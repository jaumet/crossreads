  
 20 our efforts & she  is now anchored near at hand. Tuesday 29th : I today established several naval signal stations which will considerably reduce the amount of trotting about hitherto necessary for the carrying out of our duties. At 4.30 this afternoon we had an interesting ceremony. The native police have now come under Garrison supervision & the Major decided to present them with their rifles & swords (taken from them upon our occupation of Madang) and to give several of them ratings equivalent to British non-coms. All men belonging to the Garrison who could possibly be spared were present, the Naval Guard occupying the right, the Infantry the centre, & the Native Police the left. After the presentation the Police went through a few Rifle Exercises & parade movements & they did credit to the remarkably efficient drill of their German instruction. Of course there were several amusing things noticeable. For example when stepping off they begin with one or two short steps like the introductory movements of a pas seul; the sergeant then gives the order "grrrmpsqvxiup!" (or something of the kind). They give an extra thud with one foot & step out much in the style of the ballet dancers in comic opera. Numbering off is a thing to be remembered. As each man calls his number he looks at the man on his left. The last man of the line looks straight to the front until the antepenultimate trooper has called. He then turns his head to the right at precisely the same moment that his neighbour turns his to the left. Glaring fiercely at each other they call "furp"! One feels rather disappointed that nothing serious results therefrom. After the parade the native troopers were marched to the barracks set apart for them.
