When we went down to dinner I brought the bottle along & asked the steward to open it & bring me three glasses.   The bottle did not turn up & no one knew anything about it.   I was in a pretty fix with two ladies to entertain & not enough cash to run to another bottle.   About halfway through the dinner a steward came along to tell me that he had taken my bottle but had given it to someone else.   Later on it was discovered that the bottle had been given to Major Campbell who thought it was a present from the Captain.   So after all it turned up & things then went on all right.26th Dec.   We have just sighted Ceylon.   I must end up as I have a lot to do before landing.  I don't know where you will get this letter but hope to know before we leave Colombo.  I am keeping real well - Fred also is in good form.  With best love to all & hoping to see you all soonYour loving old manWill.
