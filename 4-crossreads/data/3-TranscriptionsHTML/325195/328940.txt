<p>17.9.15<br/>Friday 17th<br/>Rained a little again last night: An order was sent in to Bde H.Q. last night for 35 Bell tents, also several small tents for Officers for this Regt. so it looks very much as though we are here for the winter: Two Motor Lorries were landed here the night before last &amp; they were using them last night; a good deal of shelling goes on here every day &amp; the aeroplanes are still as busy as ever; but this spot we are in at present is very safe &amp; we have had no one wounded since we came here. The Turks trenches are 600 or 700 yds away &amp; seldom anything doing: Stan and I went down for a dip again today; This evening the despatch riders horse was badly hit &amp; lasted just long enough to carry the rider out of danger before he collapsed: Last night the Turks had a demonstration but there was nothing doing.</p>
