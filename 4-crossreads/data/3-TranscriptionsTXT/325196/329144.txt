16-3-16tea as we could drink with the heads of the village served in small tumblers, We had great fun showing them how to regulate the telescope & field glasses & they made a couple of very amusing discoveries throught the telescope; We left them soon after 3 oclock & Reid & I had an argument as to who could tied the sheaves the fastest & after to settle the argument  dismounted & gave our horses to one of the farm hands to hold & set to work tying barley sheaves & in a short time had finished off all the barley that was cut. We arrived back in Camp just on stables after putting in a very enjoyable afternoon .
Had several rounds with the boxing gloves after tea & then a bash in the river; A rumor is afloat that we leave here shortly, we have heard nothing of it yet, but the natives tell us we shall soon move!
