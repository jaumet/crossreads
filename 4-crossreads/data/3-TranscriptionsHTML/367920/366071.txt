<p>Delville wood.</p>
<p>We stayed at Delville wood till Christmas day when we had some pudding and cake.</p>
<p>On Christmas Night we went to Needle trench. I went on to the front line with a fatigue party. I got bogged several times and the last time was the worst I went up to my waist in the mud and as I was the last of the party no one saw me. I had to get out myself and the party went on. I had just managed to get clear and get into the trench (where I got stuck again) when the party returned. They all thought I had become a casualty but I was there right enough.</p>
<p>We returned to the Needle Trench where we stayed till the 27th [December] when we went into the front line.</p>
<p>The part of the line we were holding was only tenable in parts the remain-</p>
