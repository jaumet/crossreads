<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>Talk about "Egypt's sandy plains". There here alright, and all of us are just about tired of them. There is no getting away from them, even for a day, and I for one will not be sorry when the order comes to move on. I will give you the outline of one of our day's work here. Reveille at 5.30 am, and everyone has to be on parade at 6.30. We fall in on our battalion parade grounds, &amp; then march out on to the desert for about a mile, and indulge in physical exercises &amp; marching, returning to Camp about 8.15. This is the best parade of the day, because the mornings are quite crisp, though not at all unpleasantly cold. Breakfast at 8.30, consisting of 3 eggs each, salmon, bread &amp; golden syrup, &amp; tomatoes if you like to buy them. The next parade is at 9.30, and the work on this</p>
