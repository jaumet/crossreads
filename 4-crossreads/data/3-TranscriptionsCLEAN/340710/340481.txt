  
 they are bright and cheerful.  "C'est la guerre, monsieur, C'est la guerre"   They are truly a wonderful people.  Here and there along the cobbled roads one meets a few old poilus in uniform keeping the road in order for the heavy traffic passing to and from the front, too old for service in the line, they are used on the lines of communication, just the cogs of a huge machine but very necessary cogs.   and    Sometimes their old backs get stiff so they sit down and smoke their pipes and rest a while "C'est la guerre, monsieur." they say. They are doing their bit for their beloved France.  "Oh yes but surely the Allies will win but all the men must fight to drive the Boche from France, it is very necessary for all to do something to help, yes, it is very necessary." "C'est la guerre, monsieur."
