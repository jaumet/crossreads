  
 Monday 15 Nothing of importance the last few days. The clear nights are favourable to bombing on both sides. Fritz comes over & about us last night & to-night he has been very active 
 Tuesday 16 German Aeroplanes are detected at night by the pecular, irregular throbbing of their engines. The searchlights are not at all quick in picking them up & usually the guns in the vicinity of the bombing object are first to discover him. When they are caught in the light they look very fine. 
 Wednesday 17 In an aerial battle this morning one German plane came down in flames from a great height. German planes have been very active during the nights & mornings & they have been dropping many bombs about the neighborhood 
 Thursday 18 The guns on the front have been very active, both English & Germans 
 Friday 19 Visit the little coffee shop on Poperinghe Reninghelst road where there was a motley crowd all singing various songs Belgian girls Australians Canadians Chinese of Chinese Labour corps & West Indians. The evening was very merry & the coffee good. A German plane flew very low all over the ground, but it is rumoured that it was brought down 
 Saturday 20 Poperinghe & the picture show where we saw an Australian Gazette. It is a pity the authorities don't send more of these over to the front to keep the boys in touch with events at Home.
