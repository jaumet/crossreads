<p>Sunday 6 April 1919<br/>Brekker at Club. Visited St Macloun church. There was a service on still we had a look. Very pretty indeed. The choir being exquisite the building itself is very nice also. Then saw church St Patrice which has excellent stained glass windows. Very good We then went to the Picture Gallery but it was closed with the exception of an exposition which we saw. It was very poor indeed.  Then to church St Godard. This was closed so we only saw the outside. Back for lunch. After lunch saw Church St Vivien which also has beautiful windows. There was a service for children on in this. Met French again had dinner &amp; then to see a show at the Follies Bergere. It was terrible. We left at 11.30 half way thro the show. Walked a bit &amp; then home to the hotel to bed.</p>
<p>Monday 7 April 1919<br/>Brekker at the club &amp; then to the station for the train. Saw the Maison Morrow with its beautiful carved wood. Gee its good. Also saw (from the street) Church St Romain. Left Rouen at 10.22 am &amp; arrive here in Havre at noon. Got a lift in 2 motor lorries right to the camp. A big bundle of letters awaited me. Had lunch &amp; then played basket ball.</p>
<p>Was on Hotel de Ville picquet. Took them in but missed the bus coming home 'cos I was away with one of the boys. A train wouldn't stop for me so ran after it &amp; pulled the pole off the car. I could get on quite easily. Caused quite a sensation in the train for a while.</p>
