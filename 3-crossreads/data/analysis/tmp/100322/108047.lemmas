 25/4/19 Bingen but could not be definit certain that I locat the celebr chateau . It is wonder to see how everi tini plot of ground here is under cultiv . The Rhinegau [ Reingau] stretch of the Rhine is veri love but I like it best abov Rudesheim and Bingen becaus it is more wild . Pass the gigant statu of Germania ? each nostril of her is said to be larg enough to receiv a man . Bingen ( sweet Bingen on the Rhine " ) is face by a terrac bluff of vineyard and on the opposit side we pass Bishop Hatto 's Mauseturm ? a low tower now use for navig signal . The old ruin castl seem to becom more frequent in this gungi part . Burg Rheinstein the Enemi brother and the Stolzenfel were all notic one . The larg cliff of La Lovelli
