<p>16th First glimpse of Kangaroo Island 6 am<br/>10 am first glimpse of Dear old Ausie, 245 miles<br/>10 pm dropped anchor in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Next morning we had leave ashore and here we parted with some of the old boys who lived in South Australia It was a merry parting and next morning when we woke up under way for Melbourne we felt as though some great friends had gone.</p>
<p>The trip to Melbourne went very quietly and on the morning of the 21st July we disembarked at Port Melbourne and after saying goodbye to the Victorians we entrained on a Red Cross train for Sydney After travelling all that day and night we arrived in Sydney at 10 am on the 22nd</p>
<p>From the Central Station we went per motors to the Anzac Buffet where I found my Mother &amp; Sisters and after 3 &frac12; years of Soldiering I was not sorry when at last I found myself once more at home.</p>
<p>For the first week at home I felt that I had lost the world when I lost my pals &amp; I hope if ever I take on another war I shall fall in with some of the same boys again as we were more like brothers than friends.</p>
