<p>These old castles have seen some stormy times I'll bet &amp; could tell some fine old tales.<br/>Like Sardinia there are villages scattered all along the coast &amp; very nice they looked in the distance with the green fields &amp; big mountains for a background, we skirted the coast &amp; very close in some times for some hours, till at last Touloun was sighted, as we approached the harbour, a French torpedo boat came out &amp; met us &amp; showed the way in, as we entered the port we flew the French &amp; Australian flags from our mast the band was fallen in &amp; played some tunes, it is one</p>
