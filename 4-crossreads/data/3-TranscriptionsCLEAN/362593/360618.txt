  
 Sunday 22 November 1918 Monday 23 November 1918 Now I am certain of getting Home again which I never really expected to do.  I have started to take more care of myself & also money.  We are all practically tea-total which avows our good sense. I put in time playing tennis & golf mostly.  We are having a really quiete restful time after a long spell of active service. Flying here is no strain on one at all, it is only a pleasure. We are flying Avios.
