Every time it came to a meal time I felt inclined to cry "I wa'me daddy" not me dinner or anything else, & I still do, though have settled down a little more.John & Gwen are sitting next to me at table and later on we will be having quite jolly times.  We have added to our little company that young man who is going home to enlist, you remember the one with the brown eyes one of which is badly affected.  He is very gentlemanly & altogether nice- not that New Zealander, but one whom you had a long chat with: his name is Leckie and he is an engineer surveyor thing.      Well you dear people mine, we are at Freemantle now & must close.Very much love to you all,Your very loving daughterX  Olive X
