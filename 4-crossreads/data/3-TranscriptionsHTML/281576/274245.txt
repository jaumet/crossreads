<p>Sun. July 15  Took over Sanitary Job again.  Today we had 44 men out playing in 4 different matches.  2 Teams played the 1st Fld  Amb. &amp; won,  easily. Another Team played the 15th F.Amb. &amp;  lost.  Then our Soccer Team played the 8 M.G.Co. &amp; lost by 6 &ndash; 0.  Col. Shepherd &amp; most of the officers played Cricket.<br/>Finished my weekly epistle to Lill, but it was a mighty poor effort.  Poor old Girl, she will begin to  wonder what is wrong.</p>
