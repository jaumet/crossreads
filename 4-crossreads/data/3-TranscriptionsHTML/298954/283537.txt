<p>Sun.  14th Oct.<br/>The "Hitachi" left us today and "Wolf" resumed the patrol solus.</p>
<p>Sat.  20th Oct.<br/>Quite openly the Germans say that the "Hitachi" was to have been sent to Germany as a prison-ship and prize.   Since no coal-ship has been caught the condition of the bunkers does not permit the Jap. vessel to be kept any longer.  She is to be sunk.   Today we again met her and proceeded to the Carcados atolls.</p>
<p>These consist of a long semi-circular reef, convex to the East, sandy atolls, some quite bare of vegetation and only two others showing a few clusters of palms, are threaded on the reef here and there.</p>
<p>The entrance to the anchorage is full of shoals;  "Wolf" felt his way in with the lead-line.</p>
<p>Old Martin, whose home is in Mauritius, only a couple of hundred miles from here, says that he has been here before, that the place is inhabited by ex-convicts etc. from Mauritius.   Is also visited by fishing boats.</p>
