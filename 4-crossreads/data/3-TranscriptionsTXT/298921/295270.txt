October, 1915Tuesday 26Re-organized Regiment & with 85 men brought over have formed B Squadron X I am given my Captaincy at lastX Usual bombing & Howitzer shelling going on day & night but we are fairly comfortable here at No. 2 outpost - & the scenery!!! Is very fine, Imbros island about 15 miles on our West & Hospital Ships, Torpedoe boats, trawlers lie in between or unload quietly at night & steal away before being shelled in the morning -  We have a lovely view of the shell fire & the burst of shrapnel mixing with the clouds as the Turks fire at our Aeroplanes.
