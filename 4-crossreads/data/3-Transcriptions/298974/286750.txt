<p>17<br/>On the afternoon of the 12th a large barge came along side with 350 wounded English Tommies. They were all in different stages of convalescence. These we took on board and prepared to leave the port. But more about the Tommies anon. At about 6 P.M on the 12th we left Said bound for Devonport England, via Gibralta. We did not expect to touch Alexandria. As I promised to port this on this will be a suitable place to make a break. I will continue as the chance offers.</p>
<p>Well, Dorothy how are you all? I'm very fit indeed. Tell Ma that I consider my health has improved in every possible way. The food is rough but good. It is not a [indecipherable] producer though.</p>
<p>I hope the matter here wont be dry in too many places. Its hard to write amid these busy surroundings where one daren't miss any of the numerous sights which go past like a cinematograph film, from dawn to sunset. Give my love to all. Tell Billy to take my kind regards to Mr Langrove and all the others. I hope he doesn't owe any calls to his visitors. If Father types this I would be glad if he would allow Mr McCulloch to read one.</p>
<p>Well, good by, best love to all.</p>
<p>Your loving brother</p>
<p>Dene.</p>
