<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>Here we are again in the city by the sea, aged about 2300 years. This world of ours moves round &amp; we each play a little part in it.</p>
<p>On Saturday at 1 p.m. I handed over the command of my hospital to a Captain Bourke, threw off my responsibility after five months of strenuous endeavour to do good work. Did I? Well nous verrons!!!!! However here I am!</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, in about five hours from bow you will receive a cable message telling you that Jerom &amp; I are posted for Lemnos of which the port is Mudros, thence am I bound for Anzac, a new name that will last adown the ages. Alexandria is the first stage on our journey</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday morning I was at the Basilica Heliopolis and in accord with the arrangment made by Mollie I recieved Holy Communion. You did likewise some hours earlier at St Marys. Sunday was filled</p>
