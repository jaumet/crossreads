<p>I hardly slept all night as I found the boards very hard and the ships movement shifted my aching bones all over the place until at last I was glad morning came at last.<br/>5.4.16  We were told we were to be relieved of our stable duties for 3 days but only one day will we now be off. Some of the men had been kicking up a bit of a shindy and for punishment were made work in the stables for 3 days which is considered the hardest on the boat.

This morning we found a flying fish in the boat which had evidently in its fright flown in at a low opening &amp; died. It is about 10 inches long with a deep blue back, and square head and has a large pair of fins at the "arms" and a smaller pair lower down for flying.
