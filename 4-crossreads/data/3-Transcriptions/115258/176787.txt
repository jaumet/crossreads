<p>I seem to have a fearful lot of letters to answer this mail and I believe there is another one coming in a day or two, so I will have to work hard for the next few days and try and catch up a bit. Have you read Daddy-Long-Legs Mother? Stella sent it to me for Christmas and I did enjoy it and a lot of chaps in the regt. have also been sent it and are all talking about it. It is a simple little story<sup> </sup><s>and</s><sup>but</sup>&nbsp; a really good lesson in letter writing I think. In my last letter to Father I told him that I might be sending a cable home for money as there was a chance of us getting leave long enough to go to Luxor - However leave has been cut down to three days so Luxor is finish; but I&#39;m still thinking of sending the cable soon and then just taking the leave to Cairo when my turn comes.</p>
<p>People have been very good to me this Xmas, and have sent me a tremendous lot of parcels; nearly every body I know has sent me one I think and I have sox galore! about eight pairs. It is an awful pity; because if we do any big moves they have all got to go over board and in two months time I&#39;d be giving anything to get a pair. A person cant carry on big stunts, more than one</p>
