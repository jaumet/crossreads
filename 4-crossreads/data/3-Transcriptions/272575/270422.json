<p>him when up at Overstand.   Do you remember the Comforter that Kitty gave me, it was the only thing left in my Kit bag.   the sheep skin jacket was gone.   I think all those articles were comandeered by the Military authorities they were wanted in France.   I will get there for the tail end of the winter so dont mind so much I dont like the cold and wet combined.  I would sooner get a blighty than trench feet.   a lot of our men were sent across suffering from that complaint, and its no good.   I must stop and try to write a couple more letters.   Dont let yourself worry about me too much    I hope to be home for next Xmas dinner   I had to tell Mrs Horton not to worry.   she did not think it fair that men who had been wounded should go back.   Heaps of Love to all especially yourself<br/>from your Loving Son    Chas<br/>Next letter may be from Perham and may be from France</p>
