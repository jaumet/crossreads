Sunday 3 January 1915
Nine o'clock this morning saw the recovery of most of last night's poor unfortunate, although there was far from being a full muster at Church parade.  The aforementioned little Presbyterian parson again stuck his chest out, put his ears back, and laid down the law about the excessive use of what he called the "Australian adjective".  He pointed out that, if we did not cut it out before we reached England, we should all be ostracised from polite Society.  Then his week's work which, by the way, cost the Commonwealth Government exactly 7-17-6, finished.  I can't help again remarking that this sort of sinacure job should be promptly abolished.
To-day, canvas awnings we put up over the decks, and the first touches of the tropical heat made themselves felt.  The troop decks were stifling;  and the Lord only knows what it will be like in a few days from now.
