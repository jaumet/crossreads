<p>a fine statue memorial to the soldiers who fell in 1870 &ndash; 71. Commands a great position, overlooking, as it does the whole countryside. It has been rebuilt but the old moat, drawbridge, cannons etc remain    This place was originally taken by William the Conqueror, taken &amp; retaken by the French several times &amp; now but it's walls remain    After climbing the towers, viewing the well, exploring the subterranean passages, we descend to La Bouille take the 8-15 pm boat to Rouen arriving at 10 pm &amp; off home after what I consider a great day   Had dinner at La Bouille &amp; very nice, costing 3 Francs (app 2/3).</p>
<p>21st August:- Monday<br/>Plenty of work &amp; going strong all day. The only pleasant change was a nice lunch at our usual. At 5.30 pm dinner &amp; after a long walk to Boisguillame &amp;</p>
