<p>now and I saw some splendid crops. Of course there are no big fields of wheat like those in Australia. The fields are cut up each man having his own little lot and the wheat fields have so many different shades in colour some being more advanced than others just the same as in the south of France the hills were cultivated here as much as possible.  I was very sorry I didn't posses a camera it would have been very handy. Here again we followed a river for a long while I think it was the Seine, a fine big river the vegetation was very thick along its banks and all the hills beyond cultivated with wheat. Our destination proved to be Havre on the coast, where we got out of the train and spent the day and night in a small rest camp just out of the city. We went for a four hour route march here and I enjoyed it more than anything. We got into a birch wood they grew thicker than grass it was almost impossible to get along at all among the trees grew thousands of  ferns and flowers and it was more like a park than anything else. One thing a chap noticed while passing through France</p>
