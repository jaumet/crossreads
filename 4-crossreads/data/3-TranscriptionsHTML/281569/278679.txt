<p>30 May, 1916 Tuesday</p>
<p>Reveille at 5</p>
<p>Aeroplane reconnaissence of today reports that troops of the enemy are still in their old positions &amp; if anything El-Salmana is strengthened. All ready to move out at a minutes notice tonight.</p>
<p>Left camp at 1000 instead of 0400 tomorrow &amp; first of all got in our wrong position in the column, when they moved off eventually they went in the wrong direction &amp; missed Katia, the trip was an awful one, cold &amp; tiring &amp; I was asleep on several occasions on my horse.</p>
<p>Heard all sorts of rumors of the boys in France but don't attach much importance to them for they are only furphies, Chevaul led us on the march &amp; is just the same as ever.</p>
<p>31 May, 1916 Wednesday</p>
<p>95 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>On the march all night &amp; arrived at Hod-el-debabas at 6.30 tired out, set up sig stns &amp; office right away working with Ogratina  the attack was highly successful &amp; the Turks sustained 20 casualties. The New Zealanders stormed the Hob &amp; gave them blazes &amp; putting them to flight at 0900, we had two casualties only. Set out for Romani at 1000 &amp; had a hard time coming home, no water for one thing &amp; then as we had signalling to do we got behind our rear guard &amp; Jacks only had to follow up our troops &amp; he had us but luckily he didn't, gave horse the last of my water out of my water bottle &amp; didn't he enjoy it, what oh! got in at 4 &amp; went to bed at 7.</p>
