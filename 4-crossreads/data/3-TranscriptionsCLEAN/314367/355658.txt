I was out with a dynamite fishing party this afternoon & we got some great hauls of red pointer, blue striped garfish & big spotted trevally - The Commander - Skeete - self & a lot of us went & had a grand time - Once inboard I got a note from Corporal Nunn - He'll take anything I like to Sydney - You'll get the big silver N.G coin Mab the small one - R. the triangular bandage - I've written an article to the M. Journal on our ptomaine stunt - A second that I've sent to Turner - on Xmas day in New Ireland & on the natives. He passes it on to the Nat. Hist Soc of Brisbane - Its for them - I am going to wind this up here - Carry on as per usual - See that you get my pay 29 p m - We maynt be home for months - All is quite well & I'm most careful - We had fish & a bit of steak for dinner - Fancy putting your teeth into fresh meat - Lovely -  Fred -
