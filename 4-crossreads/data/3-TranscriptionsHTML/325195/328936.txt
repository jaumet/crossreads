<p>13.9.15<br/>Mon 13th<br/>At 4 oclock this morning rain began to fall &amp; we got quite a sharp shower &amp; as our bivy was not made for a wet weather Campaign, our blankets got wet, &amp; at 6 oclock it looked as though it was going to rain for a week, but the clouds cleared away by 10 oclock. Smithers &amp; I went to the beach for water &amp; had a dip while we were there &amp; the water was like ice; Stan was also in swimming on his way to Anzac to have his tooth filled; The sun came out very hot about dinner time &amp; I put in an hour or so building a rain proof shelter &amp; I now think we can afford to treat any rain we are likely to get with contempt: The Canteen rations were served out to-day but they did not amount to much, one tin of Cocoa-milk, a bottle of vinegar, one tin of sardines, 1 tin of Herrings &amp; 3 tins of Ham &amp; tongue was about the total we received. Stil heavy firing to the South.</p>
