<p>Sunday 29th August<br/>It was deliciously cool this morning. One of our transports got in a bit close and went aground for some hours. The Turkish Artillery opened fire over her but luckily did not hit her before she got off. We often get a good view of the trawlers &amp; other boats moving in to the landing stage under fire. A shell goes over them one behind &ndash; perhaps one in front and so on. It's very interesting to look on while this drama is being enacted. The 12th Light Horse came up to our lines this afternoon &amp; I understand merged into the 7th L Horse flanks. They had only arrived from Egypt in the morning early.</p>
