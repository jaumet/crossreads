In England24.1.1917
Dear Mr Ferguson
Just a few lines to you to let you know I received two Parcels Containing Chocklates from you. In which I appreciated very much. I am still in England But expect to go to France anytime now. I have not been to good Since I was wounded on the 4th of August. I was wounded in the leg & was buried at the Same time In which my Back was hurt & it is still Bad otherwise I am in Perfect Health. Mr Ferguson have you received Captain Ferguson Private Property yet, I hope you Have.
The weather here is very Cold there is Plenty of Snow & Ice on the Ground.
There are not to many of the Old Battalion Boys left now. I think this Spring will be far more Superior than Last Spring as there is a lot of talk about the Russians coming on the Western Front with us & I think this Year will about finish it.
Well I think this is all the
