<p>feet have been wet during the whole 16 days at the front and now we are once more wet through.  Only a drink of tea &amp; biscuits for a meal when we came in.</p>
<p>7th November (Tuesday)</p>
<p>We all spent a restless night.  Whenever I woke up I could hear the others moaning or talking in their sleep.  All are absolutely knocked up though only about 10 in the section have stuck to the work all through without falling out or reporting sick.  Drink of tea for breakfast and nothing</p>
