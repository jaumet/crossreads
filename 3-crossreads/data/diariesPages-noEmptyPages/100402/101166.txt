At Bazeul on the le Cateau-Maubeuge Road. We are moving to-morrow, moving back rumours are rife that we are en route for Marseilles thence to Turkey.
Wednesday 13 November
Early this morning we moved, back to Busigny, a march of nine miles or so. En route, we passed 4th Army H.Q. while passing General Rawlinson came and had a few words with us. He told us that we were going to Busigny area until the railway was repaired to Germany then we were to go on to Coblenz, on the Rhine!!! What joyous news.
New lands to discover new people to see. Of course, yesterday's rumours dispelled..
