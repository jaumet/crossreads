  
 May, 1916 Wednesday 31 Half holiday today Too hot & lazy to do anything except try to sleep which is almost impossible. After tea I went to Cairo for a change of air but came home early. 
 June, 1916 Thursday 1 Weather continues stifling & oppressive & would bring a thunder storm every day under the same conditions in Aust.  But it never thunders here. Rumours are rife about all Australians leaving at the end of the course
