 296 He is full of all the beauty of Paganism and when I used to him the word Pagan, didn"t know what I meant.  If there is anything in reincarnation, which he calls rot - he"s an original "wood thing", possibly Pan, and in build and feature, animal lithness and build, he  is  Pan.  How near to Bacchus was Pan?  Bacchus he would never know, and Pan"s 'armours" are as his.  Pan"s love of the Naid"s beauty is largely his, and his manner towards them the same.  Yet civilisation has softened the grossness alive in Pan and produced J-., a Dinkum "Billjim". 
 297  p.m. Since writing the above, the worst possible dream - a murderer fleeing through France - a more wonderful France of fantastic colors and designs of Renaissance Buildings - and in some awful dream manner a murderer and murdered too, fleeing justice with someone I hate. 
 Three episodes in the dream, passing an awful fantastic Gothic ruin amongst dark trees, a seeming sudden awakening in a time - the coffins open, and shining horrible festering aged corpses with some hideous throbbing, matting mass on the head of each sucking life from the dead brain, and the third - entering a colossal church, wonderful as a Pogany drawing, dirty but with candled altars. 
 The whole hideously clear and damnable.  Two days ago I had a similar one.  This time J. had gone to some immense cathedral within France.  God knows what suggested him, and in the way of dreams the church changed to the home church in Woollahra, with this difference:  the floor was richly carpeted with the red carpet of the citadel Mosque of Mohamed Ali, and the entry of a stretcher bearing a chap bandaged, with his two legs off.  I was in uniform and painfully aware of the red cross on my sleeve.  Then Russ, and others of the unit appeared, all in civilians, and mostly alike, sitting back with a bunch of young sisters.  The dream ended with the death of the man. 
 298  Oct. 31 This afternoon came back Jake after a rattling ten days with the Pearsons - fagged to sleep after less than an hour"s talk.  Met Alf in the Strand, and since then he"s staying Pearson-way.  Thanks to the Invisible Gods he"s back - after the chaps in C this morning he"s like a breath of fresh air after a thunderstorm. 
 299  Nov. 1, 1916 Tonight walked in to Boulogne and brought back Heath Robinson"s "Hunlikely" and a list of translations of Verhaeren - The Bodley Head 1915. 
 King"s got no sense of humour:  one night I showed her - or rather drew her attention to some stack cut cigarette cards of Raemaeker"s Cartoons:  the one of Germania Singalong with Death - From L. to L. - from L. to L., she thought represented Brittania and Germany - Britannia making the dance pace a little hot for Germany - Death. 
 Tonight I shewed her "Hunlikely":  she went half through it without a smile, then, 'Dear me - all about the Huns".  When she"d finished I said, "That"s rather a good end page, did you notice it?" she hadn"t and looked it up. 
 "Playing Tennis, a Concert and Fishing ...  No doubt they"ll soon be able to do that too."  Help! 
 300 "Did you wear your cap in Blighty Jake?" "No! your bloody hat"s your crown, Frank - you"ve got your hat - well you"re dressed." 
 At about two this afternoon he came into the tent, propped himself against me, and wrote to Dorothy - "if you feel like I do you"d like [indecipherable]."
