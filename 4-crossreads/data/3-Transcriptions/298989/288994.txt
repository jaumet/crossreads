<p>22/2/16<br/>Nothing doing. Rumoured alteration of establishments for units. Good fight this afternoon. Lawson v Harwood won by latter &ndash; a very gory encounter. General Holmes present also Brigadier and Staffs. Engineer's fatigue hard at work this afternoon, although the rest get holiday. Peart returned full of information. All quiet.</p>
<p>24/2/16<br/>Curnow and Slater returned to duty today. Usual routine today and in addition went round the outposts with Curnow in the afternoon. Furphies that Colonel Brand is to be the new Brigadier on account of Gwynne becoming BGeneral and going to Army H.Q.  General White going to G.H.Q. [indecipherable]. Our wandering bird Henley returned to us under escort today. This life becoming very monotonous and consequently much gambling is going on. In rear of the lines little schools gather round candles at dice games. "Anymore for anymore." Our band is coming and a harmonium came today.</p>
<p>25/2/16<br/>A&amp;B Coys route march today. The new units are being organized on the reduced establishments for the New Armies. A windy day but sunny, a good deal of French wire being festooned in front of the trenches. Rode around the line with the C.O. first thing and had a fairly easy time after both Ped. and myself waiting for news of our transfers to the new units.</p>
<p>Noticed the tracks of lizards and snakes out in the desert today and also indications of the jackals or wild dogs we hear barking round the camp at night. Some "dinkum" arrived about 2130. Norris appointed to the 53rd and Harris to the 59th. German wireless intercepted stating the Australian "Indian troops" had risen and that the officers were shooting their Moslem servants even if they were only guilty of clumsiness! "C" Coy did a night operation and found direction hard to keep. Am getting quite a star gazer and know Great Bear North Star, Orion's Belt, Mars Venus &amp;c.</p>
