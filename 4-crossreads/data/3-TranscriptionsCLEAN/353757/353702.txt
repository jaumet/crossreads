  
 want the wife to know.  To make matters worse, someone wrote & told her I was half dead & "hopelessly disfigured for life".  That's no joke, you know.  My left leg is turned a bit & my head slightly on one side, that's all;  can't notice it.  When writing, address Corporal A. Hine as it facilitates delivery to have them a/d correctly. 
 Will write again soon as possible. 
 Your cobber till lights out A. Hine 
 P.S.  You'll understand, old Cock, that sometimes its impossible to reply to letters for weeks & months so you'll excuse irregularity of letters & the disjointed nature thereof.  I have a very stiff right arm where I got my wrist twisted. 
 Kind regards to your kindhearted Mum, also Violet & Molesworth Senrs. 
 A.
