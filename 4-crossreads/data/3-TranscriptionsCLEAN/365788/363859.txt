Then we came back to Egypt & as Mrs Fletcher was sending the Capt. a parcel, Beatrice R - G - enclosed the one for me in Capt. Fletcher's to Lemnos - so it must have been on its way to Lemnos when I was on my way to Egypt. But no doubt it will turn up soon. You will note the address. I think that address should find me. It is very hard to say what address is a correct one. With very much love to you all. Ever your loving brother, Fred
