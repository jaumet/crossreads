<p>Thursday 21</p>
<p>Appointed batman to Major Quick &amp; like a fool, accepted it. Found on arrival at the site of my new duties that I have to help two other batmen attend to four, - taking the meals &ndash; waiting <strike>daily</strike> every other day with one of them while the other does all cooking.</p>
<p>Absolutely rotten ! !</p>
<p>Narrow escape; shrap pellet alighted two inches from my toe as I was standing in front of dug out.</p>
