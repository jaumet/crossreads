Marched off about 11 am after the Infantry for Becourt, where we arrived about 2/30 pm &ndash; Very nice camp &ndash; good clean Huts &ndash; good water laid on, quite a treat after shell hole water.<br/>Stan Clarke &amp; I went for a walk around the Beaucourt Chateau &amp; toward the Cemetery where a good sprinkling of Australians are laid side by side with the pick of the English troops, such as Black Watch &ndash; North H. Fusileers &amp; many other crack regiments, who were the first to fall early in August 1915 &ndash; Fritz dug in about here first, after being driven back from Amiens &amp; through Albert.</p>
