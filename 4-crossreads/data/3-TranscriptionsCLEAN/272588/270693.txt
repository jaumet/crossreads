  
 Friday 19 April Very sorry to be relieved from this post this morning as things were quiet & we were living exceedingly well. We are to work another sector of the line to be taken over from the French by the 3rd Bgde. & we are now waiting for the infantry to come in before we can take over the posts. We are now just to the left of Fletre with Meteren area.  Ballieul is now in German hands. Things seem to have been very quiet just about here. "B" Section A.D.S. is at Caestre. 
 Saturday 20 April Early this morning we relieved the French at a R.A.P. to the left of Meteren.  To-day things have been quiet, little shelling off & on & not a stretcher case has come through as yet. A bit of gas to-night. Caestre A.D.S. has been shelled & one case, Greenwood, wounded. A car was hit to-day but no one hurt.  It is in the ditch at Fletre now, waiting for a first aid lorry. Fritz has excellent observation here.
