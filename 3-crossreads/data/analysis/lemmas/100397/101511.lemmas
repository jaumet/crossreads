My Dear Mother Had a short note from H. yesterday with Letter from yourself and Betti enclos , I was veri glad to know that you were about again , and get better , I have not receiv ani Australian mail myself for sometim , but when I rejoin the Battn and have a more settl address I daresay I will receiv letter more regular . Sine I left Wareham I have onli receiv English letter , I just reach this camp the night befor H left for the Sig ? School at Grantham . I went up to his line to see him but found that he had gone . he may be 6 or 8 week at the school . and there is no know what may happen in that time We leav at 8 P.M. tonight for Franc . and I suppos we will be in the Depot there by Tomorrow night . I hope so , ani way . This camp is not a veri nice place , just at present , mud in plenti , and food is not as plenti as might be . we get stew , thicken up with flour , more flour than anyth els . it is grow rather monoton ? and men are ask to be sent to Franc everyday .
