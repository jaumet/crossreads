Found out the reason later when on returning to Bn. H.Qrs. there was the awful news that the Hun is right through up north now.  What is the matter with the English!  Decided on altering the dispositions of some posts of A Coy which are ridiculously sited.  Saw Kennedy and others in their trenches all very muddy and dirty.  A good view of Albert with Fanny Durack hanging.  Three men killed by snipers.  Relieved by Duggan & complete by m.n.
