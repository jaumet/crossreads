<p>fine days &ndash; typical of the Riviera but last night a breeze sprang up &amp; early this morning (about 3.30) I was awakened by the roar of a gale &amp; the flapping of loose canvas with the tent swaying so violently that I thought it would come down any minute. Put on my boots &amp; greatcoat  grabbed hold of a peg mallet &amp; got outside somehow &ndash; the O.C.'s office is a square tent &amp; I slept in a section of it divided off. Great activity everywhere &ndash; officers &amp; men in pyjamas, portions of uniform etc. etc. struggling with tents that were going their best to become balloons. The O.C. was valiantly wielding a mallet &amp; with the help of several men was doing his best to keep his sleeping tent from floating into another part of France. For a full hour &amp; a half I kept at it and then just as day was dawning, turned in again for a short snooze. Several</p>
