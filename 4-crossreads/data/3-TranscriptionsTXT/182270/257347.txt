TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1919.
Fine, & foggy. Went up to the Bank
in the morning and to a
matinee of The Maid of the Mountains
in the afternoon. Went to bed
early. Alan came down &
is staying with me. He has
got his gdischarge all right. I
gave him my two tickets
for "Oh Joy" & he took Marj.
Lang & enjoyed it very
much.
