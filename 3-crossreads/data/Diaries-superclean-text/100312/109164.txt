18/11/17
Up early and got all preparations in train for our move. Cleaning up camp. Dark clouds like approaching snowstorms. Ammunition crackling merrily in the incinerators! Left at 12 a.m. and had a good march along fair roads passing through Westoutre. Before coming into Locre we pass through good country and over one prominent ridge with woods and a windmill on the top. Here there is a water storage reservoir and pumping plant. Tommies and Jocks passing ? some extra clean transport. Locre a small village undamaged and neat, one of the few left in Belgium. Outside the Mairie flies the national flag. The peasants all in Sunday clothes and wearing their sabots or wooden shoes. Got into camp about 4 p.m. a fine comfortable camp about 2 miles out of Locre. Our doctor Stevens back from leave.
