<p>12/12/18 Boulogne<br/>Another very wet and beastly day. Went up the winding road into the little hamlet as above and found Colonel James at his billet. After a yarn we walked down to Bde. and there met Generals Rosenthal &amp; Robertson. Inspected transport all the morning and had a sort of conference about doings when we get as far forward as Charleroi. Walked back to billets and lunched. In spite of pouring rain a few of our sports enthusiasts were hard at their training running up &amp; down the roads. The buildings around here all have very low rooves and no windows practically. Classes on the go all the morning for telegraphy, English and other educational subjects. If the weather were at all fine things would be different. A claim today for a duckhouse pinched!! Jack dined here.</p>
