  
 Leaving Trenches for Carlton Camp 22nd Nov Warned to get back to Carlton Camp the best way possible. Being foggy got lost   & slept in shell holes the biggest part of the night waiting for daylight. Mud up to our necks, both weary  & foot sore   & cursed the day I was born to go through such torture. I must say we looked a weary lot of wretches & almost gave up hope of ever getting back to camp again.
