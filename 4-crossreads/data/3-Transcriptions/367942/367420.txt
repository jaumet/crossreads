<p>2nd March<br/>Bebra 6AM Had a cup of coffee<br/>Frankfort on Maim 1 pm., had a good hot meal, expect to reach Karlsruhe at 8pm.<br/>10 pm. Arrived at Karlsruhe &amp; under strong guard were marched to a hotel, which as far as I can see is a fumigating house before sending us onto the camp. We are four in a room &amp;  not allowed out of it. Windows all painted on outside so that we can not see out.<br/>5th March<br/>Still under observation in hotel.<br/>6th March<br/>3pm. Were marched under guard to the camp, which is situated in the centre of the town. All our effects were examined &amp; we were charged 18 marks for carriage of our baggage &amp; our food on the way from Kiel to here. We are pretty comfortably housed &amp; have plenty of room for exercise, which is a treat after the confined space in the "Wolf"  Shipmasters are being treated on a par with Army captains &amp; I believe to be paid 100 marks a month, but most of this will go in paying for our food.</p>
