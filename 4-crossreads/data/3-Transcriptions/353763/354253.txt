<p>To the Beach in the aftn  -  with liberty men from H.M.A. Submarine AE2 &ndash; a great boon to the submarine men  -  They alone of all the fleet allowed on shore  -  They deserved the boon anyway  -  First of all I did a little laundry job &ndash; ship prices 4/ a dozen &ndash; each piece 4d &ndash; therefore a pair of socks 8d !!! Pay don't run to that so I fixed up with a Chinese man my small goods &amp; left the large for the ship's chap &ndash; wily white man = Then I blew in at the Carnegie library &amp; inquired about a Flora Vitiensis &ndash; Fiji or Viti &ndash; Seeman wrote one in 1869 &ndash; that's the standard one &amp; I spent an hour examining his colored plates &ndash; beautifully done  -  A palm peculiar to Fiji bore the palm Pritchardia pacifica  -  There was also a volume entitled 'The cruise of the Curacoa' before his time (Seeman's) &amp; it figured Flora &amp; Fauna of varied species right thro the Pacific Islands  -  There is no naturalist in Suva I regret to say &amp; of course on the shore</p>
