<p>[Drawing]<br/>Monday 24th Feb. 1919</p>
<p>The above is what we hoped to see on the 24th but the Jackalls seemed to have sent out notices &amp; the nearest was &frac14; mile away &amp; howling derision.  The sparrows almost as numerous as the fleas but not so friendly seem to think the trap was erected with the sole purpose of giving them food &amp; shelter.</p>
<p>The weather improved on this morning and with my light horseman I footed it to a very interesting Turkish trench on a hill called "Johnson's Jollie" and there did quite a good correct study of <strike>a</strike> Spruce, the light horseman aforementioned, as a stiff.  It was quite exciting in that I had the right kind of man in right clothes and right ground.</p>
