<p>Tuesday 11 March 1919<br/>Didn't go into town till evening. Then went in to take charge of the teams. Had a good feed at the club. The boys were rowdy. Broke one window. Took up a collection &amp; fixed it up OK.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12 March 1919<br/>Very beaut day. Bill &amp; I went out to his cousins. Went for a good stroll. All over the cliffs at St Addresse [Adresse] first. Taught his cousin how to play bridge. Got our  train easily. His [indecipherable] was on Special patrol. A real decent job</p>
