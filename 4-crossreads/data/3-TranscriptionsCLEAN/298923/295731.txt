  
 6 March 1918 Wednesday (X to X crossed out)  14th R.F.C. (articled)  I hope to send you some photos taken from above the Turks line next mail. We are well treated here, electric light in every Tent generated on the ground- great comfort after a Cavalry Mobile Brigade. X The planes send messages by wireless & a XLAXON HORN-   We send by a Black & white PANEL on the ground- MORSE. Men from all English Regts are here quite young men & they treat us well, this is  not  the Australian Flying Squadron- I send you some photos of Machines-X
