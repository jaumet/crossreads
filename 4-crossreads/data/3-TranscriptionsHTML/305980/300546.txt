Welsh division failed miserably &amp; left 400 wounded on the field.  Our casualties were 600 killed &amp; 2000 odd wounded, nearly all of them infantry.  This was a fearful bungle, as the mounted men were on the beach holding the town, when they had to gallop away owing to the failure at Ali Muntar of our infantry.

Murray never left Arish during the whole action, we being with him as reserve Brigade, yet were not called upon in spite of the way things went with our troops.  Wounded going down all day in cattle &amp; goods trucks, the medical arrangements were disgraceful, many wounded being out in the open on the sand for 12 hours, owing to lack of hospital accommodation.</p>
