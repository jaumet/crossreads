<p>(See over)<br/>In the field<br/>France 2/7/17</p>
<p>Dear Eric,<br/>Just a line to let you know that I got fed up with the General Hospital and have exchanged with a Field Ambulance Sergeant? My address now is:- Staff Sergt. B. Rainsford, 14th Australian Field Ambulance, A.I.F. France.</p>
<p>The papers have been arriving regularly. I got the last batch of about 20 about three weeks ago.</p>
<p>At present our Division is resting and we are in billets in rather a decent little village. The country is looking very pretty now, i.e. the part that hasn't been shelled lately. Smiling France is coming into its own.</p>
<p>Sincere yours<br/>Bruce Rainsford<br/>P.T.O.</p>
