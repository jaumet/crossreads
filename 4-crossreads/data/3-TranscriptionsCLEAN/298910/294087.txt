  
 a dozen bombs round about here, gave us all a bit of a scare. Last night one of our big siege guns was doing some business & it just rocked everything, must have been a naval 15 inch.

 10/11/16  Friday 
 Very nice day & fine - On duty at Operating Tent. Not so many casualtys today, the 1st & 2nd Divisions seem to be getting a rough time. German Aeroplanes dropping bombs freely during the night, very little damage done hereabouts - Our Guns bombarding very heavily during the night, which was a lovely clear moonlight. We got in a fellow with both legs blown off, he was leading a horse, when they walked on a dud & it exploded - A Tommy while leading a horse to water, the horse fell thro a dug out & inside there were two german spys.
