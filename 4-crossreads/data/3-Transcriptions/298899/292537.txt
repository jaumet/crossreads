<p>November 4th  We were called at 7 A.M. by request, had a bath at 8 but the "boots" lost our boots by some misunderstanding &amp; we had to ring three times &amp; then only received them just before 10. Spent a good night. Spent a good night, the bed being luxurious, shaved etc before going out. Had no time for breakfast as had to report at the Police Headquarters, Caserne de la Pepiniere, Place St Augustin. Walked to it &amp; found it by asking the direction &amp; had our passes stamped to leave Paris by 11.40 train on the 7th. We then went into the Church of St Augustin very fine built in 1860, splendid dome 82 ft wide, 260 ft high, style approaching Renaissance. The Place St Augustin contains a statue of Joan of Arc. We then went down the Boulevard Malesherbes to the Madelain commenced in Louis XV reign, in 1806 Napoleon wished to convert it into a Temple of Glory, opened for R.C. worship in 1840. The interior forms one vast nave with cupolas receiving light from above. The outside is surrounded by fine colonnade of pillars. Then went down the Rue Royale a splendid street where we decided to have lunch. We chose the Tavern Royal, Maxims &amp;</p>
