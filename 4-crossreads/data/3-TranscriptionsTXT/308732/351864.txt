Mr Williams & three others were wounded on his post, and Sgt Galland & one other on the post I was relieved from. We are going back another stage tonight. I am out in advance taking over our platoons Trench. Things are quiet, except that Fritz has a "mad minute" now & again with his guns. We hear good news from different places on the front, and things are looking much brighter (for umpteenth time since the War started)26-7-18 Have had three days quiet here, about 1000 yds behind the line, a few shells now and again, to keep us from feeling lonely. Saw here the narrowest escape I have seen so far, a shell came in at the end of a tiny dugout where a man was sleeping, blew his equipment to small shreds, smashed his rifle, tin hat, & sundries to bits, and all he got out of it was shell shock. Tonight we are to go up forward again and  there are rumors & rumors as to what we are going to do. I suppose we will find out in time
