<p><u>December 1918</u> [the year should be 1919]</p>
<p>Red-Cross ladies, We were supplied with all sorts of eatables and had some very nice tea served.</p>
<p>After we had finished eating our fill we were put in the train with a carriage between six men, And left for Ripon Camp in Yorkshire shortly afterwards, arriving there early the following morning.</p>
<p>I stayed at Ripon Camp for two days, was rigged out in another clean uniform and had all particulars taken again, I was also required to make a statement concerning the attack of the morning of April the 11th 1919 [the year seems wrong, need to refer to the previous diary to see the attack referred to].</p>
<p>On the 30th of December I was granted one month's leave and came to London in the afternoon, After going to the Australian Headquarters in Horseferry Road Westminster And messing about there running after clothing and Leave passes for about an hour, I was allowed to go free. I stayed at the Star-</p>
