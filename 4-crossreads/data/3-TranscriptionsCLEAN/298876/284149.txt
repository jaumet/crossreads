  
 here we saw thousands of Tommys - Indian - Australians - Horse - Camels - Mud Houses - Asses etc - At 8 pm we just fell out at Zeitoun & after getting all L.H.F.A. Baggage etc, we left the L. Horse for our own Camp - which we reached after 2 miles walk - were issued & Blankets each & camped in a [indecipherable] Hut, it was that cold all night I couldn't sleep - I used to think I knew just a little bit, but am quite resigned to admit as a Queenslander that I didn't know I was alive. 
 It took my breath away at the magnitude of the Military Camps - from one end of the Canal to the other to just Camps & soldiers - Quite a common thing now for me to see Aeroplanes. 
 Wednesday 8/3/16 
 A nice cool day - cold at night.
