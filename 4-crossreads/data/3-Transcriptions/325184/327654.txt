Numberless depressions are to be found in this area &ndash; natural &ndash; about 100 feet across and 30 feet deep. These have generally been used for Battalion and other HQrs .   Arrived at Trieste at 4.30pm.  Ascertained train leaves for Vienna at 1.15 tomorrow am. so we have decided to go on. Called on General [indecipherable] commanding Trieste Zone.
