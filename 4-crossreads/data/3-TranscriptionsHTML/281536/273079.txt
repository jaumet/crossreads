<p>26/6/19<br/>Uneventful. Some nurses came and played tennis and danced afterwards.</p>
<p>27/6/19<br/>Went to Bath by a train at 10.58 and there saw about some photographs. Only stayed in the town for half an hour and then caught an express to London. The journey between Warminster and Westbury is uninteresting but between Westbury and Bath and Bath and Swindon there is some of the prettiest scenery I have seen in England. Reached</p>
