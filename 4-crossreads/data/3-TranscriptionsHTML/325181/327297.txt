<p>in front of us. Passed several steamers, windjammers &amp; small schooners. Good many birds &amp; porpoises about. The latter look strangely weird as they slip through the water in the deepening twilight &amp; one can only liken them to ghost like serpents. The effect is accentuated by the glittering phosphorescence of their foam splashed wake. Passed 2 cruisers &amp; possibly a submarine during the night<br/>14th  Hot as usual rather strong undercurrents from 1 pm on. Washed towel etc. Spoke Wandilla last night. Heat abated a little Passed suddenly from disturbed to smooth glass like sea covered with an apparently oily scum.</p>
