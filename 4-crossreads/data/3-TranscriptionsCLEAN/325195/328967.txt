Les gave him a sov. as he was out of cash;The storm that has been threatening us lately paid us a visit last night. I went around early & arranged a couple of oilsheets over us, shifted the 'phone under them & was a warm & dry as if we were at home, the boys in the trenches had a very rough time & it was that dark that it was impossible to see anyone more than a couple of feet away: The patrol also had a very rough time of it
