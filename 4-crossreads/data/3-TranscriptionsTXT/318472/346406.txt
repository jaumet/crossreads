 30 June 1918 Sunday 5 After Trinity 
 Put a few men through the equipment store in the morning &amp; in the afternoon rode a bike to Clacton &ndash; on Sea. It is a very nice little place &amp; I believe very fashionable &amp; gay in times of peace. 
 1918 July 1 Monday Very quiet. Got about 40 men away in the afternoon. Italians are doing well according to reports &amp; British &amp; French have had successful minor affairs on the Western Front. Nice fine weather.
