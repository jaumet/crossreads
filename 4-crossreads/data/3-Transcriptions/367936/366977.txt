<p>Friday 12 May 1916<br/>Very calm day.  Worked up like thunder storm but we only had a little rain.  Went down to stoke hole and engine room in evening.  There are 4 boilers each with 4 fires.  We are doing about 11&frac12; knots per hour.</p>
<p>Saturday 13 May 1916<br/>Usual work still very calm.  Slept up on top deck &amp; had my air pillow pinched;  but did not mind very much as it was pretty badly punctured.</p>
