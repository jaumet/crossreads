24/6/18
Plenty of band music this afternoon. Each battalion has a band and they are not bad. Our printing press struck off programmes for the Sports we are having tomorrow. A few more of Pimblett's sketches done on the wood blocks arrived from London "Punch" for publication in our "Echo". This time he has "got" "Jonah", Tom Willis and B. Horan to a tee. Overhead a few aeroplanes are buzzing but otherwise there is not much here to show that a War is on. Georgie Hughes is acting as Sports officer and is a grand little chap who I like very much. A quantity of beer at Bde. Sports has left an aftermath of stray drunks who wander home like lost voices roving in Eternity
