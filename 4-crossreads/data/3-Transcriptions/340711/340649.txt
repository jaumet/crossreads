<p>of the Farrier Sergeant's verdict re water etc., the authorities, (while other batteries are off) persist in humbugging us as much as possible. I am sick of the whole business. The Pits, with all their danger, are without the hyprocrisy, the rotten acting, the tawdry drama of this. Ceremonial camps! I should never enlist again under such conditions. The food (at the best of times) is rotten. We are half starved. The sergeants have always an abundance of jam bread etc. We get two 1lb tins of jam every other day between 29 men.</p>
<p>Saturday, 12.<br/>Went up Town on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Sunday, 13.<br/>Church Parade. Went with Catholics, but found Church closed. Had chips and chops at Marguerites.</p>
<p>Monday, 14.<br/>Usual routine at Camp. Left at 9.am. with four others for Halloy-l-Pernois on dental leave. Got a lift on wagons from Mr. Meates. Reached there 10.30 am. Too late for dentist. Had a good meal coming home at a private house. Evening went to St. Ouen for shopping. Asked along the road for the way to Flixcourt---and then Tipperary. Fred Hollingswood and George Eddie came with me. Promotions. Cpl. Cox to be Sergeant. Gunner Reed to be bombardier. Sgt. Iken to be Sub-Lieut. 16th Battery. I am transferred to D. Sub, commencing 15/8/16.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 15.<br/>Morning. Went out exercising horses. Cricket match afternoon, so afternoon aff. I went to Canaples to see Field Cashier re my Extra Duty Pay. Told me it rested with O.C. Battery to decide. Rained on way, so took shelter under a portal. Saw there one of the finest types of a Picarde. "Gros bete", said I to my horse---and a tap on the foot from a parasol greeted me. At Canaples went to canteen and gave each of the girls a character sketch---in return</p>
