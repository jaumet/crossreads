<p>N.B. Kindly address mail Cadet J.L.W.<br/>Aust. Flying Corps,<br/>Abroad    until further notice.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I have a fair amount of home mail to acknowledge   On the 10th inst I received yours of 30/6/18, and this morning yours of 7th &amp; 14th July, Mothers of 14th July, &amp; Olwens of the same date.  Many thanks to you dear people for all your bright and intensely interesting letters; you may be sure they are appreciated very much over in these parts.<br/>In my previous letters to you from time to time I have acknowledged all the parcels that you have so kindly forwarded, but I was surprised to hear that Lawry has sent parcels also.  These have gone astray, unfortunately, as I haven't received them at this end.<br/>Mother speaks of loneliness on a pilots first "solo" flight.  It was not my first flight so much that I found lonely, as all my attention was taken up, divided between the instruments on the dashboard, and listening intently for the slightest difference in the tone of the engine.  When I did feel lonely though, was the morning I went up for my height test.  I originally intended going to 9,000 ft but as I think I explained in a previous letter, when at 6,000 ft one of the exhaust valve springs on the engine broke, temporarily rendering the engine useless, owing to the vibration set up through the "dud" cylinder.  Even at 6,000 ft the drome (which is roughly 1000 X 600 yards) looked about the size of a visiting card, &amp; I wondered how on earth I was going to get in &amp; land, but I glided down lower &amp; lower, &amp; landed quite decently.  I have got the name</p>
