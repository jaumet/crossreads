 Nothing much to write about. We don't seem to stand much chance of getting away from here for donkeys' months & are therefore being specially trained to look pretty by numbers in order that the elite of Toorak & Bendigo may be pleased to gaze upon us & applaud. So far we have stood it. Only last Sunday morning we kicked a bit & caused some little scare at H.Q. Next time the M.G.s have to kick it may cause some flutter, but they have promised if we're good, things will be much improved for the N.S.W. men & more liberty granted. Love to all & your self
