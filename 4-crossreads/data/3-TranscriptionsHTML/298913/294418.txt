<p>ation was prevented.</p>
<p>Arrangements were made so that an orderly could direct us from a certain place along the old Constantinople Telegraph line (Cairo to Constantinople) which we had to follow. We therefore set out along this line and at dark found ourselves getting very near the enemy guns. No orderly could be seen so we kept on and at last thought we had better stop so we turned into a hod nearby, intending to risk sleeping the night. A few odd troopers came in and we were arranging to keep a watch amongst us in case of surprise. It was a nasty position, so we loaded our rifles and; prepared to face it</p>
<p>We had only just unloaded the camels and had been looking amongst a lot of enemy gear that had been left when they evacuated this hod (Bir Roaml) I could smell cheese and was hunting everywhere for it, when a NZ trooper dashed in on his horse. We advanced to meet him &ndash; rifles ready in case of it being the enemy. Our rifles never left our hands here, not for an instant. He was a mass of blood and one arm hung at his side helpless.  For God's sake get out he said &ndash; the LH have been forced to evacuate owing to no water and the Turks are only half an hour's ride away. That was enough. Tired as we were, we packed those camels and began the retreat. The Indians were done up too, but they had to move too. Our rifles were primed with 11 rounds ready for any emergency</p>
