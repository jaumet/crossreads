<p>3<br/>transit camp for all the Mesopotamia people on their way home. It may also be used for Australians, but I think they will probably be shipped from Kantara.</p>
<p>I have just got back a few days from a week's Xmas leave during which I paid a flying visit to Luxor &amp; Assonan, a very interesting trip and well worth the tedious train journey &ndash; especially on a free warrant.</p>
<p>I'm hoping for another mail any day now as its over a month since I've had one from home.</p>
<p>With very best wishes to you all</p>
<p>Yours affectionately<br/>George M. Edwards</p>
