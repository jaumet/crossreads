<p>big guns in the distance was very distinct this morning. These villages don't contain any lovely females, all the women seem to be old &amp; fat, with big hips &amp; one rarely sees any girls. The parts between the houses and the barns where the animals are housed &amp; hay stored, is all muck &amp; filth, manure &amp;c.  &amp; the streets are muddier than Codford, &amp; that says a lot, but the heavy military traffic goes unceasingly. We tramped out about 2 miles to a paddock &amp; had our rifles inspected &amp; then came back again &ndash; its a great life alright. I struck a couple of Tommies who are cooking for an officer &amp; a few of the staff &ndash; they belonged to the 9th Corps, but it was cut up by the Germans, &amp; now they are with the Australians. I had a friendly chat (nothing like being with the cooks) &amp; they gave me some steak &amp; onions &amp; potatoes for dinner,  tres bon it was too. The roar of the guns in the distance can still be heard like far off thunder &amp; it kept on during the night without a break. Wednesday 10 April Slept pretty well, on the floor with hay &amp; waterproof</p>
