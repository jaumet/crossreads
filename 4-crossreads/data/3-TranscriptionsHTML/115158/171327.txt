<p>On Saturday night, however, we were suddenly ordered to raise steam within 1 hour &amp; proceed to sea. A German squadron was known to be out, &amp; we were to attack it on the next day. The next day all was excitement, &amp; everybody was keen to meet the enemy. It was expected to get in touch with him about 4 p.m. When we sighted a hostile submarine, we thought it to be a sign that we were in the vicinity of the hostile ships. Just as everyone had made up his mind that we were to go into action at last, orders were received to return to our base. Apparently the enemy had gone back to his base.&nbsp; Evidently spies were active on both sides, for the Admiralty always seemed to be informed of impending German movements, &amp;, likewise, the Germans knew that we had left harbour &amp;, therefore, ordered their own ships to return home. The crew did not at all relish this keen disappointment, &amp; some very strong language was used to give expression to it.</p>

<p>Before next morning we received further orders from the Admiralty to turn round &amp; search for the enemy again, but this time again it was a fruitless search, &amp; we eventually reached the Firth of Forth, filled up with coal, &amp; waited for the next &quot;spasm&quot;.</p>
