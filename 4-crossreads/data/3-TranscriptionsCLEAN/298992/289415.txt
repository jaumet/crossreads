  
 do it and then grumble, that's the difference. But as anyone will tell you, that has had anything to do with the Australians, their grumble is part & parcel of them, and it really counts for me. 
 I really must stop now, & hope you will look after the photos for me. How is Billy? I hear very little about him, the dear of a kid. I wonder if he still remembers me? 
 With love to you all 
 Your (grumbling) son
