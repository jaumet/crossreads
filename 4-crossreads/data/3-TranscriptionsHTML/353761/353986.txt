<p>1.<br/>Eye Witness of<br/>Australians &amp; others embarking for the front Some for <u>first time?</u> I think not<br/>from England</p>
<p>Here, at Southampton Docks, has arrived from the Australian Engineers Training Depot at Brightlingsea, a draft of troops.<br/>They have just de-trained and, having been marched into a wharf shed that seems to extend for miles beneath a weary repetition of ugly roofing, stand awaiting further orders, as soldiers must. These men are to embark for France to re-inforce Engineer Companies of the A.I.F.<br/>Many of them are Sappers who have already done their bit at the front but having recovered from the wounds that [indecipherable] them to Blighty are once more destined for the trenches.<br/>There is the usual delay that attends all military movements on such occasions, for no single officer knows exactly when or where to fit his little bit of duty</p>
