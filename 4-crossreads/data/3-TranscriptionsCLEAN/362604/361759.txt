  
 a Barrack room where the Staff sleep so I had to move in last week.  Ellis also moved but He has gone back to the flat again.  I am in a small cubicle with Ern Thomas & we are quite good Pals since we first dossed together on the sand at Warwick Farm.  It is only 50 yards from my office & 100 from the Mess & is ever so much more convenient for that
