  
 Firing Line Le Sars M16b67-M16a08  23/2/17 go out in search of trouble. Arranged this and then slept on until 6.30 p.m. awaking feeling far from refreshed owing the poisonous foul air of this unventilated place. During evening things were quiet except for a heavy shelling with big stuff of our left Co H.Q. in which a dugout was knocked in and Fulton slightly wounded but much shaken. Could not turn our heavies on as their action would have stirred up further strafe and interfered with our inter-coy relief which was just starting. Screeds re F.P. No 1 tonight. In this regiment we have disciplined the worst characters and tamed lions without resorting to the degrading punishment of tying men up - a thing repugnant to every Australian. The left Coy. was relieved in good time but, as usual, the right was late. Wood of "B" Coy got knocked right up, bogged in the mud, and eventually was too exhausted to come out and had to be left in the dugout up there. His first time in the trenches - a rough experience but never would one of our gritty old hands throw up the sponge
