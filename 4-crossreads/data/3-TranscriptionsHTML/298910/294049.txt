<p>A Tommy sniped just outside Eaton Hall at 10 am &ndash; Only had a few casualtys.</p>
<p>15/8/16  Tuesday</p>
<p>Raining off &amp; on. As our Ambulance was recommended for special notice &amp; one medal was alotted to H. Ramsden today, it is the Military Cross. I have referred to Harry back during the stunt. Forgot to mention the King &amp; Prince of Wales passed thro Sailly &ndash; I would know him from his photo antwhere. Put in a wretched night down in saps &ndash; only one casualty, but the shrapnel &ndash; whiz bang, etc fairly got my nerves. 2 Fellows killed outright.</p>
<p>16th  Wednesday</p>
<p>Dull &amp; raining &ndash; mud is the order of the day &amp; it is hard work stretcher bearing. My self and Dick Deshorn went up to the firing line about daylight &ndash; I had a couple of shots &amp; hope they had good effect. Rumours that the King said we were going to winter in Ireland, etc.</p>
