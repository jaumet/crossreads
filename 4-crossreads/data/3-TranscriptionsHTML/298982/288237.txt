<p>When the officers call grub<br/>Pudding &amp; pies remember pray<br/>That they have stars on their shoulders<br/>They're built in a different way.<br/>Save your money.</p>
<p>When gum has glued your inner man<br/>For days beyond recall<br/>Remember your boots to polish boys<br/>To fleshy lusts don't fall<br/>Save your money</p>
