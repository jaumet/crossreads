<p>for its &quot;spell&quot;.&nbsp; This is an awful camp, the dust being almost beyond endurable.</p>
<p><u>Oct 3rd &#39;17</u>:&nbsp; The Brigade moved in to a camp on the beach near Rafa, our horses having been declared unfit for the Front line.&nbsp; Rumours are current to the effect that the Brigade is to be sent to Upper Egypt, &amp; I am inclined to believe that there is a big chance of us going there.&nbsp; There has been more sickness amongst the men of this Brigade than any other</p>
