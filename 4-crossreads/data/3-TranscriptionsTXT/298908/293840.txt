sounded the "Last Post" & the notes died faintly away in the distance & beautiful sunlight, for the day was a perfect one.  There were a fair number of civilians present which added to the sadness of the thing & it was with a heavy heart that I turned away when we marched out & left 2 of our mates lying in that lonely little spot.  I often think if it should be my fate to die over here without seeing Aussie I should never rest but should wander in my spirit to the sunny south for love of our land is very strong in the "Aussies" for to us there is no land comparable that we have seen.One of the ships that went out the other day had to return on account of the flu being so bad.  An officer told me that 38 of our lads had died on her & not a single invalid had caught the disease.  We are losing a lot of men through this cursed thing & until it dies down its a certainty we will be kept in England.
