of getting to England.It is rather miserable waiting here in the terrific heat & doing practically nothing.  We get drill & route marches early morning & late evening, but during the heat of the day one just lays down & tries to sleep.2 days ago we rose at 4 & went on a five mile route march, were inspected by a General & then came back.  It was ten miles of hard work for the heat was very great even at that early hour.
