<p>Saturday 13 September 1919<br/>Did nothing but read &amp; play all day. After dinner a crowd of us went into the dining saloon &amp; sang ourselves hoarse.</p>
<p>Sunday 14 September 1919<br/>Coy. orderly officer today. Helped the Q.M. all the morning with Q1 forms. Played the rest of the day &amp; managed to hurt both arms again. Think I must have strained the sinews in each. They ache some. Only have 991 miles to do for Adelaide now. Do me.</p>
