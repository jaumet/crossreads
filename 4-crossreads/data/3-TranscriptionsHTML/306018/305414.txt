<p>March 1917<br/>camel on the way.  Drew rations for the natives &amp; the camels &amp; it was past 7 when I got the camels fed &amp; barracked for the night.</p>
<p>Friday 30th<br/>The Brigade came back in the morning to camp &amp; I followed with the camels, filled up at the wells &amp; distributed the water.  After dinner sent all the camels to the Lake &amp; watered them.</p>
<p>Saturday 31st<br/>Had an easy time distributed the camels among the Bgde. drew the rations &amp; then shifted camp.  All the Divisional water &amp; Hospital camels are being put together, so I handed my camels over to Lieut Fisher.</p>
<p>Sunday 1st April<br/>Australian mail arrived today.  I got 2 letters.  There is artillery &amp; rifle fire every day, but there has been no infantry attack on either side.  We get good surfing every day &amp; the water &amp; weather is just right for it.</p>
<p>Monday 2nd April<br/>Managed to buy a good supply of cigarettes, oranges &amp; eggs.  They are nearly impossible to obtain here just now &amp; are very dear.  We got an issue of bread first for over a week, but are still on the bully beef.  8 "Tanks"</p>
