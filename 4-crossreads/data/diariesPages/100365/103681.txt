Regiments just in from the advanced positions for a rest. We next came through Talmas then on to Septenville where we are now resting for a while.I am billeted in a French Chateau it is a most beautiful place, many acres of nice woodland grass to roam about in.I am a little puzzled over a letter I received today from Mum about several visitors calling saying they knew me well.

We are still at Septenville awaiting fresh orders. The Troops are pouring through here from rumours it is evident that there is again going to be a heavy bombardment which it is hoped will smash up the 3rd system of defences. The weather still holds good things are working smoothly. I hope they have us here for a few days, as not only are we comfortably quartered, but everyone needs a rest after the strenuous time we have had recently.Aeroplanes very active numerous have not sighted one single Taube or Fokker of late, which speaks for the way the Allies have in downing them.The Germans are again using a vast number of Tearshells, which emit poisonous fumes, but the helmets combat the Gas if promptly fitted on when the fumes first arise. They will get gas this
