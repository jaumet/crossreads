[Transcriber's note:  The letters of George Lambert commence in January 1919 from "Paris en route to Gallipoli" when he is arranging for payments to be made to his wife in England while he is carrying out his work as a War Artist with the War Records Office of the A.I.F.  Most of the letters are to his wife describing the places he is visiting, the work he is doing and include many drawings.  He travels from Cairo to Gallipoli, Damascus and back to Cairo in July where he is awaiting a passage to England.]
July, 1919
