Britain has sent more than 10&amp;percnt; of her eligible men to the war &amp; has 9&amp;percnt; more engaged in munition making.  Australia has only sent 5&amp;percnt; of her eligible men.

Surely we cannot say that Australia has done enough, so long as she has only provided half the percentage that Britain has given!</p>
