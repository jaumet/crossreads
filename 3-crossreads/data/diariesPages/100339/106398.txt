Sunday June 1st 1919
To-day at 12 o’clock the ship stopped for a few minutes while we buried a Seargent who died yesterday. The burial service was conducted by Padre Finigan of the 4th Australian division. The Buglars blew the last post as the body was slipped into the sea.

This Seargent was badly gassed when in france, and was being Invalided home, but the heat in the Red Sea was too severe for him to pull through. As a rule, the men that have been gassed are taken home via the Cape of Good hope, as the heat that way is not nearly so severe as the Suez Canal Route, and therefore not so dangerous to their lives.

At about 3 p.m. this afternoon we crossed over the Equator, and the distance that we have travelled since leaving Colombo is 491 miles up to 12 noon.
