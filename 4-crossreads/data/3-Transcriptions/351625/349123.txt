<p>About 20 or 30 of our men have got them but this was only a minor thing compared with the meningitis through which we lost about 6 men during the voyage, three in our company caught it, one died at Cape Town &amp; another, Smith, one of our mates was put off there the morning we left so we don't know how he got on, another we put off at Durban &amp; did not hear how he got on.  Here we are under very strict isolation and cannot go out of our boundary limits which allows us very little freedom.  Every night at 9 o'clock we are marched up to the canteen for &frac12; an hour which is the only time we are allowed there, so you see we will be jolly glad to get out of contact.  We made a fairly good voyage from Cape Town to England spending about 2 days at Sierra Leone but of course we could not get off there.</p>
