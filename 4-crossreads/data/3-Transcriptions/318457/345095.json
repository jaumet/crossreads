<p>Whilst at Rabaul the 'Encounter' captured a merchant seaman the "Zambezi" and sent her back to Sydney in charge of a prize crew. She had a German agent on board who had in his possession certain official documents which the Germans were awaiting.</p>
<p>On Thurs. we arrived in the waters around Bougainville Id and steamed around Shortland Id and adjacent isles, we taking the northern course while the flagship went round the south searching for German ships. The scenery was very diversified and pretty, enchanting in some places. Several native villages were present. In one case by the glass we could plainly see dusky figures playing in the breakers. Cocoanut plantations were frequently seen.</p>
<p>We were evidently carefully watched by German officers for at night we intercepted a message in German from a wireless on Bougainville Id stating that "Enemy's squadron arrived here. Cannot raise Yap. Where is Mr Brawn, the question is where is he". The fact was, the German wireless station at Yap was destroyed the previous day [12 August] by the "Hampshire" of the China Squadron.</p>
<p>We proceeded toward Rossel Id the flag with us to coal about 500 tons. We have now only about 850 tons. Then we complete coaling at Port Moresby where we regain the flag and other ships.</p>
