 An M.P. who carri his badg in his Breast pocket pull me up in Charleroi today ask to have a at my Pay Book . This is the first time I have been stop by a M.P. without his arm badg on . It is a good idea becaus previous the Shrewdi could alway see an M.P. some distanc off Hop it while the go was good . 20-3 Went to the Concordia to see the " Dinkum Blue " Diamond . Veri poor show . While come home I was pass a Motor Car , a M.P. call on the Driver to stop , he took no notic , the M.P. call onc more then fire two shot from his Revolv , one shot went through the Bonnet and damag the Engine . This took place in a crowd street . I do n't know whether I have mention it befor but two Aussi Desert have been shot in Estaminet brawl sinc I have been here . Some of our " stray " have been " Hold up " peopl even Estaminet with Revolv . 25-3 , Tuesday Blew out the Murray-Prior combin twice last night but have a strong suspicion that the first game was not genuin . Compani had to Parad today owe to the Slack Gaurd they have been put up late . We are to parad twice a week until there is an improv . This morn 's parad was no joke . It was snow and the wind was enough to cut a man to piec . 26-3 Was advis today that I was on the next draft for Aussi . Seen the Q.M.
