May 29th Sat. In Cairo.

Went to the gardens with I. M. The gardens are at their loveliest at this time. It is simply glorious to walk through these gardens.

June 1st Tues.

Weather still continues to be hot.

In Cairo. It is amusing, if one happens to stand at any point waiting on a tram etc, how the native urchins gather round and jabber away in their native tongue to you. I found this is a good opportunity to learn a few words of their languages. The method adopted is to say English â€“ "tea" "Arabic"?. If they understand straightway, the answers comes Arabic "Shay". This method makes on the possessor of numerous necessary words quite simply and incidentally causes some amusement amongst these black urchins.
