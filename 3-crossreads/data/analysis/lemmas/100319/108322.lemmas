 25/8 /18 Vecquemont offic came up and said that the heavi rain had so soften the second class road that we could not go further by convoy . So we had to debus , send for the guid and wait until they return . Then we plug along for about 3 mile over muddi track and all were tire by the time we reach our posit ? open field sunken road and not a particl of shelter . I lay down in a littl hole in the ground and spent a miser night . Near tire out I could not rous myself enough to get up and walk about . Toward dawn Charlesworth flung a blanket over me and I got a confus and vex kind of sleep for an hour or two until waken by the duti of a busi day again .
