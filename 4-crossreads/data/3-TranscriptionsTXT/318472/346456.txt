 19 August 1918 Monday Arrived Cape Town &amp; tied up about 10.30 AM. Had leave into town in the afternoon with Sgt Brindly R.Q.M.S. Clarke Sgt Rees. Took a tram trip to Camp Bay &amp; back via Koof Nek . It is a very nice &amp; interesting trip. In the evening we went to see Three Weeks at the Opera House. The Acting was only just fair. Cape Town appears to be a fairly well built little City but I was rather disappointed on my first visit Arrived back at Boat about 11.30 P.M. 
 1918 August 20 Tuesday Stationed as Piquet in Police station ed  till 10 P.M. Got very little time off. Had a look around town with Sgt Brindly for awhile in the afternoon &amp; for a couple of hours in the evening. A very hot day. The people of Cape Town do not to me appear to be very hospitable - at least not toward the Australians. But I may be mistaken as I have not seen much of them. However appearances do not give one a good impression. Got back off duty to boat about 11 P.M. very tired &amp; with the usual headache
