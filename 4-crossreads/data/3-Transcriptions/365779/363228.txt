<p>Jack &amp; I are out at the Pyramids camp. I think your Jack will be out at Maadi, across the Nile - some 10 miles away. I fancy his regiment is just about arriving there- I hear some of the Light Horse will be out there today. I will go over as soon as we have settled down a little.<br/>[Sketch] Pyramid Camp .. Cairo .. Maadi camp.<br/>It is on the edge of the desert &amp; should be very healthy though dry.<br/>Love to Joan Nancy &amp; Claude<br/>Chas</p>
