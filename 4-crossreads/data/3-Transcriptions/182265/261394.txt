Walking from Arc<s>h</s> de Triomphe through Champs Elysees &amp; Place de la Concorde to the Madeleine, a beautiful church with an exquisite interior lavishly adorned with white sculptings.</p>
<p>A short walk brought us to Restaurant de l&#39;Opera where for 7 francs each we had an excellent dinner. After a visit by tube to Gare du Nord we promenaded from Opera to R&eacute;publique visiting a Cinema on the road.</p>
