Went over to Flying School saw all the planes a R.F.C. chap gave us a wash brush up in his quarters. Very good of him. Never got a ride as none were going up. Lousy with skylarks also a few hares partridges. The streams are full of salmon trout pike but not allowed to fish. Same as with hares birds. All the trees hedges are a lovely light green, good grass wild flowers of different kinds all over the paddocks.
