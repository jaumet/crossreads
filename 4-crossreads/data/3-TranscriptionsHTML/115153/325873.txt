<p>near England and down towards Africa. After 10 days pleasant weather and smooth sea, we arrived at Sierra Leone on the west coast of Africa. We had a stay of two days at this place and took on coal, but did not get off the vessel to see the town as it was stricken with fever at the time.<br/>While out in the harbour our boat was surrounded by black's canoes, and the blacks did a very good trade in selling tropical fruit, curios, and postcards of views around the town. The natives at Cape Verde Islands, which we called at when going to war, had small boats made in up to date fashion, but the natives at Sierra Leone had crafts of a more primitive fashion that were made of one long solid piece of bark procured from a tree, and the paddles which they used were very well shaped and cut out of a solid piece of wood.<br/> Although there was a very strong current running in the harbour the natives kept their craft always near our ship's side by the skilful manipulation of their paddles in the water, and if there was any money thrown overboard they would not miss it as they were adept to diving.<br/>Up to the time we came to Sierra Leone, we were in a convey of 9 vessels, with an auxiliary cruiser and 2 small gunboats which traversed to and fro across our track and in front of us the whole time.<br/> When we left Sierra Leone the convey broke up, as we were comparatively safe from the submarines then, and each vessel went on its own course.<br/>We duly arrived at Capetown, and after we had been there a couple of hours we learnt that the boat would be staying for 4 days in order to get a good supply of coal in the bunkers, as there was no likelihood of our getting coal in future  when we got to Australia owing to the great industrial strike. <br/>The idea of a 4 day stay at port was met with great approval by the boys, but the idea of going ashore without a pay day met with disapproval, so the military commander of the ship made provision for the men to be paid enough to afford them an opportunity to see a fair deal of Capetown.<br/>As I had been in Capetown before, I did not ramble about idly wondering where I should go, but made up my mind to go and see the parents of a boy, who was with me in France and was killed at my side..</p>
