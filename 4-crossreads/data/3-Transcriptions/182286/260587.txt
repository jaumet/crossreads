<p>Parkhouse -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walking up to the top of the big hill overlooking our camp Parkhouse one has a fine panoramic view of the surrounding country below and specially of Lark Hill. Directly below are the big Rifle ranges in use all day long by the thousands of troops in Camp there. New Zealanders are directly below us and nearest to Tidworth of all the Camps. The huge and immense Ranges show up very strikingly with their pure white chalk mounds against the surrounding carpet of green meadows and dark belts of small forest plantantions, of which there are very many around here. And&nbsp; away out one can see for miles The various camps of Bullford, Lark Hill and Rollastone, and the villages of Durrington and Netherhaven where the big flying school and aerodromes are of which I have written before. The vast array of red huts stretching away out into the distance is a fine sight and one wonders how long it took to build them all. Bulford just below always was a permanent camp&nbsp;and is built largely of red brick&nbsp;and is a very comfortable place apparently and is always used as an inspection ground as parades for Royal inspections, worst of which occurred during my stay on the plains. One can also see the same old observations balloons we know so well at Lark Hill and their hangars, which are situation in a clump of woodlands right by the Fargo Hospital and not so very far from the village of Shrewton. On every hillside all around long white streaky tracks of chalk show where troops have been practising the same old game of trench digging and they have cut up the ground for miles around. The depth of the soil all around there only averages&nbsp;from about 6 to 12 inches&nbsp;of soil and&nbsp;then endless yards of pure white lime chalk. From the aerodrome over yonder one</p>
