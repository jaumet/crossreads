<p>We passed the Eddingstone [Eddystone] Lighthouse about 10.30, and while we were at dinner we steamed into the Harbour of Devenport and lay to. At 3.30 we were transferred to the "Atlanta", and the remainder to the Sir Walter Raleigh and landed along side a stone pier, and immediately marched on board a train for Salisbury Plains on the London &amp; South Western Railway line. At 4.30 o'clock we started and reached Exeter at 7.15. Stayed 10 minutes, &amp; had tea &amp; a bun supplied by the Mayoress of Exeter. The trains are much faster than the Victorian. We passed through some beautiful scenery and country homes. Everything is green, &amp; the farmers are in the midst of hay making. We reached Yeovil Junction West at 9 O'Clock and Amsbury [Amesbury] at about 11 where we disembarked. There are long twilights &amp; I saw a farmer carting in a load of hay at 9.30. we marched out to the camp &amp; could not find our place for a long time. Eventually it was found and we lay down on the floor in our overcoats at 2.a.m. &amp; slept to morning.</p>
