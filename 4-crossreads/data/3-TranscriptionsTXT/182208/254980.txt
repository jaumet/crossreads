Dear Mother.
I am writing to tell you I shall be down next Saturday night if all goes well, pay day being on Wednesday.
Besides your 3/- from me and 1/5 from the government per day Dave gets 4 1/2 per day from the government too.
I was going to go to Sydney last Saturday but I had no money but next Saturday I&#39;ll have a few bob. &nbsp;I cannot write too much&nbsp;news to you owing to the Sencors Board every letter that leaves this camp has to pass a sencors officer
