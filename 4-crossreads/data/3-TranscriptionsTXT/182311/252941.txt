 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Entering Enemy Trenches :&nbsp; First lie up for nights under his parapet and learn his habIts - by listening you can judge with reasonable accuracy his method of holding, his strength and habits, choose to enter in a place or at a time when no one is about and work away always securing your retirement and marking your gap. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Return journey to be accomplished as carefully as journey out (for instance Burglar&#39;s methods) information secured is useless when enemy is aware that we have it, in fact it is dangerous as he may guess our plans and provide against it. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Enter trench cautiously and then advise the posts that you are in.&nbsp; Every man should be examined for information and if not asked should insist on telling  all  he saw and heard. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Aids to Direction :&nbsp; Know your s tars.&nbsp; When going out notice which side of your face the wind blows on.&nbsp; Pick up landmarks, as salients and re-entrants in the wire, trees, ditches, craters, and if lost, lie down and wait until many verey lights have been sent up.&nbsp; Usually the British line is quiet and dark, but the German uses lights throughout the night. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Patience :&nbsp; A scout&#39;s most useful qualification. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Communication .&nbsp; To be made as silently as possible by pressure of hand and by the use of string signals. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Action on Meeting Enemy Patrol .&nbsp; If fighting patrol avoid them, go back and  ^  Secure  machine gun fire about the spot.&nbsp; If reconnaissance patrol avoid them - they will probably do the same if they see you.&nbsp; If it looks an easy snap attack them, but remember you are armed for defence and have only a few bombs and no long range weapons.
