<p>it leaving early.  On reading a letter from my unit which I had collected from L.M.&amp;Co. I learnt that the January &amp; February men had been called for a week ago so it looks as if we are to return to Australia.  This may alter my plans so will call at Headquarters tomorrow.  About 4.30 went to see F. Gossing &amp; after tea we went to the Globe theatre &amp; saw Nurse Benson a very fine play with Marie Lohr taking the leading part.  Turned in about midnight feeling rather tired out.</p>
<p>Wednesday 11th Dec.  Interviewed Major Wilcox about likelihood of Commissions being still granted &amp; learnt that no more were going so will not have that on my mind now.  Fixed everything up during the afternoon &amp; repaired to Hotel Rubens where I had dinner.  Rather a 1st Class hotel</p>
