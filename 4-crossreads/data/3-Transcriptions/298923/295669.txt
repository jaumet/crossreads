<p>3 January 1918 Thursday<br/>Just before leaving Moascar I wandered into a Kitchener Hut &amp; was surprised to see in large letters presented by Deniliquin &amp; old Ernie <strike>Tim</strike> Armstrong from Gunbar in charge.  Have asked him to post you a photo of it.  Did I tell you the Arra[indecipherable] has been torpedoed outside Alex  That was the boat I went to Italy on, every boat except the Malta we travelled on is now down.</p>
