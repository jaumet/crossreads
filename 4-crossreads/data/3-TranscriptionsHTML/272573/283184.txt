<p>I found that we were not leaving till the next morning. Between one thing and another I was not in the best of humour, as per usual when excitement run high I had a severe headache. To add to it all I had not had much sleep, the weather was extremely hot and I had been inoculated in the afternoon, so that I was not in the best condition for long lours in the O.T. However C'est La guerre.</p>
<p>Sat 14th. July</p>
<p>During the night there was a great deal of aerial activity and, between the buzzing of the 'planes, the bursting of the anti-air craft shells, the flashes of the numerous searchlights, searching the skies, there was not much sleep for us that night  Luckily very few bombs dropped our way this night</p>
<p>Left for No 17 C.C.S. at Remy Siding near Poperhinge, this morning at 8 o'clock.</p>
<p>We quickly made our way along the road amidst a shower of rain and also thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>On duty there at 8 o'clock to-night. This being a British C.C.S. our quarters are very poor. In a crowded marquee amidst all sorts and conditions of men.</p>
<p>July 15th. Sun.<br/>Operating up till three in the morning. Walked out to near Poperhinge. Plenty of shells are sent over this way.</p>
<p>July 16th. Tues.<br/>Operating all day.</p>
