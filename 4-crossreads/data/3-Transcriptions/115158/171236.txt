<p>board, two more than we usually have. One of these, Dr. Hornibrook, was a cheery individual, hailing from Melbourne, who at the first sign of hostilities, had volunteered his services, which were accepted. Although only 35 years of age he was a South African war veteran. Taken altogether we have a &quot;mixed&quot; crowd of officers on board. One of the &quot;hard cases&quot; has been everything from cook to officer. Another has been a &quot;general&quot; in the Nicaraguan revolutionary army. However, taken collectively, I think we have the qualities which will teach the Gemans a severe lesson. We pursued our northerly course keeping inside the Barrier Reef. during the day we passed several steamers, all of which we compelled to show their colours and declare themselves. One ship S.S.&quot;Cairnhill&quot;, was being towed by a tug on account of a broken tail shaft. She had, for some time, been a helpless derelict amongst the Islands. She seemed a little perturbed when ordered to hoist her colours, and asked &quot;What is the matter?&quot; She was coldly informed that we were at war with Germany. During the day we heard that three French ships were concentrated on Penang Straits, and also that the English China Squadron was steaming South to intercept German colliers destined for the enemy cruisers &quot;Gneisnau&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. The weather grew perceptibly warmed as we worked our way up the Reef and the &quot;rig of the day&quot; was changed from &quot;blues&quot; to &quot;all whites&quot;.</p>
