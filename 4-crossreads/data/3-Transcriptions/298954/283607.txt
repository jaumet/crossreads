<p>Wed 3rd Apl.<br/>Just as the troop-train was pulling out the Brass that graciously yielded to the prayers and entreaties of my unteroffizer and granted us permission to travel with the troops.</p>
<p>We swung on to the moving train and squeezed into a 3rd class compartment crammed with young and youngish Huns all clad in the regulation greenish-grey and little peak-less caps.   As we passed between the docks fringing the Elbe and crossed the Elbe itself I had some most interesting views of the huge Merchant Fleet rusting there.</p>
<p>One dock which we passed was packed with beautiful passenger vessels of about 7000 tons all a mass of rust.</p>
<p>The river itself was crammed with ships, big two and three funnellers being very noticeable.</p>
