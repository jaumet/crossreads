On the landing upstairs there was a little round table to seat 4 & we promptly confiscated this & ordered dinner as our appetites were keen to a degree after the walk which took us 2 hours. The dinner was good just imagine Partridge baked in the tenderest of Mutton or was it Goat & potatoes after which a sweet omelette was served. This with a little wine & fruit finished our feast for such it was after the daily menu over at Anzac. 
 I was delighted with the Greek children who crowded the principal street. Their quaint little faces smiling with dark eyes was pleasant to look on
