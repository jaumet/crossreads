 2.  4 on, shews :- No 1. A Boxing Match on Board.  This ring is rigged up on No 1 Hatch.  Dave Ellis &amp; I slept on the spot marked X from Fremantle to Suez.  No 2 is on Suez Station &amp; No 3 is a group of 3 Sikhs who were on Guard.  No 4 is the famous Tel-el-Kebir which was snapped as we travelled through    The Kanowna Views shew the group Annie's Room. &amp; the Day the Boat sailed on the other one. Well, it is getting late, Mum, &amp; we have no fire in the Room, so as I want to write a few lines to Dad I'll wind up this letter. We Hope You have a Bonnie X'mas &amp; we really do hope to spend the next one with You.  I am going to try &amp; get to the Island for X'mas, but I do not expect to be lucky enough. Regards to Mrs Stephen, Dobson, Bunting &amp; Ali &amp; also to the neighbours every one, although I do not mention their names.  I would write to them all but I have 20 or 25 letters to write every week now &amp; could not manage. Best Love Harry
