[Printed page]THE SUM OF CHIVALRY
What shall be said of him, your friend,That very perfect gentle knightWhose fair life, crowned with such an end,No graven scroll could praise aright?
There is a simple line can tellOf the great spirit, proud and free,Whose steadfast vision still would dwellUpon the star of Courtesy.
No shining warrior prince of old,Whose glory fit the knightly days,But this brief epitaph had toldThe perfect measure of his praise.
Yet him we mourn a courage gracedThat finds no ancient counterpart,What knew they of the deaths he facedWith laughter from a boyish heart?
There needs no marble, just the smallRude cross of wood that soldiers rear,And this for proud memorial -"AN AUSTRALIAN GENTLEMAN LIES HERE"
