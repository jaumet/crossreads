"Ah Che la Morte Ognora"Il Trovatore   Verdi
Ah I have sighed to rest meDeep in the quiet graveSighed to rest meBut all in vain I craveO, fare thee well my LeonoraFare thee well
Ah I have sighed for restYet all in vain do I craveOh fare thee well my LeonoraFare thee well
Out of the love I bear theeYield I my life for theeWilt thou not thinkWilt thou not think of meO think of me my LeonoraFare thee well
