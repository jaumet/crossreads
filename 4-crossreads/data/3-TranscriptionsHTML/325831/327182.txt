<p>Judges' Chambers<br/>Supreme Court, Sydney<br/>19 August 1916</p>
<p>My dear General Foster,</p>
<p>A little while ago I discovered that some of my friends were very kindly interesting themselves on behalf of my surviving son, with a view to minimising his risk on active service, &amp; I am now informed that it is probable he may be put on non-combatant duties.</p>
<p>The more I think of it, the more impossible it seems to me that the boy would be willing to consent to this course, &amp; I feel that he would never forgive me if he thought that there was any ground for the suggestion that my position was being used as a reason for giving him exceptional treatment. He is very keen on his work: he has done what he felt to be his duty in offering his services, &amp; he went with my full consent. I have talked the matter over with his mother, &amp; we agree that if he wishes to remain in his present position, we ought not to ask him to leave it.</p>
<p>I am sorry to trouble you with such a purely personal matter, but I should be very much obliged if you would let the Minister know how I feel about it.</p>
<p>With kind regards,</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely</p>
<p>David G. Ferguson</p>
