<p>1918<br/>Tue.  1st Jan.<br/>New Year's Day.   In the afternoon several patients were carried forward under the awning near the foc'sl head.   I was carried along on a bamboo chaise-longue.   Winton and the little Jap. Nagayama were next to me.   The band played "Deutschland uber Alles", Die Wacht am Rhein", and Wagner and Waldteufel walzes.</p>
