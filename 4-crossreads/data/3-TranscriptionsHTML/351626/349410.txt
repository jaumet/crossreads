<p>trenches among the scrub  &amp; wild flowers   &amp; in time they became such a nuisance that we had to give them an armistice to bury them.  I was about three weeks in the trenches   &amp; was hit in the leg by a fragment of shrapnel  &amp; so have been sent to Malta &ndash; a hospital base &ndash; I expect to be here some time as the above address will find me.<br/>The bone of my leg is not injured so I expect it will heal up alright though of course it will take time.  I hope you are all well with love to all from your affectionate son<br/>Charlie<br/>over</p>
