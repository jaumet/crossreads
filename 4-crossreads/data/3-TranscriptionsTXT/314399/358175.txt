Friday 27 June 1919Garage at 10 am. Drive early. Did reverse & starting up a hill & did very well. Do me. Had lunch at Bill's place & then we went to Olympia. The Queen, Princess Mary & Prince Henry were there too. They got a huge ovation. The show was good. Consisted of  physical jerks by Waacs & soldiers. Tanks in action. Infantry in action. Frog Cavalry. 18 pounders & two teams of gun running. Also some Scotties dancing. We enjoyed it immensely. Had dinner & then went to Hyde Park & listened to the band. Came home early & read.
Saturday 28 June 1919PEACE  SIGNED
Up early & round to Bill to tell him I was going to Brighton. Got the 11 am Pullman & arrived in Brighton at 128 pm. Had lunch at St James Restaurant & then went out to the hospital & waited for Janet. She turned up at 2.30 & we then went for a stroll. Watched some cricket near the racecourse & then went into town for tea. Walked along the esplanade to Hove & then into town again for dinner. Quite a huge crowd in the streets. One could hardly move. Rockets, crackers, whistles trumpets. All sorts of things used for making a noise cos peace was signed at 3.30 pm. Got the 9.50 back to London. Searchlights were going everywhere here.
