 Thursday 8 Good day. Very heavy rainstorm at night. Sergeants Mess room bent in about 1 ft evidently by a big wave. Had shave.  first since  Nichol mended breeches torn on screw on a boat. 
 Friday 9th Mended white [hat?] which was torn nearly half way round. Saw  young  whale which was about 50 yds from ship. As it came up for breath we could see about 20 ft of a brownish body about 50 ft. long, round &amp; about 5 ft across. 
 Saturday 10th Sea very calm and at places oily looking. Evidently a current where so oily. There was a long swell but no ripples at all. 
 Great afternoon &amp; the finest day so far. No kit inspection as was expected. Afternoon off, chatted on boat deck with Pynor &amp; Nichol. Washed bluies &amp; towel, hung out &amp; took in about 1 am next morning. Slept as usual in hammock  on   above deck . Alarm immediately after tea. 
 Sunday 11th "boat" Church parade, slight dizzle in middle. Writing on top deck in nice sun after heavy rain. 
 Good service in evening. Finished at 7 pm. as organ was required. Service was great success &amp; very enjoyable. Chaps wanted week night service so one for Thursday arranged. After organ taken away continued singing accompanied by a flute. Sang until we had enough. Singing which was conducted by a chap was of first rate order. The service, the singing and the home atmosphere unconsciously associated with a good lot of singing formed undoubtly the most enjoyable evening yet had on board.
