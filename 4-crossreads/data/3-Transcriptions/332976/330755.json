<p>November 1916<br/>25th   We received large quantities of material for the trenches to-day &amp; infantry fatigues have been taking quantities of it to a sub-dump (Needle dump) to be taken straight into the trenches  The 29th Battallion went "in" to-night &amp; each man was issued with four sandbags.  We have had a party making barbed wire entanglements all day, which are to be taken down into the line.  The air-craft have been fairly active to-day &amp; we saw two planes brought down one of which was our own.  We had a heavy frost last night &amp; to-night we are having some fine rain.</p>
