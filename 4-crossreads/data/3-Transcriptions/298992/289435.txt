<p>26 letters!! Can you imagine getting 26 all at once? I didn't know where to start. However I sorted them out in dates, and spent all the morning reading them. Goodness only knows, how long it will take to answer them all. There were 3 from Father, only one<br/> from you Mother, and 3 from Dorothy, &amp; a very interesting one from Dene. I have been waiting anxiously to get one from Dene, &amp; he was a sport to write such a lone one. Incidentally of course, there were numbers of letters from several other people. Gee! what a time I had reading them all. Mr Hand received</p>
