Gib. Seems a barren little square rock. Big Naval Base at Valleta (Capital). Nothing unusual till Port Said. Amongst the Gippos niggers again. Quite a lot of shipping. Not allowed off on a/c of Flu. Usual mob of Eastern vendors of all nationalities selling wares of different kinds. Left here after a day's stay started through the canal. A great piece of work. Sand on either side as far as you can see except an occasional oasis or a Ave. of palms green vegetation presumably a creek or something. Canal only about 200 yds. or
