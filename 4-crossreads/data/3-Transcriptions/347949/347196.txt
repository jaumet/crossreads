<p>3rd Aus. Aux. Hospital<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Dartford<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  5.11.18.</p>
<p>My dear Folks,</p>
<p>In my letter to you yesterday I promised you an account of the Battle of<br/>Amiens which I was in before finally being evacuated through sickness. I will<br/>describe as best I can what I saw, how one feels during the nine days with the Battalion in the great advance commencing on the 8th.August.</p>
<p>Well we had been out of the line for a few days spell - they were only very few: but<br/>at least one had a chance to wash &amp;amp ;cleanup generally &amp; feel more like a civilized being again.  One morning after being only on parade an hour or so word came out  calling all companies in &ndash; our hearts sank within us because everyone knew what  it meant again &ndash; that this time something very big was in view.<br/>The rest of that day was spent in</p>
