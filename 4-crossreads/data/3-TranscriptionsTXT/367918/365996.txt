 4 pieces and reconstructed in all but the ironworks. In each case it means two or three weeks delay and an expenditure of &pounds;5000 &ndash; &pounds;10000 but money doesn't seem to enter into Naval matters as a consideration of any moment. And you never know when you have them &ndash; they're always liable to change their minds at the last moment, and undo all the work they have just completed. 
 I had the hardest evenings work on Easter Monday that I've had for a long time. I was informed at 6.30 p.m. that I was acting as best man at a wedding at 8.30 and that no arrangements had been made. Not a taxi in the city available owing to their strike &ndash; the minister away out at Abassia, the bride in another part of the city, the bridegroom here and the church in a different direction again. 
 It took me two hours almost to get a car &ndash; no dinner &amp; no time to change out of old slacks, dirty boots etc. It was a queer show but eventually when I got home about 1 a.m. everything was fixed up. The hurry was due to circumstances brought about by the war here and was unavoidable but I'm finished with being best man. 
 My kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson 
 Yours very sincerely R.J. Hunter P.T.O.
