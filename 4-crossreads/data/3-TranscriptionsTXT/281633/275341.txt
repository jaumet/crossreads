morning by a French Gamekeeper.  As soon as the crews arrived two of our fellows Austin & another, Ridley, went out with Rifles but could not find the Froggy.  If they did I firmly believe they woud have shot him dead.  Steve has been buried & a Cross is being made for him.  I am still roosting in my Bunk.  Cannot put my foot to the ground.
25/11My Foot is still bad, but I can hobble around with a stick.  I was called up for orderly room to-day & informed that I would have to go to Hospital as we are going to move in two or three days & I will not be able to march.  I said nothing but intend to hang out until I am kicked out.
Thursday 28/11There is a "Purphy" floating about to the effect that the 1st & 4th Divisions are out on strike.  The yarn runs that after they arrived about Strasbourg they were put on Salvaging Barbed Wire.  They soon got sick of that & knocked off saying they had captured enough prisoners to do all that.  For punishment they were sent on a 12 miles route march.  After reaching their destination they were ordered to march back but refused:  finally motor lorries were sent out to bring them back.
7.12.18The ancle is still very weak but I managed to walk half way to St. Ouen yesterday.With reference to the above mentioned "Purfy" I don't believe the 1st & 4th Divs. reached Strasbourg at all.
