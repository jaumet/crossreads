26 - 27  Nov
posted up this morning.  but it only told us that the Indian troops had captured 3 machine guns & similar news, but did not say how the war was progressing & nothing about the reverse in Africa.  We would be a lot more contented if they published all the war news that comes through.We passed through the Straits of Babel Madelo at 2 P.M.practising Morse flags all day.  another horse died.
Fridy 27thI was on duty from 6 to 8 & from 12 to 4 during last night, had a cup of tea as we were coming off at 4 oclock this morning.  All the boats had orders to sail along last night with no lights & we were to do signalling with the lamps only on urgent messages  (The officers on this boat are always barking at the officers on the Hororato & the Hororato barks back;
[correctly: Bab al Mandab]
