After dinner the reading of stories, the issue of chocolates, the goodnights & saying of prayers, a possible picky back entreaties for a jiggety jig & then peace perfect peace.   I also thought of dear old Father & Mother - Farther in his arm chair reading a book, Mother seated in the most uncomfortable chair in the room and sewing. My thoughts also turned to all the boys & their wives & to Aunt Sara Cassie & Frank.
