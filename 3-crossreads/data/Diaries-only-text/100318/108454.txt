Boulogne
While having breakfast a funeral passed headed by a man carrying a crucifix. Followed a surpliced priest, the widow, the tawdry hearse and a small crowd of mourners. At 10 a.m. with Bateman caught the passenger train for Abbeville and at our first stop two girls (rather goodlooking) entered. I found some excuse for getting into conversation with one and tried a bit in French about air raids. She came out with some English later and it turned out that she had left London only a month ago having been there on a holiday. She had learned English from her governess. They have a townhouse in Paris and divide their time between there, Biarritz, Nice the other pleasure haunts of moneyed people. A nice family. Reached Abbeville at about 1.30 and
