<p>looked in for awhile &amp; then walked out into Fishpool St, up which I proceeded until I came to the gates of St Michael's. I walked into the little church, and found a number of ladies decorating it with holly for the Christmas festivals. An elderly lady pointed <strike>me</strike> out the burial place of the wisest and brightest, and meanest of men. His monument is in the Chancel and represents the great philosopher <strike>dead</strike> in his chair, his head fallen backward, and suggesting that the mighty soul had just shed from its earthly home. The monument, executed in white marble, was set up shortly after his death by Sir Thomas Meauty's   "Living his Attendant; Dead, his Admirer." Of all the figures in Literature, that of the unfortunate Chancellor <strike>interested me most,</strike> is the most interesting to me. I felt gratified indeed on beholding the spot where his ashes were entombed. In the Afternoon I went to St Paul's Cathedral, and surveyed the main parts of that building, including the crypt where I reverently stood before the tombs of Wellington and Nelson. I was shown round by a pale-faced withered old man, dressed in black, who flittered among the tombs like a ghost, and behaved so like one, that I expected every minute to see him vanish into the Sarcophagus. This spectre showed me a monument in the crypt, on which was depicted a profile in marble, and he exclaimed: "Monument of William Bede Dalley, the Australian Statesman."</p>
<p>* In the crypt inventory of departed mortality I read: "72 William Bede Dalley. Dalley as Premier of N.S.W, upon the outbreak of the Egyptian War (1882), sent a regiment from the Colony to join our troops in Egypt as a substantial token of the child's affection for the Motherland. This action has acquired a historic value as the first practical move in the direction of Imperial Federation." Cathedral Guide.</p>
