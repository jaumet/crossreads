Again the nature of the country was all against mounted men destroying their mobility.  (The above report is taken almost verbatim from Col Cameron's despatch)</p>
<p>On the morning the Bgde area was visited by 6 enemy planes, which dropped one bomb amongst a troop of the 7th L.H. killing 8 men &amp; wounding 10 No casualties in the 5th Regt. On May 12th changed our camp to the Nth of Jericho, weather extremely hot, &amp; wind blowing dense clouds of dust. Whilst here the Regt was attached to the Australian Division furnishing working parties for roadmaking. On May 22nd the 2nd Bgde took over a section of outpost line in the Wadi Auja (No4 Sub-section). This sector was held by each Regt alternately: Two Sqdns holding the outpost line with one in reserve. Daily patrols were made to Tel-el-Truny, where the Turks had an outpost in the foothills. On the 25th Inst our Patrol was fired on &amp; one man killed. Working parties from each Regt were sent out roadmaking &amp; wiring round the constructed positions</p>
