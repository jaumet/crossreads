<p>Weather still continues to be hot.</p>
<p>In Cairo.  It is amusing, if one happens to stand at any point waiting on a tram etc, how the native urchins gather round and jabber away in their native tongue to you.  I found this is a good opportunity to learn a few words of their languages.  The method adopted is to say English &ndash; "tea" "Arabic"?.

This method makes on the possessor of numerous necessary words quite simply and incidentally causes some amusement amongst these black urchins.</p>
