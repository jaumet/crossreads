<p>Tuesday 23 April<br/>Things have been quiet about here all day but to-night a heavy artillery activity was evident on the left.  French front Battalions change over to-night &amp; early in the morning there is a bit of a stunt in the direction of Meteren.  Exactly what I cannot say.</p>
<p>Wednesday 24 April<br/>Just after midnight this morning an attack was made on Meteren without artillery preparation by the 3rd Brigade.  The Boche line was alive with machine guns &amp; our men made good targets for the German Gunners in the moonlight.  Ye Gods, it was a gutser! &amp; our chaps suffered heavy casualties, mostly coming through this post.  I have been carrying all day up till midnight.  However, he left our roads alone &amp; never shelled back at all. Again, this afternoon, the artillery fire on our left was terrific &amp; on our front our people gave him some gas.</p>
