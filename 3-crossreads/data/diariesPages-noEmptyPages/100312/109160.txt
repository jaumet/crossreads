11/11/17 near Ypres
Another sloppy day. The Battalion comes back from the line this morning the relieving Tommies going up in daylight. Five Taubes came over about 10 am dropped a number of bombs. They make very skilful use of the clouds. Antiaircraft guns and m.g's opened intense fire. Moved down to another camp about noon near Ypres and preparations were there made for the Battalion coming out of the line. The whole campsite was filthy dirty muddy and the huts unlined cheerless but they will seem like Paradise to the men from the line. They began to trickle in after lunch and everyone was down by dark and making themselves at ease. We march 10 miles tomorrow to Wippenhyoek. Our casualties this time very light ? one Corpl was killed coming out.
