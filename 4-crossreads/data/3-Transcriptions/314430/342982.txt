<p>"Gott mit uns" can no longer be the claim of a beaten and broken people. Tomorrow may bring the good news. Kings are falling fast these days. Left Dartford for Weymouth today, via London.</p>
<p>November 11th :- The news has come at last! It reached me today at Littlemoor Convalescent Camp, Weymouth, at 11.40 a.m. We were called from our huts to attend a muster parade. The great announcement that the Armistice had been signed was made in a very shabby way indeed. A talkative, egotistical sergeant of the "Eggs-a-cook"* crowd, addressing the men on parade said :- "All the men in these ranks (indicating the number) will be in lying picket tonight. Peace was declared at 7 o'clock this morning. Your job will be to see that the beer canteens and pubs are not broken into tonight. Dismiss." That is how I learned officially the magnificent news that would ease the hearts of all the world.</p>
<p>* The shapes of the shoulder colour patches for the five Divisions of the A.I.F. in France were as follow here :-<br/>1st Div [drawing &ndash; horizontal rectangle divided crosswise, top half shaded]<br/>2nd Div [drawing &ndash; diamond divided crosswise, bottom half shaded]<br/>3rd Div [drawing &ndash; horizontal oval divided crosswise, bottom half shaded. Drawing is surrounded by a square line.]<br/>4rd Div [drawing &ndash; circle divided crosswise, bottom half shaded]<br/>5th Div [drawing &ndash; vertical rectangle divided lengthwise, right half shaded]<br/>It will be noted that the shape of the [arrow to drawing] 3rd Division patch resembles an egg. My friend Gunner Lee <strike>who</strike> referred to on page 114 of this diary, had been in Egypt. He told me how the name "Eggs-a-cook" originated :- In Egypt the supply of eggs is inexhaustible. Every dirty Arab kid sell them &ndash; cooked. You hear "eggs-a-cook", everywhere. Consequently, when the other Divisions saw the shape of the colours of the Third, they promptly called them, "Eggs-a-cook", They put more relish into it, because the Third Division was a very long time in England before going to France.</p>
