November 191614th   We are still on the drain job & have the same party as we had yesterday.  I have two other sappers to help me, & have started on a bridge which is to be made on a road where the drain goes under.  One of Fritzs planes flew over & dropped four bombs near us, wounding two of the Tommies, but he was brought down in flames about ten minutes later, a few miles away, near Mametz Wood.  We have heard that successful attacks have been made by our boys on the morning of the 12th & also at night, & another yesterday morning.  Over 3000 German
