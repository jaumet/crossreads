 Another trip to Poperinghe and to the "Anchor Follies" which are not at all bad. We move tomorrow to Lille Gate Ypres to be in reserve for 2nd Field Ambulance.
Wednesday 24
 Move this morning to Ypres "The city of Fear" and camp in dugouts at Lille Gate. The dugouts are made in the ramparts and are long tunnels lit with electricity, like baby road tunnels.
 Fritz's Gothas came over the town this afternoon received no opposition.
 Met George Wilkie. I believe we join on left of our old position, through Frezenberg
Thursday 25
 Still at Lille Gate Ypres waiting in reserve. Things are quiet on the line.
 Rumours of a stunt tomorrow are about, on a big scale
Friday 26
 Still at Lille Gate Ypres. Last night bombing activity by Fritz to-day big shells which made our dugout rock like a ship.
 Move up the line in the morning.
 Yesterday morning the Canadians took Paschendale ridge, but owing to the heavy shell fire had to abandon it
Saturday 27
 Move up early this morning to Zonnebeke now about 1 mile behind the line. The post is located in a cordial factory is fairly shell proof. Fritz has been shelling very heavily about here with very big stuff. The day has been fine cares few so except for the magnetism of the place things aren't bad.
