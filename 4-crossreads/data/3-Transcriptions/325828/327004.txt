<p>and though cold &amp; frosty it is fine at last.<br/>We had a nocturnal air visitor last night   For over an hour the droning of the Zep engines was plainly heard with an occasional sharper hum of our planes in pursuit.  Whilst the "sky larking" was going on, I dropped off to sleep, so didn't hear if any damage was done.<br/>The brown-toned photo of Ypres Cathedral is one that was given to me so I haven't any negative of it.  The larger one was also given me.  It was taken at Brown's Dip (Anzac) &amp; shows corpses of Australian soldiers laid out prior to burying.  No negative of this either.   I will send the negatives of the others on later<br/>Must close now with love to you all<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
