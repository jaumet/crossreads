 Messines Left "Pill box" at 6 am, with Mr Kerr, for Forward Observation Post, via Bob trench. There was a cold hard surface on the ground, and  a knife edged wind. I had to fall in a shell hole, and make myself a iceberg until the sun thawed me out. At midday we did our shoot,Baab Farm and Pill ditto.
