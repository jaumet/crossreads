<p>It has been possible for my father to go back in his native land: the village in which I inhabited before the war has received some shells. &nbsp;The german have taken off all furniture. &nbsp;Only the four walls and the roof [indescipherable]. As my father is a notary, he had many papers; the Germans have taken off these papers also.</p>
<p>At this time, there are many american soldiers in the country.</p>
<p>I hope that, before going back in Australia, you shall come at Paris.</p>
<p>I expect your letter patiently.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Your friend</p>
<p>Jean Watelet</p>
