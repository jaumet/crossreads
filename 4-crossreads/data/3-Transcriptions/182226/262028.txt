<p>Thursday 6 January, 1916</p>
<p>Feeling a bit tired.</p>
<p>The weather is beginning to get windy with a promise of rain.</p>
<p>Rain came on late in the afternoon &amp; the sea got up a good deal. It is a pitch dark night &amp; the boat is rolling horribly.</p>
<p>We have as escort a little trawler which carries two light guns. She is rolling all over the place &amp; shipping a lot of water.</p>
<p>We have to have our lifebelts with us all the time &amp; are all told off to certain boats in case of being torpedoed. I am in No 13 mess &amp; 13 boat so according to anyone of a supersticious nature I don&#39;t stand much chance of pulling through if anything happens.</p>
