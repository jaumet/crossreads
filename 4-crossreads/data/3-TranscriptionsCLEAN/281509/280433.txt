  
 29 July 1916 Saturday 
 Off duty at 8 a.m.  Tony's unit camped alongside us last night.   Had a good old yarn to him.   They move back this morning.    also our tent division clearing hospital handed over to 4th field.   Stretcher bearers remain behind.   Say farewell to Tony.   I wonder how long it will be before we see each other again.
