<p>1916 July 20<br/>Thursday<br/>A rumour gained currency this morning that the 1st Field was not to go into action just yet. Great disappointment among the boys. Issued with steel helmet.<br/>Move of from Vadencourt wood not back, but foward still to next village &amp; take over casualty clearing hospital for an indefinite time. "Chatty" blankets. Hunt for a feed, 1/3 rations "no bon". 12 a crowd in tent. Fierce fighting going on foward. Germans shell Albert heavily. Numerous casualties among Australians. Admission to hospital bullet wound in hand self-inflicted.</p>
