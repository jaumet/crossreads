 that losses had already occurred through want of proper information being given the men. It is alright perhaps for officers to know all the details but what is going to happen if the officers get knocked early in the action? The men want to know what to do apart from officers &amp; the platoon Commander was asked to go to the O/C &amp; explain that the men want him to tell them where they are going to, what they have to do, what the objective is, what the Country is like in front &amp; the description of the part passed through &amp; that to be traversed
