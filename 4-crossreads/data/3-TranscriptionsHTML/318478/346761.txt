<p>Having referred my informant to the O.C. of the unit of occupation I slept undisturbed save for the old Webley <strike>and</strike> sticking in my soft parts &amp; a pouch of 36 rounds under my ear.  In fact should you ever visit the scenes of this any second <strike>were</strike> was I am afraid I could only show you the place where I outdid Aaron &amp; perhaps a small wooden cross, should it still exist, put up outside our possy under a beautiful tree pomegranate I believe &amp; carrying the simple but explanatory epitaph.  In loving memory of the ginger cat that <u>used</u> to live next door.</p>
<p>This afternoon with my tall scout a real scout of the 3rd Brigade I have done a recognaissance of the two places I am to paint &amp; really they are wonderful, one a fording place of the Jordan just below the Lake Baheiret El Herle.  The Lake, hills &amp; Mt. Herman in background.  But enough for tonight.  It is cool &amp; refreshing and so home &amp; dry &amp; more tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert.</p>
