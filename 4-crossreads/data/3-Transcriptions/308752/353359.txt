<p>August 24th.<br/>Thursday half-holiday. Eric, Bob &amp; myself went for a walk to [blank] a fair sized town much bigger than the one that we are at present living. The distance was about 9 miles altogether. We spent a very enjoyable afternoon. Visited the Church. The carvings statues &amp; drapings inside the Cathedral were magnificent. It is the finest church we have been in since landing in France.</p>
<p>Sunday 27th August.<br/>Visited the Aerodrome, which is situated about two miles from our billet. It was a very interesting afternoon walking round &amp; inspecting the Aeroplanes.</p>
<p>Monday 28th August.<br/>Spent the day working in the fields harvesting, a very interesting &amp; healthy occupation. In the evening a splendid concert was given ty the Unit at the School.  It was great success. All the officers were present.</p>
<p>Tuesday 29th August.<br/>A Section Tent Division have moved off to a village situated in a wood to form a small Hospital for troops. The distance must be close on 12 miles, a long &amp; stiff march with packs on. Eric left with this party. During the afternoon I came across Roy Watkins &amp; Hector Dargin, old school mates of mine. They were both 18 months in Egypt, both looked very well. The Unit is split up a great deal now. Men distributed in different places doing useful work.</p>
