<p>on the head to find the right road.<br/>July 7th 16<br/>We were paid last night, in francs, 49 francs equal<br/>&pound; 1.8.8. The franc is usually worth about 10 pence, but it has now dropped a little in value.<br/>Estaires Monday July 10th<br/>Arrived in this town yesterday midday, it is all narrow streets, and nice shops. On the march from our village, we saw innumerable airoplanes, including some enemy ones. Several times we saw some planes being shelled. We are now very near the firing line, but outside the town, every thing looks peacefull enough. Very few men are seen about excepting soldiers. Have had a look round this place, but am not impressed with it at all. Estaires is not altogether free from gas attacks so they have arranged an alarm, which is a ringing of all the bells, &amp; when the danger is over, drummers beat their drums through the town. Most of the inhabitants appear to be possessed of gas helmets, but they do not appear to have much fear of the gas.</p>
