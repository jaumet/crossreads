<p>Terry has gone across to the Dardanelles has been there now for some time and is doing well I am sorry to say I can't  give you any definite news except that he is quiet well of course in Artillery we are pretty safe if we take ordinary measures of safety. So far our casualties have been very few.</p>
<p>I hope Mrs Garling &amp; Pat are in the best of health and I will write to Pat as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Eric Lenehan</p>
