 Saturday, 31 July, 1915 Received bad news that two more of our chaps are dead Tommy Price &amp; Rosey, two of the strongest men in the corp, fever &amp; pneumonia being the cause I wrote home but was annoyed as only the Sydney Mail arrived for us and I had no letters to reply to as they were not sorted by the time we sailed at six o'clock closely followed by the other newly painted hospital ship Seang Choon. 
 Sunday, 1 August, 1915 On fatigues all morning scrubbing floors and cleaning up &amp; other house maid duties of the 1. L.H.F.A.  The Seang Choon has been following us closely all day, one of our chaps has made a book on the result of who will reach first at night the former passed us and I have backed the Clan. 
 There was an angry scrap at Achi Baba a few days ago and the Turks lost heavily.
