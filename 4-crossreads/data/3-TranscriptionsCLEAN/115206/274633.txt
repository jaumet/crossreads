 Messines Had a big stunt at 2 am. this morning. Weather wet. Spent the usual day. Am for O.P. tomorrow. Received Customs memo. At 12.5 midnight, we were barraging for a raid. Still raining.  Roussell out at O.P.  Walker went for pigeons. Loaned A.G. 151. Formed a picture Gallery in dugout. Rumoured that Eggs-a-cook stunt of 2nd was a failure that's why they   "hopped over" at midnight.
