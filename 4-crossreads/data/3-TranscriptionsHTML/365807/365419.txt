<p>alone. Keith was resting in a hollowed out place Gibson had in the side of trench with a Fritz overcoat for cover overhead to keep sun and rain off. At 3.30 pm a H.E. shell came over and burst just on the English side of trench, killing several and hitting Keith on the temple, while Gibson got a horrible gash across the shoulder, which wont be healed for two months yet. That was on 31st March.</p>
<p>Keith lost his speech and talked a lot of nonsense, so that they thought he had gone off his head, but he was not at all out of control or anything of that kind. From the description Gibson gives it looks as if the neighbourhood of Broca's convolution in 3rd left frontal must have been involved, and that he had what we used to term "gibberish aphasia". I can't say for certain of course, but it looks to me like that from the details a layman could give me, and naturally a layman would think Keith off his head, although not really so. For instance, he pointed to the Boche lines with a wild look in his eyes and shouted nonsense, but as Keith saw the men didn't understand him he pulled a pencil out of his pocket and scratched the letters in the soft clay in side of trench &ndash;</p>

<p>by which they afterwards made out he meant "fight". It certainly looks as if the inner workings of his brain were intact, but the outgoing channels of expression cut, and if this is correct the prognosis would be much more hopeful than if the damage had been vice versa. However, I shall be anxious to get further details</p>
