 response to this message, our Captain ordered the H.M.A.S. to proceed to Cocos Island and intercept hostile warship, - only a few minutes elapsed between the receipt of this urgent message and the despatch of "Sydney" and ere long the "Sydney" was obliterated from view by her own smoke screen. Captain Mortimer Le Silver became very frenzied because he could not himself proceed himself to intercept hostile warship, but he was prevented from so doing on account of his immense responsibility of being in charge of convoy and its safety, and he had to perforce remain with convoy, against his wish, but quite in accordance to his duty It was a most ideal day for a naval action &amp; naturally one and all came to the conclusion that the supposed hostile warship if such it was, could be no other than the much searched for "Emden" that had given such considerable annoyance and anxiety and which was under command of Captain Von Muller.
