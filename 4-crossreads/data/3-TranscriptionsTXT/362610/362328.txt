 Saturday 22 April 1916 It was raining heavily when we woke, &amp; steady rain continued right thro' the day until sundown, making it a very miserable day. Some of the companies had to go out to the rifle range, but for the remainder parades were very rightly cancelled. Most of my time was taken up with censoring &amp;c., &amp; late in the afternoon I went into Etaples to buy some methylated spirits for my little stove. Amid many interruptions tried to get some letter-writing done after tea.
