2Ireland four days & went to Killarney which I thought very lovely.Nancy Norris gave me  15- from you dear. It was very very good of you old girl & I am very grateful. I had a lovely Holiday & went & saw Mrs Elsmie & her daughter & very charming they were. Had dinner there. Also had tea with Mrs Norris & Nancy. What a dear old lady Mrs Norris is. Barney Somerville & I had our Photos taken in Dublin 12 for 1/6d - awfully cheap & not half bad. I enclose one for you, one for Trish & one for Arch with my love & Fred the two brothers one for you -
