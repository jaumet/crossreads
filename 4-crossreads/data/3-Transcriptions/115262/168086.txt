<p>Thursday 15 November 1917.</p>
<p>&quot;Stand to&quot; at 3.30 am. A bite to eat &amp; off again at 8 a.m. Passed over a strongly built stone bridge of 3 spans. With one or two halts we reached the village of Akir, taken by the Yoemanry this morning.</p>
<p>Ammunition etc left &nbsp;in Jacko&#39;s hasty retreat. Passed near a very&nbsp;&quot;classy village near Abushh. Every building had a red tiled roof &amp; white walls. One building was 3 storey. Gardens &amp; orchards well cultivated.</p>
<p>At Akir our sandcarts took away a number of Turkish wounded prisoners whose&nbsp;wounds were in a shocking condition. On once again &amp; passed through another village on <s>the</s> a branch railway from Jaffa. Turkish prisoners here also. Some wounded. Travelled till 6 pm. Halted &ndash; awaiting orders. Got a little rest.</p>
<p>Ramleh the main Turkish position on the Jaffa-Jerusalem railway has fallen &amp; is now occupied by our troops.</p>
