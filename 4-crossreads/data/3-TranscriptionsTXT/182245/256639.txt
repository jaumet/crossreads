 1917 MAY 
 4 FRIDAY 
 Fine &amp; hot. Think this weather 
 must be too good to last. Fixing 
 harness, horses ect in morning 
 &amp; cleaning harness all 
 afternoon. The other two 
 sections went up to the pits 
 in evening. Fritz was 
 doing a lot of shelling in the 
 morning round Erquingham 
 &amp; Fleurbaix. I had to go 
 up to the pits at night to 
 show the man with the rations 
 the way. Saw Capt Campbell 
 &amp; he said he would get me 
 up to the guns shortly.
