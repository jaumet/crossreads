<p>Thursday 30th.<br/>Still cold. At the rifle range all day Nothing else out of the ordinary occurred.</p>
<p>Friday <strike>3</strike>1st December<br/>Cold again. Another very heavy frost last night &ndash;</p>
<p>Had a tooth pulled out &amp; so stayed off parade to write some letters as it was the only chance I have had for a fortnight of doing so.</p>
<p>Nothing else happened today.</p>
<p>Saturday <strike>1st</strike> 2nd December.<br/>Expected to be shifting camp today but again put off.</p>
<p>At rifle range in the afternoon. Had to fire 10 rounds each with gas helmets on. One lot scored 8 hits on the targets out of 640 shots; six however is the record. Had to knock off early as it is now quite dark by 5 oclock.</p>
