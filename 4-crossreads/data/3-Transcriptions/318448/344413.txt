<p>no Coal queues<br/>11/4/18<br/>This morning we woke up to the noise of great guns &amp; a fierce bombardment. The Turks made an attack starting at 3am this morning.<br/>It was abortive &amp; I hear that they suffered very heavy casualties 2000 being the number estimated while we lost 17 men killed &amp; 40 wounded. Now every thing is quiet again, but there has been great activity all through the day.</p>
