Already several of the boys are sniffing & have watery eyes, and something worse sets in so quickly unless you are very careful. 
 So long for the present Mother dear and I expect to receive a big mail in a day or two now. I am, honestly, quite well so you need have no fear in that direction. 
 Heaps of Love to all the family and yourself as well.
