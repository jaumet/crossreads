  
 March 1917 15 continued   counterattacked & some of our advance machine gun positions evacuated to the front line.   He was driven of & we got a few prisoners. The casualties in the front line have been very small lately, but around here, within the last four days, we have had over 80 killed & wounded. 16th   Fritz's shelling has been a bit quieter to-day, but still, he didn't forget to let us know he was still alive.   A great number of our "plumb puddings" went down to the line from here this afternoon & it is rumoured there is to be an attack tonight.
