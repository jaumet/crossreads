It was very interesting to hear the opinions of the patients, as none of them were at all aware that I was interested in \"the Nightbirds\"</p> \r\n <p>Sun. 18.  Spent a day in Hospital  A chap named Stevens is in this ward.  He used to be in the Manly Band, &amp; he &amp; I had some great yarns about Manly.</p> \r\n <p> \r\n Monday 19.  Good news from Bapaume.  Our troops have the Town &amp; several villages beyond &amp; Fritz is still on the move.  It seems strange not to hear the Guns banging away.  They are too far away now to hear them firing.  Went to see the Anzac Coves with Ted Grey &amp; MacKinlay  Very good show.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300050\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 50]<br> \r\n Tue. 20.

Hand in the Convalescent Hut.  Kept busy supplying men for the different Fatigues about the camp.</p> \r\n <p>Thur. 22.  Weather getting good again.  Quiet a treat to be alive.  Busy getting ready for the Concert.  Johnnie Moore got &pound;5 from the Comforts Fund to buy a new violin.</p> \r\n <p>Friday 23.  The Nightbirds Orchestra is getting some class now.  We have 2 violins, Piano &amp; Cornet.  Our Concert is put off till Monday night, as the \"Anzac Coves  want to see it.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300051\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 51]<br> \r\n Sat.

The Concert came off &amp; was pretty good, but not  so good as the show we put on in Albert &amp; Meault.  Norm Adams made us some new ruffles which looked very well indeed.  Nick Coxon appeared as  Melba &amp; did very well.  Heard today that the Bapaume Town Hall had blown up &amp; caught some of the Comforts Fund people who were arranging for a Concert  to be held there.
