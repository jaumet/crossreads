  
 Wednesday, 9 June, 1915 It blows like the Devil here we get full strength as we are on top of the hill.   We have a dip every morning as soon as we get up.  we are allowed to sleep in till seven o'clock this is a luxury.  We are camped on top of the hill of Mudros and behind us is the village thousands of years old and still the same with the quaint houses and greek peasant costumes.  The Capital of Lemnos is eighteen miles away, the total population is 25,000 with about the same number of troops, French and British.  It is going to be a permanent base and the Egyptian Eng are making roads, but the chief drawback is the water supply, what there is is of bad quality and we are only allowed about a pint a day & that boiled. 
 Thursday, 10 June. Whilst the others went for route march in a strong wind [indecipherable] fatigue the Col & two sergeants went to Gaba Tepe to get the mails.  The other officers have been chaffing him and he has plucked up Dutch courage.  The place had been condemned as a base, Imbros & Narselles [?] going to be the next, there is scarcely any water here and what there is is bad, Typhoid being very common a lot of the men have developed it.  The next tent to ours is a mortuary and every day five or six bodies are brought over for burial from the hosp ships wrapped in a union Jack for a decent but crude burial on land a rough cross is put up to denote the sleeper underneath.  It is impossible to get good feed here, only fish & spaghetti reeking with olive oil and garlic.
