 Oct. 5 Tuesday 1915 
 Another big Aus mail in every one working at high pressure, Also a larger quantity of wounded mail from the Dardinelles. We do not seem to be able to cope with the work. It is growing so fast. 
 Oct. 6 Wednesday 1915 Pay day drew 7/- starting to put away as much as possible to send some Xmas presents home. Went to midweek prayer meeting in Scots Church. It was just what is needed here  - those present quite enjoyed the time spent. 
 Oct. 7 Thursday 1915 Working all day, had a long walk through the By Streets &amp; lanes of Alexandra. The narrow streets simply swarm with humanity &amp; one wonders how in years to come they are going to exist. Spent an hour or two watching the cargo boats being loaded with sundries for the Dardinelles. The warf  is filled with every article one can think of for the comfort &amp; protection of the soldiers.
