<p>Aug 30 at 8 pm. Wired Hilda, had dinner, bought sundry things, inspected the old town. Caught the Camps Bay tram &amp; did the round trip via Sea point &amp; by ------ it was great! The scenery is simply magnificent. There above towers the giant Table Mountain; below the blue waters of the Atlantic break endlessly on the rock bound coast. And yet, there is a beautiful little sandy cove nestling behind the rocky outposts, but alas it is unsafe owing to the dangerous quicksands. Along the shore are a few ref' rooms a private Hotel &amp; several private buildings</p>
