Battle of Romani Aug 19163rd - 13th - About 125 Turks treated. They were given Dental tent & three or four bell tents for their winged. All thro day of attack & night following spent bullets by hundreds fell in & around tents. Two wounded, hit by them, flesh wounds only. One fell in doorway of same & some passed thro tents. Tipped somebody one of us to be hit by them but our luck was in. One of our men, Hollege killed by one & Blyth slight wound in back. Fairly spent. Hollege hit on back of head & killed instantly. Turks had retreated thro night & all rifle fire ceased for a time. About 7 pm, Turks given a table in our tent & carried on. Rather unique spectacle. We (Austns) treating ours on one table & Turks treating theirs on another table in same tent. Would like to have got a photo but too busy. Turks had retired on Qatia & our L.H & NZs kept in touch. On afternoon of 5th our men charged Turks at Qatia & got within 600 yards but they were too strong & their M.G. fire mowed our men NZ. M.O (Wellingtons) & his Sgt caught by M.G. fire & badly wounded. M.O. died & his sgt to this date (13th) not expected to live. M.O. had compnd, complicated, comminuted fractures of both legs & shock. His foot also badly knocked about below ankle, by piece out of left calf & several M.G. furrows thro buttock. Despite these injuries, poor beggar had to ride from Qatia (6 miles) on horseback. Marvellous pluck & endurance. Several other cases of men with broken thighs riding back. For absolute pluck & endurance I never saw or heard of anything like it before
