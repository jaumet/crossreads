The trenches all communicate with one another, and each can be walked into from many directions.  Telephones heliographs and flags are working all the time, by their means information is kept constantly travelling from one point to another.   Lemnos is all sandstone.

 The enemy never fires his guns at night because the positions might be discovered; they also cease firing when the aeroplanes or the balloons are in the air, to prevent those watching from above discovering them as targets for the guns upon the ships.  Luminous shells and flares are often thrown into the air at night and they are frequently followed by hand grenades.   Both sides use these.
