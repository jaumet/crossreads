In a cricket match to-day "B" Section were badly beaten by "All-Comers".
Fritz still shells these areas heavily in parts, Hazebrouck getting plenty as well as some gun positions on our left. Still civilians on this other farms hang on.
Tuesday 7 May
Very wet this morning, but it was fine when we went into the line again to the same posts which we left. Things are quiet on this front to-night but on the left, the artillery is very active. Caestre is quiet now. The wheat flour potatoes on the farms here are all being salved taken back.
