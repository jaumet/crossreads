<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Just a few short sharp lines more to thank you for your two letters &amp; the photos than anything else.  You are a brick to write so often &amp; just the things I wish to know of.</p>
<p>As for the photos, they are both splendid especially the one taken with Graham, thats the best one of you I've ever seen I think.  I have it stuck right above me &amp; you would smile to hear some of the remarks.  Don't be alarmed, always complementary, <u>most</u> &amp; sometimes quaint as well.</p>
<p>I took it to show Mrs. Johnston &amp; she</p>
