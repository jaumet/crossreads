There were about a hundred of ?em young, middle aged  and old. Some of the girls were fairly good looking, but did not come within miles of our Australian factory girls. They are quite as cheeky though. We had a busy day scrubbing out the baths and getting them ready for business tomorrow. This was a laundry before the war, not dye works and was run by a German firm. It is almost within stone throw of Armentieres which is very much knocked about by the Huns, and this place is, so far, untouched. We knocked off work about 4, then we all had a hot bath and clean change of clothing.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a5299100\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 100]<br><br />\nThe RSB of the 31st Batt. lost 11 men out of 14, which is a big percentage, about the heaviest of any crowd.
