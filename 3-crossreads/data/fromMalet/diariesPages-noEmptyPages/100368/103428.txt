July 12th
Intended to have a sail up the River Nile with M. but much to our disappointment we could not get a boat to hire so we decided to go out to Heliopolis.
We had a walk round this beautiful place which is built out in the desert.
Returning to the city we had tea in Groppiâ€™s and then drove home in a "gharry".
