<p>Apl 1 Several of the boys were in a state of shik last night, some just harmlessly maudlin &amp; others aggresively drunk. Its a pity of course, but then the boys havn't had any booze for weeks</p>
<p>The English say there will be one big drive this month or next &amp; that we'll be right in it. "No chats yet" Route march this morning for a couple of hours through gloriously green country &amp; along good roads. A little drill about 2 oclock &amp; then a foot inspection. Shifted camp to another, &amp; much better barn</p>
<p>2  Slept warm &amp; soundly last night on a straw bed. Beautiful morning; very little frost. Church Parade at 10.15; in the meantime the boys are playing miniature cricket &amp; enjoying themselves no end. Some coot pinched our bread yesterday, so I had to go to the village for more or else eat biscuits Likker is some cheap; beer 1 glass rum 2, &amp; wine 4, or 10 a bottle The beer is very light. None of the buildings about here<br/>[in margin] <u>Sunday</u></p>
