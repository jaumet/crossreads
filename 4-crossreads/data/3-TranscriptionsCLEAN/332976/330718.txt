  
 October 1916 which goes under the Thames. Bournemouth which is only a few miles from Christchurch is where most of our boys spent their spare time.  The place is one of the high class seaside resorts of England, & is swarming with girls & very nice ones too.  I have had a glorious time there & am sorry to leave it.  (I have left my kit with Mrs Onslow of "Teneriffe"- Spring Rd- Bournemouth, as it is likely to be lost if put in the army store.)
