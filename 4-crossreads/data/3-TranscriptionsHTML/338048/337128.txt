<p>Monday 21st Aug<br/>Air line work in morning but spent most of the time doing nothing. It appears as if they do not know what to do with us &amp; are content if we keep out of sight. In afternoon repairing cable but no requisites available. Made ourselves scarce again, remaining mainly in a refreshment house writing letters. Went to Elstow to see Bunyan's church in evening.</p>
<p>Tuesday 22nd<br/>A job has now been found for us, digging dug-outs. Put in the day at this. Rode around Houghton Conquest in evening</p>
<p>Wednesday 23rd<br/>Started a new hole and work solidly at it all day. Sunk 3ft by evening. We work two shifts 4 man each &frac12; hr on &amp; &frac12; hr off. One man picks &ndash; 2 men shovel &amp; 1 man wheels the earth away. Writing letters during spare &frac12; hr. to catch mail.</p>
<p>Attended concert in Y.M.C.A. for first time tonight for stayed for about an hour only.</p>
<p>Thursday 24th<br/>Still digging and making good progress.</p>
<p>Friday 25th<br/>Back <strike>of trench</strike> at dug out digging again. Rained heavily in afternoon so we knocked off and had a bath. You have a bath here in a tub and it reminds you of younger days.</p>
<p>Advised that I go to Dunstable next week.</p>
<p>Saturday 26th<br/>Digging again in morning.</p>
<p>Week end leave starting in afternoon. Obtained good bikes at 1/6 for the week end from people met at the Church instead of 3/6 the usual week end charge</p>
