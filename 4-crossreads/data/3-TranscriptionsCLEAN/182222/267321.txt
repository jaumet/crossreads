quiet about it & dodge the butcher. Sure I will who wouldnt !                                                                                 4 Nov. Awaked from another "crook spin" Nice visitor with cigs, etc Miss Cooper. Singer. rich as Croesus but gone on some blank dashed Belgian tenor so I have buckleys blink him.  Can see I'll never be rich.

Looking back think must have been near death or religion to write some of the rot in this book.
