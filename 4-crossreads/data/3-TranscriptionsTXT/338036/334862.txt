[10th Jan. contd]It may be interesting to describe an Estaminet scene (I have often been delighted to visit to see the fun)     They are not like our Hotels and the villages simply abound with them.  There is a counter in some case where the beer etc is handed over.  You walk in get your drink & sit down at a table of which there are usual a dozen in each outfit.  Then the piano starts & fun commences & more you drink the better you sing.  Style Compre.  At 8 o'clock (weet heure) kick out time comes.
