 Fine &amp; calm. Sighted land at dawn 
 &amp; got into Albany at 12.18 pm &amp; dropped 
 anchor in the Sound. It was a very 
 poor homecoming for the Western 
 troops as there was not a soul 
 to meet them. They were taken 
 off in barges &amp; put into quarintine 
 for three days. We got away 
 again at 6 pm. About 740 troops 
 got off&nbsp;&ndash; over half the number 
 on board. Got a wire from 
 home. 
 Days run 325 miles
