The weather is better again. I am very fit.<br/>Today both Turkish &amp; our own aeroplanes are up burring away in the sky, ours have a square tail [Sketch] Turks [Sketch]. Guns fire all day &amp; night but one gets quite accustomed to it.<br/>In our dug out I can see an old Bully Beef Tin for a Billy, Golden Syrup, with the fat saved from the Bacon for a [indecipherable] lamp, next our gas helmets then a strop, steel mirror hanging on a Bayonet &ndash; and seratim, Revolver Eno's Fruit Salt in a hole in the earth wall, then a towel Soap &amp; Razor &amp; a water bottle with some Rum.<br/>I sit Here on a sand bag &amp; write you ere turning in but will not till I hear from you; all my love from your fond son <u>Frank</u><br/> There in letters gone from Egypt I suspect.<br/>I enclose a <u>good</u> 10/- note endorsed by me as Pay for Gallipoli men &ndash; with love your son<br/>Frank</p>
