<p>Some of the infantry on the other side got knocked about some. They were big shells &amp; had an instantaneous burst. We decided to move camp &amp; had already moved some of our gear to another position (about 1000 yards away) when the Colonel came to light &amp; told us to move right back to our old camp at Lamotte &ndash; Warfusee. We had dinner first &amp; then moved back. Our old camp was taken by Tommies so No 8 was allowed to come over to some Fritz deep dug outs on the opposite side of the valley (facing Fritz) while the rest of the Coy had to dig in. Am over with No 8 &amp; have a decent little place. Fritz shelled near our camp &amp; bombed all round it during the night.</p>
<p>Friday 16.8.18<br/>No work today 'cept clean up &amp; make dug outs for the other officers. Wrote 7 letters. Fritz shelled our camp but nobody was hit. Has been very hot since the push started. Shelled again</p>
