The RSB of the 31st Batt. lost 11 men out of 14, which is a big percentage, about the heaviest of any crowd. I think the machine gunners come next.

Heard this morning that the Austrians had "thrown in the towels" but it sounds too good to be true. Mac and I went for a stroll and cracked a bottle. We got orders to get our kits ready to move off at 2. To dye works, just outside Armentieres, now being used as Baths. After about 2 mile walks we arrived. It is a fine big building, and we lost no time in looking it over. We are camped in a big room in the basement and actually have bunks to sleep on, so we'll take some waking in the morning. There are plenty of clothes in stock, so I can see B. Section going into action the next time with brand new outfits. Things look good to me, the only "fly in the ointment" being the big guns roaring, just to remind us "there's a war on."

Last night the firemen got steam up in the boilers and we were awakened at about 6 a.m. by the squeaking of the machinery, which wanted oiling very badly. No one showed any signs of getting up until about 7. when the voices of girls and women were heard. This acted as an alarm, as everybody got up then to have a look at this crowd we were to work with. There were about a hundred of ?em young, middle aged and old. Some of the girls were fairly good looking, but did not come within miles of our Australian factory girls. They are quite as cheeky though. We had a busy day scrubbing out the baths and getting them ready for business tomorrow. This was a laundry before the war, not dye works and was run by a German firm. It is almost within stone throw of Armentieres which is very much knocked about by the Huns, and this place is, so far, untouched. We knocked off work about 4, then we all had a hot bath and clean change of clothing.
