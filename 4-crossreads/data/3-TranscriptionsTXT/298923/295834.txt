17 June 1918 MondaySupposed to be relieved in 2 more days- one cannot get exercise in the Trenches-  Among reptiles around us is a lizard that makes a noise like a Cabby driving his horses or a Bird, I thought it the latter for a long time-  great collection of immense Scorpions Tarantulas etc:-  All hands fit & well so far;  one man shot a hare another a snake-  Jacko is busy wiring his side & so the days pass-  We stand to arms at 0320 or in Australian language  20 minutes past 3 in the morning, it is light then the days are long & hot but nights fairly sleepable.
