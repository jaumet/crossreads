<p><u>December</u></p>
<p>The camp is in an awful state, There does not seem to be anybody in charge of affairs since the revolution has upset things.</p>
<p>When I was last in Soltau camp you could not see a speck of paper blowing about, But now there is heaps and heaps of rubbish laying around everywhere. A lot of the barracks have been pulled down and the timber used to light fires to do our cooking with.</p>
<p>Sickness is very prevalent in the camp, Two Englishmen died yesterday with the Spanish Grippe or Influenza.</p>
<p>Last night the 10th I went to see the morning pictures, The show is inside the Camp enclosure and is managed by a German. It was the first morning picture show that I have seen since I left Australia over two years ago. Inside the building was a notice that ran thus &ndash;</p>
<p>"It is vorbitten to smoking being every infectious and strong" (And also another which ran thus:- "Please take your hat off."</p>
