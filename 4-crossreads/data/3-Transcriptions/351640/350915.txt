<p>The Labour Party had a decisive win in Queensland.  They rule the roost throughout Australia, except in Victoria, if I remember aright.   Time will rectify all.  Beeby will be sorry that he has left them.  Yes Mr. Finney is the best in business matters, he will direct you better than any of the others.</p>
<p>Many thanks for all the information in your letters, the now fill up all the gaps and keep me well informed.  Daily do I thank God who made you fair that He has made you so good my dear.  The early morning hours are with us in Egypt, the constellation Scorpio is turning on his side, so I must to bed to brighten up for tomorrow, then I shall make reply to the letters from Joseph and Kitty.  Good night. Good night. Good night.<br/>[Lines of Xs and Os.]<br/>Car. Joe. Kit.</p>
<p>Joseph dear:<br/>You are good girls to make an outfit for our Kitty that she may be well fitted out when at Maitland.  It is one of the greatest pleasures of my life to note how kind and loving you are to each other happiness of life for you and me depends not a little upon the consideration which has at all times been shown in the best of sisterly ways amongst my four girls.  God bless you all for it, and He will.   He made you fair and He has made you good also.<br/>You will be more pleased and better off if you let my room.  You can safely let it for two or three years because this war is not likely to end for a long time, every one here is not settling down to a prolonged struggle.  Personally it looks clear to me that the German will win all along the line during this summer and that our side will not be ready to command success till next summer, by then the British nation will have waked up its shoulder will be to the wheel and great efforts will be put forth to recover the lost ground.   What will have become of France meanwhile?  One does not care to contemplate   It is more than probable that she will be but a German province.  You do not ready in the papers such prophecies as would parallel such thoughts.   Their fulfilment is much more probably than you wat of.  The self conceit of our empire people has led us into a sense of security which is not.  The prolonged training of the Germans may just be about to assert itself, and if so we must temporarily go down, and with us the people allied with us until Russia pulls herself together &amp; becomes well enough recovered to again put up a fight.  It is sad to have such thoughts, and let us pray that they will prove but to be the fancies of a too vivid imagination.   The grip did not hold the sheet.</p>
