Roam up the village street in evening. Such a desolate scene, not a house left standing either burnt down or blown up, all trees etc. cut down or hacked about. Fritz even levelled every telegraph pole, cutting them off about 5 ft from the ground with some explosive systematically smashing every insulator with a hammer. The local church of Beugny (this village) he left in absolute ruins, blowing it sky hight.
'Tis reported that the last ground of the 4th Div. has been retaken. Great victories reported round Arras thousands of prisoners many guns.
