3/8/19 - Cape Town Chemnitz
Much smoother but all the same too rough for church parades. Cold. We left 20 absentees at Cape Town. Carried out an inspection of the whole ship and found too many men down below in the decks. A following sea this afternoon and the wind drives showers of spray all over the ship. A dull night.

6/8/19
