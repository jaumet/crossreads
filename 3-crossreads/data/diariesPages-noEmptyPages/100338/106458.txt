Wilsons address to Congress on the 8th of January last, and his other addresses given earlier, As a basis to Peace negotiations.

Germany is also asking for an Armistice with the Allies on Sea, Land & air.

It is my opinion that if peace does not come this time, it will only be a matter of a few months before we completely smash the German Armies in the field. The majority of the German people believe that this is the end, The people at home are well nigh starved & the moral of the troops is weakening every day. Foodstuffs are very scarce and what there is of it is very dear.

The rations allowed are 7l;bs of Potatoes per week, 500 Grammes of black bread per day, Meat can be bought at an enormous price, one day per week for three weeks of the month, The fourth week is meatless. 500 Grammes or 1lb is allowed for every adult that is working. Persons not working and children, cannot purchase meat.
