<p>19/12/17 Kortepyp<br/>Another hard frost. Supervised the work of our N.C.O.'s school of instruction and found that they are coming on very well. Devoted nearly all the morning to trying different ones out and testing their words of command. The ground remains frozen as hard as iron and more slippery than glass. Crouching over hot stoves indoors and then going out into the cold gives us all colds. Ordered the issue of an extra blanket per man today out of our regimental store. During the afternoon drew up some recommendations for the Croix de Guerre Belge. Stewart went on leave today and Bourke came back from hospital. Half holiday this afternoon &ndash; the Band played and a football match was on. Padre to lecture on "Rome" tonight in the Church Army hut. A cloudless chill night.</p>
