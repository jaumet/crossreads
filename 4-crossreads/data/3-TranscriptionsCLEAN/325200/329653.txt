  
 Dueidar 2nd November We reached this delectable spot this evening about 5.30 pm. And now I am in bed writing by the light of a very inadequate moon. Used as I am to this business now of making camp still even now I am influenced by the sort of glamour which is undoubtedly attendant upon a brigade of cavalry    entering    advancing . The noises both of men  &  horses  &  the place lit up like a gin palace by countless twinkling fires - the whole effect is decidedly picturesque and - to use an Americanism - it "gets" you sometimes.
