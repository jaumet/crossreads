  
 March, 1916 Saturday 18 As soon as dinner was over, at the invitation of several Scottish Horse Sgts, I went to the Army International Football match on the E.S.R.I. ground After a pleasant convivial evening we turned in about 11.30 pm. Shortly after 1 am it started raining & came through our roof wetting us unpleasantly 
 Sunday 19 Spent best part of the morning drying clothes & blankets & mating a permanent shelter out of some timber we pinched for the job & a wp sheet. Have a high tea w/- dad & go to the pictures.
