I was sent to the Supply Column to relieve another chap who went on leave.  I had about five days in Desves & then the German offensive started on 21st March. I still stayed with the Supply Column & we did a good deal of work with rations shifting from one place to another  We went from Desvres to Waton in motors, camped with the rations alongside the road from there we went back to Sercus on 24th  After awaiting movement orders so went to Steenburck entrained from there to Doullens about a six hour ride  We moved from Doullens to various points the A S. C arrived at a village named Behencourt  after three days
