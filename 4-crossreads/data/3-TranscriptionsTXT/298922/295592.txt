 Monday 8th October 1917 
 Halted at  VOGHERA  after travelling all night, had a wash &amp; breakfast. It is a great struggle to get any rest as the carriages are full &amp; no sleepers. We get Army Rations issued, but buy CHIANTI, eggs, etc. &amp; a very good sparkling wine SPUMATI which is cheap. 34250 LIRE go to the English pound. At  TURIN  we halted for 2 hours &amp; went to the town, bought a bird &amp;  bottle  for tea. The Alps are all around &amp; covered with Snow, a pretty spot &ndash; Electric train from here.
