<p>Thursday April 10.1919   151<br/>[Shorthand transcribed as follows]. 10 day of the voyage.  [end of shorthand] This morning is again hot. It is very close and stuffey between decks. I could not sleep last night for coughing, so paraded sick &amp; the M.O. recommended me to sleep on deck.</p>
<p>The ships course was altered this morning to about 8 degrees East of South. I saw several schools of Porpoises, numerous sharks and flying fish. The Southern Cross can now be plainly seen. It is a very pleasant sight to the home coming Aussies. It can be seen about 600 miles N. of the Equator.</p>
<p>Today has been very hot, and it is also hot tonight. Fortunately there is a cool breeze, but  between decks it is like an oven.</p>
<p>There was another concert tonight, also a boxing match.  There are several whist and Euchere Tournaments on board also draughts and chess!  In the draughts I won two semi finals, but lost the one for this deck which means I will not be in the final.</p>
<p>Friday April 11.1919.   (152)<br/>The heat is very intense. It was hot all night</p>
