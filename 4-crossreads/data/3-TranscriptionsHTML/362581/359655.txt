<p>France 3.6.17</p>
<p>My darling Eddy,<br/>I have a Candian Officer &ndash; A Flying Corp one in my ward. He was shot by the wicked Huns but is doing well   &amp;  was able to bring his machine to the land safely, also in our own part. We see lots of Planes   &amp;  Torbs [Taubes] flying about, but don't like them when they get busy. Heaps of love   &amp;  kisses. Hope you enjoyed Auntie Etta's birthday.  From Auntie Eadle.</p>
