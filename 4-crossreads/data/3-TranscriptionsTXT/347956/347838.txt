services of a guide, hired a motor-car for 10/- to run us out to the pyramidshad our photos taken sitting on camels  they cost us 4/- each for two photos & had the Sphinx & Pyramids for a background.  I enquired for Morgan Welch but saw no one that knew him.  Came back to Cairo & had a bath at Shepheards Hotel & dinner at the Obelisk (4) had a fine days outing & climbed right over the pyramids & it is a pretty stiff climb & arrived back in camp on the 10.30 train
every night one of the lads that sleep in this tent come home drunk & want to fight the rest.  fortunately Stan & I sleep outside & enjoy the arguments without taking part in them; & the best of it is the same men only get drunk every 3 or 4 nights & they take it turns to break the monotony
