to how to cross the Rhine as railway passengers, which was || valuable information to us as the German Government, having all the bridges guarded used to regard it as a better means ef keeping the prisoners in Germany than a line of sentries.We also acquired information as to how the border was guarded at the particular point we purposed crossing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we were fortunate in was this- there weresix of us attempting the escape and we intended going in parties of threes but there was only one compass.
