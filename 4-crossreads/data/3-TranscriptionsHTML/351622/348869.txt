<p>Mac &amp; all my comrades in the infantry who will be taking part in that great charge across No Man's Land. Worse even than Verdun.</p>
<p>4 August 1916 Fri<br/>Started work again at 12 oclock in the receiving room. Wounded have been pouring in all the afternoon. They are quietly dressed &amp; pushed off to the Casualty Clearing Station where they are attended to in better style. To-nights' the night for our Division the 2nd is going over the parapet in hopes of taking the Ridge. My thoughts are of Jimmy Ronny [text continued at top of page]</p>
<p>[Note in margin]<br/>The past seven days have been the most exciting of my life.</p>
<p>5 August 1916 Sat<br/>Worked all last night on account of the number of wounded coming in. The boys were very successful in their charge &amp; took the German's first &amp; second line of trenches. Plenty of wounded German prisoners passed through our hands. Poor beggars that seem glad to be captured &amp; werent they hungry. Amongst the wounded was Toby Brerton &amp; Sgt Hill although neither were of a serious nature. Slept all the morning starting work after dinner. The division is expecting to be relieved to morrow for a rest &amp; to reorganise</p>
<p>[Note in margin]<br/>Bombardment 15 minutes. 9 p.m.</p>
