  
 to sleep on my own; whether there were snakes in the thick grass I didn't much care; I was away from the noise and roughness of the camp. 
 April 1 Drill - visit Dr.Garavedien; he is always delightful. 
 Apr; 2 Good Friday. Studies. Visit Cairo - terrible happening in the Wazir quarter; there has been a row between the natives and their troops; many wounded, two killed; this sacred day has been well celebrated.

 Apr; 4 Easter Sunday.  We are kept in camp , as the Cairenes have a Fete Day on; if "the boys" got amongst them there would be trouble. 
 Apr; 5 To-day in camp has been like hell - great gusts of wind which blow the sand into the eyes, the nose, the throat; almost suffocating - sand, sand , sand everywhere. I break camp and visit Garavedien, during which time picket entered the Doctor's surgery and ordered me back to camp. My God! What a manner in which to finish perhaps the last days of my life - I have offered my life for my country but it seems to me they have also taken my liberty - such is the military life. 
 Apr; 6 Soon we shall be upon the battlefield - I pray God that I shall not be wanting when we are under fire. 
 Apr; 7 Drill - visit Cairo
