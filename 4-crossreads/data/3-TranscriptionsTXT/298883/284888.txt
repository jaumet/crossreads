Many refugees from Amiens and Abbeville are living with their children in filthy hovels being dependent on the inhabitants here for practically everything except I believe bread.  Many of these poor people are extremely ill and our Doctor has d already a very large bakshee civilian practice.
This village abounds in apple orchards, the fruit of which is being gathered by the people for cider making.  They are good eating nevertheless and better still for pies as every one in our mess can testify.
