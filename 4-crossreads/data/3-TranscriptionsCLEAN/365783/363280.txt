  
 Westland & his brother in law can then go over it with the fork & get out & burn as many of the blackberries as they can. The ploughman must be careful of the new fruit trees & of the three little jacarandas in the corner near Miss Cripps tennis court. He should also not interfere with any of the little gums that you would like left. I think one of the first things to do is to take down the remainder of the paling fence; it serves as a harbour for the pest; when taken down it should be stacked in a place where the blackberries are not likely to grow. The strip of ground between the tree plantation and the fence should also be dealt with at the same time. I have no faith in chemical eradications.
