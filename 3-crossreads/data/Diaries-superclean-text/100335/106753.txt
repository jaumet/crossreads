in different parts of the Boat, which helped to pass away a very monotonous time on board. A Diagram of the Course the Boat was taking between Durban and Fremantle was displayed and it gave us all a surprise as we all thought that our course would be straight across the Indian Ocean, instead of which a Course was started East by South East for 10 days which brought us to the South of St Paul Island instead of North, also a line was drawn each day shewing how far we had travelled each 24 hrs and it caused a lot of discussion how far we were and when we would arrive at Fremantle. After we rounded the Island which was last Saturday Morning our Course was altered slightly to East by North East bringing the winds more to our rear and making the Boat more steady and pleasant, and which gave the Sports Committee a chance to resume the Competitions likewise a chance the Dancing amongst the Married Folk, Wireless Communication from Australia direct, also Durban and several Transport's en route to A Australia was established and Messages were received from the Troops at 10d per word and several Messages were sent by the Boy's to their Relatives and Answers received. My Chum and myself sent one notifying our Wives we would arrive on Sunday Next, this was in case the Authorities did not do so. As we are now only 3 days from Fremantle certain duties have to be performed.
