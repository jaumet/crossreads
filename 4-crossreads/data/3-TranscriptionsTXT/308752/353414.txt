January 31st1917 Another quiet night, the Medical Officers do their best to keep any patients until day-light as they know that carrying stretchers in the dark in this severe cold climate is no pleasant task, of course if any cases are serious they must go on immediately. We were certainly very lucky as snow was falling heavily all through the night.  At 3 a.m. we were awakened, all made sure that a stretcher case had come along but fortunately, it was a chap who was sick, we soon put him between the blankets & kept him in our dug-out till morning. The poor fellow was delirious all night, I think he is in for an attack of pneumania. In the morning another rush occurred, as it was a clear day Fritz observers must have easily seen our troops moving about, shells were bursting all over the place. It is about the worst shell fire I have yet experience. It was absolutely marvellous the escapes our Bearers had. We all thank God that we were kept safe. (I could write about six pages of this terrible day, but I think it better to wait until I return & will then tell you all about it). At 5 p.m. the relief arrived as this was our seventh day. The walk back to camp was a long & weary one, I was dead beat & very often I fell off the slippery duck boards. Arrived at camp at 7 p.m. & enjoyed a good hot dinner not forgetting the rum.
