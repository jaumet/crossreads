<p>The breaking up at last of the "Irish Contingent", a bottle of Champagne &amp; some cakes &amp; a final supper with my other great friends, Madame &amp; Mdlle. St. Armand &amp; to bed late.  My last night in Rouen.</p>
<p>10th Oct. &ndash; Tuesday<br/>Awoke at 7-30 a.m. and after saying good-bye to Madame &amp; Mlle. St. Armand, &amp; a touching farewell it was for me.  I shall never forget the many kindnesses of these fine little people.  On arrival at the office with all equipment more of the usual delay &amp; we were put on to work until 12-30 p.m.</p>
