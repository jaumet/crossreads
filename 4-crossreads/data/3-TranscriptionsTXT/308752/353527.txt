Christmas Day 1917.Christmas Service, held in marque, rather enjoyable & impressive, I played the piano for the service. The dinner was a great success, plenty of poultry, vegetables & plum pudding etc. The Sergeants acted as waiters & plenty of good hearted chaff took place. Still I could not help noticing the slight depression of all, the fact is only too true - everybody is sick & tired of the war & we have been altogether too, long away from our homes. However we must look we must look on the bright side of things & "keep smiling". In the evening a concert was held which was much appreciated by all present but it was jolly cold sitting in a tent this weather.
For the third time, since leaving Australia our cheery Christmas season is with us, & though the world is in great trouble & sorrow we shall forget our troubles & celebrate the occasion with all the old cheerfulness & as many of the old rites as our circumstances permitted, in this small village, in which we are billeted. We drank to success in the New Year, and a speedy return to our friends & fair ones in that wonderful land of sunshine & wattle. For a while we forget, the grim duty which called us away from home & enjoyed ourselves.   Of course our thoughts turned to our loved ones, during the festive season.
