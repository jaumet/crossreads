 Our Mountain Home. 14th September 1915. 
 Dear Ruby, 
 Just trying to write a few lines, not that I have any more news to tell you &ndash; but just to try as far as possible to get a letter home as often as I can. 
 We are still in the same place and still O.K. though most of us have not been too good lately.  Think it must be the change of climate and the hard tucker.  For my part I have been pretty lucky. 
 It is getting very cold here now and think we are in for a very cool winter.  Warm clothes are pretty scarce.  One could also do with a couple of good fairly solid books.  Something to argue about.  One gets a trifle tired of playing cards, which is practically all we have to do to fill in spare time. 
 I received your first two letters in Heliopolis, but have not heard from home since, though there have been several mails in.  Expect I will get a lot in a bunch. 
 I was very pleased to see by a stray paper the result of Australia Day.  I only hope they never have to use any of the money on me. 
 Remember me to Mr. Rose.  I will write to him when I can think of some more news. 
 I wonder if you could find out Frank Eather's Battalion and Brigade.  If he is still here I would like to look him up. 
 This letter seems to be a list of requisitions.  I still have another one.  Send over some writing paper and envelopes.  I mentioned this in the last letter I wrote to Father, but just in case he forgets.  I had to cadge these sheets.  Chocolates and cigarettes ought to carry well through the post.  Address as per usual to Egypt.  Think that will be all I want for the present, though I daresay I will be pretty lucky if I get any of them. 
 I'm sorry my letter is not too interesting but will try and do better next time.  Will write to Western Australia this week or next, also Charlie. 
 Love to all at home, Your loving brother, Pte. 1280 Roy Richards.
