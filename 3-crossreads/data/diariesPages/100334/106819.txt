has been cancelled and after Sunday next no more leave whatever will be granted to the Boys, All the boys are not pleased "not half" of their early Departure for home, we are all tired of this life and want to get home to our Home Folks in Australia. I hope my next record will be our departure from here so now I will close until then. 
Thursday April 10th.
I have been off duty since Monday and my turn came around to work again, as we only have three Engines out daily, we have plenty of time off duty. My work this day was on the Vrow Shunter working up at the No 2 Aerodrome, Royal Air Force, it is over three months since I was up at this place I noticed a vast difference, The work as far as the Railway is concerned is just about done with, all the large Hangers or Shed's were almost empty of Material although a large number of Motor Cars of all sizes and in all sorts of condition are waiting to be shifted.
