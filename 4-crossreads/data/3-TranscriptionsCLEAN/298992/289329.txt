  
 following you, and till we dropped to it, we found it very embarrassing having some few score of urchins & grown men too chasing you wherever you went. 
 We finished our ride about 4.30 & went to the "Pagoda" a large refreshment house in the main street, for a cup of tea. And such a cup!!! I have never tasted nicer tea anywhere, and coming after the tack we are used to on board it was delicious. I bought Hazel a small bracelet & posted it to her before we left, I would like to hear if she got it when you write again. It will do for her birthday. She might give Dorothy the silk scarf & Wilga the necklace, just a small remembrances of my visit to Colombo. 
 I got back on board about 6 pm, & many were the envious glances cast at me by the other lads who had to stay on board during the whole 2 days & nights we were in port. We sailed about 12 that night for Suez & should get there in about 10 days. We are now 2 days out
