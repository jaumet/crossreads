  
 place, they were firing their guns so fast at times that you could not count the report from one ship let alone 6. they kept this up for hours but they failed to get old "Beachy Bill" for just before the finish Im hanged if he didn't have the cheek to fire back at the warships, Beachy must have been in a pretty secure place to defy those naval guns as he did. Old Beachy would have a go at anything, they reckon he was in a steel & concrete gun pit  & had rails to run up on when he was going to fire, & the recoil from the charge would drive him back & he would run to some other hole & let go at them.
