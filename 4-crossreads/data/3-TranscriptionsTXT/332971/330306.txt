but with a twinkle in his eye said that "Since the rebellion there was a stronger body of them than ever" and I do believe he was one the way he seemed to enjoy pointing out the ruins.  In Sackville St theres a grand statue of D. O'Connell with his Compatriots untouched of course, a little way further down is a Memorial to Nelson.  A charge of dynamite was put under this - but discovered before any damage was done & although they tried hard to destroy it.  Only the nose was blown off - Further down again is the fine memorial to Charles Stewart Parnell & on the side his Statue and his finger as if pointing to the people these words are written below -  No man has nay right to fix the boundary to the March of a Nation - No man has any right to say to his country.  Thus far shalt thou go and no further.  We have never attempted to fix the ne-plus ultra - To the progress if Irelands Nationhood - And we never shall;  In the afternoon we go for an hour's tram drive by the Sea to here the Inland of Irelands Eye.
At 9pm we are in Belfast.  And on the Station to meet me Mr Thompson & my nephew - I try and not think of tiredness and sit up until 2am talking - I feel so sorry to curtain my stay with three kind friends when they invited me for the fortnight - but I feel I must See Scotland and Can't be persuaded.  Mr T takes a holiday from business next day & Takes Rose & I around first to the City Hall - and beautiful it is too with its sunset marble Halls.  Next to the Museum & Art Gallery & thence to Robinson & Cleavers - the great Manufacturers of Irish linen - We are shown over the works - The other Sisters are there too - Some of the things are esquisite - the daintiest of handkerchiefs ranging up to ?10 each.  We are shown a sample pattern of the Royal train that the ladys of Belfast presented to Queen Victoria.
