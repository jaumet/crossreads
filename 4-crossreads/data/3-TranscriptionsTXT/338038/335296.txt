 I came over in the boat from England with Maurice Ferguson from Jerilderie &ndash; He has been through a school in England &amp; has just got his commission &ndash; was surprised to hear he is married and the proud possessor of a son &amp; heir, ten days old! He married an English girl when he was on leave from Gallipoli last year. 
 Also had a strange meeting today &ndash; Was out with a company for exercise on a route march, and was talking casually to an Engineer officer who was with me. And he turned out to be a Darbyshire, nephew of Aunt Laura &ndash; He seems a very nice fellow indeed &ndash; 
 I will wind up  with this short note for the present. There is absolutely nothing in the way of news &ndash; 
 Your loving Son Terence W.Garland
