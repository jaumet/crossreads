This one has <strike > too</strike> four rooms with a sort of hall between, it also had a window to each room, but the order of things being reversed <strike>they</strike> the doors &amp; windows were facing the enemy.<br/>The view from the pill box which was in Glencourse Wood, was desolation itself, over to our left was a low stretch of country, every yard a shell hole, &amp; here &amp; there a pill box, these were still in enemy possession, every now &amp; then our shells would burst near them. I saw some terrible sights in this front. Our lines led up to another pill box about 400 yds ahead &amp; from there to the other coys. There were no system of trenches, the men dug in, in the side of shell holes, during the day nothing was done.<br/>On the evening of the 25th we moved back to the Half Way House as it is called, the 53rd &amp; 54th took over, &amp; half an hour after they took over, a shell exploding just in front of the pill box, pieces flew in through window &amp; door</p>
