 Battery W.Lines. near Pont Noyelles. 12.30 am Came off shift relieved by Scottie Malcom. Weather delightful, pleasantly warm. Had customary swim. Met Alex Francis who is off to a "poisoners" school at Pont Remy. He's in luck right enough. Bombs during the night and a few shells. Fritz having a little "stunt" down south near Soissons &ndash; seems to be successful, Rheims fell to the Hun today. He is up against a large body of troops.
