<p>This evening Jock Mackie &amp; I went down to Hqr's to see Len &amp; while there had a game of cricket, our match had to be put off this afternoon for we had no ball fit to play with.<br/>As I write this we are having a sort of sing song we have got a cornet or two going &amp; an E. flat bass, we started off with the old familiar songs which never seem to grow old, &amp; we are now on some of our favourite hymn's. As I write this the boys are singing "The hymns of the old church choir" I think this is a very pretty thing. Weather is fairly dull &amp; warm.<br/>26th. This morning we had bayonet fighting with our gas helmets on, they are a horrible thing to wear, it nearly makes you sick for the first time or two, your throat gets real dry &amp;</p>
