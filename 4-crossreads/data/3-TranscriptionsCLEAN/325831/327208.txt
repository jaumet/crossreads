 We are in this show  to win , & having her hand to the plough Australia  cannot turn back . 
 This war is the best thing that has ever happened to Australia. She is now a  Nation  recognised by the whole world, & what Country was ever yet any good that had not fought for its Nationhood. The price in manhood is high, but the game is worth it. Unfortunately so many of the best have gone & the worst, "the Nosers" are sad to say left behind to breed the future generation of Australians, but thank the Lord  All  those who have come here are not going to be killed & their influence must be felt later on. I must say I was a bit surprised at the Soldier Vote, but the matter was not properly explained to them, & the Union's raucous voice reached them even here. Some politicians addressed a few  after  the Vote was taken. 
 In London I was speaking to a lady, the wife of a NSW squatter, & she told me her husband & all the Station voted "No" because if more men were sent away the labor trouble would be increased; that already they could not get sufficient labor to take the wool off the sheeps back.

I succeeded a most distinguished Indian Army General (Sir H V Cox) who has gone to England as Military Adviser to the Secretary of State for India. My staff consists principally of British & Indian Army Officers. One of my two A.D.Cs is a son of Mr Justice Ferguson of Sydney. I am very happy indeed in my new Command but the responsibilities are of course enormously increased, but you know I never shrink from responsibility, though I realise what a difficult matter it is to follow such a distinguished & experienced a soldier as General Cox who has served in all parts of the world for 38 years. 
 Basil will soon be a Major. He is at present doing a Commanding
