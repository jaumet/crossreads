21/3/18 Red Lodge
On our right last night the 5th Bde tried to get at the Boche in a raid but did no good. On our left two officers and an N.C.O. on a special reconnaisance were run right into by a party of 60(?) Boche and utterly routed them by point blank shooting with two revolvers and one rifle! At least, that is the story! A very quiet evening and we dined happily in our mess where "A" Coy ?
