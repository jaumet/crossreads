 [Sunday 20 August 1916] 
 All the boys in the Hospital come &amp; see me &amp; we fight Romani over again,  they  know who squibs it &amp; who plays the game. All are getting over their wounds well- but are indignant at the idea of going to a RAMC Convalescent Hospital instead of Australian.  All the East of Suez Canal is quarantined for CHLORA,[cholera] so no one can get leave from there.  Went to Church in Pyjamas &ndash; as before a Chapel is part of these Barracks.
