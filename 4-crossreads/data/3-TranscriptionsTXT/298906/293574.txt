I like the idea of knocking about without stripes you see & hear some funny things at times, when in France I rarely wore stripes, it was nearly 3 months after I was made a Sergt, that I put them up at all & Major Jacobs told me to put them up then. This morning the whole of the Battn was reorganised, all Coy. Commanders were called out & then all senior NC.O.s Capt Pearce ("old Tubby") asked Capt McGregor if he had any capable N.C.O.s & for some unexplained reason he said yes "& mentioned my name so Capt Pearce sings out at the top of his voice Sergt Barwick, now thought I what the devil is the matter
