<p>Husband is a Trawler Skipper but has given up the sea for about 10 months now.  He is having a spell.  He is well off &amp; 2 years dodging mines &amp; subs. in the North Sea is enough for any man.  I had a feed of Crab.  The first in my life &amp; it was tres bon.  The old Father &amp; Mother are still alive &amp; hale &amp; hearty.  They have been married 59 years.  The Dad still works at His trade piano making but really only like John Caswell, He won't give up.  He is 82 &amp; real grand old Yorkshireman.  I had a lovely time.  I intend to write to Mrs. Horner as soon as I can get the time.  Jennie</p>
