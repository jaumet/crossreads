A hard frost which presented a sight beautiful and remarkable. The whole world was glistening white ? the trees were outlined with icicles in every twig and looked like a lovely pattern in white lace. A narrow road runs along the front of the camp and the view looking along it is fine. The cold is intense and the men had to be kept moving. Had a muster parade and got a fairly smart turnout except for the cooks who are incorrigible. "D" Coy's went on a sort of mild strike so we pushed them all back to their company and put new men on. I inspected the lines and found them fairly good. Our N.C.O's class put in some work on handling the men of their company. They have made good progress. Two companies marched off to baths at Papot and I went over to a farmhouse close to here and had a bath in a tub. Madame
