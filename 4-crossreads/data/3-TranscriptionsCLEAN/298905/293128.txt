  
 to go to the stretcher bearer's he is going from there to the A.M.C. The weather is still keeping ideal. 22nd  We played the return match yesterday evening & this time No. 10 turned the Tables & beat us by 5 run's. To-night another chap & myself took up a collection for a cricket set for our platoon we got enough money easily. Last night Len & Holme's were up again & after the match we had a rubber or so of bridge. This morning on parade they called for volunteers for a raiding party, & nearly half the platoon stepped out, but strange to say they would not take old Anzac" men, we were disappointed but nothing could be done for it
