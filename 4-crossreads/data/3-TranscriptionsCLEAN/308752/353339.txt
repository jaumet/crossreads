  
 Monday 15th May. A big surprise sprung on us today, we were given squad drill for a few hours. The heat today is terrible. 
 Tuesday 16th May. Inspection held of the camp today by the Deputy Director of Medical Stores & A.D.M.S. Great preparations are being made for a big move somewhere, sincerely hope is out of Egypt. Weather most sever, it must be close on 120 in the shade. The dust & the flies are also very unpleasant. 
 Thursday 18th May. On account of this severe & most oppressive heat the Division were granted a holiday. It was even too hot to go for a dip in the Canal. 
 Friday 19th May. Instruction & training in carrying wounded to & from some abandoned trenches. Very interesting work, quirte a change from that monotonous stretcher drill. 
 Sunday 21st May. General inspection of 8th F. Amb. by General Mackay & the A.D.M.S. All formed up in review order,  with all our transport in the rear. Stood like a rook for about 15 minutes, all marched out in column of route, the General noting our marching etc. he sent in a very satisfactory report on the inspection. 
 Monday 22nd May. It has been decided to hold big Divisional Manoeuvres today. reveille at 2 a,m,    Marched out of camp at 2:45 a.m. returning again about 9 o'clock. The attack etc. was very unsatisfactory. 
 Tuesday 23rd & Wednesday 24th May. More inspections etc. All this must surely mean that we will soon be making a move out of this hellish country.
