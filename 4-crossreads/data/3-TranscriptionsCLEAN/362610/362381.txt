Wednesday 14 June 1916Steady rain during the night & in the early morning, conditions underfoot being execrable.Lt. Cullenward returned from leave. An extremely quiet day, very little firing taking place on either side. A fair NE wind in the afternoon together with a little sunshine dried things up considerably & by evening it was fairly pleasant, though cold. Visited by Lt. Newth & Lt. Moy during the day, & also by Arnold Hazlewood who came along from B Co to have a yarn.
