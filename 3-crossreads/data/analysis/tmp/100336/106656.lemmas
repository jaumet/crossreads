 veri serious , as it meant that we could not dive . Our onli chanc was to come to the surfac and go back full speed on our engin as day was break and we were liabl to be seen and fire on from shore . Howev our luck was in . We arriv at Tenedo 8 a.m. 24th April 1915 . We immedi had anoth coupl fit after which we had a trial dive to see that all was well after which we anchor and wait patient for the night . At 1.30 a.m. 25th April , we got under way to attempt the Dardanell again . We pass the patrol destroy at the entranc and proceed about 5 to 6 mile insid the entranc but we were fire on from the European shore , a shell pass just over . The searchlight were veri activ both from the fort of Chanak and Dardanus , so we dive immedi . All went well this time , and noth was heard till we came to the first mine field . Here we were alarm to hear the moor of the mine scrape along the outsid of the boat . This was veri unpleas but still we knew we must be quit safe at a depth of 90 feet . Short after we pass the minefield we came to the surfac and show our periscop to take observ befor enter the narrow . This was about 5.15 a.m. and the water was like a sheet of glass . We found we were about 150 yard off the European shore and under the main fort of Kilidbar they soon notic the wash from our periscop and commenc to fire on us . We soon got down to 90 feet again and , on a slight differ cours , we soon pass through the second minefield just below Chanak . All went well and when we came to the surfac at 6 a.m. we were right in the Bay opposit Chanak . Here there was a battleship lay at anchor and a gunboat under way , we we immedi prepar to attack but owe to the fort lower down have report a submarin approach there were a number of small craft torpedo boat launch , etc. , dash about to tri and ram our periscop whenev we show it and it be veri calm made attack veri difficult , not be abl to show the periscop for ani length of time . Howev the foremost torpedo was brought to the readi and all prepar were made to have a shot at the battleship , but at the critic moment the gunboat was cross in front of the battleship as there could be no time lost we had to fire at the gunboat . We immedi went down to 60 feet . All was silenc for a few second and then a heavi report concuss shook the submarin and we knew that we had secur a hit . At this moment we were alarm to hear a grate nois forward and we soon knew that we were aground . We went ahead and were soon off . This happen on the Asiatic Shore . We then proceed slowli , think all was well but not so . We had onli been off 10 minut when we ground heavili forward . The depth gaug show that we were rise fast . When we were near off , the boat stuck fast aft . The boat was lie at an angl , down by the bow and there was onli 8 feet of water show
