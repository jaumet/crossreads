<p>Dear Girl<br/>I landed all right &amp; sent a letter card to you. It was hot, wet &amp; slippery in Sydney &amp; on G. Island &ndash; I went<strike> there</strike> at once to GI &amp; reported &amp; had lunch there. I then paid my mess bill up to Dec 1st &amp; went to town. I went to Anthony's &amp; bought your few things which I hope you &amp; Mab will like &ndash; I think Mab's hatbox is A1. Green I think looked even better than the brown &ndash; It is 22 ins square &ndash; The tumblers you will need &ndash; also pepper pots &ndash; I had a strenuous aftern. I tried to get &ndash; "The riddle of the Sands" but could not &ndash; you might send it to me if practicable &ndash; I got Bernhardi's "The next  war" to study &ndash; I had dinner &amp; to bed early &ndash;</p>
