Got 3 nice new white blankets & a hammock this evening so am set up especially as I have a good place to hang it.  Have a fair amount of space on each side of me & being right opposite the hatchway get some fresh air.
Sunday 23rd
Had an execelent night.  The hammock is just the thing to sleep in.  It has been rather a wet windy day not very cold.  Passed quite a lot of ships & steamers.
