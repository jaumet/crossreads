<p>Juillet 11<br/>No. 2 Section driving piles for a wharf on the Somme Canal. It is likely that there will be a hospital established there if we finish the wharf.<br/>Nothing of importance to mention except that the Russians are still making good headway in their offensive.</p>
<p>Juillet 12.<br/>Working on [indecipherable] class bridge on Somme Canal today. Nice fine weather. British had a set-back of 600x on 1400x front on Belgian coast &ndash; losing about 2000 prisoners to the Germans. Intense bombardment levelled the defences, including some of the bridges on the [indecipherable]. Russians reported still doing well.</p>
