<p>11-12-16<br/>Mon 11th<br/>The Anzac Troops took a pack horse in today for canteen stores &amp; we had Mr Frost with us for dinner. An enemy 'plane came over about dinner time &amp; had us standing to our horses, she dropped 3 bombs 300 yards from the 3rd Regt lines but did no damage, she was too high for accuracy. Snowy Wride returned from the School of Instruction today &amp; reports a good many batteries of Artillery &amp; Scottish Infantrymen on the road out. The Infantry march from Kantara to get fit, they march on wire netting rolled out along the desert &amp; it makes a very good road to march on. The gunners at Mazar boast they scored a hit with the third shot yesterday damaging the tail of the 'plane.</p>
