<p>Dearest Mother Father &amp; Little Doss<br/>Have had no mail landed here from Australia for two weeks so expect your letters tomorrow or day after. I am still like the Old Johnie Walkers 10 weeks &amp; still going strong.<br/>I did not have time to write last week as I was picked out to take charge of an outpost picket &amp; reconnoitring party There were twelve men It was the job to find out if you are the right stuff or not. I was on it a week. Out of the original 12 men I only had 3 left at the finish. It was night work &amp; they had 2 hours on &amp; 4 off Some lasted a day some only one shift, &amp; a few ten minutes. They would say get another man in my place this is too solid for me. Then I would have to send for another man.<br/>What made it like that for them, a couple of days before I took the job over (you are only on this job for a week) a couple of Turks were shot dead at the posts. They were calling me every five minutes &amp; saying they could see them creeping They would not be satisfied until I would go up &amp; look, If what these chaps suffered from is called nerves thank Heaven I dont suffer from them.<br/>There I was all the time anxious for a few to come &amp; these rotters praying they would not. Damn it a lot of them ought to be ashamed to call themselves soldiers The knocker came a few days after we had been on, The Major wanted someone to take 5 men out &amp; examine the gully I was sure it would fall to me , &amp; I was right. I dont know how many he asked before me. I just said right Oh. But when I went to pick the men, there were a hell of a lot felt sick. At all events I got five &amp; we done our job well, but did not have the luck to capture a couple of Turks, worse luck</p>
