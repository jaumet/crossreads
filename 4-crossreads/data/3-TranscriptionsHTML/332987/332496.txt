<p>Weather unsettled.</p>
<p>20-9-1918, Roisel<br/>Just heard that Lieut. Delaney, one of my old mates, was killed by shell on the 18th-9-18.  We are camped near the village of Roisel.</p>
<p>21-9-1918<br/>Great stir up last night.  6 bombs fell in our lines.  Two horses wounded.  One, the Major's charger, an original horse, was so badly wounded, that he was destroyed.  The other horse, Lieut. Gates, was wounded in rump.  One bomb in particular, made the largest hole I ever saw in the bomb line.  About 20 feet across, and 10 feet deep.  Our guns were also bombed, two men casualties, Gr. Haliday and Izzard A Sub.  Guns out of action.  Saw an enemy plane come down in flames, one of our night scouts got him.</p>
<p>22-9-1918<br/>Warned to proceed to Australia on leave at 7 a.m., move off at 8 a.m.  Went to D.A.C. Head Quarters.  Left there at 9-30 a.m., went to Peronne in G.S. Wagon, now</p>
