<p>Company billets and Cook houses were inspected by Battalion Commander and found quite satisfactory.  An Order received that all returns in future would be rendered to Battalion H. Quarters.  A daily guard of 1 N.C.O. and three men was detailed to be mounted over Limbers.  This was found from Section for duty, 4 men being detailed, the best turned out man being excused sentry and acting as Mess Orderly for the Guard.  This practice considerably increased the smartness and appearance of the guards turned out.<br/>Notification received from Battalion of vacancies on Battalion H. Quarters staff and asking for nomination to fill same.  During the afternoon Company paraded as strong as possible at Battalion Parade ground where Battalion Commander spoke to men as a whole.</p>
