<p>Hall were numerous bays, each of which would accommodate a small congregation, with an altar, and lighted candles on either side of the altar. Other things of interest were the massive organ, and the beautiful windows at the head of the Church.</p>
<p>After a few more days' stay at Fleselles, we marched onto Ribemont, the marching to which, taking a good day. At Ribemont we prepared for the trenches and left for Fricourt Wood, marching by road and arriving at Fricourt Wood the same evening.</p>
<p>It was snowing very heavily all the time we were marching, with the consequence we spent a most miserable night camping. Though I felt very miserable and tired out, I could not resist visiting an old mate of mine, whom I knew had a dug out on the crossroad. This mate of mine was at this particular time, corporal of police on point duty in Fricourt Wood, and he was possessed of plenty of cigarettes and good food; needless to say I came away from him full of gladness and cigarettes. I had a sleep for the remainder of the night and next morning we marched, at times knee deep in snow and mud, to Ginchy where Australians were in action.<br/>We took up our position in the Needle Trench (in reserve), and stayed there two days. All the while it was raining heavily and we were standing in water, and even had to sleep in soft vet mud as there were no shelters of any kind in the trench. While in this place we only had a few casualties and one killed. I was picked one dark night, among a party of others to go back a little further to a camp, from where we did fatigues with the engineers and pioneers up in the front trench. We used to tramp along duckboards in the teeming rain a good five miles up to the front line, where we used to help repair the front of the trench and make shelters if possible, with sheets of iron, for the men who manned the trench.</p>
<p>On one particular night we went up to the line for the purpose of digging a trench in No-Man's Land. After wading through mud waist deep in unused trenches, we arrived at the spot where we were to go over the top and creep along in the wet mud, until we reached the exact spot where each one had to entrench. Each man had a certain measurement allotted to him to dig, and if everybody dug his part successfully the trench would become joined and finished.</p>
