<p>bread bags at 2/9d each. In the first place none of ever saw them. "They are not worth 2 &frac12; d each let alone 2/9/ Anyhow the unanimous &amp; rather decided answer is <u>we won't pay for them</u> .Naturally a deficiency is inevitable &amp; would have been paid for only for the way we were treated. The Chief Steward has the matter in hand &amp; all the men want is to bring the Chief Steward along &amp; judging by their tone he had better stop away. The officers say it <u>must</u>  be paid or it will be docked. When they were confronted with the high canteen prices, short weight in jam etc &ndash; all they had to say was "Don't know anything about that "&ndash; No, they don't know anything like that. Well the question simply is that the men refuse to pay &amp; the money cannot be stopped legally &amp; moreover there will be a far greater shortage in other ways if they do so.</p>
