<p>You can now stop sending me luxuries &ndash; old girl &ndash; Please don't do it any more &ndash; I have everything I want now. Another case of food &amp; an enamel plate from Graham. I gave him 30/-. A plate will be a high luxury &amp; will signify the grandeur of the C.O.</p>
<p>Owing to the censor work being too heavy on Capt. Smith, I am going to relieve him of some in the morning so cannot write more this mail.</p>
<p>Burdett &ndash; Tinson &ndash; Lawry all O.K but G.H. of Tumut away sick (8 officers absent altogether.) &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
<p>I did not hear how Clark got on with his appendicitis. Gibbs of Warrawee is well. Holliday's Bulletins come regularly &amp; are very much prized. Have lots of writing paper now &amp; envelopes. Have not seen Graham this trip but had letters from him.</p>
<p>I hope plenty of young men are enlisting, they seem to want plenty of pushing out. I think they will all be needed &amp; wish there were a few more here &ndash; Enclosing some yellow lupin seeds of wh. there are such lots growing here.</p>
<p>22nd<br/>I often wonder if you get the photos I send you from time to time or have they been confiscated.</p>
<p>Your letters to me (just arrived) show you had letters from me from Alexandria. 4 leaved shamrock from Kit &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; Would like to see Phil in his soldier jacket. I did not get any tobacco from the Sun fund &ndash; nor con's socks &ndash; nor chewin' gum. Don't worry about more.</p>
