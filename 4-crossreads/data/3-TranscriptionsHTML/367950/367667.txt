<p>This is really written in part on the 19th and I thought being as this is a journal of a private nature and concerns myself and my signallers and the regiment I thought that a biograpahy of the characteristics and description of these men of mine might not be out of place. It may prove interesting I don't propose to devote too much space to each man otherwise I should soon fill the book . So firstly we start on the senior n.c.o. (1) Corporal C. Cameron No 859. Good and particularly smart at his work when the spirit moves him but horribly easy going when it doesn't , Well educated, very even temper in fact no temper at all which must be expected from a man of that temperament. His principal hobby, shorthand and German. We twit him about learning the Hun language but he says it has a fascination for him (or [indecipherable]) rather forgetful at times which is decidedly embarrassing to him (and me) Has that characteristic Australian fashion of bending both ankles over when standing at ease which looks unsoldierlike</p>
