15/4/17BullecourtWent down and saw General re some obscure details in operation orders. Rain fell during afternoon and the whole place is muddy. Our heavies caught Germans massing at Caen. Big bombardment of heavy guns before tea. We have had a number of men killed and others wounded today, and the doctor has been busy. Wounded Huns still arrive and are devils to groan. After tea went up to firing line and discussed plans with Bunning and [indecipherable] in their dugout. While there Thwaites came up with report that 50 Germans were coming up at our left flank. Prayed to God it was true being ready for a scrap but I could see nothing there. A party of 9 attacked Gawler's post this morning and left 8 dead. Altogether a day of fights. Coming home we got lost and rambled a long distance out of our way. Found AMC congested with wounded on stretchers. No sleep for two days. Hope for some tonight.
