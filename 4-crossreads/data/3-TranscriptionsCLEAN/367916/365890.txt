I take it the [indecipherable] gives you any news about me that I sent her. I can't talk of couorse about the things I'd like to. Signals is all my life at present Jack.
France7th July 1918.
Dear Judge,Very many thanks for your letter dated 29th. April and the cable forms which all arrived O.K. I must tell you right away Judge, that the chocolate has been arriving O.K. all along and that I can't thank you enough for it. I have written you of this but I suppose the subs play up a bit with the mails.
Our knowledge of dates etc are so vague that when we are told a certain mail has gone down we haven't the faintest idea what letters we wrote that were about that mail.
Life is flowing along in fine
