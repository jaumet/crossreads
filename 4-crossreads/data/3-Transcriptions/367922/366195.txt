<p>My Dear Fry<br/>In these sad days we cannot console one another, we can only try to borrow some of our dear boys' courage &amp; fortitude to enable us to face their loss. They have done with sorrow, they have left us proud memories, &ndash; some day I think there will be consolation for us in that.</p>
