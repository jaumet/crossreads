<p>word came through one of the most popular men of the Unit &ndash; Cpl. Cosier was leaving the Ambulance for good, to take up the position as Chaplain in England. The opportunity was then taken of giving him a little farewell.  This took place during the interval. Light refreshments were served out &amp; L/Cpl. Murphy D.C.M. made a <strike>small</strike> short speech on behalf of the Unit &amp; bade Corporal Cosier all sorts of good luck etc. &amp; a speedy &amp; safe return to Australia. Cpl. Cosier responded.  At 9:30 the tournament ended &ndash; Pte. Roberts J. winning the first prize, Pte. MacGoldrick gained the 2nd prize &amp; last but not least &ndash; Sgt. Curta, who was honoured with winning the "booby prize". A vote of thanks was passed to L/Cpl. Murphy, Ptes Peake &amp; Colley-Priest for the successful &amp; enjoyable evening.   No definite programme was arranged for Saturday evening but, fortunately we were in lucks way, as a "Digger" arrived from a certain Battalion who could play the piano very well. A small dance &amp; sing song was therefore held &amp; a pleasant evening was spent.</p>
<p>"The Recreation Committee, conveyed their thanks to Pte. Peake, for his many kind acts in procuring comforts &amp; material for the Recreation Room. Quite a number of football matches were held during the week, &amp; as usual we came out on top. Rugby League, Australian Rules, &amp; Soccer were indulged in, we have a good team in each</p>
