  
 [Post card - cartoon of a German soldier asleep in very basic circumstances with mice crawling over him and dreaming of a woman coming to him carrying a tray laden with food.  The following words are printed on the card:] Ich Traumpt von Kuchen Bieru Schinken; ein Holdes Madchen tatmir winken. Doch ach ashatten unterdessen Die Ratten mir das Brot gefressen. 
 [Roughly translated I think: I dreamed of cake beer ham; A fair maiden waving at me. But alas meanwhile The rats have eaten my bread.]
