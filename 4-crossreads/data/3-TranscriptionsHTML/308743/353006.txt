<p>26 July 1915<br/>Monday 40 wks from home</p>
<p>We made a demonstration this morning at 8 am to try &amp; draw the enemys fire but they are up to the dodge now &amp; only fire as long as we do. The new brigade of arty is doing splendidly C baty has accounted for 4 guns at least whilst the other 3 btys have made havoc of gun emplacements etc of the Turks. On duty practically all day &amp; went for a dip after tea, visited 701 &amp; watched as pretty an artillery duel as one could wish to see between our guns on the right &amp; the enemy's at the foot of Gaba Tepe, then troops were observed moving along the road accompanied by cavalry &amp; transport 6 guns (3 field 3 How) got on to them &amp; made excellent practice their bursts being very effective , after dark they gave attention to the beach &amp; threw over about 20 or 30 shrapnel then the gunboat engaged the enemy on the S of the Lake also shelling the gun now in position there Aeroplanes spotting effectively<br/>27 July 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>The Turks have changed their garrisons again &amp; tonight we are to try &amp; draw their fire by a somewhat lengthy programme. The Turks have shelled the beach continuously all day &amp; are doing a fair amount of damage. I went for usual swim at 1400 &amp; combined QMS duties with it &amp; drew all the stores needed from Ordance. The Turks are giving us a new bomb a huge un about 9" in diameter &amp; are hurled by a catapult gun which has an effective range of a mile. Trawlers very busy all the afternoon chasing a submarine but without success. Nothing doing down at the Cape, no movement of our troops visible at all. Press reports that we have taken the offensive again at last. as it is very evident that they dont intend to come at us again so we will have to go for em. The condensers made a start today &amp; are filling the local reservoir first, then the drop reservoir further up the valleys. [indecipherable] to be retained.</p>
