Sat Dec 6th:-278 miles of bad weather.
Sun Dec 7th:-We are making a course to go around St Paul &amp; Amsterdam Islands. 307 miles up to midday &amp; weather OK.
Mon Dec 8th:-312 miles today &amp; also maggots in the prunes they put to us for dinner. Of course there was no uproar.
Tues Dec 9th:-300 miles (dead reckoning). We are in the centre of a rainstorm. Hostile demonstration against the adjutant &amp;amp Colonel of ship. Missiles flying &amp; I must say some of the women are straight shots.I expect to see the adjutant's name on the next casualty list under the haeding of:- "Died from a bombardment of rope quoits, uncooked potatoes &amp; decayed fruit."At any rate he was posted "Missing" for a time after &amp;  the beloved Colonel carried out a strategic retreat.
Wed Dec 10th:-294 miles in wet misty weather.
