  
 about the end of March or beginning of April.  We have been working very hard the last few days digging, we are always doing something of late & we havent been amongst [indecipherable] for ages consequently there is very little news to tell.  I am hoping to get some Paris leave before long.  I will try & take a trip down to Havre & see May at the same time.  At present we are living in little dugouts
