[Continued from next page]We have just been out on deckWatching manly couples  peckAt each other with a pillowSwaying with each stormy billow
We are glad to be at lastMidst our own compatriots eastCuspidors & toothpicks banishedBossy, saggy trousers vanished.
We have not been asked our ageSecond name or hopes of marriageHaven't even had our stewardAsk if seasickness is cured
Captain Phillips is so jollyTales part in all youthful follySuch as cricket on the deck
Poor old Nelson H. DuvalPronounce it so's to rhyme with "call"Accompanied by James B. HaneySaw us off, altho' 'twas rainy.
Nelson H. sent P some rosesIn what capacity he posesIs evident in little waysHe called 5 times in 7 days
