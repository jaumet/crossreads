 My dear Father   I received your letter of 12 Dec also Mothers postcard written in the train coming back from Sydney on 30th Nov.  I am very glad to hear all the news of how well home is progressing and am so glad you used that money of mine till the shearing money came in. I wish Father that you would keep on using it, as it would be much better helping to carry on at home, and better for me too, than its just lying idle in the bank. So do please take it and then the Corriedales will be all the better when I get back, and I'll have done a bit more to help to establish our flock than I have done so far. It is awfully nice to think of us getting hold of James's and it seems a great idea to rent it until next year when you will be able to buy it after the shearing money has come in then - we will have a regular Station then with Wilson & sons Corriedales. ch[?] what Fred is some class with his crown lease and being able to convert it to CF[?] & CL[?] make it a lot more valuable, does it not?  What is the original value on it, somwhere about 16/- is'nt it?  Will you be able to get that piece of land inbetween your crown lease and James's? If I could get those Werrobil flats as a Returned Soldier's block...
