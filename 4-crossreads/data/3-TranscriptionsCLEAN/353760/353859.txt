  
 February 22 181. Dull, and fine faltering rain, cold and a little wind. 
 Mail brings Ralph Hodgson's "The Last Blackbird" and "The Bull", a Flying Flame Chapbooks.  If "The Down by Moonlight" were the only poem of "The Last Blackbird" it would be worth every penny of 4/6, it suggests it is almost the inspiration piece of his "Song of Honour". 
 Also Christmas "Land and Water" - W & N sketch book - a most abominable specimen, and six Venus Pencils from Mrs. H. for which Dear Mrs. H. a million thanks.  Now I'll be able to try hard a lining of Lyttle's fascinating face. 
 Basil and self were last night yarning of the fascination of faces.  I asked him to name two of the unit who still lacking perfect features, held in their expression and manner a beauty lacking in the remainder.  Almost pat came his reply, "Well Lyttle certainly! - and Macdonald!" 
 Letter from Gerald:  in Blighty Act. Adjt. at some Aerodrome. 
 February 22, 23 Loaned Clarrie's "Guy & Pauline" - half read, but reading Maarten Maarten's "The Price of Lis Doris". 
 February 23 182. From early last night till just before dawn heavy gun fire beating - and a fire that ended in a terrible roll. 
 In the evening's mist with Basil to Bailleul:  the great square beautiful with its fantastick tower lording its grey openness.  To quarter moonlight its loveliness would be full. 
 Spent there about 10 F. in Magazines for Rec. Hut - from "Gheitz" money - and B. sends this morning the remainder - about 1.10.0 to London for Musick. 
 183. Now thanks to a slack morning, I've written to Mrs. H., Aunt Louie and to the Poetry Bookshop. 
 184. In "Aussie" No. 2 - the first published drawing of Frank Dunne - a caricature of Sapper Smedley of "The Sentimental Bloke". 
 Drawings Frank shewed me yesterday are evidence of the enthusiasm he's put into his work, but he fits well in cartooning.
