<p>4 &ndash; of course you would cable for me if you or Father was ill &ndash; and I could probably get home on transport duty. But I hope you wont be. I wonder so much about Willie and Gibson.<br/>I have Mother &ndash; your precious New York photograph on my table. The only photograph except some snapshots. I have had all the time &ndash; in my tent in my hut - &amp; now here in Cairo. Your ever darling, loving face &ndash; always inspiring and comforting. It's an awfully sad time &ndash; all the Australians are moving &ndash; but we dont know where to. Both the other general hospitals are going, we stay here they say till August. I'll Cable if we move but I shall not know where to.<br/>Please give Bill &amp; Edith &amp; children my love. I'd love snapshots of them all. also of Constance &amp; her family. I'd like - a Saturday Herald &amp; a Wednesday Telegraph if you have time to post them. I got all you sent before. Devoted love to you my precious Father &amp; Mother.<br/>Ever your loving daughter<br/>Beth McMillan</p>
