troops going on leave to Blighty. It was a huge building consisting of four or five stories and served the purpose very well indeed. We were each issued with three blankets and three boards to sleep on.

We were all too-much excited to sleep well that night.

Nov 26th. Sun.
Marched to the wharf and sailed from Boulogne at 9 a.m. arriving at Folkestone at 11 a.m. There the leave train was waiting on us and soon we were speeding our way to Euston Victoria, London. I was a bit unfortunate and had to stand in the corridor all the way. Drove in a taxi to Euston and arrived there about 4.30 p.m.

The train for Scotland was due to leave at 8.50 so I whiled the time away waiting on the platform. I got settled down after a good deal of difficulty and had to stand or lie in the corridor of the train nearly all the way from London to Scotland, not a very pleasant experience, but worth all the trouble to get home for a few hours.

Nov 27th. Mon
Reaching home about 8.45 feeling a bit tired out.

The thing that struck me in Stirling when home on leave was the scarcity of young men and the predominence of women.

Went to the pictures in the evening with Jane.

Nov 28th. Tues.
