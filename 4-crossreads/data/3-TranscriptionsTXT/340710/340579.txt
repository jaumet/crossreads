Victor at the Estaminet.They sat in the village inn- Jean, Gaston, Pierre and Leon all soldiers of Class 48 of the French Republic, also there is Victor but he is in the garb of a civilian, but only because he is the father of eight children and has not yet been called on for service.  Victor sings little snatches of song, both Sentimental and patriotic, to his comrades and when he starts to sing the inn immediately becomes silent and attentive for his voice is very sweet and impulsive.     In the middle of one of these songs, some khaki-clad figures enter- Australians- and Victor stops and invites them to join his table and this invitation is readily accepted
