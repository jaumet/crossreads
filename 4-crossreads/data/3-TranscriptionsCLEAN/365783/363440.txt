  
 However you are on the spot & have much better opportunities of judging what is best  that  & I have no hesitation in saying I leave it to you hence the part of my cable "decide yourself"   Whatever way you come when you get here you will have a very hearty welcome to Egypt.   I hope my cable was perfectly clear to you.   When you come bring plenty of cash - I reckon to get a nice suite of rooms for you at the Continental; you will then have time to settle down & decide how you would like to live over here.  I have been looking about for a nice small house with garden close to the place where our hospital is to be;  (and it is one of the nicest districts in Cairo) there is also within 100 yards of our hospital a nice lot of flats;  but I will decide nothing till you get over here & you can choose what you would like best. Before you leave let me know your boat & your port of destination - I could probably arrange to meet you at either Port Said or Alexandria.   In regard to Trix, let her do whatever pleases her. Au revoir dearest old woman with best love to all, Yr Loving husband 
 Will.
