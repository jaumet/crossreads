<p>A lot of the men were terribly sleepy on the return journey. The sun was hot and we were heavily weighted with our marching order. For my part I know I had my water bottle (full) Haversack with rations in it. Bandolier with 90 rounds of ammunition waist belt with bayonet and four pouches with 50 rounds in them making 140 rounds all told. a pair of field glasses a Telescope and a prismatic Compass. We reached Camp about 3.30 p.m. Thoroughly tired out. But it was an experience</p>
