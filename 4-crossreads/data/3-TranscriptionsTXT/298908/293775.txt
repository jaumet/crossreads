 Have had Grano with me this afternoon putting him wise to the job for he is taking over from me whilst I go on leave. Drew &pound;8 yesterday that will have to do me for this little stunt, I am going to go easy &amp; save up for my "Aussie" holiday which can't be far off now.  A lot of the Sgts. are boozed tonight having just been paid &ndash; poor mugs. Last night Graham &amp; Brainwood came over to see me about 11 oclock, I was in bed consequently got pulled out thats a way we have of greeting one another, pretty rough but very effective I might inform you.  I am going over to the O.T.B. tonight to see Graham he is going to France on Saturday night so I shan't see him perhaps for some time again for I expect the next time we meet I shall be in Australia.  Lindsay &amp; I have been good mates &amp; I hope he gets through alright.
