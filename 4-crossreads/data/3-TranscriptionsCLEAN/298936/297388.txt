Two doctors in place of one left at Melbourne one a Lt. Col. the other a Captain who is now very sea sick.
Found that Capt. [indecipherable] put a good word in for me & now I am in full charge of Hospital with rank (temporarily) of Corporal. Possible it will be confirmed later. I hope so anyhow. I am much better off than I should have been with Hospital Unit for I am getting splendid experience.
I have men in hospital
