I just missed seeing Caesar in town at the end of July and have heard nothing of him lately. From indirect enquiries made just about the time of the attack on the Hindenburg Line I heard that he was well and back with the 56th. They had a rough time I believe with other battalions of the 5th Div. but I sincerely hope that he came through it all right.
While we were at Tincourt about the middle of September I ran into the Hq. of the 1st Bn. and saw Jack Mant. He was very well then & hoped shortly to go on leave. Of others I have no news for although we were workg. with the Australian Corps for six weeks in Aug. and Sept. we were always so busy that I didn't have a chance of looking people up. Even the several meetings with my young brother, in the 3rd Div. [indecipherable], were - except the first one - entirely chance ones.
Looking back now over the past three months I feel very glad that I got over in time to take part in the final series of allied victories. It was a very interesting time, though strenuous and often extremely uncomfortable. Our actual line of advance was one of the deepest for in about 14 weeks we journeyed from just East of Amiens to just west of Avesnes. It would take a long time to write even a small portion of our doings and experiences and I'm afraid your letter would be even further delayed, so I will indulge no further in retrospection.
The great question now - assuming that all hostilities have ceased permanently, is how soon one can be released from service with the forces, and what one is to do when that has been accomplished.
