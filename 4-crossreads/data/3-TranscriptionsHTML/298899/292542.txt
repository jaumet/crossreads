Retracing our steps we crossed the Rue de Rivoli &amp; passed through the Jardin du Palais-Royale where we saw Sir Douglas Haig having a constitutional. We gave him the salute. We then visited the Church of Notre-Dame des Victories, a pilgrims resort. The Place des Victories contains an equestrian statue of Louis XIV.

In the interior the Chapels are decorated with beautiful paintings</p>
