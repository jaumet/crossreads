13/9/17 Steenvoorde ? Abeele ? Reninghelst 
While it was still dark the transport had commenced collecting packs other gear. After 8?oc breakfast had some coffee served up by a smiling mademoiselle. Moved off at 10 in column of route and joined the Bde. column at 11 seeing the General there. The roads were congested with many marching troops and a lot of transport. Our march carried us right along the Belgian border. Pulled up outside Abeele for traffic delays and then marched right through forming up for lunch the other side. An aerodrome here was very busy. The hop pickers were industrious sitting among the vines picking the flowers. They use long poles for detaching the plants from the wires overhead. Marched on through towards Reninghelst having long tiresome delays owing to blocks in traffic. Met billeting people. Passed enormous shell dumps with niggers Chinese laborers. Made Camp at 4.45. Met General at 5 and arranged to go up to the front in the morning. Roar and gunflash tonight.
