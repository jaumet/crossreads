 news is told us that we one of the men who left our vessel at Hobart had been taken ill and we were all suspected contacts of small pox. 
 But a word about our beautiful Harbour.  It is a veritable paradise;  a gift of Nature of which we may well be proud.  It is the only Harbour I have seen for 31/2 years. 
 We could appreciate it more, and rhapsodise at greater length, only for the thoughts of North Head!
