20th  T of E.T. Exam.An episode in France I call to mind, when at Armentieres, as soon as we arrived, the first few days we opened a pretty heavy strafe.  Consequently in retaliation the Germans lobbed a good number on the town.  The estaminet keepers were frantic and ran about saying "Australians No bon, No bon, plenty bombard.  Finish Couchez"
28th  Left the school with a first class pass for musketry & Lewis Gun.
