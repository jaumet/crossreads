<p>1915<br/>July 11 Sun.<br/>Attended Evening Service at All Saints.<br/>Heard the British Military Band which plays <strike>even</strike> on Sunday evenings in the Esbekieh Gardens.<br/>Saw a couple of Battalions of Australian Infantry marching through Cairo streets, returning to camp after a route march &ndash; all wearing the shirt &amp; short pants.<br/>The Australian troops look far more tough than the other Troops &amp; better fighters &ndash; but they lack the discipline of the others. - Physically they are far superior to the "Tommies". The N.Z. men appear to be good all round.</p>
