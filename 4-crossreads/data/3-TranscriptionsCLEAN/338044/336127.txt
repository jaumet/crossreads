  
 4th Dec. Saturday &  we have the afternoon off. I determine to visit the Citadel    &  wend my way there, per tram about 2 pm. Arrived outside the walls I first enter the ancient  & large mosque of Sultan Hassan. On the walls are still visible the holes & even cannon balls where Napoleon bombarded the Mosque & city. this mosque is over 600 years old    &  is considered very sacred. Its dome is the highest in Egypt. Cost over  3,000,000 to build. One huge door inlaid with 22 ct cold & copper  is valued at  17,000. Sultan Hassan's tomb rests in the inner temple, where is also a red flag stone marking the spot, on which he slew the Mameluk. We noted the huge Koran book & cupboard, the Coronation chair (ancient) & Sultans pulpit
