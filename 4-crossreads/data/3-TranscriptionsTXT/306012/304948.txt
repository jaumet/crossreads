 times a day in beautiful weather &amp; no work to do.  The night bombing was the only uncomfortable feature.  We went up to the A.D.S. in cars, through Hamel &amp; Cerisy, up to main Amiens-St. Quentin Rd.  The place we took over is a captured Fritz field hospital and is full of German stuff - uniforms, helmets, gas masks, equipment, drugs, books, bandages.  No lack of souvenirs. Was off colour last night &amp; to-day but am feeling better to-night. 
 Tues. 3rd Sept. We did not reign long in our position on the Amiens-St. Quentin road opposite Harbonnieres.  The Ambulance after being A.D.S. for a couple of days became M.D.S. and then closed down as the line moved forward.  We remained inactive for a couple of days during which time I made strenuous efforts to get my correspondence up to date, washed some clothes &amp; had a look over Harbonnieres.
