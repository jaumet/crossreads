  
 Tuesday 21st November 1916. Revielle 6 a.m. & freezing wether too. Make a move with those heavy packs on our backs & cam at [blank] Wood where some very heavy fighting took place in July last. The camp was a home when compared with our last home whilst working in the trenches. The arrangements are more suitable this time, although the tree Ambulances are working together only one Amb. Will go out to the trenches at a time. This proves that we are on a quiet portion of the Straffe.  We ill work 48 hours in the trenches & 4 days doing fatigues in camp. Watched an exciting air duel today. Fritz's plane was brought down. We are well off here, a Y.M.C.A. & an Australian Coffee Stall are close by. A mail arrived at last after waiting 3 weeks for news from Sydney. 
 Wednesday 22nd November 1916. Fritz rather angry sending shells round our camp & dressing station all day fortunately no one was hurt. Met Capt Ward again, he is doing good work here & has arranged a Coffee Stall at the beginning of the Sap. He is well liked here. This weather is too cold to be living in tents so two other chaps & I fished round for timber etc. & built a comfortable shanty.  It contained a fire place, & we possessed 7 blankets between us.  It was very cosy,  we also had a primus stove which I pinched. Peter Kemp & Frank Woodwood are my pals in the "Braemar" Shanty.
