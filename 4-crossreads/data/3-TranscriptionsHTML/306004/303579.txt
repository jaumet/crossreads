<p>29.10.16<br/>distance swimming race, across the Canal &amp; back &amp; the same lad proved a winner again  Then a team from the 1st Regt played the machine gun Sqdn football &amp; scored a win (6 to 3) followed by another team from the 1st Regt playing a team from the Field Ambulance, again scoring a win (6-0) Stables this afternoon was postponed till 4.30 in consequence one of the best days sport I have witnessed; There appears to be a good deal of doubt now as to whither we shall leave here or not for a few weeks; The weather is now perfect &amp; we are not at all anxious to get back on to the desert in a hurry</p>
