<p>1919<br/>March<br/>snowing again.  We had had a draft ready to leave for some time, but owing to labour troubles over in Blighty they were unable to get away.<br/>April 2<br/>However on 2 April the draft went, Jimma Bruce going with it.  The same day our Battalion marched out.  Were were to go to a suburb of Charleroi &ndash; Marcinelle Haie.  They were to stop the first night at Thy-le-Chateau.  Corporal Ryan was put in charge of the packs, &amp; as I had a bad boil on my back I stayed with him.  The packs were all stacked in the square, but the lorry did not turn up until late.  An old woman, whose house faced the square gave us afternoon tea.  By the time we had the lorry packed it was dark, so we went around to a house where the Corporal's mess had been.  Madame was very pleased to see us &amp; gave us tea.  Her husband  was a worm.  He sat in his corner &amp; said nothing.  As for Madame, she was very kindhearted, but was a dirty slut of a woman &amp;</p>
