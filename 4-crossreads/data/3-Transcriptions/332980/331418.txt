<p>doors &amp; skylights on the Station &amp; Signal Boxes have been Smashed, there is very little doing there all the Traffic passes through to other parts, As the Passenger Train continued on to Colone I left it at Berguette &amp; after a wait of about 1 hour I caught a Light Engine &amp; returned to St Omer in time for Dinner. I must not forget to mention that all the way to Berguette the land is under cultivation the same as other parts &amp; worked by somebody.</p>
<p>Wednesday &amp; Thursday 10 &amp; 11.<br/>I went the same way &amp; came back on light Engines, on Thursday 11th the engine was a French one driven by a Frenchman &amp; a very large Engine at that, having four steamchests &amp; Cylinders. The Cab where the men work is very large &amp; the parts are strong, being in different positions to our Engines, &amp; the Fireman uses a lot of Water on the Coal &amp; as it is very fine Coal he makes it into a paste &amp; with a long handle shovel puts it into the Fire in lumps, &amp; now &amp; again in goes a Pricker &amp; he draws it through the fire several times,</p>
