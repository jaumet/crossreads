  
 all day unloading lorries & getting cases up stairs.  There is more room here than in Alexandria & the mess & quarters are much more comfortable.  The hours of toil have been altered from 8.30 to 1, & from 5 to 7.30. with the afternoons free for sport. Work has increased a great deal  Casualties have been coming in freely & we have also had to prepare copies of nominal rolls so have had to work extra hours for fortnight or more.  I have visited several of my friends.  Called on Mrs Warner & Mrs Rice & have also been out to Briggs several times.  The first 2 or 3 Sundays we had off, but now we have to work on Sunday mornings, which none of us like a bit.  However it gives us a chance to deal with our private letters. I go out to the 14th AGH a good deal as quite  number of 6th LH boys are in there wounded & sick  & I got full accounts of all the recent fighting.
