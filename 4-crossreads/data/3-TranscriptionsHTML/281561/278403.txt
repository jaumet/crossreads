<p>20/6/17.<br/>There was rain yesterday and the final course of the Competition was postponed till today. Finished it off this morning. The verdict was issued this evening. My company won. We are "D" Company 3rd Battalion, the crack infantry company in the crack Division of the finest Corps of troops in France. Some boys us! Returned to Buire this evening. The 1st Brigade turned out and cheered us as we passed through the town. By bringing back the honours to the 1st Brigade we covered ourselves with glory.<br/>21/6/17.<br/>A holiday today resting after our labour. I managed to get into Amiens again. We of the Anzac Corps are supposed to be in reserve to the 5th Army. It will always do me, but I guess as soon as we are fit again &ndash; Hush! Don't wake it up!</p>
