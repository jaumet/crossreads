Friday 3rd
Very hot Had field day, stretcher drill and bandaging. I was lucky enough to be sent out as patient, so had easy time. The label I wore was "Bayonet wound, left thigh" In the afternoon Lieut. Robinson gave us our first lesson in French, which was very amusing, and quite enjoyable.
I forgot to put in Wednesday diary that we had a meeting and elected a Sports Committee Miss. "Lizzie" Payne was elected unanimously as B. Sec. Men's Rep. and later on was elected to the position of Secretary. "She" went with Capt. North, Ross Woodward into Cairo to purchase Sports material. Now he drives us silly, as he even talks cricket and football in his sleep, and leaves his things lying about all over the tent. This evening at tea time, Alec our corporal cook and Pt. Poulton had a barney and Poulton gave Alec a crack. Now he's on tattoo for striking an N.C.O. Bricky had some photo material, so now he's busy again making pictures. The defaulters are on cooks fatigue, and are kept hard at work carrying water and there is plenty being used now as it has to be boiled before drinking.

March 1916.
our worthy sec. being "hors de combat" owing to his missing finger, had to be satisfied with the position of umpire. Woods made the top score 29. Hunt B. got 6 for 11. The best bowling average. Total scores B.Sec. 115, A.Sec. 71. They started a second innings but had to give in owing to failing light. Weather mighty hot, and the flies eating us alive.
