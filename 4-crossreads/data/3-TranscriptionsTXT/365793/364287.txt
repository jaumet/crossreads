July 3 & the City of Weymouth. The background of cliffs stands out clear & distinct against the deep blue of the Harbour. "And it is a perfect day"  From the trees & the hedgerows come the songs of the birds, & some happy youngsters are playing among the heather. Thank God that the children at least no little of the horrors of war!
4 Parade at 6.30, half an hours physical drills & then finish. Listened to the Band outside the Officers mess & then went for a walk with Fred out past the Coast-guard Station & along
