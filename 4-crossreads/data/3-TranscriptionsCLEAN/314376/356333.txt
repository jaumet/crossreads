It cannot be otherwise with the plantations and the various tropical plants which grow in profusion round about the town of Colombo itself. 
 From my observation it is a beautiful clean place well worthy of a visit. The streets are comprised of a reddish soil similar to the composition which goes in Sydney by the name of "Ironite". Geographically it is like Manly when you start from the point of disembarkation and walk straight ahead after a while you reach quite to the other side of the Island which is girt by the ocean.
