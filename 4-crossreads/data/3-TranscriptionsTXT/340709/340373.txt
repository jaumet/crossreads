 141 in the Sepik (Kaiserin Augusta) River. This place is about 80 miles from here &amp; the river itself is navigable for about 300 miles. It would probably take 2 or 3 weeks to properly search its waters even near the coast. We have only one week's provisions &amp; are expected back on Saty &amp; I have therefore decided to return to Madang. It is my intention to call at Sarang en route to pick up Mr. Stillen who wishes us to give him a passage to FdkWmshfn. FdkWmshfn Sun 8th : We left Eitel Hfn at one o'clock on Friday hoping to reach Sarang before sundown. Wind &amp; sea were against us &amp; darkness fell when we were still 5 miles off. As the entrance to Sarang is strewn with shoals I decided to stand off the land &amp; make for Alexis Hafen. The moon rose at about 9.30 &amp; we made for the coast again; we rounded Cape Croisilles at two am. I then set the course &amp; turned in for a few hours sleep. About 3 oclock I was thrown out of my bunk by the lurching of the vessel. There was by this time a tremendous sea running &amp; the "Lili" rolled heavily. The jib was set to ease her &amp; she ran better. At 4.30 we were off Jino Spit when suddenly the engine stopped. The engineer examined it &amp; announced that he could do nothing. We hoisted the mainsail &amp; mizzen &amp; stood out to sea. After beating about for a few hours we eventually entered Alexis Heads at midday &amp; in passing through noticed a large ketch making in our direction. She appeared to be crowded &amp; not knowing what to expect I ordered all rifles on deck. As we drew near she hoisted the Jack &amp; on coming closer we found it to be the "Davapia", a large auxiliary ketch, which had entered Alexis Hfn on Thursday &amp; had been promptly captured by a party of Native Police under Sergt Carlisle. The Major was on board. He had come out to search for us.
