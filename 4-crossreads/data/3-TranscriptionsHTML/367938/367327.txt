<p>at Saltwood. I shld. like to bathe tonight if I can &ndash; as have not washed or changed boots for nearly a week &amp; the walk will be a saviour &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
<p>Have'nt heard of Geof yet. Don't think they'll go to France while we cant move.</p>
<p>We have lots of Regt. funds &amp; now's the time its needed to keep off sickness &ndash; about &pound;450 <u>but cannot lay my hands on a penny of it</u>.</p>
<p>I wd. like to have been with Phil at the march past of the troops going away from Sydney. They are arriving in Alex. now.</p>
<p>The papers you sent have been good reading &ndash; the accts of our splendid position here are however most misleading: now fully understand "still slowly advancing" &amp; "otherwise calm". Cannot say too much except that they hold higher hills than we do &amp; shell our swimming beach &amp; trawlers, &amp; that this unit holds the same ground as the day we arrived here &amp; went straight in to it, except that the snipers who used to crawl along the valley underneath us, are now exchanged for our snipers.</p>
<p>Sgt. Barry of Syd. Sqdn had a periscope glass cut on his head yesterday &ndash; otherwise the lot are still</p>
