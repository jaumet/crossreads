<p>belt [missing] up there [missing] end of the rope I don't know whether the blind man drowned or not he was long enough in the water to be drowned a dozen times.</p>
<p>6 of of chaps pegged out before we reached port said and the Boson &amp; two others from other ships, pneumonia was the cause of most of the deaths the doctor apparently had no previous experience. I was very sorry for him the hospital was full up all the time I was in it for 3 days but I was getting better when I was put in I had a wretched week previous to this I am all right again now.</p>
<p>I got your card written Xmas eve the day before yesterday . I was sorry to hear about the Cox boys. I did not see the notice in the paper although some of the other chaps did it will be a great blow to the old man he thought no end of Mick. I heard to day that there are a great many gaps in the first Brigade very probably some of us will be called on to fill them, but on this subject I know no more than you. This camp is very easy to get out of   the penalties are much heavier if one gets caught, we arrived home 1 hour late &amp; we caught by one of the heads just near our tent  after looking at our passes we were made prisoners at large but nothing came of it  next time we are late I don't think he will get us so easily. I must stop my scribble now  I have no more to write about. Much love to one and all from</p>
<p>your loving son Alan.</p>
