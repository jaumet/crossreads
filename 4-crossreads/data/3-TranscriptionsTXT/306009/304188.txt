 1915 Jan. 2 Sat. Still feeling a bit off colour. Weather  still fine and sea calm. Usually sleep out on the deck with hammock as a ground sheet. Have only slept below first 2 nights on board. We got plenty of tucker but I very rarely have an appetite for it. Have gone right off meat, potatoes, coffee &amp; tea. The meat is sometimes, bad.
