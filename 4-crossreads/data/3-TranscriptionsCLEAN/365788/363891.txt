  
 1st Field Amb. 1 Aus Brigade 1 Aus Division Aus Intermediate Base  27/2/16 My dearest Irene, Yes- I think most of your letters & parcels reach me eventually. Received a letter since I last wrote to you for which thanks. The parcel you mention having sent containing Tooth-brush, soap, camphor & matches has not yet come, but will turn up within a day or so, I expect. Thank you very much for sending it. We got several tooth-brushes & soap lately in Aus. gift stuffs & are now getting matches as an issue
