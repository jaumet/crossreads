  
 Saturday 20 January 1917 
 Regiment gone on Reconnaissance, & stayed in the first time on record. I've missed a Stunt for sickness but gland not too good, making use of time to write some letters, have posted you a Gippy paper re Rafa. [The following sentence crossed through]  I hope you & Day & Dot are now out of the heat for a bit, & change is very necessary & don't worry about me, I'm alright & will soon be marching home again I hope. Did I tell you the simple way the gunners hide their guns from enemy aircraft - simply a nett like a Tennis net or what I had over the fruit trees at M. Any distance up quite a blank & so light & easy to carry.
