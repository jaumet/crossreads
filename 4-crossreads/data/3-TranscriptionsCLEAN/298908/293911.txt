  
 Well I am satisfied that I have not lost all my nerve yet, after this afternoon, ever since I came on board this boat one of my big back teeth has been aching mad, a perfect brute, & my face had swollen badly, I could get no enjoyment neither could I eat nor sleep, so I decided to see a dentist Sgt. & see if he could do anything for me so after dinner I asks him about it & he took me into the dispensary & had a look at the brute, well he said Sgt. we have not got a syringe on board so I can't give you any cocaine, but if you are game enough to have it out without anything I'll do my best for you.  This put the wind up me properly for I had never taken such a thing as this into consideration & I am a regular coward even with cocaine.  I began to turn things over in my mind, & I came to the conclusion that it had to come out & it would be better to put up with perhaps 3 minutes
