<p>Our kit bags were sent into Minia today;  I have been very busy today getting things ready to go away;  I am sorry we are leaving here as it is the best camp we have yet had but we have had a good spell &amp; it is about time we had a little more excitement;  A Sqd shifted to Shusha today &amp; did not like going as they also have notice to be ready to move at any time;</p>
<p>&pound;50 was missed today belonging to the Sqd &amp; suspicion fell on Whitby (a batman), he was searched &amp; an inquiry is being held, Whitby has been losing very heavy at two-up &amp; everyone thinks he is guilty</p>
