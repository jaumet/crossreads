<p>Sunday 16 September 1917</p>
<p>Alex:<br/>[The following paragraph crossed through.]<br/>Had a letter from Dolly but none from home yet. Some of the photos I sent Dolly she returned the Censor having put them through a Bath blotting the whole lot. I hope what I send you are not so treated.. Everyone tells me I'm looking very fit again again, anyway I'm having an easy wait but am naturally very impatient at the delay.</p>
<p>Intend going St. Marks Church near Matron Aly's Club at 10.50 this morning.</p>
