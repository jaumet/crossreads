  
 Saturday 6 January 1917 [1918] On duty evening & Miss Hughes & I fearing she is no gain to our wards.  Matron says I must make her from a 2nd to a 1st class sister but I say no hope, now stuff is not there.  A bad amp. sent in from Kantara - pus pouring away & very "smelly".  Off duty 2-5 & did sewing etc.
