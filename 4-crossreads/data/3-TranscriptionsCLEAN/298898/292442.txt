At 9 A.M. we marched to  for  "Buire" about 4 miles back to take over a rest station being run by the 1st Field Amb. Thoroughly enjoyed seeing my old unit again. C Section running the place so I took  of  over the Dispensary altho' did not do much that day. Had the good fortune to meet Morris on the way down. We were marching through "Dernancourt" when he walked out of his billet into the street. Later he came up to see me & we spent several hours together when I told him all about my trip & how I had left Will etc. It was a great pity we did not do the trip together but it was not to be. Bitterly cold & snow still lying thick.
