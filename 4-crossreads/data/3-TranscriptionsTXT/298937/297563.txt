 Sergt. Horrocks was up here last week, but I can't imagine it to be true, or not Herbert at any rate, for he would have found me easily. Letters are again slack;  have not had any for some time. Went to town again yesterday &amp; met Nobes (I with Molloy). Spent nearly 100 piastres in the afternoon &amp; evening &amp; nothing to show for it. But it was a long time to be at Maadi without going in, so it can't be helped.
