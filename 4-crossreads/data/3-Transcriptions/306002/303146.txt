<p>15.5.15<br/>Sat. 15th.  Last night the 2nd L.H. made a charge on the Turkish trench, but were mowed down by machine guns.  Out of 100 that charged only 45 got back again.  This morning I went for water &amp; decided to look up Morgan Welch.  I had a 3 or 4 mile walk but found him quite well.  It is a rather dangerous job walking down the valley, as we have to pass places in sight of the Turks &amp; 3 men of the 3rd L.H. were hit by a machine gun, just before I passed.  B Sqd. signallers went on duty on the telephone at midday.  Lance Cpl. Crisp of B Sqd. succeeded in bringing one of the wounded lads into the trench &amp; has been recommended for the D.C.M.  About 4 oclock a sniper succeeded in wounding Sergeant Lovett through the leg</p>
