<p>11 p.m. 4 nights a week and then chipping to Mama for a while then leave again 9.30 next morrow is strictly against my principles.<br/>The beastly war goes on &ndash; the Casualty Lists are longer every day.  They say it may end by next Summer.  I hope we will hang out alright till then but sometimes you wonder if it is possible.<br/>We are at present living in the lap of luxury at the Goring Hotel, Grosvenor Gardens.  Tom  arrived from South America on Wednesday last so we went along there to be with him.  No Miss Hamiltons for him thanks.</p>
