being sent from the Base.   Now I will have to advise the Base P.O. of my whereabouts as then perhaps some of my letters will be sent across.   The Parcels never arrived and I do not expect to see them now.  I think that it would be best not to send any.   I can get all sorts of little things over here.  up near the line we have a small canteen for each Batt.  So anyone who wants buscuits of sweets can purchase them there also Tobacco, etc. Pencils "Indelible" are hard to get at times but I have allways managed to keep one.   I had it ever since Pozieres and only lost it in 47 Gen Hos.   I lent it to one of the Canadian Sisters and never saw it again.   However as soon as I arrived here I was able to purchase a fresh one.
