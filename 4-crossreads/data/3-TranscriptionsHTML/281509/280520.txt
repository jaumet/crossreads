<p>1916 October 24<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>Rain &amp; thick mist.  Scratch for breakfast. Fall in for moving off at 9.30. Stand about for 1 hr. Move off slip &amp; slide down hill  &amp; up another, falls &amp; guffaws. Main road. Block off traffic. 5 yards &amp; stop. most tiring, slush &amp; creamy mud. Immense convoys the "pomp &amp; circumstance" of war. Mud bespattered horses &amp; men. This is the side that has no charm. Took till 4 p.m to make 2 miles. Pass thro' Fricourt, Montbaum &amp; Mametz. Camp in Mametz wood.. search for dugouts. Such confusion of holes &amp;amp fallen trees. Manage to get into a warren &amp; make ourselves as comfortable as damp smelly hole would afford. Back to pre-historic times. living in the ground. Beaucoup bombard all night.</p>
