 Anecdote 
 An officer lay between the Australian and Turkish lines wounded. 
 Two Australians saw him from a trench and discussed which of them should go into the fire swept zone im endeavour to bring the wounded one to safety. 
 The toss of a coin determined the choice. 
 He who called head crawled stealthily to the prone officer. Pulling him by the coat sleve he said. &quot;Get on my back Sir&nbsp;&amp; I shall endeavour to carry you to the trench&nbsp;&amp; safety&quot;. 
 &quot;My good man six bullets have passed into me or through me all-ready.
