 Comdr to Brigadier 
 My information was previous to Comdr Beresford. 
 50 men with a flag of truce conducted by a captured German have proceeded to the WT station with the view for negotiation with the officers there for an unconditional surrender. 
 I am sending about 30 black prisoners & 2 white under guard to Australia now. 
 Comdr Beresford proposes camping about three quarters of a mile inland from the pier awaiting result of negotiations @ 1715
