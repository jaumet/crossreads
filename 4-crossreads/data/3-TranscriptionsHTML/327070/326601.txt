<p>morning. The ship's run up to noon was 291 miles.</p>
<p>Thursday 27 January 1916</p>
<p>Air appreciably warmer. Day fine &amp; clear &amp; sea a good deal calmer. Numerous flying-fish seen. Ordinary routine of work, enlivened by an inoculation for typhoid in the morning which gave me a sore arm in the afternoon &amp; evening, &amp; also by a hunt for officers with long hair, my clippers being many times called into play.</p>
<p>Prescott resisted nobly but eventually had a big junk removed from the front &amp; then submitted: he was left with a nice round tuft on his crown. Several of the others also fought, but were subdued &amp; left with lighter heads, two of them having a strip of long hair left from the forehead to the crown. I had taken the precaution of getting my orderly to run over mine &ndash; front &amp; all &ndash; the previous afternoon, but was persuaded to have my moustache attended to by one of the sufferers, with what are declared to be excellent results &ndash; so it is said &ndash; 10 yrs younger!</p>
<p>When we turned up at mess there was quite a commotion, &amp; I hope tomorrow to get one or two snaps to illustrate the causes.</p>
<p>Ship's run to noon was 384 miles.</p>
<p>Friday 28 January 1916</p>
<p>Another fine day with smooth sea. Approach to the tropics indicated by all stewards being in white when we went down to breakfast. Routine not varied during the day.</p>
