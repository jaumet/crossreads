<p>Friday 5 October 1917<br/>Columbo [Colombo] is about 4 days now so we trust.  Our boat goes so slowly one wonders how long it will be before we get "there" finally.<br/>A musical romance held 8 p.m. was only good for the ones well up in all latest "Gags" &amp; comic operas.<br/>Smelling competition 8.45 p.m. resulted in 15 out of 23 for F.E.H., chief faults being sage &amp; kitchen smells.<br/>Crowds of flying fish are to be seen and pretty sunsets but no lights on deck render the evenings long &amp; make "Patience" necessary.</p>
