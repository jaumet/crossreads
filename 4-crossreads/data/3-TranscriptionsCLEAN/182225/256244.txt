APRIL   TUESDAY 4   1916
Who pants & struggles to be free,
Who strives for others liberty,
Who, failing, still works patiently,
He truly prays.
Who, loving all, dare none dispise,
But with the worst can sympathise,
Who for a truth a myrtyr dies,
He truly prays.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Petitions are but empty air
Brave action is the only prayer.
Thus learn to pray.
 
Annie Besant.
