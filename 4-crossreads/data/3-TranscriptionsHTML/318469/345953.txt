<p>is a fairly large village but it has been much knocked about &amp; a good deal burned by shell fire from the Fleet.  There is a fairly large Mosque with a tall Tower &amp; this appears to be intact.  On our way back we had a storm at the "Beach" &amp; while there a shrapnel shell burst quite close to us &amp; killed one &amp; wounded another man.</p>
