<p>noon for reorganisation purposes.  Very short of men, as we have been on the move since 24th of last month &amp; many have been wounded &amp; evacuated sick.  Got our bivvy sheets today &amp; erected a "home".  Rain has now ceased.</p>
<p>23:  Four parcels today &amp; the contents were repulsed with heavy losses by our mess.  N.Z. mounted forced to retire after a hot scrap against a large enemy force at Wilhelmslia ( a Hun colony), infantry also suffered heavy casualties in this scrap.</p>
<p>27:  Taubes dropped bombs on Aust. Div. at Ramle, causing heavy casualties amongst men &amp; horses.  Left Ezdud  8a.m. reaching  Ayumkara (15 miles) at 2 p.m.  Fine Jewish colony, but bread &amp; jam very dear here, 1/- per small loaf.  Town immediately placed out of bounds to men, though officers going in &amp; out at their leisure.  Taubes over using their machine guns at night, without doing any material damage.</p>
<p>29:</p>
<p>Heavy bombardment all this day on this flank, standing to arms each morning at 3 a.m..  Taubes visit our camps every night machine gunning the roads and transport of our column.  In reserve to N.Z. mounted in trenches at Aalebbus.</p>
