rushed into a flock of sheep. These scattered at our unexpected visit fortunately we only damaged two. Bean endeavored to arrange the damage with the herdswoman without success. Naturally she assessed the damage exorbitantly. After much haggling we proceeded on our way as we wended our way towards Hazebrouck, the sky gradually grew brighter with the flickering quiver of hundreds of guns in action. It was the most awesome sight I have ever seen. As we neared Hazebrouck the guns could be heard - almost synchronising with the flashing. We took up our quarters with a number of the headquarters? staff beneath canvas.
