<p>to another table this morning &amp; so done out of our orderly job.  Yesterday our section were vaccinated &amp; inoculated.</p>
<p>18th February 1915 Ash Wednesday</p>
<p>This is the second Ash Wednesday I have spent upon the high seas.  We were inoculated again to-day.  My arm has quite recovered from the vaccination but there are a lot of beautiful arms about.  I met another chap off the 'Benalla'  &ndash; 'Dr. Lowrie'  &ndash; a day or two ago.  Have to instruct our sections in semaphore.  We are all fed up with this old tub &amp; every now &amp; again curse it</p>
