them and send them our photographs also, and tell them that if they are only able to write in English that we will be able to read it as a friend of ours now (reads English?).
Dear friend, I finish my letter in wishing you a big kiss from all the children and from us also. Do not forget to give the message to all your friends for which I thank you in advance for their remembrances in the shape of their photos. Au revoir, soon to have news of you I hope. Simone and Robert embrace you from far away.
I remain your devoiree for life
