<p>France<br/>25th Apl 1916.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Since I last wrote on 14th inst I have received your letter of 13th Feby.  I must thank you very much for it &amp; also for a parcel of sox I received from you by the same mail (21st inst)<br/>To-day is the 1st Anniversary of "Anzac Day" &amp; the troops here show they haven't forgotten.  Since I last wrote I have left my old Unit &amp; am now an orderly to Colonel Sturdee (ADMS) who is a brother to the Admiral.  He is a fine old man &amp; I give him all the attention I possibly can.<br/>The weather here seems to have taken a change for the better.  It is typical spring weather now &amp; is quite decent after all the heavy rains we got just after landing in France<br/>Where I am at present is quite within sound of the guns &amp; some of them shake the windows etc a good bit when they explode<br/>Aeroplane bombardments &amp; duels are of frequent occurrences, &amp; it is quite interesting to watch an aeroplane being shelled.<br/>There is a big difference in the marksmanship, our gunners being far superior.</p>
