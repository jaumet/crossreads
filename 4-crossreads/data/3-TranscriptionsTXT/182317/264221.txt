 Australian Imperial Force. Administrative headquarters, A.I.F. 130, Horseferry Road. London, S.W. 27th October, 1916 Lieutenant K.A. Ferguson, 5th Training Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, Rollestone, Salisbury Plains. My dear Ferguson, I congratulate you on your letter of the 25th instant, which confirms the chat we had here a day or so ago. I feel that you have chosen well &ndash; I also feel it will have the full endorsement of your father and mother, notwithstanding the frame of mind they must naturally be in over their losses. I wish you very complete success, which I venture to think you are going to achieve. Remember, to let me know if at any time I can do anything for you, and at all times I shall be glad to meet you. Truly yours, Richard McC. Anderson
