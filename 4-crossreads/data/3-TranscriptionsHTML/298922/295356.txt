<p>Tuesday 30 January 1917</p>
<p>EL BURG<br/>Relieved yesterday by the Yeomanry but our men are happier away in front where there is the chance of a [indecipherable] or two &amp; an occasional shot. I won a Rooster last night from A Squadron. We each had only 1 &amp; as there are 4 officers in each Squadron we tossed Snakes or Pheasants on Gippy coins, not heads &amp; tails. SNAKE won.</p>
<p>[The following crossed through]<br/>More letters from England re-addressed by LAURA.<br/>Mother Nov. 19th<br/>Joe &amp; Daisy Nov. 26th<br/>Christmas Card of DOGGIES<br/>Thank you for song. Very good &ndash; Dolly does not sing or play &ndash; I like <u>Dorothy</u> from other people, Dolly for myself &amp; YOU.</p>
