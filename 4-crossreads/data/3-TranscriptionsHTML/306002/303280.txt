<p>3.9.15<br/>Fri. 3rd.  Last night was one of the best I have had for comfort &amp; contentment.  The Hospital Ship lit up gaily with Red &amp; Green lights looked a pretty sight standing out some distance from the shore, she was the only boat visible, although we knew that scores of warboats &amp; destroyers were there, about 9 oclock a flash of flame followed by a loud report &amp; the screeching of the shell over us was proof enough that the warboats were still there, she fired 30 or 40 shots &amp; then again silence broken only by an occasional rattle of rifle fire;  as we were coming along the sap yesterday evening we passed scores of wounded men mostly English <strike>bet</strike> being taken to the beach to be sent to the Hospital boat, they had been in a scrap early yesterday morning.</p>
