Dearest Mother & Father,Recieved your very welcome letter written on the 6 December. I am doing well & as you see still in England. It is very cold here. and always raining.I was up to London from Friday last until yesterday. I had a very enjoyable time. Miss Astin & I went to the Theatre on Saturday night. Mark Hamburg was one of the performers. He plays lovely. I had just got off the train at Waterloo when the big explosion took place. It made some noise I can tell you. The chaps about surprised me they were rushing everywhere, saying the Zepps were here. It took me 3/4 of an hr before I could get a taxi to venture out to take me to the Grafton Hotel. The theatres & restaurants are always packed in London. They all seem to have plenty of money.News is scarce but I am feeling well & hope you are all the same. Good luckBest wishes & loveYour loving SonTom
