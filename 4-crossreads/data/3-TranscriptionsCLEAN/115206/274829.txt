  
 September 1918. Monday 16 
 In Reserve  (Hebecourt) and Bouvincourt. Weather very warm, quite a midsummers day. Left for line at 10.45 am. and headed to a cluster of bushes near Bouvincourt. Travelled via Braches, Peronne, Doingt and Cartigny to a little position near to the village I mentioned. Ammo wagons proceeded to Bty position. About midnight a storm sprang up, and the boys received a very unpleasant  drenching. Smithy and Doc came a beautiful thud. Wrote D.B.F. and T.L.
