A.I.F. Headquarters, London.          R. 24.5.17  A 27.5.17.27/3/1917.
My dearest Father,When I wrote last week, I told you of my meeting Rid at Headquarters here, and of my cabling the previous day (Monday) telling you of the meeting and also asking for another 8.  I received this, less the cost of cabling, on Saturday last.  Thank you so much, Father dear, for fixing these cables up for me so quickly.  I have seen Rid every day since, and this morning, when he came in, it was to tell me that he had to report back to Perham Downs, Salisbury, to-morrow morning.  His knee is not right yet by any means, but I think he is looking well otherwiseWe had some great old yarns together, and I am awfully sorry he has to go back now.The weather this week has been really abominable.  One day, Wednesday, I think it was, we had rain, hail, snow and sunshine, all in the one day with an interval of a couple of hours between each change.I am expecting to go down to Perham Downs on the 11th. of next month, and after a few weeks training, over to France againWe still have as much work as ever to get through, and I really don't know how P.U. men are going to stick it out.I posted Ol a book last week, "Australia and the great War" Part 2.  I was able to get Part 1 yesterday, and will send it off to-night.  The series are in 8 parts, and will be well worth keeping when complete.
