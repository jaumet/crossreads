<p>a man, who knew Kitchener &ndash; I think &ndash; that it was only a matter of a month or two.  It's a pity in a way, it will do such a lot of men out of a job.  It doesn't worry me much that way though, I think I must be one of those who sickens of a job as soon as they have got properly into the swing of it;  in fact if it lasts much longer I've decided to become neutral.</p>
<p>No more letter.  No more to say.  Its an awfully dull place, absolutely nothing to talk about.  We see a paper about once a week &amp; then can't follow it on account of our ignorance.  Give my love to everyone, &amp; tell them I really &amp; truly hope to see them again soon.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son<br/>Arthur</p>
