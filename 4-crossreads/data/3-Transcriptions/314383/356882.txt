Sent &pound;34  home in a draft to Grace to look after when I return to London.  I wonder if I'll every get there.  Also bought a pair of boots, dried fruits &amp; rice.  Starnes assembled us after tea &amp; informed us that we could not push on to the Caspian owing to the fact that Kutchih Khan with 70,000 followers in the pay of Turks was barring the way.

Staines gave us all the chance to pull out &amp; remain here if we wished as the journey from Zengan to Bijah was across unknown &amp; hostile country.  Not a man</p>
