 The 3rd Highland F. Amb . is in charg , , and a parti of them were play croquet on the lawn when we arriv . Serg . Johnni Moor ask one of us to go Cook , until the rest of our crowd arriv , so just for a chang I took it on . The scotti are a veri decent crowd and made us feel quit "at Home " They cook the tea , and Mac and I wash up . There were tabl and chair , knive and fork , and even a big clock and pictur on the wall . We had bulli beef , chees jam and butter for tea , and it was quit a treat to feel one leg under a tabl again . After tea a parti of 8 went out to the trench . The rest of us stay in and play card . Saturday 22nd Arose from my virtuous couch at 7.30 wash and shave then play a game of croquet befor have breakfast . The Scotti cook the Bacon and got breakfast readi and I wash up assist by Laycock and Sullivan . After breakfast , I had a look through some of the ruin hous in our vicin . Everi hous for mile around is in Ruin and they are just as the occup left them dure the bombard . Pictur still hang on the wall , and cloth of everi descript lie about . In one hous was a babi 's cot all complet with it littl sheer and a pretti quilt . Near by was a babi 's hat , a straw , trim with forget-me-not . It near made me cri when I saw it . We went into a millin and there were score of hat of all shape , trim and untrim , some of them had the price mark on and vari from 10 F to 40 franc . Hat pin and belt buckl were there in abund , but most of a cheap qualiti . One big drawer was full of kiddi hat , and they were sweet and pretti . Of cours we had no busi in these place and would have got into serious troubl had we been caught , but luck was with us .
