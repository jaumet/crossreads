officer’s orderly was hit & sent off to Heliopolis. He was a hale fellow well met & we are sorry to lose him.

The gallant 18th were in action Sunday night & Monday & suffered severely in an attack on a strongly defended hill. After taking five lines of trenches they were forced to retire & hold two, owing to their being outnumbered. They would have secured a decisive victory if sufficient reinforcements had arrived in time. As it was, report has it that only 300 men out of the whole battalion came through safely. They must have been cut up for the number of wounded being carried to the base hospital as we pass marched here on Sunday night were many & the stretcher bearers then reported that they had had a pretty heavy day.
