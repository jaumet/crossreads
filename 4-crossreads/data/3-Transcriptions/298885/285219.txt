<p>I at once set to and made what enquiries I could with the result I learnt that Stan has been classed as severely wounded with shell wound in head, right hand and both legs. I hurried at once to 3rd Field Ambulance but was an hour too late as Stan had passed thru the station and was sent straight on to Boulogne. From there I should think he will get to Blighty, so have written to Wal Davies in London and telling him to keep his eyes open for Stan and to let me know if he hears anything.</p>
