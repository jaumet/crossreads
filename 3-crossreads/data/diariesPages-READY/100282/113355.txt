left Australia to fight for his country just because he is under age, if he is good enough to fight he should have a vote 10 times in preference to the rotten stinking swine's of loafers strikers who remain in Australia, this last big strike about settled us over here, especially when they refused to load our mail or food, all I hope is that the whole box dice of them get sent over here, they might change their opinions then.
23rd. Lovely sunny this morning, quite remarkable weather for this time of year, its more like early Spring with the exception that the trees are very bare grass looking ragged, but everything else is bonza.

Jock Mackie came back last night we were all pleased to see him back he is still the same old stick, Jock is going to No. 11 platoon.
Took all our shortages again
