<p>12/4/19<br/>Marcinelle<br/>Tried a couple of Orderly Room cases. One McCormack of 23rd came before me handcuffed and was remanded for Court Martial.  There is a lot of traffic now in military stores and the canal bank in front of the station is the mart after dark and known as Rue de Combien.  Saw General Martin afternoon and arranged several matters with him. Afternoon tea in the mess and then a walk round the Charleroi streets to buy a couple of papers. After mess went to Pictures at the Cinema Hall &ndash; very poor show and a great barrage of tobacco smoke. Took another walk up the street. The mildness of Spring is in the air and the buds are green and bursting. Filthily casual in their habits of sanitation are the Belgians.</p>
