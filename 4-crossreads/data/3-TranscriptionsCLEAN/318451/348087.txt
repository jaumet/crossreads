  
 hospital today.  He was lifted out of the trench & blown up about 15 ft. in the air & fell outside our front line in no mans land. 
 Monday Yesterday & today the weather has been quite mild almost warm sometimes & rain set in & fell heavily during the night.  I went up to Town from here today & visited the hospital. The British have entered Bagdad so the news runs.  It will be a fine stroke.  Got back almost dark.  Things are very quiet as I write tonight. 
 Tuesday 13th Today has been fairly quiet.  Intermittent shelling all day.  I went down to Batt. HQ this morning.  This afternoon I did not do much.  Now it is nearly 11 p.m. & we are waiting for a big raid on our Front at a quarter to 12.  We have made provision for a good many wounded.  There's nothing I know of quite like this
