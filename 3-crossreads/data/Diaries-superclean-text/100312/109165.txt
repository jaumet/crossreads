19/11/17 Locre
Busily engaged all the morning on the improvement of the camp raising duckboards c and drainage and by lunch time had the job well advanced. There is much danger of fire in a place like this. Military labor is a most wasteful thing. Alderson the padre got away on leave the former to Paris. After lunch football matches were on the board ? inter company goes. General Paton came round and inspected our lines. By 4 p.m. it was nearly dark. Dull grey clouds very low, bleak bare trees, a ground mist rising and a raw cold striking through one. Such is the outlook in this part of Belgium on an afternoon at the beginning of winter. It is pretty country in the spring but now is the time one's thoughts turn to sunny southern climates. Great keeness on the part of our guards just now and much practice to be good. Long and cheerless evenings these of winter! Lecture after Mess.
