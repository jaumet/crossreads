credit for a smart piece of work & thank our lucky stars that each parachute opened.  'Tis excitement only to see a burning balloon but a man falling headlong to earth is stunning in its sorrow.
Sunday 14th Julya fine morning & Fritz sent several of his balloons up, but each had a plane patrolling in front of it.  None of ours went up.  Hun planes also over in the morning  Rain during latter part of day.  Had a game of cricket.  Wrote home.
Monday 15th JulySent off for drugs.  Did a little French during day & minor jobs.  About 2.30 P.M. Fritz again managed to get a balloon, one which had replaced the one he destroyed on Saturday.  It was all over in 5 minutes but the barrage put up by our anti aircraft guns saved the next balloon in line.  Its observers however jumped out & all landed safely.  'Tis wonderfully exciting while it lasts.
Tuesday 16th JulyA very busy day as
