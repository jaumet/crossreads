Having about a 100 Egyptians workman which proved useless & had to save this man on my own myself being the night officer in charge of the Transport. Then the police arrived at 9.15 pm with dragging irons & dragged until 10/30 pm & finally hooked on the private & fished him out from the bottom, depth being about 33 ft. We laid him on the wharf & kept working him for 1/2 an hour. Life was found extinct so sent him away in a ambulance in charge of the Military.The Australian Hospital Ship Wandalla arrived to day full of Australian wounded. Made fast at the wharf next to us discharging her soldiers & transhipping same to the Transport Kanawa bound for Sydney. Called aboard & found several chaps we knew amongst the officers. They having been away for years Capt Sunter & officers were delighted to hear news of Australia.
