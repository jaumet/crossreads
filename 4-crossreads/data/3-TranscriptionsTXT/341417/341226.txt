 Dear Drs 
 It is some while since I had a letter from you but I heard that measles, smallpox &amp; probably a few more of the 7 ancient plagues are keeping you busy. 
 I am still in the land of unpleasantness &amp; doing well. 
 Jaundice is common here &amp; monotony of diet gets the credit of its origin. I understand it differs from the ordinary complaint, in that the intestines are the seat of the trouble. It is mostly accompanied by diarrhoea with the usual yellow skin &amp; eyes. "Played-out" swells the sick reports. Mumps &amp; Measles add to the list. 
 The Anzac Medical Ass'n, is the latest institution here. I cannot say who they have on their black list. Probably it is the Turks &amp; The Ordnance Dept. 
 Pow-wows are held regularly every 2nd Sunday &ndash; Shelling permitting. All the high-browed specialists
