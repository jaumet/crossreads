There was a fair bit of firing done & at midnight we were relieved by A Troop.  We filed out after breakfast.  I was detailed off for special sapping in the afternoon with 5 others on 3rd shift.
Monday 19th [July]Started at 4 am digging firing pits in the new firing line & sandbagging & making new loopholes.  Came off at 8 am.  Had a fairly easy day & went on again at 4 pm.  Forgot to mention that I received letters from mother Doug, Carrie & Roy Blair & sent replies to all but Doug.
Tuesday 20thA sniper in the bushes in front of our trench exchanged shots with Major Windyer but they both missed.  A party of 10 belonging to the 7th undertook to go after him.  Os Walker (of Dorrigo) was one of them.  They nearly ran into the Turks trench which was full & they were fired on heavily.
