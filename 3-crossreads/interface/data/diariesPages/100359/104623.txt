Messrs. Dawson and Doutch sang "Farewell" and the choir joined in the chorus, which sounded very fine. The Sutton Bros. rendered "Larboard Watch" in a most pathetic manner. The choir then sang a few part songs and we brought a most enjoyable evening to a close by singing the National Anthem, I must apologise to "Billsy May" and "Jacks" for not mentioning them before as their items were among the most enjoyable.
Thursday 19th
Stan Wright and I got a pile of straw and made ourselves as snug as possible on the brick floor. About 1 a.m. we were rudely awakened by Serg. "Benny" who informed us that we were to arise at 5 and have Break. at 5.30 and be ready to depart. We got up at the time stated dashed down to the cookhouse in the pitchy darkness and through the mud and got our break of bacon and tea. After break we were informed that we were not going away till tomorrow, so we are all smiles again as we can do with a day's rest, There is absolutely nothing one can buy here and the people are verydirty and unobliging. They have no time for soldiers at all, and almost seem to begrudge telling us the time. A number of us visited several farm houses before we could buy bread and butter and when did get it, we had to pay "through the nose" for it. The Cooks gear has been sent on, so we had to cook our own meat. We fossicked around in search of wood for our fire, I would?nt like to say where we got it from, but a little shed that was just outside our billet is not to be seen this morning. Dodson is cook and he gave us jolly good feeds. For Dinner we had grilled steak and boiled Potatoes for tea we had more steak chipped potatoes, and stewed apple and tinned milk, quite a glorious feed, considering we are so near the firing line. After tea we had another fine old sing song our choir has come on wonderfully and they sang the choruses almost like prima-donnas.
