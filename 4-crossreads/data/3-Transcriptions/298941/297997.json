<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.30 p.m<br/>After Wimereux, to my surprise came Calais. Here the signs of the present battle were more noticeable in the trainloads of salvaged material, smashed guns, &amp; light railway stock that passed us. Also three long hospital trains of wounded passed us. It was  a constant succession of trains on the other line.<br/>Calais was a confused impression of narrow streets,dirty houses, &amp; networks</p>
