<p>27 [Apr]<br/>pm. Continued discharging guns, carriages &amp; ammunation for (Palastine)</p>
<p>29.<br/>Coaling ship &amp; loading guns, carriages &amp; ammunition.<br/>Air Lieut. Worrell flew today over here from Port Said so called on Indarra &amp; told us that he was in a hydroplane bombing the Goeben at the Dardenelles &amp; had several direct hits. She was badly knocked about on the upper structure. On her side she had a large hole where the mine struck her whilst steaming back to the Dardenelles after the raid. Rough weather prevailed &amp; prevented our airmachines from bombing for several days. So in the meantime she got off &amp; was seen by Worrell whilst flying over Constantinople in dock from one of the British machines</p>
