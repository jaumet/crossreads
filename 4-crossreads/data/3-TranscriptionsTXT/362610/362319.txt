Thursday 13 April 1916A beautifully fine day after all the rain, but cold in the easterly wind. In all directions could be seen great-coats, rain-coats, boots, & clothing of all descriptions spread out to dry. Was very glad to get my saturated things dried.In the morning the 3rd Battn. moved into the tents erected on the ground I laid out yesterday, & headquarters also came along. I had to get 4 marquees put up for them & was all day at this & similar work in the camp. Most of the men were on various fatigue duties, but a few companies had their men on parade during the afternoon.
