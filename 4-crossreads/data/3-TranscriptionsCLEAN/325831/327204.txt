 At the close of his Lecture the Chaplain volunteered to answer questions, dealing with the War or Army. Many were very funny - One Australian had seen in an English paper - where a Mrs Brown of Clapham had been fined "Three pounds" or "Two months in the 2nd Division" & he wanted to know if that meant with "the Dinkums" (the nickname of our Division). 
 I am expecting my Brother who is coming to see me here, his long delayed leave having come at last. We had three days to-gether at Rouen - which was our first meeting since we left Egypt nine months before. 
 I was so glad to meet Lieut Ferguson while on Salisbury Palins & knowing how keen he is, was glad to hear of his appointment. 
 We will be sorry to lose Genl Holmes from the 5th Brigade. I believe the 18th Colonel who is now Brigadier Genl, now has charge of the 5th Brigade. 
 I must close now 
 Yours sincerely etc
