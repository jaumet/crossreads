<p>possibly run in it and it was rather trying having to walk accross places swept with fire. Our officers were marvelous (Ronald especially) they would walk about and sit up and tell us what to do when I would be trying to lie as flat as a shaddow.<br/>We have given the Turks a jolly good licking and today are having a grand rest so you need not worry about me Mother dear.<br/>I received a parcel from Aunt Katie the day we left Tel-el-Kibir and brought it up here &amp; opened it out here and the chocolate &amp; stuff in it was most acceptable: but the balaclava cap cover was a little out of place Mother the chaps did laugh when they saw the cap cover in a country where it has never rained and my cap had just gone off to Cairo pack store with my kit bag and another chap who got a parcel at the same time had a pair of gloves and mittens in his.<br/>I am very much afraid that poor old Bill Graham is killed: he was very badly wounded by shrapnel bringing in a wounded mate and since then I cant hear anything definate but I will go to the field ambulance and try and find out about it and if he is killed will write to his people.<br/>He was some distance along the line from me so I did not see him; but it was jolly hard luck for him as he had not been in the Regt 12 hours.<br/>Yesterday we were under fire a good part of the time but it was not very bad as it was only rifles and the Turks kept surrendering ahead of us.</p>
<p>[Note<br/>This action was the Battle of Romani.  An extract of the official history states:</p>
<p>"The British defences were sited 35 kilometres east of the canal, which the Turks tried to outflank early on 4 August. Initially, only the 1st Light Horse Brigade was in position to meet the Turkish attack.  Heavily outnumbered it was forced to fall back but as the day progressed reinforcement steadily arrived allowing the position to be stabilised."]</p>
