  
 [Wednesday 30 August 1916] 
 275 miles in 24 hours Calm Hot night   Steaming along Tripoli coast rugged & Timbered:- Passed an Italian Hospital ship it was near here that this boat ran into an Italian Tramp & cut it in two, easily done in the dark & caused by the NO Light rule. This day week we should be in England.  I must be careful not to tell too many back country yarns there!! We are over the Spanish coast from here & so on to Gibratler.
