<p>Sept 7th Friday<br/>Came off Guard 9 am this morning. The five of us volunteered to take it on every second day permanent, but we were not allowed.<br/>A boat roll of about 180 was picked this morning. I was not on it. It is supposed to be orderlies to go back on a hospital ship, so I am not sorry I <u>was</u> not on it.</p>
<p>Went on my first route march in this camp this afternoon, &amp; my word I was tired when I came home. We went to Easton &amp; back. Rather a long way for a march.<br/>We are having very fine weather now.</p>
<p>Saturday Sept 8th<br/>Went to Easton again on a route march. We didn't go so far as we did yesterday.<br/>Everybody is expectant of a boat roll about the 16th of this month.<br/>Had a look round the Portland jail this afternoon. We couldn't go in though.</p>
<p>Sunday Sept 9th<br/>Very misty &amp; raining. Went to church in the Gym this morning. Played cards (Bridge) all the rest of the day. When leave is granted to Weymouth now, you have to be fallen in &amp; marched to Portland where you are put in the train. Leave (daily) is now granted from 4 pm till 9.30 pm, before it was 3 pm till 10 pm.</p>
