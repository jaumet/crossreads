  
 12/1/19 Gourdinne Sunday morning. Gorman and Matthews went out shooting and got a hare and a good bag of "Longbec" - a small bird with a very long beak. After lunch I walked over to Nallines [Nalinnes] and there found that both Colonel James and Savage were out so I walked back through the Woods. Jack came over to see me at about 5 p.m. and we read Australian letters together. He stayed to dinner and afterwards Sergt AJ Wiltshire 24th. came over and had a family reunion cemented by several glasses of spirits and prolonged till late. Horse thieves are very active round here at present and our picquets need to be very alert. Read the Times until after 11 and then retired to bed and sleep.
