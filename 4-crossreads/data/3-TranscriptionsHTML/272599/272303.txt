<p>1917 Saturday 3 Feb.</p>
<p>Troops did not wake till nearly 10. a.m this morning. Hunt roared up Sergt. Flynn &amp; sent him up to next aid post, bringing Sergt. Clifton here - a welcome change  Bright clear day &amp; considerable aerial activity.  another frost makes the snow dry &amp; crisp like fine salt. Get back treated with liniment for first time  Not much better yet. Receive May's parcel of sweets &amp; find them so good. So do the other boys. Also "Sun" from Mary.</p>
