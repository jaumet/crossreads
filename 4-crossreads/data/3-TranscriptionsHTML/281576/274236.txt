<p>Fri. June 15.  At Tea time the mob in our Mess drank my health - in  tea  &ndash; unfortunately.  Johnnie Maggs returned from Hospital, also Nick Cox.  Our Cricket Team played the return match with the 3rd C.C.S. &amp; lost by 9 runs after a most exciting game.  Bunny Allen was top score of our side &ndash; 41.  Busy packing up ready to move off tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sat. June 16   Left Bapaume    Turned out at 5.  A most ridiculous hour, as we did not leave till midday.  Marched to Bapaume Station.  Conveyed in Cattle Trucks.  Arrived at Varennes.  Detrained there &amp; marched on about 5 miles to Senlis.<br/> It is a pretty little spot.  Our Camp is on the side of a Hill overlooking the village.  After Tea we went for a stroll &amp; had some refreshments at a Caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>Sunday June 17  Glory Alleluia.  Mail came in.  Got 5 letters from France, 1 from Mother &amp; 3 from M.S.  Got some writing ahead of me now.  Told off as Sanitary Corporal.  Got Nigger Bowden, Snowy Atherton, Archie Deed &amp; Donovan in my squad.  All good workers.  This is a very pleasant little camp.</p>
<p>Monday. June 18.  More mail came in  Got wedding Cake from Nell  Distributed it amongst our mob.   Capt Irving left us today.  He came on parade &amp; wished us all Good Luck &amp; said "Goodbye".  The mob are very sorry to lose him &amp; gave 3 hearty cheers &amp; sang "jolly good fellow".  He is going to a Base Hospital in England.  Got Letters from Lizzie Rowley &amp; Mrs Jack B.  Gee! I don't know how I'm going to answer all these letters.</p>
