<p>9th  Sat.  Made a small stretcher which is much more use to us in these narrow trenches.   <br/>Supplied with waterproof capes.  More "Strafe" as we call a bombardment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <br/>On our right are Dublin Fusiliers, New Zealanders, Scots Guards &amp; French troops.    <br/>Our dug out now is a circular recess which was used by the Germans for machine guns.  <br/>It is 3? off</p>
