  
 very good advice re not marrying over this side I am not at all likely to do that. I would have liked one of Berts photos. I have written him a couple of letters since hearing from him but so far haven't had any answers. Of course it will take some time for a letter to get here from him. It is something to know he is faring so well. Fancy him taking to a pipe. I cant picture him with a pipe at all. I am pleased to hear Uncle Will has recovered again from his sickness. I had a letter from Mrs G Smithers she said they were expecting Aub home in a few days from when she wrote. He wont be at all sorry to be back in N.S.W. again I will bet. No more news just now. Must close. Love & best wishes to all 
 Your sincere son Clyde
