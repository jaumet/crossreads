 We haven't been killing ourselves today. We are further advanced than any of the other pits so are taking it easy. 
 We are being well fed lately & have plenty of water. We have no occassion to grumble & yet we do. It is a soldiers privelige. Personally I don't mind it out here now, only that I am anxious to get home again & I don't suppose I shall be actually[?] happy till I get there.
