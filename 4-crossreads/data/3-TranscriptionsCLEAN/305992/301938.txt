Mar 2Com. loading airoplane machines tents & stores for Egypt for Palastine.Embarked 60 airoplane cadets & 65 sisters & 40 military officers just arrived last night by rail from England. Had lunch in the 1st saloon along with them. Several of the sisters smoking cigarettes at the tables to the disgust of the ships officers. As mentioned before we had 58 Australian sisters on board for 5 weeks. Without an exception I did not see one of them smoke not even on deck. Before dinner the same day large placards No Smoking hung in the 1st saloon dinning room.
