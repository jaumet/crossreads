<p>Tuesday 23 January 1917 [1918]<br/>All hospital very quiet &amp; most wards being turned out in turn.  Last lot of V.A.D's are in swarms &amp; some a mass of powder, how can they send these sort of women out to look after these brave boys?<br/>Saw Col. Onslow.  40 sisters leaving tomorrow for P. Said.  Went town, drew &pound;4-0-0 at pay office &amp; lent &pound;1-0-0 to S. Steele.  Rec'd letter E.G. Palethorpe lately &amp; reports all well at "Wilga".  Pts. are scarce but one cannot have everything.</p>
