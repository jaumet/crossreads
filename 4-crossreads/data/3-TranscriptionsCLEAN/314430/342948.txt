  
 For miles behind us and before us the road* was crammed, jammed, and often blocked with traffic - wagons, motor lorries, ration limbers, Red Cross cars, ammunition limbers, batteries of artillery cavalry, traction engines, dragging huge guns, water carts, tanks and columns of infantry. All were struggling forward in the dark. Shells were bursting more freely around us, horses kept kicking and jumping about, and vehicles bumped into one another. Men shouted orders in wild tones while the columns of infantry somehow wormed themselves  itself  along the road. At length we got into the village of Estrees and while passing through it, were subjected to a fierce shelling. Later we crawled into a shallow trench where we remained several hours under incessant fire. There were no regularly-dug trenches in this area, and what had been dug, were not much better than gutters. We established our company headquarters in a battered trench affording very little protection,  being  so close to the enemy artillery that we could see  the  flashes from the mouth of their cannon. The rest 
 * I was unaware of what we had to do when the above notes were made, but some  weeks  days afterwards I learnt exactly what we had done. We were placed in the trenches in front of Estrees on the 1st Oct, and were facing the third and last line of the Hindenburg System which runs from Beaurevoir to West Wiancourt, and Ramicourt. This line of defence was usually referred to as the Beaurevoir-Fonsomme line and crossed green and open country. By smashing this line we had definitely passed that gigantic defence system, the "Hindenburg Line".
