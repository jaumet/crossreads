<p>Great rumours are knocking about since yesterday. &nbsp;It is said that the German Fleet is out and all arrangements are in hand lest there should be an attempted invasion by the Germans. &nbsp;It seems a very harem scarem idea, all the same. &nbsp;There is talk of a general mobilisation, but one can&#39;t get the &quot;dinkim oil&quot; about things. &nbsp;There was also talk of a revolution in Ireland again, but the newspapers say nothing about it. &nbsp;All leave is cancelled until further notice. &nbsp;This included the 4 days&#39; Disembarkation leave, and nearly [indescipherable] from this [indescipherable] after all arrangements had been made. &nbsp;They say that the big ship-building yards in Scotland are on strike too. &nbsp;It is certain, however, that something is on foot, in one direction or another. &nbsp;We read the head man (Newton Moore) of the A.I.F. had a flying visit yesterday. &nbsp;These are for 8 troopships just about to arrive this week sometime; they have been hung up somewhere. &nbsp;Germany, according to Lloyd&#39;s Weekly, was almost on the brink of revolution, and much talk of a similar situation as has arisen in Russia&nbsp;by eliminating monarchy and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>I could not get the Times yesterday, but am forwarding a few papers. &nbsp;Is Bess trying over the bits of music I&#39;m sending over? &nbsp;There is another fiddler in the office, &amp; we were having a tune last night where we were visited by the Heads &amp; compliments.</p>
<p>Gee Whiz, the March winds are going strong today. &nbsp;They reckon Salisbury Plain is the coldest and bleakest spot in England. &nbsp;Some of the countrypeople reckon this winter is the worst in their ken. &nbsp;And still it continues.</p>
<p>Well, dear Dad, there&#39;s nothing more to say at present. &nbsp;With fondest hopes that you are all well.</p>
<p>Best love from</p>
