1916   TUESDAY 29   AUGUST
A miserable day. It rained all day & blew a young gale  I was heartily sick of the whole affair & had a real attack of the blues. The signalling class had buzzer work in the empty huts in 18 camp. There was a muster parade in the huts in morning & Col. Pearce was round. Bill Hunter & self went to the pictures at night & got very wet for a rotten show.
