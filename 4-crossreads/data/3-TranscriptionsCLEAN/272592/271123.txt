17th.   This morning a new lot of men were sent down from the Battalion to relieve the men who came down with me but the Engineers refused to let them go, so I took them back with me, for I had to go back to the Battalion & take charge of a Platoon so I am gradually getting on.
There is a "General Order" out this morning calling for applications to join the Flying Corp only N.C.O.s are allowed enter I believe, I don't think I will apply for entry though nearly all the rest of the boys are doing so.
