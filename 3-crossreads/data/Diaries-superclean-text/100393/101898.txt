than 1/3 of the total German Army.These are figures given out. From this people will realise what five Divisions of men from the Southern Cross have done.The most pitiful part is that we cannot replace or bring back those 50,000 poor lads who lay there for ever.
In conclusion.This little narrative has only dealt with the war, between certain dates of the war. After 6th October we went down to Abbeville foe a good spell then followed with other armies up into Belgium after 11/11/18 where we remained in occupation until such time as we were sent back home.I would like to state that every word of this narrative is absolute fact truth not in any way exaggerated. In fact a lot has not been mentioned a lot not spoken of enough.
Commenced in Bouffoulx, Belgium on 28th March, '19 completed on Salisbury 'Plains 12th June 1919.
