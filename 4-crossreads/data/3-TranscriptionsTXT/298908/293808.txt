has just died with it, how stiff is he.  They reckon we are likely to stop here for a while until it dies down for they are frightened we might bring it aboard & give it to the rest of the patients, everyone is getting fed up & some are taking their 10 weeks in Blighty through so much messing about.We had to find 80 men today for various duties & a nice time we have had getting them off.After tea this evening I went into Town mainly with the idea of having a hot bath but on arrival found that there were no baths open of a Sunday night so I did the next best thing under the circumstances had a good feed then a stroll round the street & home.  I much prefer walking than riding these nights it helps to settle ones feelings & makes me more contented which under the present conditions is not up to much.  I hate hanging about & there are so many temptations to dodge.
