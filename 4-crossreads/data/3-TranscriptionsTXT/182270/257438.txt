 TUESDAY, MAY 6, 1919. 
 Fine. Digging tree holes for the 
 drive in morning. Then Eric, Owie 
 &amp; M rs &nbsp;Cadell came out. Eric took 
 me over to &quot;Beauly&quot; to inspect 
 X bred ewes in lamb, but 
 did not do a deal as they are a 
 very weedy lot. Eric &amp; Peter &amp; I 
 then rode round my part &amp; 
 valued it at roughly &pound;3.10.0 
 Marj. jo, &amp; Owie met us at the 
 Middle paddock bore for lunch. 
 The Cadells went home after &amp; 
 Marj. also.
