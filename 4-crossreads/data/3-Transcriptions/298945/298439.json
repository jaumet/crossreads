<p>Friday 13 Sept. 1918</p>
<p>Yesterday morning Sgt Kerry of the O. Room told me that a nomination<strike>s</strike> had been called for from the Colonel for <strike>one name</strike> the position of Education Officer with a unit in the 1st Division   Each Battalion will have one &amp; the whole of the other details such as AA.M.C. &amp; A.AS.C., one each to a division. The Colonel wanted to see me at 2 p.m in his tent, &amp; when I went he told me that he had decided to nominate me. My lack of degrees or diplomas is distinctly against me, but my organising ability will give me a dog's chance. Sgt Kenny gave me a copy of the order, to judge <strike>my</strike> the wording of my application form, &amp; on it I noticed the names of Sgt. Woodyard, Pte Dalton, Pte Maynard, Pte Barlow &amp; Pte Holt, with the latter underlined. I would like to get the job, but the chances are not great.</p>
