<p>June 17th<br/>I finally retired to my bed at about 9.45 pm last night but could not sleep, so I got up again at 11.30 &amp; agreed to do another chap's picket then &amp; he to do mine in the morning. So stayed out on the horseline until 2.30 &amp; then went to bed deciding not to take off any clothes as I had to get up again at 5.30.<br/>So I went to sleep in full war paint until 7 am this morning when a fellow woke me up &amp; said that the morning parade was over!<br/>Fortunately my absence had not been noticed.</p>
