We stopped in Colombo from Nov 15th till Nov 18th during which time we had got water aboard. While we were getting water the N.Z. &amp; certain other ships left a day before us on their way to Aden. We left on Tuesday 15th &amp; caught the rest of the Troopships up on Wednesday 19th Nov.</p>
<p>Nov 21st<br/>We all got up in the morning to find all the boats had stopped &amp; we naturally thought something was in the wind but the stoppage was only caused through two boats coming into a slight collision. We arrived in Aden on Wednesday morning 25th Nov &amp; after stopping there a day for coal &amp; water supplies</p>
