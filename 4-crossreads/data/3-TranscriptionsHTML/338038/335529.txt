<p>&amp; appeared to be reviving when I looked &amp; spoke to him. He went to sleep then &amp; I think passed away in his sleep.  I think the fragment must have struck the artery &amp;amp he died from loss of blood.</p>
<p>One of the men brought me over a snapshot of his grave when I was in Hospital in England &amp; if you have not already got one I will have very much pleasure in sending it to you.  I have only the one snap at present but I am going to get some enlargements if I can.  It was a terrible blow to the Battery when your son was hit &ndash; the men absolutely worshipped him &amp; it was difficult, my brother officers told me since, to keep the morale up.  It is to a certain extent good to think that the supreme sacrifice he made was not in vain  but the blow it was to myself &amp; all who knew him on hearing of his death was perhaps more painful than anyone can realize.</p>
<p>I am at present still in Hospital but expect to get my discharge any day now.  Sincerely trusting that you are well in health &amp; spirits Mr Garling, believe me to be  Yours in great sympathy</p>

<p>My Army address was &ndash; Lt. W.A.Mossman.  37th Battery</p>
