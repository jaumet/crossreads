<p>Sunday, 2nd September to 15th September 17.<br/>Visited a fair sized town, about 8 miles away from our billet, spent a pleasant day there. Band performance in the gardens, met a number of old pals, including Holmes from Hooper &amp; Harrison, Dickinson &amp; Redmond from Neutral Bay. (The latter was killed in the recent operations, a jolly fine fellow he was too).  Spent the evening at a Picture Show which was most enjoyable.  A day spent in the above fashion helps to break the monotony of this life greatly. Just after returning to my billet Fritz made an air raid on the town so its just as well I left the place early. Quite a number of civilians were injured I believe. All the week, the same routine so will not comment on it. On the following Sunday the 9th inst. I visited the town again &amp; once more came across a number of old friends including Roy O'Keefe's brother.  He is only 17 years old &amp; is a Stretcher bearer. 27 years old today,  it the war lasts much longer I will be too old to settle down &amp; get married.<br/>Received parcels from relations in England.</p>
<p>16th September 1917.<br/>Moving orders to hand again, this time I believe it will be towards the straffing. Plenty of work, striking camp etc. a portion of the Ambulance leave early in the morning.</p>
<p>17th September 1917.<br/>Reveille 5:30 a.m. it was rather unfortunate the Ambulance being at the end of the column, the whole Brigade marching. It was a long &amp; tedious march, about 18 miles altogether. (Of course as usual I will not b e able to mention any names of places etc.)   At mid-day we marched through C [blank] a fine little township situated on a hill from which a grand view of the surrounding country was obtained. Arrived at ---- about 7 o'clock,  every one dog</p>
