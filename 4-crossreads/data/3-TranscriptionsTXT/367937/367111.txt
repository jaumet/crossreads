 My darling old Rob I cant think of anything to say &ndash; so will just say it &ndash; but you know wherever you are when you open this we are sure to be thinking of you &ndash; it will be worthwhile going away just to come home again &ndash; I am not fretting darling because I feel so absolutely we are all in Gods hands &ndash; you are just doing your duty, &amp; all is right.
