In Front of Harbonniers. Bty, PosWeather fine and clear. Laid an O.P. line with Tom and Ped Palmer 31/2 miles in length .Had a very exciting time doing so and the battery had the pleasure of doing some excellent shooting for the infantry. The 2nd Div were held up by a large garrison of [indecipherable] guns and these were eventually cleared. Smithy Tom and myself left for W.L. Battery was   to go out of action - but after going half way we returned again on the right of our old possie, 1st Div took Lahion. French took Montidier and one or two other small villages.
