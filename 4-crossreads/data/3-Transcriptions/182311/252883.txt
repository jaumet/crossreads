<p>DEAR PEOPLE,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am on the same old job as before, &quot;Scout Officer&quot; it suits me for very few officers know anything about N.M.L. and I am usually left to do my little job without interferences, of course were it done other than well, I would hear about it, but as it is I work out my little game as I will and &quot;Nobuddy sez nuthink to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few days time I set off for a week&#39;s instructing, a British Brigade has requested my services and so away I go again.&nbsp; What an awful thing I&#39;ll have to join the police when I return and raid Chow Betting joints for excitement.&nbsp; Anyhow it&#39;s an appreciation and a compliment and shows that past work must have been good.&nbsp; I&#39;ll send you a copy of their request when enough time has passed to make it innocuous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Hurry is one of the most considerate men alive, he is very hardworking and brave too, he delights in sharing the boys&#39; perils and the boys realize this and call him &quot;The Old Prince.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can think of nothing else of general interest for a semi-public letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; BEST WISHES,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAROLD.</p>
