<p>22-2-19 Sat<br/>Usual routine</p>
<p>23-2-19 Sun<br/>Went to Chinese camp this afternoon to tell Capt Grice (West Susssex) that we would be up to dinner on Tuesday &amp; not Monday &amp; to go for a walk with him. He is out so I walk over to Dargnies passing Heyman &amp; another officer on the way.</p>
<p>Dargnies is a small village in the wood as straggling as most villages. Here I saw a man in a little carts drawn by two dogs &amp; moving much faster than I could run. He seemed unusual as all the villagers stopped to look at him. Thence I went on to Woincourt through the village &amp; home again.</p>
