My Dear Ones,
   This England is a lovable place, a country of stories, for almost every town, many of the villages and even wayside cottages and crossroads have histories.
   It gives one quite a thrill when passing through a village to learn that Amesbury is really Almesbury of the "Idylls of the King" and that here Queen Guinevere sheltered when retiring from the court of King Arthur.  Again when travelling cross country in a motor car we observe a large conical hill in three terraces, and hear that it is Old Sarum (Old Salisbury) fortified in prehis-toric times, used by Romans and Saxons, and is one of the famous "Rotten Boroughs" retaining very strangely, the right to send two members to Parliament (although quite uninhabited) that is of course until Reform Hill passed.  Again at a place called Figheldean (pronounced Fielden) we found the Chestnut Tree and Forge quite incorrectly alleged to be the scene of Longfellow's "Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree the Village Smithy Stands;" and then the church where the Smith heard his daughter "singing in the village choir."  An interesting old place is this Church of Norman and Early English Architecture, with in the porch are two cross legged figures discovered in a field at Milston probably from the tombstone of some old time Warrior for they seem to represent Crusaders.
