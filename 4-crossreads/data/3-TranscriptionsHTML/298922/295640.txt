<p>Friday 7 December 1917</p>
<p>Still at <strike>Malta</strike> &amp; remaining till Saturday. We had trouble in getting here &amp; it looks as hard to get away. The Egyptians some years ago had a small NAVY &amp; they set out for Malta but could not find it!!! returning to Alexandria they said, Malta "mafish" which is <strike>gypsy for</strike> means "finish". Visited the Church of <u>Bones</u> 2500 Skulls &amp; bones of the ancient defenders of Malta are arranged in Tiers in a vault, gruesome!!</p>
<p>[The remainder of the page crossed through.]<br/>More lace today so the wife should be busy in Cairo with sewing. We have our meals ashore as Dolly likes to get away from the Steamer.</p>
