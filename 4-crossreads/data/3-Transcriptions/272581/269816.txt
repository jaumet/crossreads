<p>March 1916<br/>it was not till about 1-30am the next morning before we got into the train. The train was a fair length &amp; had 1st 2nd &amp;  3rd class carriages &amp;  I was lucky enough to have a 1st class. There was about fifteen hundred men on the train &amp; eight in each compartment &amp; with our equipment there was not much spare room. <br/>The French railway stations are different to ours for they are only raised about a foot from the ground &amp; not near as finished off as our own. We passed through the wine growing area &amp; there are some fine scenes to for the grapes are grown up the slopes &amp; on top of the hills and mountains. Fruit is also in abundance &amp; at this time of the year all the trees, vines &amp; hedges are beginning to get their leaves &amp; everything is green <strike>As you</strike>  While passing through among the mountains snow could still be seen of the tops of some &amp;  it was a great sight. As you go north you get into pastoral country &amp; now all the young crops are showing their heads &amp; look well. France seems to be a net work of roads &amp; rivers &amp; the roads are made of white metal &amp; with green fields it makes a grand scene. The train took us within a few miles of Paris &amp; then branched off &amp;  we were all disappointed for we were wanting alook at Paris</p>
