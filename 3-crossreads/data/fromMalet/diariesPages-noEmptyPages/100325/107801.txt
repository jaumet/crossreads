3 pm left for Cairo with Capt Pedler and Buckley. Took gharry for Mousky and then walked on. The whole narrow street very busy and full of colour and life. Touts very annoying at first but soon melt on "Imshi Yallah", and threat with walking stick. Continued up Neuvre Rue; noticed quaint street cries. Sukker melons some cries very musical. Leaving European shops reach native bazaars. Tatooed donkeys and sheep, goats on footpath, the street covered with  inch mud from watering. Native women shopping; one with dropsical feet, her shoes only fitting over heel and toe. The flesh bulging out like balloons and shaking like jelly. Her appearance otherwise normal. Beggar with red growth on left side of face, protruding about 3" and extending from left eye to chin ? probably lupus. The fez sellers selling small gold braided caps for Ramadan. Saw man carry bundle of tarboushes 12? high
