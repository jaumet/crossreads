"E" Camp Needle Trench
22/12/16 A gun flash showed gun positions now and then and big shells were screaming overhead. Shrapnel puffs flecked the sky. The duckboards wound sinuously over the rises and at last we came to a series of trenches in which I found a dugout containing Col. Forbes from whom I gleaned some particulars. 2 men killed there today. Returned in the dark and feet very tired and sorefooted as boots were ill fitting and loose. We then took a wrong turning and were quite hopelessly lost for a time but at length came into camp and had a good tea and some liquid nourishment. Some had got parcels so the mess benefited to that extent. Issued operation and other orders during the evening and other orders during the evening and had a talk with Q.M. What a host of details one has to think of! The little "Pard" quite excited over the soup kitchen he is going to run. Some big shells going over. Went outside and got hopelessly bogged in the mud.
