<p>those days, amid dirty and disgusting surroundings too.&nbsp; Beer cheap and watery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wine dear and thick.&nbsp; Spirits high priced and quickly effective!!</p>
<p>Bailleul is a large railway centre.</p>
<p>We spend a good deal of our spare time in this town, while camped here.&nbsp; The &quot;jacks&quot; being ever on the alert for those who delay their departure after the prescribed time.&nbsp; Noted houses at times being searched, for those who fail to report back at camp.</p>
<p>While in this camp a certain number of men are picked out to be sent further &quot;back&quot; to a reinforcement camp, to form the nucleus of another battalion, should the existing one be practically annihilated in the forthcoming action.&nbsp; I am amongst the number chosen to remain behind.</p>
<p>While in this camp I suffer considerable pain from what I imagine to be rheumatism in the forearms and shins.&nbsp; The &quot;quack&quot; is of the opinion that I am suffering from trench-fever, and with the object of diagnosing my case asks many questions relating to my civil occupation, what hobbies I had, what manures I used on my flower garden, if I had any &quot;chats&quot; and questions which to my dull and uneducated mind appeared to have no bearing on the case at all.&nbsp; He said my case was most interesting.&nbsp; This of course pleased me greatly, but failed to relieve the pain.&nbsp; I think the cure was eventually effected by a shell which had me running all over the place.&nbsp; One of the quickest and most effective cures for most ills was a shell to burst in your vicinity, if you could&#39;nt get up and run, well!&nbsp;then there was something pretty wrong with you, and should result in your being sent &quot;back&quot; to the the base.&nbsp; A bomb dropped in your immediate locality would have much the same effect, only a little more so, perhaps.</p>
<p>&quot;Bombing&quot; had not come into fashion very much at this time, but it was not long before it became quite the &quot;rage&quot;.</p>
<p>We remained in this camp for a few days only, then those who had been chosen for the &quot;nucleus&quot; marched &quot;back&quot; to a camp near Hazelbrouck, and the others moved &quot;forward&quot; to take part in the historic and successful actions</p>
