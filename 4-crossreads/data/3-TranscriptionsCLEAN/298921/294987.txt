  
 January, 1915. Thursday, 14 Left Colombo at noon, a pretty Harbour & sight all these big boats steaming out. A lot of trouble over men leaving the ship & getting drunk. And many Rickshaws were broken out. I sent some Post Cards which I hope arrived safely - I bought some Mangos, PawPaws Bananas Green sweet oranges etc:- sufficient to see us to Aden. The Chief Officer got locked up in the civil gaol, & several of our men fell off the Anchor Chain trying to get on board.
