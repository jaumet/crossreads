<p>turned on the electric light &amp; the fan &ndash; good kidstakes- We asked to see some shawls &amp; scarfs, silk, good &amp; not dear in price. Out came endless shawls &amp; scarfs of various colours &amp; qualities, some magnificent work &amp; other cheap .  No amount of trouble is objectionable as they empty box after box &amp; explain each ones special points. How much ! is the most important question &amp; as expected out comes 25/- . No good &amp; up we got to leave. Hey sir! Sit down  don't go yet .We sat down again &amp; by dint of alternately feigning to leave &amp; sitting down again we beat him down to 10/- at which price we snapped it. Everywhere one goes it is the same, knocking prices down down &amp; down. There is no fear of him refusing to sell so long as he can make a fair profit. He will always call one back to try again.</p>
