<p>February 20, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Hopped out at 6</p>
<p>Caught cold during the night &amp; now am suffering for it, nothing doing today at all, only church.</p>
<p>Wrote letters home then went for a stroll down the Nile with the boys &amp; there watched them ploughing by means of a 4 furrow disc which is pulled backwards &amp; forwards between these two traction engines, they are about 120 yards apart &amp; the plough is on an endless rope, the engines move up the paddock as the work goes on.</p>
<p>The planes reported that the enemy was again stationary &amp; that we could have a little rest waiting for them, they also had a very successful mornings bombing at one place they blew half the camp to bits.</p>
<p>Had supper then went to bed at nine.</p>
<p>February 21, 1916 Monday</p>
<p>70 wks from home</p>
<p>Reveille at 6.30</p>
<p>Had a trip out to Hassan Pasha today, then on to Shusha, not bad going but bumpy the 2nd Regt have details at these places where they are doing patrol work.</p>
<p>Nothing has been reported for days so possibly we will get a move before long.</p>
<p>The aeroplanes have been very busy this last few days both in scouting &amp; flying, one came down heavily the other day &amp; damaged slightly his under carriage but nothing to speak of.</p>
<p>No mail &amp; no pay they go well together but trying at times but hold out hopes for [indecipherable] in a few days time.</p>
