<p>12/5/19<br/>Havre<br/>Today the men were put through a cleansing process &ndash; bathed reclothed steamed deloused and all their equipment taken from them. For me there was nothing doing and it was simply a day of loaf. In the evening we moved about &frac14; mile to another camp. The surrounding high ground all wood covered and very pretty. The Frenchman seems to place his houses very artistically and chooses fine vistas.</p>
<p>13/5/19<br/>Another very fine summery day. Motor lorries busily puffing about with kits &amp; blankets. Did nothing all day but at 5.30 pm went down to No. 3 Camp and met Major Storey and Red Cross Hayes. By motor lorry went into Havre. A nice run to the old port of Harfleur which is rich in historical memories. Saw an old field where one of the Henrys had a battle hundreds of years since. Reached Havre about 6</p>
