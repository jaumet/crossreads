4th A lot of details came in last night from England, some of them have been malingering there for 15 months more, must have been absolutely kicked out: or they would have never stirred
This morning the whole company were instructed how to load work a Lewis gun, a fine most necessary thing I reckon for it often happens that the whole crew of them get knocked out if you are in a tight corner they are just the thing, they are so light handy, they fire 47 shots in 5 secs so they are pretty fast while they were instructing us a shot was accidently fired
