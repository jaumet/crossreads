<p>3 or 4 a day</p>
<p>May 15th &ndash; 17<br/>At 8 oclock this morning we left Monument Wood and proceeded on our way towards "BERLIN",??, stopping at VELU Wood at 10.15AM</p>
<p>To reach this wood we came across country on our bikes up hill and down dale, which, covered in green grass looked to us like a huge piece of undulated green cloth.</p>
<p>This position here is very comfortable and as far as concealment is concerned it is. <strike>At</strike> as our huts are built into and down in an embankment</p>
