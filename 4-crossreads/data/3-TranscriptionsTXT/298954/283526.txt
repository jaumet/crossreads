 Wed. 26th Sept (cont.) In another was a picturesque little group of Asiatic women. 
 A little old woman was sitting in a deck chair, squatting around her was a pretty little kimono-clad Jap. woman, a Chinese girl in blue trousers and a little child. 
 This group were smiling and placidly chattering in marked contrast to the English women. 
 An enormous number of men were squatting around, many kimono-clad, others in white. 
 We were allowed on deck at about 8 pm to find the "Wolf" steaming on a set course at full speed with her prize at the port quarter. 
 Before we came on to the poop a few corpses could be seen lying on no 3 hatch.   They were put over the side at about 7 pm. 
 Thur. 27th Sept. Another burial at 8 am.   Nerger attended himself, together with his and the Jap. officers.
