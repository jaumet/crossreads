 Latest letters from Home were dated 27th May.   some of the earlier letters are to come along yet, they are wandering round, or perhaps waiting somewhere for someone to send them on    Say while I think of it one of the boys cut a small piece out of the paper here the other day  Re War Minister Pearce's Inquiries ..
