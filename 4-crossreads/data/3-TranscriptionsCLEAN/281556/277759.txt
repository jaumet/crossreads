wire where we lay low in holes for the 20th. Signal, which never came so about 1/2 hour later got orders to return to our own lines about 100 yds back. The fire was terribly fierce. Machine gun & Rifle grenades & shell fire & Fritz lit the place up like day with flares. We waited for a while till fire slackened & then got back . Dumped my gear to make matters easier. All wounded were brought in also some of 1st Div. who had been out 5 & 7 days. Stayed in front line passing ammunition & bombs & firing flares till daylight.
