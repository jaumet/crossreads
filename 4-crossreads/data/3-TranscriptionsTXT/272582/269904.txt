"Standard Maud" was used by itself. It was very coarse in grain and dark in colour, and when made into dough 'prooved' slightly quicker than pre-war flour. It will not stand as much 'proof' as the ordinary flour, which is accounted for by the lack of body. It requires a little more salt per sack to retard the fermentation in the trough. The amount of meal and other Commodities of like substance in its Composition help it to gather and retain the heat, thus necessitating the dough being set away at a slightly lower temperature. After being "divided" and 'moulded' to the required shape, the pieces of dough enlarge to the correct size slightly quicker than dough made from ordinary flour; therefore more careful handling is required so as to ensure that the dough has not too much "proof" before setting in the oven. The loaf produced is much darker in colour of course, but quite palatable, and otherwise satisfactory.58 NCO's and men baked 37,920 lb rations. Temp. B. 50. Fl. 46. W. 110 to 104. M. 47.
