28-4-16Fri 28thWe received a pay again today & the two-up school was in full swing before the paying was finished;  An order was issued to each village (48 of them) last night to supply 50 men from each to build roads & bridges across the Canal for the troops 4 miles this side of Ezbet-Sit-Houm, as the country the troops are camped on now at Ezbet will be flooded in a month or so;  The troops at Ezbet-Sit-Houm were told that they will be here for a considerable time, & there is some talk of a road & line being made out into the desert, where the Armoured Cars now are stationed;
Bassan came down here for a ride today;  Went in for a dip after tea & played cards as usual till bed time
