Needle Tr. Firing Line 
25/12/16 Xmas Day. Awakened at 2 a.m. and got up and issued orders for the shift tonight. Only 50 yards for H.Q. to go ? just across the duckboards there. The guns put up a heavy strafe about midnight, quite like old times, but the enemy's response was poor. Rations and hot tea and other foods are a great source of trouble. In the firing line we have 80 men and three officers doing nothing but superintend the coming up of the stuff and its issue. About 3 pm I crossed over relieved Duggan ? a much better dugout very deep and dry and comfortable. Much telephoning about guides c c. Our men left at 4 p.m. and started to file up in the dark. Their rations also started to arrive and the special carriers took charge of them. Major Main is in charge of the forward headquarters. McGregor two artillery officers messed with us. The former had received some parcels so we dined well. At 7.30 relief was proceeding well but one party got quite lost. Dog tired tonight but have to stay up all night.
