<p>14/6/17 Paris<br/>Up and out and 9 o'c and went by tube to the Opera. The Paris metro is first class. Here ordered some chocolate and then took a taxi to Gare du Nord and bought my ticket for tonight. Drove back to the Opera again and visited Lloyds Bank for some change. Returned to Hotel and met Ella and we went to Les invalides. All the open approach was covered with portable buildings for the fair which has just closed. In front of the building is a moat now full of grass. Along the terrace in front is a row of old guns. Entering we found all the place closed as usual, but an old man had permission to take officers &amp; their friends round. However, having seen it all before, we contented ourselves with a view of all the captured trophies in the courtyard ranging from field and machine guns to aeroplanes. Returned to hotel most of the way on foot owing to the difficulty of getting taxis &ndash; the drivers</p>
