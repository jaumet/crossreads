 1916&nbsp; THURSDAY 21&nbsp;&nbsp; DEC. 
 Raining &amp; Snowing all day &amp; bitterly cold all day. About the stables all day, just fooling about. The battery went on duty in evening &amp; I was on horse picket. 
 Roumers are flying round wholesale that we leave on the 28 th  Dec, but dont believe them.
