<p>Sister Davidson was jolly nice to me. She had a morning off, so we went for a drive round Ghegera Island and Shoubra and along the Nile and had tea at Groppies and a great old talk about Mudgee etc. Next day Miss Davidson and another sister invited me and another chap to tennis and afternoon tea at the Nurse&#39;s Club. It was very hot but we did have great fun and we drove back to Abbassis with them and it was lovely spinning along in the cool of the evening. Miss Davidson has a cousin down here, a patient in this hospital, and I have just been in to see him. He seems a good sort of chap and is in with boils and general desertitedness. i went to Church in Cairo Sunday morning and left that evening for Port Said. The military gave us free 3rd Class tickets down (over). It is getting near dinner time so I must stop. Good tucker here and I&#39;m getting fatter every day. Did I tell you that my poor old horse &nbsp;&#39;Suzanne&#39; was badly wounded in the scrap the other day. I am sorry as I have had here ever since Romani and she came with the original regiment. I hear Mr James is back, but not having received my mail for so long I dont know whether you saw him or not when he as home. Love to Father and the boys. I am Your loving son Robert C. Wilson</p>
