Arrive there &amp; entrain on S.E &amp; C.R Coy at mid-day and arrive in London at 3 pm. Escort of three destroyers &amp; crossing calm. The 3rd class carriages are luxurious after the French railways. To bed early after a bath.</p>
<p>Saturday 10<br/>Foggy to-day. Experience of travelling by the marvellous tube and omnibus. Visit bank, Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and Cleopatra's needle on the Thames embankment.
