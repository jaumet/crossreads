<p>Monday 18 [17] June 1917 [1918]<br/>Another &amp; my last week at 27th begins.<br/>1 white frock is lengthened for Pt. 25 &amp; they cost Pt. 2 to do up.  All badly done too.  Heat is fairly great but nights cool.  Crows cawing in the gums at my window sound very homelike &amp; the withering flowers in the garden.</p>
