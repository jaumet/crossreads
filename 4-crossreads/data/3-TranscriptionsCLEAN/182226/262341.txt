Still in Valletta but running short of cash. Met Mac & Norrie at 2.30 spent the afternoon with them.
Went & had tea & fooled round playing billiards etc. Took a run out to Mesieda [Msida] when we got to the ferry the last boat had gone so we went over in a gondola, we got back to camp at 1.30 a.m. We had only been in camp about 5 hours since Wednesday.
Everything was O.K. & we hadn't been missed.
