the Town was out of bounds to Soldiers although there is a large number quartered there. I was notified for a Special Train to remove a Big Gun at 9 Pm After the Petrol Engine which goes up to the end of the line with material stores for the troops had left we followed a few minutes later, we had two Officers two Guards riding on the front of the Engine, we have to have a Tarpaulin right from the Tender over the Cab of the Engine to prevent the Glare from the Firebox showing above the Cab, we cut small a hole in the Side for us to look out for Signals en route from the guard. We went along the Main line steady turned into the South loop about 2 Miles from Camp up into a Dead End were the big gun was I am told it is 9 ft longer than any gun along our part of the line. After coupling it on to our Engine we pulled it out of No 4 Dead End slowly shunted it along into No 5 Dead End, we placed it behind a Clump of Trees where there were a screen of Wire Netting behind above
