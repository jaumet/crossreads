19-5-1918, SundayQuiet day, weather still continues fine.  A bit of a stunt coming off tonight.  The Bty. opens fire at 8 p.m.  No officer in wagon line.  Our 15 pdr. went into action last night, gone forward, an anti-tank gun.  Enemy aeroplanes over again last night.  A few bombs were dropped as we say on the outer circle, a fair way from our lines.
20-5-1918Battery Sgt. Major Crittenden to go to St. Johns Wood (O.T.C.)  tomorrow.  Sgt. Torpey acting B.S.M.  Weather still good.  A few shells flying about.  Enemy planes fairly quiet.  The French made a slight advance on our left, captured 200 prisoners.
21-5-1918Quietness still prevails.  Weather remaining fine 80 deg. in the shade, seem terrible hot.  B.S.M.  Crittenden away.  Good bye and best of luck.
22-5-19181,350 rounds of ammunition to go to Bty.  Two enemy planes down last night.  A big stunt on
