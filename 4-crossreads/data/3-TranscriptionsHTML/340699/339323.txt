<p>to my present job as it is full of promise but I feel that I am not only going steadily back, but that, I am not in condition to do myself justice. To have gone right through the war too, would have been something; but, that sort of vain-glory doesn't pay.</p>
<p>BLANGY TROUVILLE<br/>France, 14/8/18.</p>
<p>I missed writing yesterday as everything was unsettled on account of a move. We made the move and then I moved back to the old place as, where I was before was a good place to work and the new was not. But in new hands the old place had no food to give me so I had to hop a lorry and get out to the camp again for a meal. During the earlier part of the day I went to see the M. 0. but he was too busy - in fact wasn't on the scene. After my meal in the woods I went to the salvage and from Captain Viner got a brand new Hun uniform. I got it for illustration purposes, but I hope I don't need to use it. Disappointment has turned this job into a hateful one. This morning, in order to rectify my meal-less state I thought of going to Corps and seeing if an old acquaintance there - now a Captain - could do anything for me. The way in which he told me what I ought to do would have made me laugh outright but for his 3 stars and scarlet patches. It was a case for saying "What the deuce do you think you're talking about anyway?" But as it was I just carefully explained my position to him. He then agreed to do what I at first had asked of him - adding that, a little sketch for him, etc.... The fraudulency of it all! The opportunity this militarism presents for putting pressure on one! The war won't be of any use unless it discredits it, I notice the growth of Prussianism in the army all along - a state of affairs foreign to the very principle of Australia. I don't want any commission on these terms, but want to get out and collect the tag ends of my health together and get back to you and our children. As soon as I can I'll see the M. 0. and put forward my application. We've still got the weather and thought Jerry is putting up a stiffer resistance, I don't believe the push has yet stopped. However this is only guesswork, as I hear nothing and moreover don't want to hear anything.</p>
