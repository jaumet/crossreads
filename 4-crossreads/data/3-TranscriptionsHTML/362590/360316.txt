<p>R.M.S. Makura<br/>Off Honolulu<br/>Feb 4/16<br/>My dear Ferguson</p>
<p>Just a line to let you know that all so far is well. We reach Honolulu tomorrow &amp; Vancouver on the 11th &amp; should be in England about the end of the month.</p>
<p>I begin to see quite clearly what has to be done there &amp; am hopeful of doing some of it. The time at my disposal is far too short. Well by going full speed ahead I hope to get through somehow.</p>
<p>Hoping all is well with you</p>
<p>W.M. Hughes [Prime Minister]</p>
