<p>SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine, but cold with an odd</p>
<p>snowflake dropping now &amp;</p>
<p>then. Went out to the Bank</p>
<p>in the morning. Alan came</p>
<p>down &amp; we both had lunch</p>
<p>with Jack Bridges at the Bath</p>
<p>club. Went to &quot;Oh Joy&quot; at the</p>
<p>Kingsway theatre after &amp; it</p>
<p>was the best show I have</p>
<p>seen over this side. I enjoyed</p>
<p>every minute of it.</p>
