<p>France,<br/>30th October 1914.</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>Before I forget it I have to thank you for another parcel which came along a few days ago, containing a shirt, socks etc.  Have been getting them regularly lately.  Also please tell Father that I have had the American Magazines he has been sending, also Bulletins etc., so have been doing pretty well.</p>
<p>Well there is nothing much to write about now.  It has been raining incessantly for a week or more, and things are very miserable all round, and on top of that I have had a lovely cold from wet feet, which I am just getting rid of.</p>
<p>We have again had a shift, but this time a miracle happened, and we were transported in Motor Cars.  Had about a seven hours ride in them, but there was a drawback, we had to March six miles in pouring rain and then had to sit cramped up all the way with wet feet.  Hence the cold.</p>
<p>Thanks very much to you all for the numerous Xmas parcels you are sending me.  I only hope that we will be out of the trenches, and so be able to enjoy them to the full.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Billy not long ago, saying he expected to be on his way over here shortly, so hope to see him soon, and also a number of mates in the 3rd Division.</p>
<p>I had hoped to be able to send you a Photo for Christmas, but they haven't turned up yet.  I had two as samples and sent one to Margaret and one to Egypt.  They are not too brilliant, but I suppose the subject wasn't too brilliant either.  I have never seen anyone yet satisfied with their own Photos, so perhaps you May be better pleased than I am.</p>
<p>Well, I've run out as usual and will end up by sending everybody my best wishes for a very Happy Christmas, and I hope to be able to say it in person next year.</p>
<p>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
