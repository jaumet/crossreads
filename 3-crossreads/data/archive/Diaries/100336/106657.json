This meant that the after part of the boat and the top of the bridge were showing above water.  This was indeed alarming as we were surrounded by forts.  We could hear the shells striking the water and buroting outside.  At this stage the Captain Stoker told us to remain cool and all would go well.

We were soon delighted to see by the depth gauge that we were moving off into deep water and we were soon down to 80 feet, as if nothing had happened.

We kept on this course and ran into a big bay on the Asiatic side just above Point Nagara, the Captain looking through the periscope, saw that we had misled our enemies, not having sufficient electricity left in our batteries to take us into the sea of Marmora the only thing we could do was to lay on the bottom and wait till nightfall when we could come onto the surface and charge our batteries.
