  
 (30) The town of Armentieres had a pre-war population of about 25,000. It was apparently very prosperous, being one of the smaller towns around Lille, the great iron and manufacturing centre of northern France. It also has large jute factories of its own, and of course large breweries. The town is set on flat ground partly beside the wandering Lys River or Canal. It seems to consist of an old and a new part and is on the whole a comparatively pretty town with its college quarter, modern commercial quarter and a few parks and avenues. 
 Our division was holding the whole of the Armentieres salient. Our ambulance working with the infantry holding the right half of the 3 sectors. Thus we spent our first Christmas in France, most of the men being in the billets at the Institute St.Jude. Here on Xmas day the fatigues were few and the mutual greetings many. During the morning each man received from the Co's hands a card board box of comforts and a fine plum pudding from the Aust. Comforts Fund.
