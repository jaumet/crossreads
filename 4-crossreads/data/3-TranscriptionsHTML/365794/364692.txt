<p>Tuesday 16 October 1917<br/>Recovered from paroty. inj. (mx) I think was the dose.  Still [indecipherable] &amp; perspiring freely.  S. Macdonald very trying to live with in our little cabin, however taking things altogether we pull along fairly well.<br/>S. Watson objecting to sponging for temp. &ndash; says never saw it done for bronchitis etc.  2 sisters by day 2 by night for her nurses.  What does she think of us all I wonder?<br/>Long rays of light across the water said to be phosphorus and lights seen at intervals by [indecipherable] sisters.  O for a friend to relate all the funny incidents of this trip &amp; to talk things over with.</p>
