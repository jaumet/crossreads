 KANTARA 
 Left at 5 a.m. BIR EL ABD for ZEITOUN, will be glad for the change after 3 months of Desert. I get 3 weeks then back to the CRUSADE again. 
 On arrival KANTARA, [the following crossed through] no arrangements had been made for 109 of us, no Transport or Trucks! 
 Fortunately a REST CAMP run by Mrs. W. CHISHOLM fed all ranks at a nominal cost - MISS McPHILLAM helps & Australians & N.Z.s all very thankful for the work these Ladies do, for the SOLDIERS & officers. It is indeed practical WAR work of the best kind. STONE Railway Stations are now being built & the old places we knew in their early desert life have much changed.
