 I am very busy these days &amp; I have such heaps of letters to write.  I always keep the Mater's going &amp; yours &amp; Bringagee but I'm afraid others must reckon I'm an ungrateful &amp; forgetting pig. 
 Am dying to read your book.  Did you get the scarf I sent, I hope so.  Well my dear I must close tonight.  Shall send you a photo taken in Paris soon.  I hope Alison is well.  How is Mrs. Kathryn.  I'm sorry Tom isn't behaving. 
 Will try &amp; write some more in the morning. 
 Wilk. 
 I've been reading your letters over again, I simply can't say what I feel but I'm that proud &amp; grateful when I see what a pal I appear to be &amp; I simply cannot express what it means to me.  You are an absolute dear &amp; a brick &amp; the Boss is a trump.  I wish I could fly back.  You don't know how I miss &amp; long for you &amp; the dear old place.  I put things so rottenly but I feel sure you understand.  I'm not a praying sort either &amp; lots of things lately have made me less than ever that way but I think "God bless her"
