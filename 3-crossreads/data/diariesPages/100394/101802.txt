On picquet today. Had 9 rolls of films developed in Cairo. Some very good photos among them. Will send some home as soon as I am able but we are not allowed to send through post just now.

Nothing heard of our transfers yet. We have been seeing a good many officers trying to get them to put in a word for us. Great rumours flying round about going to France and I think we will eventually.

March 7
46 men and some officers have joined us from the 4th L.H.F.A. Col. Howe is now in charge of us. We are going in on leave to Cairo tomorrow, but we intend catching tonight’s train in. Got into Cairo about midnight and took cab to Khedevial Hotel 5/- bed & breakfast os Cropley and myself

Enjoyed a beautiful rest between sheets. First since leaving home. How splendid hot bath and breakfasted. Went out to Ghezireh. They are all packed up with orders for France. Called in and saw [indecipherable] & Mrs. Connor for a few minutes. Lunched at St Jame’s. Went and saw Hilda and afterwards some shopping. Dined at Petrograd and caught train at 7 pm for camp.
