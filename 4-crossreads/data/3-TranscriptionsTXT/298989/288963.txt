25/1/16Bitterly cold in early morning and ground hard full of pebbles about the size of a marble. One of the old heads remarked to a mate "Five months ago we'd have been excited to think we were off to the front in an hour or two - now we merely regard it as a bloody nuisance!". Rain just before dawn added to the discontent of the bivouac. All loaded up to the eyes marched out on to desert field piled arms & then sat down. Detached 4 platoons and cleaned the camp site up.
Left for station at 0920 and entraining. Open trucks 35 men to each, and the horses in closed trucks. The entrainment quietly and speedily carried out and train ready to leave. Niggers calling out "B paper Egyptian mail one piast", "Orankis big one!". The country we passed through was verdant vegetation on one side barren desert on the other. Reached Moascur and disentrained - fine railway yards and then marched along side of Sweet Water Canal. Bitter Lake & Suez Canal on our right. Warships on the lakes . Marched through Ismailia a fine place, much bigger than one would judge viewing it from a ship in the Canal, reminded one very much of Colombo. Green avenue of bean trees, motor track, fine houses (French) all ablaze with scarlet and indigo creepers, lovely gardens. Plenty of motor cars & other motor transport. Saw Generals Legge & Godley.
Crossed Canal on a pontoon bridge and reached camp site. Collected our tents, sited the camp and within one hour of marching in were comfortable in tents all laid out correctly and smart. Tea before dark. Right in the desert, there are plenty of camels and trenches and entanglements near the Canal. The 8th. Brigade are here. Our march discipline today was rotten, reinforcements the trouble and want tuning up.
