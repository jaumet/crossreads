<p>The prisoner's trust in the British Navy has been sorely shaken by the safe return of "Wolf" to Germany, but despite the irritation the tension has now lifted &ndash; all are glad that the issue has been decided in some manner.   The strangest thing is the attitude of the German crew &ndash; they seem by no means delighted at the proximity of the Fatherland.</p>
<p>And naturally, since they will be drafted either to other raiders or to submarines after a short holiday.</p>
<p>"Wolf" is pushing down the coast of Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
<p>She is quite unescorted &ndash; many fishing craft in the offing.</p>
<p>What is apparently the mainland is clearly visible on our starboard beam.   It is a clear, bright wintry day &ndash; the little red roofed towns with their windmills and fir-tree backgrounds are quite free from snow.</p>
