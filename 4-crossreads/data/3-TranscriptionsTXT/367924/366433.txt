 Still on the Move 23rd Nov 1917 
 Dear Aunt Just a few lines to let you know that I am still well &amp; trust that you are all the same. Well I received a tin of Cocoa &amp; one tin of Health Salts from you yesterday but no socks or the parcel from Rodgers yet. 
 Well I have only time to scribble a few words as, we are likely to move at any moment, we have been on the move  no  for just on a month now, I will be able to write you a very interesting letter when we get in a settled Camp again, I have seen a great deal since writing you last. 
 Just fancy Alie looking on your neck for my Photo she must have a great memory alright. My word the boss payed a good price for those sheep he bought at the sale, they must be good ones. I hope that Nell has been over with you before now. 
 Well I must close now with wishing you all A Merry Xmas &amp; A Happy New Year, Take every Care of yourself 
 I remain Your Ever Loving W. Weaber 
 Kind Regards to Birt &amp; His Wife
