 war, and the old Chateau with windows empty of glass like sad eyes, looks down on the once happy garden - once a pleasaunce, now --- 
    What a glorious place before the war, and what a heartbreak to the Chateline if she returns to it after the war, for the destruction has only commenced. 
    France has lately deserved her title of "Sunny France", the days have been warm and clear, the nights clear and moonlit, almost too clear for it favours night bombing and although no bombs have so far been near us (touch wood) four planes came over us last night, they were caught by several searchlights and covered for many minutes while Archie (Anti-Aircraft-Artillery) and Lewis Guns hammered away at them, two were brought down and will not see the "Fatherland" again.  The Gothas when caught and outlined by searchlights are very beautiful, they seem like great golden butterflies hight in the air. 
    'Tis steamingly hot in this mess-room, so close to the cooking, so I think I will away to my cool tent. 
    Loving wishes, 
       HAROLD.
