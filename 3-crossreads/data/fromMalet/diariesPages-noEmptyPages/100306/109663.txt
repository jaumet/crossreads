16/1/17 Firing Line ? Ginchy
Aroused at 2.30 am by heavy cannonade and sprang out to ?phones at once and had an anxious Brigadier to pacify. Soon found it was well away from us and we only got some shoot-overs. The firing line stood to arms. Carried on at 3 am all being then normal. Back to bunk for a couple of hours. The Germans had put a spring (French) mattress in here and very comfortable it is but the warmth of one's body brings out the hordes of lice which infest it and it is not easy to get to sleep. At the present time I am horribly lousy in the head in addition to the body. Up at 5 am and checked intelligence and found a wad of correspondence wanting attention and a complaint from 7.F.Co.E. that we had left our trenches in a dirty state at Needle. Damned annoyed. Had Hogarth up and put the acid on to some tune regarding the matter. Quiet afternoon and evening until 7.30 pm when we had a little stunt on a strong post firing 60 bombs. Fritz at once sent up orange clusters and put a barrage of 5.9 and 77 stuff across. Some one away
