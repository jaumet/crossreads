the soil here is chalk.  Opposite crowning the slope are a few
ragged stumps, fragments of tree trunks some 10 feet high, with
bits of splintered lower branches sticking from them and this
marks where Ovillers used to be.  You would not know it but for
the tree fragments but when you look you see that there is a quantity
of broken brick and stone mixed up with the kneaded earth, and also
you come to a hole in the ground which being square and lined with
brick is obviously not a shell hole, but must be a cellar which once
had a house above it.  No village could be more destroyed because
there is nothing left but a few half filled up cellars:  of buildings
there are none.  Underground it is different.  Here again the
enemy had constructed elaborate dugouts to aid him in the defense of
the village for he well knew the importance of making a strongpoint
of a village, as possibly no type of fighting yields the number of
casualties to an attacking force as does village or street fighting
where every nook and cranny seems to shelter a machine gun.  It was
estimated that the dugouts in this village could hold, and did hold,
2.000 Germans.  It is doubtless true and one fears from the smell
that they hold many yet.  We went down into several though the
entrances to most are battered in by shells, and groped about
among the litter and darkness.  One great dugout here was found to
contain no less than 80 dead Germans which gave rise to the opinion
that during the desperate fighting it was used as a sort of vault
into which the dead were thrown with the intention sometime of

enemy's departure though was more durried than they expected and
the job was left for us to finish.  Another large dugout there is
which the Germans used as a dressing station.  It is admirably
constructed and has besides the main entrance from a trench, another
