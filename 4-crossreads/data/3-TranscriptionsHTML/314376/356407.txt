<p>96<br/>had to wade through water which reached up to my knees.</p>
<p>All this you can see is before I had started any duty, covered with mud and soaked through as regard my legs. I eventually reported to the N.C.O. in charge and was appointed my position as sentry, along with the others. How cold it was! To make matters worse rain started to fall.</p>
<p>We were standing on duckboards which gradually, with the rain and soft mud, became more and more submerged. We had no dugouts and when off duty would sit on a ledge and covering ourselves as best we could with our waterproofs and our legs dangling in the water at the bottom of the trench</p>
