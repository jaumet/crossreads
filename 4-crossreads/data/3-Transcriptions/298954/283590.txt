<p>1918<br/>Sun 24th Feb.<br/>I did a little towards returning the courtesy by extending my paw to the wooden Fritz standing stiffly at attention beside Doc.   He )Fritz.) has really been most incompetent and slovenly on board but he meant well, poor blighter!    A last wave to the mixed mob hanging over the poop rails and we were threading our way through the decorated lines of cruisers to the shore.</p>
<p>We passed the "Mowe" and the N.D.L. training ship "Kronprinz" finally landing at a jetty jutting out between two hulk-barrack, (arranged a la "Penguin" in Sydney Harbour.)</p>
<p>Apparently the whole man-power of the German Navy with their families were gathered at the head of that jetty to watch us land.</p>
