Had breakfast at nine consisting of two omelettes, ham, grilled chops, etc, then went for a stroll down the street to collect goods. Spent the day hanging about eating, eating, had a good dinner spent the afternoon in the lounge. At four oclock had tea then made off for the tram which we caught OK at 6.30 arriving about 7 at Kantara, had a lovely swim in the canal for about an hour then retraced our steps to the R.T.O's office where we put in the night sleeping on its hard sandy floors, a bitter contrast to the sleeping apartments of only last night.
