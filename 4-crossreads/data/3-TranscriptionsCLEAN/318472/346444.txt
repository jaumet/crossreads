  
 7 August 1918 Wednesday Reported "Ambulance" Transport torpedoed & 123 lives lost. Should have crossed the "Line" some time today We are having remarkably cool weather considering our position Just a nice lively sea & a cool breez. Nothing of importance to note. 
 1918 August 8 Friday A beautiful fine cool day with a light breeze blowing. Nothing of any importance reported. We "lifted" the Southern Cross last night - the first time I have seen it for nearly four years. A very welcome sight.
