 Yarned with Colonel Travers for a long time.  Heard a furphy that Capt. Hunter had died of his wounds.   This lacks confirmation as yet.   Thewlis came down from the line first and one could see that he was tired out.   I sent up a limber to bring out the captured M.g's. and other trophies.   All the chaps came down very late and quite tired out with their experiences.   Old Habel had a good dinner ready for them and they were soon all chattering about the number of Huns they had killed and all their experiences of blood.   A frequent remark was on the callousness of many of the men.   A rather critical situation was saved by Abercrombie and others on the left of A Co where their flank got well up in the air and some fainthearts started to go back.   A bayonet sent after them persuading them that safety lay forward proved a good thing.   Our star seems to have been Sergeant "Rusty" Ruthven whom I intend to recommend for a V.C.   Madden is also said to have done good work.   Smith was in charge of a limber full of machine guns which we sent down and we also brought out a minnen werfer gun. 
 Turned in after yarning with Matthews just as day broke
