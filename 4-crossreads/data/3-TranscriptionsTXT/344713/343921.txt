 Tues. Nov. 7th: - Received Aussie mail dated Aug. 27th. 
 Wed. Nov. 8th: - Worked on fatigue at hillside neat a "Tommy": howitzer battery building a tunnel for Winter "possies". A shell coming over killed a officer &amp; wounded 4 others. May as well be in line as then we wouldn't have to be doing hard-graft night &amp; day. 
 Thurs. Nov. 9th: - Pay-day. Received 50 francs. Nothing to do it on here except cards &amp; the "National game". The padre ran a bit of a canteen but his stock soon ran out. Received mail dated Sept. 16th. 
 Mon. Nov. 13th: - Left the "humpies" on road at Delville &amp; went back about a mile to possies near Bernafay where we are to do the night. Mud still keeping us company &amp;  we have two 6 inch naval guns firing over us from about 50 yds back. "Fritz" naturally tries searching for them &amp; two of our chaps got wounded as soon as we got here. I think we go right back for a wash &amp; "spell" 4th Division took over from us &amp; we won't be trailing along Cocoa Lane or Flare Alley for a while.
