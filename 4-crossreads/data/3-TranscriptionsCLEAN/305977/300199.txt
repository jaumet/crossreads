  
 April 1915 Thursday 15th Went out in the morning & occupied our perimeter camp & our various positions detailed.  In the afternoon B Squadron had some cricket practice.  At night the whole regiment went to demonstrate how you can pick out various bodies of men in the darkness advancing in different positions.  We also went through squadron drill, the orders being quietly passed down the line.  Came in about 10pm. 
 Friday 16th Squadron went out, & our troop was detailed as scouts to find out positions of a supposed enemy & also the position of a force we were supposed to connect with.  Certain men were put out with information which we had to collect & make deductions from.  It was good experience.
