<p>Doctor to be sent back as soon as possible.  I went back &amp; got Williams rifle for one of the men who had a cutlass then by that time Dr Pockley came back &amp; attended to Williams.<br/>He thanked me for bringing him back &amp; said nothing could be done for him, told me to get help &amp; take him back to the base which I did.  Previous to starting Dr Pockley took his Red Cross brassard from his arm &amp; put it round my white hat.  I asked him how he would manage without one.  He said he would be alright.  Not long after arriving at base Dr Pockley arrived also shot through chest &amp; out through the back.<br/>I spoke to him &amp; from it understood him to say he was shot about the same place as W.  From the nature of the wounds I [indecipherable] they must have been shot from a tree with dum-dum or explosive bullets &amp; that is my own experience of the affair.  After a few [indecipherable] &amp; gave the brassard to Eng R A Rial [?] (Royle?) to send to Dr Pockleys mother</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours obediently<br/>William Kember</p>
