 August 1915 Wednesday 18 Fine. Nothing to record. The same old monotonous "lookouts" up on the parapets the same sniping the same guns banging and knocking our a parapets about  "Drat 'em"  we get enough to do without always building up parapets. 
 Thursday 19 Cloudy cool. Big drops of rain fell last night and have been threatening to fall all day. Borrowed a halfcrown off private Duffy to get a few luzuries off the "Canteen ship". The Major went down to try  &amp; get the articles for us but found that it contained nothing. No stores on board.
