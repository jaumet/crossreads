Some of the Kensington people came to see me yesterday. They promise me a good time when I get my sick furlough. This is the quietest New Years Eve I have ever known, but I have never known a better one.
8th January.1918.
Was to have left here today, but the Sister-in Charge, reckoned I was not fit to travel the distance to Harefield in Middlesex. So I was not moved. I am utterly mystified with my condition, I seem only a shadow of my old self; and I'm just like a broken down horse. Anyhow this rest treatment, if it does me no good, it can do no harm.

Have been out of bed two days, feel a heap better though very wobbly on my legs. Am to be transferred to Harefield tomorrow.
