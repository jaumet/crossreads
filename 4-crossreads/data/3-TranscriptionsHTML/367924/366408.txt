<p>Have you seen Nell yet. I hope you will have seen her before you recieve this letter.</p>
<p>Well we whent out to one of the very old Native Temples called Keleani Temple seven miles out, the place is simply wonderfull, we saw their Budha God a bronze figure about thirty feet long. The Temple must be about Fifteen Hundred years old. I am sending you a leaf off the Sacred Tree of God also a certificate to show that I have crossed the Equator of course it is only just a novelty.</p>
<p>The leaf is of a tree that is supposed to be hundreds of years old and a sacred one at that. You must take off your boots to go in most of these Temples. There is no Draught Horses here at all, all the work is done with one or two little Bollocks with the hump on there neck and it is surprising the loads they can pull, then you see a family driving along at a trot with a little bullock in the shafts.</p>
<p>We saw a Funeral a Native one they use mostly grey horses at their Funeral then the next morning we saw a Native Wedding and I can tell you the Girl was done up in a lovely white dress and enought jewellery to start an ordinary jewellers shop with.</p>
<p>My pal Debnam had a birthday last Wednesday he was 55 years old, We stick together every where, he is a fine Pal.</p>
<p>Well I am satisfied that the closer you get to the war the less we know about it, as we could get no news at the last place at all we all miss our papers. Well I can tell you I will be pleased to get some news from home. Well Mother do what you can for Nell and Baby for my sake, as she is good to me.</p>
