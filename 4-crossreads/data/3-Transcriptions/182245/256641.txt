<p>Fine, but cool &amp; windy. There was</p>
<p>a church parade in morning</p>
<p>but I did not go. We had to</p>
<p>shift all our harness from</p>
<p>the stables to the harness</p>
<p>rooms &amp; it was inspected by</p>
<p>Lieut Waller. We had a half</p>
<p>holiday in afternoon &amp; were paid</p>
<p>in evening. We played the</p>
<p>&quot;Pommies&quot; soccer in evening</p>
<p>&amp; it was a draw.</p>
