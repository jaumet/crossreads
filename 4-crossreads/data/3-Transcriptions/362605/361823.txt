<p>1st class fare standing on one leg on the Back platform &amp; 2nd class on a nice seat inside.</p>
<p>Well, my Dear ones, it is dinner time now &amp; I am ready as usual.  I had my afternoon off yesterday but I only went for a long walk on the sea-front &amp; there was nothing remarkable to be seen.</p>
<p>Kindest Regards to all my acquaintances which I hope to be able to renew in a few months time.</p>
<p>Best Love from<br/>Harry</p>
