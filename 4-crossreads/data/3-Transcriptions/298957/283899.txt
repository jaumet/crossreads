<p>27th Dec. (Monday) Today I had the job of sewing bags together for a roof to the dug-out. Judging by the measurements of this dug out it displaces about 60 tons of sand. Had my hair cut right off for the first time. Most of the others had theirs done on the boat. Indian Camel Corps sighted 12 Turkish scouts only three miles out and the information has been sent back to headquarters.</p>
<p>28th Dec. (Tuesday) Completed dugout and trench leading into it. Indians report having again sighted Turkish outposts. Nothing else of importance today.</p>
