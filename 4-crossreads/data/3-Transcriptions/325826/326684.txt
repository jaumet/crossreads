<p>Box Hill  15.7.15<br/>R 16.7.15<br/>P.S. Tell Wal when you see him please that I got a nice little spoon &amp; fork set with my initials on it.   (Initials)<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>I have not yet had to say good-by to my dear husband &amp; we have still to-day.  We have found quite a lot of shopping &amp; things to fix up in Melbourne &amp; it is indeed a good thing that the boat was postponed.  We are going to have a few hours together in the gardens this afternoon &amp; let everything else go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a few lines from Emily this morning &amp; she told me that you had rung up, Father, &amp; were a bit better.  I was so very glad to hear it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is bitterly cold on the hands &amp; feet here, one could almost cry out with the pain of it, &amp; that is why my writing is so laboured.<br/>Rid has to be on board about noon to-morrow but when the boat sails we do not know.  I can't make up my mind yet how soon I will return, I am anxious to do so &amp; yet dread it.<br/>Love to the boys &amp; An &amp; to your dear selves.<br/>Ollie.</p>
