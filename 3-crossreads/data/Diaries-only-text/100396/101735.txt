I guess you have read in print what horribly bad chaps the fellows are out here. don't believe them it for they aren't true. individually some of them aren't up to much have played up, these are being gradually weeded out, others are suffering from acts of folly on their own part, which they term bad luck. There are I believe about 600 of them they won't have much chance of going to the front with us, if we go. in things military the majority have to suffer for a few.
