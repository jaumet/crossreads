  
 Is your leg quite better, I hope so.  I saw Bert Macnamara the other day & he asked after you. 
 Now my dear I must flee.  I'm very homesick for you all.  I do hope the blessed war doesn't spread over another winter, it would be a terrible blow but as the opera hath it "Oh I fear it". 
 I must flee, its too cold to stay up, so I'll to bed. 
 Love to Mac, Graham & the Boss & yourself muchly 
 Yours as ever Jim Wilkie
