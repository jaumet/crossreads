compared with our previous winters.
Up to date we have had no snow, whereas we had it in Oct last year and the year before.
Even the cold weather has not been so severe, certainly one or two frosts but no more. But what this winter has lacked in coldness has been made up for with wetness.
Now we are only a few days off Xmas again and the boys are all happy and this Xmas promises to be a very happy and cheerful one, in fact a Victory Xmas.
All our arrangements
