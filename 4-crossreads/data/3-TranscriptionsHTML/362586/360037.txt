<p>Letter from Arthur Ferguson probably sent in above envelope]<br/>France<br/>12th June 1916</p>
<p>My Dear Uncle,<br/>Your hope was not in vain.  I am well and whole, and in fairly comfortable quarters and also that you may soon hear from me again I am writing straight away.  Although we are supposed to be in the middle of summer here, some days are as cold as they can well be, and for the last few day it has been raining fairly continuously.  Rain is not pleasant at any time, but when you are in the trenches it goes far from improving general conditions.  The only redeaming [sic] feature it has, is that there is not so much danger of stopping a large shell, &amp; the feeling of security it thus affords is quite restful.</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear that you are all well, &amp; wish I had a chance of seeing you all again.  What a pity Ethel didn't go to Sydney about a year earlier, still if the war keeps on going as favourably as at present I might see her</p>
