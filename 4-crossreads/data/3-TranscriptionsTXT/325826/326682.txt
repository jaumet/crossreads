R  14.7.15  Ansd 15.7.15The Train. 12 PM TuesdayMy dear Father,Just a few lines to post in Melbourne to let you know of our safe arrival & also to ask you how you are.   We felt very anxious all yesterday & last night about you, specially after seeing Uncle Gus, for I knew then that you were worse than you had allowed us to know, & to have Mother so unwell & An with a bad cold makes it so very hard for you all.  What I specially wanted to ask you is to get An to drop me a few lines to tell me how you are, it would be such a relief to know per I feel it very much travelling away & away from you when you are so unwell & poor little Mother not herself either.  The address is c/o C. Oakley, Hopetown Parade, Box Hill.It has been a very comfortable trip over, we had a nice little compartment all to ourselves & as it was a sleeping compartment we were able to go to bed & have a good rest.  Rid's arm is still bad but he himself is better.  We had the most awful rush round on Monday right up till the last moment because Rid was kept three hours at the Barracks instead of the one we had allowed.It has not been very cold though colder than Sydney.  We are going right into rain now.  There are two other chaplains on board, Father Tighe (one from N. Sydney) is very decent.  Colonel Prescott & over 30 others were down at the train to see Rid off.  Much love to you & allOllie.
