 August 7th 1917 This is the anniversary of my  birthday  wound last year, but I'm not too bad &amp; will be about again in about a month, will try and get to England then later perhaps to Australia if possible  Anyway I'm safely wounded now &ndash; My notes will give you some idea of what went on &ndash; the Brown horse Albert gave me was killed by a bomb on the lines &ndash; the smaller horse was killed under me by a shell before I was hit myself &ndash; The Cables will have given you the military news, but we well &amp; truly strafed the Turks &amp; there are now 4600 of them safely interned in Cairo &ndash; After being hit I lay on the sand with the wind knocked out of me , a N. Zealander came &amp; offered one of his horses which [indecipherable] I rode to the Field Ambulance, was put on a Table, given a dose of ether &amp; bit of shell taken out, bandaged up, given a whisky &amp; cup of Bovril &amp; started for the Hospital &ndash; Here I am, Electric Fan is buzzing, clean sheets, flowers, music everything a man could wish for, &amp;the Turks were good [indecipherable]  to send me here We are in a big building Napoleon built for his soldiers long ago at Aygassom 
 [Margin Note] The papers will tell you about the fight, the Light Horse did it. It was their day out.
