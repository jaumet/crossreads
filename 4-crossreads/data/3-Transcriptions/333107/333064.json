<p>Tues July 30</p>
<p>The car in which we were learning to drive id broken down, so it looks as tho' we have finished driving Lessons. I've heard no more about getting on a Boat Roll and I'm afraid my chances are very poor.</p>
<p>Wed 31</p>
<p>The weather is very unsettled, and the Holiday makers are having a bad time. There are about 40 attending the Motor School now, and it is simply a scramble to get hold of any tools.</p>
<p>Thur Aug 1st</p>
<p>Another month gone, and I seem as far away from a Boat Roll as ever. The war news is good and Fritz is falling back all along the line.</p>
<p>Fri Aug 2<br/>Went into Y.M.C.A. and sat for Exam to see how much we had learnt about motor engines. We had to answer 26 out of 30 questions. Most of us managed to get thro' them.</p>
<p>Peter took a photo of us in the Motor School.</p>
<p>Sat Aug 3<br/>The result of the Exam came out today and I was 3rd on the List with 95 marks. Harling was first And Cpl Gordon second. We are finished up now at the Motor School so we are expecting to be grabbed for a Job.</p>
