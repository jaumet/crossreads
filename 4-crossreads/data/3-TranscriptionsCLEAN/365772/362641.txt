been hit. I dont think I told you how I got hit. We had rushed a position on top of a hill & took up our position just over the skyline facing a hill opposite on which the Turks were strongly intrenched, this was about 4 in the afternoon & when I looked about me after the first bit of excitement wore off I found myself with 7 New Zealanders including an officer, we were about 15 yards in advance of the rest of the firing line, about dark the officer suggested we should go back as we might get shot by our own men when darkness fell, so back we went & I got one in the arm & another in the leg as soon as I got up.Well Lizzie dear I will close now with fondest love to self R & B from your loving brother Ken
