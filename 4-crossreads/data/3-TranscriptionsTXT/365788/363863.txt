3at Ghezireh I saw Beatrice Russel-Glasson. Poor girl she had had an attack of Scarlet Fever & by good luck got there the day they allowed her out for the first time,  so I took her out for one hour's drive & then to Groppi's & over to the Hospital & I think she liked it. There are only about 3 of the old officers at Ghezireh & 20 of the old orderlies.I suppose you know that Col. Martin is now a C.M.G.Got a great surprise the other day here. Who should turn up but Arthur Colvin with whom I went to The King's School & was in the same class for Latin Greek & French! He got his degree some years ago & is of course a Capt.
