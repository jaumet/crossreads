<p>days I cannot help being just a little sad, it recalled to my mind a little verse I saw since<br/>La vie est breve<br/>Un peu d'espoir<br/>Un peu de reve<br/>Et puis- Bon soir.<br/>And it is so very very true too, isn't it?  Many of these poor lads have had their dreams, their ambitions but alas! For them it has truly been Et puis-Bon soir.<br/>To-morrow Im going to the hospital ship to see George before he sails but Im afraid it for him as those others it is- Bon soir.<br/>But I must tell you some news.  For days we have seen the inflated hides of floating mules bobbing about in the Bay but yesterday we saw something come floating in, it was a cask and more followed and all along the shore were busy helping them</p>
