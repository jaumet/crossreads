<p>28/9/15  after having it once. Have tied grappling irons on to rocket and are going to fire it to see how far it will carry the irons. After the experiment we will fire it over at Abdul and then all hands on to the rope to pull his entanglements in with the grappling irons. What a joke if it goes over their trench and they catch hold of the end and pull too. A tug of (real) war!</p>
<p>The rocket experiment a failure, went the wrong way owing to the weights being unevenly balanced and landed down in the ravine. It seems a job for a daring man and a dark night &ndash; fixing it on the entanglements. Aeroplanes up while Turks artillery firing, seemed to signal result of shots by a gun carried in the 'plane. Probably machine gun. One of ours last night came very low over them about 0000 and they let go a furious fusillade of rifle fire.</p>
