we have been looking forward to so long, happened, we steamed slowly ahead to France. Passing along between the rocky land on either side the city of Marseilles came, slowly into view. Wharves in every direction and ships of every nationality loading and unloading their cargoes. Just near where we tied up a party of German prisoners were at work, under an armed guard. They were loading trucks with rails, and seemed to be on good terms with the French Officer in charge. A number of French girls came around the boat playing melodeons and singing and they reaped a rich harvest of coins. We came ashore about 4 and hung about till 4.30 then we marched through the town to the station. The French people made s feel almost as though we were home, they waved their hats and handkerchief and gave us a most cheering welcome. We got aboard the train and left Marseilles at about 5.30. The country we passed through was a surprise to us all. To try and describe it would be wasting time. The beautiful gum trees and grass, the red poppies, the yellow, blue and purple flowers, the fine structure of the bridges over the beautiful rivers the magnificent residences of the wealthy, the pretty creepers covered cottages of the workers, with their neatly laid out gardens, in which peas, beans, and potatoes and some fine beds of strawberries were growing, the fields of grass with fat, lazy cows grazing and looking very contented, and the girls and women folk they were the biggest surprise of the lot. Their dainty way of speaking, and the neat way of dress, their pleasant smiles, in fact everything about the country the women-folk fully explains why the Frenchmen are such great fighters.
