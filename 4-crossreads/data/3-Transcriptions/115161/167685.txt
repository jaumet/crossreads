<p>have to move further afield.&nbsp; The hut we now occupy is built &quot;up&quot; from the ground, and the wind makes itself felt through the many openings of the floor which does not tend to make our &quot;home&quot;&nbsp;comforts&quot; any the more cheerful.&nbsp; Our feet become absolutely perished, and the only way to produce any warmth is to continuously be rubbing our boots, thereby producing a good polish and reasonably warm feet.&nbsp; Through this continuous rubbing of my boots really for the purpose of warming my feet, I became quite notorious for always having clean ones.&nbsp; Oftentimes fellows would refer to this fact and I would remind them that I always liked one end to be bright, and as the top end was notorious for it&#39;s dulness I endeavoured to keep the other end bright.</p>
