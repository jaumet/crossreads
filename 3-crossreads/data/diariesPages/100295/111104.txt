16th October. 1917 Tuesday
Met Shackleton he paid up like a man. I might say though, that had I not been over to collect the amount I would have been a poorer wiser person. Afternoon to Military Headquarters, where I met Colonel Griffiths, Colonel Hurley Major Gowing. All give me every assistance in their power. Evening to Arlette at the Shaftesbury with "Sunshine" which we enjoyed thoroughly. Weather is extremely wintry, it raining without Cessation.
