December 7thmaps to Chisholm.
Lecture by Col Williamson tonight on Evolution.
Very busy tonight saying goodbye to all my friends, & obtaining their photos & addresses. Finished with the main building at 11 pm - Then after I visited all rooms in our building I spent half an hour in our room & had a drink all round after wishing them best of luck &c. I adjourned to Chisholms room, where I was very enthusiastically received. All drank my health sang, he's a jolly good fellow, & after exchanging photos & addresses I eventually got to bed, feeling very tired -
December 8thAroused 4 am. Had breakfast & finished packing my hand bag then bade good bye to all of my friends. All saw us off. We entrained by 5.30 & left for Heidelberg. It was rather a miserable journey, I did not like leaving so many good friends behind, they were indeed true friends & their innumerable kindnesses to me I can never forget.
We were coached to the Station & from Station to Heidelberg camp arriving there at 1 pm. Stingel accompanied us to Heidelberg & as we were leaving that Station He said goodbye & was I think sorry to depart with us. I know He thought a lot of me, & if there is ever anything I can do for him, I certainly will for he is undoubtedly the whitest German I have ever met & could wish to meet.
It is said that Freiburg is one of the best camps in Germany, this I am sure, & I can always consider myself lucky that I was there so long, & not drafted to Strohen Holtzminden, or any other camps in the 11th Army [indecipherable], where British officer receive extremely bad treatment - To bayonet an officer is quite a daily occurence & when one hears of such unpardonable treatment as to leave British Prisoners in a burning hut & make no attempt to rescue them, & further more bayonet them if they dare attempt to escape thro the window, I think it is well time that we relatiated on German prisoners in England instead of treating them like Lords -
Had lunch & idled about for a few hours after which we were shewn to our respective huts. Depended on Bosche food today -
