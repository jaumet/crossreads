<p>lay down where we were until dawn  &amp;  thus arrived at our bivouac here at midday instead of early morning. Tonight if all goes well we should get to grips. It is intended to be a surprise but I think the turks knew all about it before we started, anyway they would be very slow if they didn't. We go out again tonight  &amp;  return here all being well tomorrow night. So now I am going to slumber.<br/>"Dubarbos"<br/>7.15 pm<br/>Tuesday<br/>We move at 8.30 pm tonight, if all goes well we should round up the Turks at about 4 a.m.  &amp;  get back here again for our evening meal.</p>
