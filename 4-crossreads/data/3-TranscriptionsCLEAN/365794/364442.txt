  
 Saturday 10 February 1917 [9 February 1918] Saw Capt. Collins during morning in Connaught & result - no fracture of arm, just what one thought & "patience" is recommended by C. Collins - may I have plenty of it is my cry. Town 5 p.m. & secured methy. for our lamp Pt. 5 per big bottle.  1 doz. photos for boys of the Connaught group & posted to them at Helouan Convalescent home. So little of interest to put down & yet every day is full of interest and we learn so much of other times & lives. About 95 of us including V.A.D's so one only knows a few of the sisters really well.
