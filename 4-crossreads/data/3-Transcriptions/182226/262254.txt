<p>Friday 20 August, 1915</p>
<p>Have been making full preparations for landing. We have to carry everything ourselves even our cooking pots &amp; firewood. I have been given an extra 50 rounds of ammunition to carry. I went in for a swim, you had to dive about 30 feet from the rail to get in.</p>
<p>Have now been put on board the Osmanieh for the final stage of our 11,000 mile journey to the firing line. We left Lemnos at 7.15 p.m.&nbsp;First sighted lights off Cape Helles 11.15, arrived at Gaba Tepe 12.30. Action was in progress which resulted in the occupation by Australians of a hill. Marched with full equipment &amp; guns&nbsp;to Reserve Gully. Visited early in morning the N.Z. Battery &amp; had some shots at the Turks from advanced shelters.</p>
<p>Have found out that the hill was not occupied last night as supposed.</p>
