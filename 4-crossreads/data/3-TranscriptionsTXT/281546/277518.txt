The Lady Elocutionist was very amusing in her recitations and caused a lot of laughter, being recalled again and again.  At 10 Pm the National Anthem was sung and the boys came out each well satisfied of witnessing a splendid Evening's Entertainment. These Dramatic and Concert Parties organised by Miss Lena Ashwell deserve every praise for their coming over amongst us and trying to make the boys forget they are away from their Homes and Families, and bring some Sunshine into their monotonous life on Active Service. It did not take us long to board our Train and soon was back at the Depot.
