<p>Nov 28th Sun.<br/>On putting our heads out of the dug-out this morning we learned why, that it had been so cold all night. Snow had fallen during the night and the ground all around was covered with a white coat. The snow continued to fall all day. It was very nice to see but one felt bitterly cold with it all. Our duty to-day consisted of clearing the snow of the roofs of the tents by means of long poles and brushes. The snow had settled on the roofs so thickly, that it was weighing the roofs down considerably. This was rather a cold job but entering into the fun of the thing and seeing the humorous side of these condition we had very good sport with it all. Some of the Aussies who had never seen snow in their lives before were very excited at the experience. The "Beetle" the barge which we used to load up our wounded to be taken over to the hospital ship has got stranded on the rocks of Imbros. Now, we have to load the patients on to small boats and they are being pulled over by a motor launch. This is a very much slower process than loading up a barge. A description of the inside of our dug-out as it is now may be very interesting. There are three of us in this "hole" in the earth. Three of the sides are built</p>
