  
 Monday 29 October 1917 A sad day for Betsy.  Capt. Collins appeared about 9.30 a.m., kind & cool seats himself on bed arm across pt. & eyes that look through to one's innermost thought, laughs quietly when I assure him it is only a bad cold, says 103 rather too strong for that, etc.  Takes history then thorough overhauling begins, then takes blood test 2nd finger (L), smiles, goes.  T. 102, P. 100, R. 30 6 a.m.   2 p.m.  10 a.m. T. 101.  Had rigor 1 p.m., T. 104. Seen by Dr. Major Tarrant & Capt. C. 3 p.m.  Thorough exam of luckless spleen, once more more questions re malaria ever had it, ever seen anyone with it, etc., more pressure of spleen until Betsy says not sore yet but, with a smile, feel sure it soon will be.  Capt. C. smiles quietly & desists, blood test now taken from 1st finger (L) & doctors vanish.  5 p.m., another rigor, T. 104, P. 100, R. 28.  Horrid feeling.  S. Peile (English) on night duty, firm & kind.  No sleep & cough troublesome.  Pills given, T. 203.2 2 a.m., T. 104 10 p.m.  Perspired freely.
