 26-6-16 Mon 26th Some fine rumors have been started here during the last day or two, the best one came out today saying it is rumored that the Kaiser has committed suicide & we shall get news within 24 hours that will startle the world.  Nothing out of the ordinary has happened today & we are having a fairly easy time at present but the weather is rather warm
