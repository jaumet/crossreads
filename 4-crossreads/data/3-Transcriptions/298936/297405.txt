<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Monday 6</p>
<p>Plenty of patients in the morning &amp; 3 operations which delayed matters somewhat.</p>
<p>Off at dinner time &amp; slept during afternoon.</p>
<p>Short walk in evening &amp; bed early.- feeling very tired &ndash; fault of climate.  This seems to be a rather a muggy month for even after a shower in morning I feel upside down.</p>
<p>False alarm in evening that we were going on Wed.  Wrote a long letter to Rita &amp; a note to Professor [indecipherable].</p>
<p>More yarns about the front.  The general opinion is that it is a perfect hell &amp; a good place to keep away from.</p>
