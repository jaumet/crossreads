<p>Saturday 1 July 1916<br/>A glorious day, clear &amp; sunny so that the ground dried up well. Had another very quiet day &amp; got together some field flowers to press &amp; send home. In the evening was another great flight of planes, 14 being up at one time, &amp; a scrap between 2 of Fritz's &amp; some of ours enlivened proceedings, terminating quickly in the Germans descending &amp; disappearing. The control that the airmen have over their machines is marvellous.<br/>As soon as it became dark a relief from one of the other companies came along &amp; took over, enabling us to march back another mile or so to a large billet on the main road, still well within shell fire. Here we are able to sleep in our pyjamas, a very great treat after the last 2 or 3 weeks when we have had to be in our clothes - &amp; boots &amp; putties &ndash; all the time. Settled in bed soon after midnight.</p>
