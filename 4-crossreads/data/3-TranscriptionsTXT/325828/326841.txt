 Liverpool Camp Tuesday Mng&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22.6.15 Dearest Father, Settling down slowly.  Both of us had a wretched night.  Found a University man Bob Atwill who Walter knew.  The 3 of us crowded into a space 5 ft wide in one of the new sheds.   About 50 men in with us.  Boards very hard &amp; cold last night.  Sworn in this morning   If you come out on Thursday would you bring an empty port, to take some of our clothes back.  We want room badly &amp; have twice too much for the room.  Our clothes dungarees issued this morning   Boots to follow later.  Ask for F2 Company Depot. Love from Both. Leo.
