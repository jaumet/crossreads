On every hand On reaching Cairo we seemed everywhere to be face to face with war.  There are always 2 Army divisions, 40000 British troops here.  They are called :"The Army of Occupation in Egypt" & they are responsible for the safety of the route to India & Australasia via the Canal.  And now, with all our men coming & going, with Territorials & Indian Regiments, with New Zealanders & Hospital Units the war seemed very close.Every day we would see the N.Z. & Austn. ambulances at work - for the only ambulances used in Egypt since the beginning of the war are those sent from Australasia & N.Z.  It sent a thrill thro' one to see them, but alas! too often they were hard at work bringing our men
