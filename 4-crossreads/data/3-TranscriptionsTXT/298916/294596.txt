in the order of about 100,000 volts. This high tension current of course is very dangerous & a spark will jump across the terminals sometimes up to twelve inches or more.
The length of spark does not indicate the power of a station as is usually believed. It is the current in the secondary (within limits of course).In parallel with the high tension leads, which are connected to a spark gap of various design, usually two hardened zinc hemispheres, are connected a condenser & an inductance. These latter two instruments by their capacity, determine the frequency of this circuit. On the condenser being charged to its maximum potential it discharges itself across the spark gap & as known charges itself reversed in polarity. The oscillations created in this circuit by the discharging (up to thousands per second) of the condenser across the spark gap set up exceedingly high frequency oscillations in the inductance, which in turn is in coupled to the radiating circuit inductively. The radiating circuit then is the ariel in series with the secondary of the inductance, earthed at the lower end. The amount of coupling of this
