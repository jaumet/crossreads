<p>Saturday 9 October, 1915</p>
<p>Arrived at Malta at 5 a.m. The town is very picturesque &amp; is built more on the Moorish style than anything else.</p>
<p>Went right across the bay for orders then came back to Valetta [Valletta] harbour.</p>
<p>It is all artificial work &amp; is very picturesque though dirty.</p>
<p>There were 6 big French ships of war in the harbour, we gave them a cheer as we went past.</p>
<p>I got some fine photographs of the harbour.</p>
<p>The usual bumboats came round the ship selling chocolate.</p>
<p>All the little pulling boats in the harbour are like the Italian Gondola, only smaller.</p>
<p>We expect to disembark in the morning.</p>
<p>We started coaling but stopped again almost immediately.</p>
