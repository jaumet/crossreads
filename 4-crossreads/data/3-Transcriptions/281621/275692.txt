<p>April, 1917<br/>Sunday 1 Palm Sunday<br/>Unit equipage. Patients begin to move up to Aveluy just the other side of Albert. Last night the Germans bombed Albert, no casualties.</p>
<p>Monday 2<br/>Movement in progress &amp; to finish tomorrow. I am still at Buire but will most likely move tomorrow. The weather here is as typical as described. Rain, sleet, snow &amp; sunshine within a few hours.</p>
<p>Tuesday 3<br/>At Buire still but expect to move to Aveluy tomorrow. The unit moves to Bazentin again in a few days.</p>
<p>Wednesday 4<br/>It is now decided that we will remain here &amp; leave &amp; join the unit at Bazentin on Friday.</p>
<p>Thursday 5<br/>Tomorrow Good Friday &amp; I have visions of Sydney Station &amp; crowded mountain trains. Had some special pastry made by an excellent French cook. Beautiful day &amp; night.</p>
<p>Friday 6<br/>Move this morning from Buire to Bazentin again. The guns can just be heard from here. Beautiful day &amp; the sky larks are going their hardest. Move tomorrow to Bapaume.</p>
<p>Saturday 7<br/>Out of the Somme &amp; once more in Pas de Calais. We moved from Bazentin via Flers, Le Roque Tilloy to Bapaume. This town now 7 miles remote from the line is in a very battered condition &amp; is still shelled by Fritz. About the size of Albert but it seems a better class of town. Guns can be distinctly heard. The neighbouring country is not in a bad state at all. M.D.S.</p>
