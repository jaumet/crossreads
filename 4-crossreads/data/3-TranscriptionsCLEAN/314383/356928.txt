  
 me up to the roof & there I saw hundreds of the enemy moving towards us over the ridges to the right & left.  Away back towards Sain Kala were the moving people so I at once ordered boot & saddle, sending Nicol with one gun to the left of the village.  Scott Olsen to the road in rear while the Chief, Brophy & I with a gun took the left flank among the poplars.  Casey & Place stayed with some of the Christians to load the mules while Cameron remained on look out.  Brophy & I got the gun into position & waited until 200 of the enemy got to the further edge of the plantation 600 yds away where they dismounted & sat down.  I then turned 2 drums full into them knocking them & their horses right & left.  The crowd hurriedly departed leaving the right clear.
