<p>to headquarters, and told that I was to be sent to a Signalling School at Fleselless for a month's training. This came as a surprise to me, and it was at the same time very acceptable, as it meant a month of comparative comfort to trench life. I was included in a party of four men going to the school, and while we were waiting at the top of the Headquarter's dug out for one of the men to join us, we saw a great airfight going on overhead in which about 8 aeroplanes from each side were engaged. The British drove the Germans off, but two British Machines were forced to descend, and fortunately they landed on our ground allowing the airmen to escape.

We had to shine our buttons and badges, and clean our boots with dubbin every morning and be always cleanly shaved. After being so long in the trenches it was a pleasure to be clean and fresh again, and we took every interest in our work to show our appreciation of it. During the month I was at the School, I studied hard, and got good results at the end of the term when we had an examination. On one occasion we had a "Mock Stunt" which was carried out by the whole of the School in Fleselles. We employed signalling apparatus from division to</p>
