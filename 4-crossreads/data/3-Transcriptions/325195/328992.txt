<p>4.11.15<br/>Thurs 4th<br/>Another morning at Bde HQ to-day &amp; we had some practical work which is much more into my hand than theory, arrived back soon after 12 oclock, just in time to miss a shower of rain &amp; it has been drizzling all the afternoon; Scurvy has broken out amongst the Indians &amp; I believe that is what was the matter with Penny &amp; Broadbent; An Aus mail arrived to-day &amp; I opened one of Stans letter put in one from myself also one from Nowland to "both of us|", closed the envelope again with the gum off another envelope &amp; sent it on with the rest; Came on duty at 5 oclock at PH &amp; a couple of schrapnel shells cur down some bushes from over the top of the 'phone box as soon as we arrived doing no damage; Everything going along smoothly:</p>
