<p>camping here until the 14th, when we moved off at 6 p.m., riding all night, bitterly cold, reaching Solomon's pools at  9 a.m. on the15th, camping 4 miles from water which means 16 miles daily to water our horses &amp; grooming 2 times daily.</p>
<p>19:  Still at the Pools, mail came today.</p>
<p>24:  Twelve hours in Jerusalem (14 miles) on leave; wonderful sights in Dome of the Rock &amp; Holy Sepulchre, but many of the legends attached to these Holy places are a myth.  Town &amp; people are filthy &amp; one has to pay exorbitant prices for goods.  Had a good day, dinner at the Grand Hotel, lounge &amp; smoking room out of bounds to N.C.O.s &amp; men.</p>
<p>29:  Cricket match v 2nd regt,, won by our team by 80 runs.</p>
<p>June</p>
<p>6:  After twelve days of what they term a spell, left the Pools at 4 p.m. riding all night, bitterly cold in Jerusalem reaching Dumm at 9 a.m. on the 7th.  Left Dumm at 6 p.m. riding through the valley &amp; taking over the valley sector from 4th Bde. at midnight, our section in reserve post.  Mosquitoes in millions, impossible to sleep.</p>
