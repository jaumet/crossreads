The crop are well advanc , and thrive luxuri . Natur reward labor here bounteous , and it would be difficult to find more arabl and fertil land than these flat stretch irrig by Nile water .

This analys method amass me more than ever ; and strive to compar their prodigi mass with ani of our present age architectur , I felt it like compar the effort of pigmi against Titan .
