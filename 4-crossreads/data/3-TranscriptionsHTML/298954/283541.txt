<p>1917<br/>Our table did well since old Martin was an expert fisherman.</p>
<p>The burial of a Japanese who had died from beri-beri gave the fastidious qualms about eating the fish which we caught here at the Carcados.</p>
<p>Tue. 6th Nov.<br/>The loot which the Huns want has been brought over:   all aboard the "Hitachi" came over to "Wolf" today.</p>
<p>Wed. 7th Nov.<br/>The two vessels put to sea today at 8.30 a. (the "Eastern squadron of the Imperial German Navy" as a wag put it).   The "Eastern squadron" steamed out through the shoals and at 1.30 pm hove to in the open sea.</p>
<p>"Hitachi" flew the German Ensign.   A bomb exploded on each side of her forward well-deck at 1.45 and she slowly commenced to settle by the head on an even keel.</p>
<p>At 2.12 pm. her stern rose high into the air as she dived;  her propellers flashed for a moment and she had gone.   Wreckage kept shooting to the surface for some time;   many deck houses, booms, etc floated.</p>
