Friday 5 July
On Thursday morning the Boshe raided 10th Battn. but he came a gutzer.
Very quiet all day an Australian mail to-day. To be relieved to-morrow. Glorious weather continues.
Saturday 6 July
Absolutely quiet all day not a shot fired by Fritz. Glorious day.
An American Sergeant was attached to this post he is good to talk to.
The Australian ideas as to the American words of command were very amusing to him.
They were
Aust ? Slope arms
American ? Guys muskets on your shoulders put.
Aust ? Eyes right or left
American ? Guys look at ?em
Aust ? Attention
American ? Guys stiffen
Aust ? Stand at Ease
American ? Guys Slacken
However, the Sergeant exploded all these ideas was much amused.
Their words of command are similar to ours.
