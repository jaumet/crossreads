<p>Tuesday 29 August 1916<br/>A dull wet day : heavy showers occasionally. Was called for at 9 a.m. by an A.M.C. motor &amp; with several others was taken thro' Poperinghe to a large town named Cassel where an army Gas School is situated. It was an interesting ride thro' long avenues of elms &amp; poplars, across the border &amp; back into France. Had a good morning dealing with the new type of gas mask, then had lunch at a very nice place &amp; stayed there for some time waiting for the rain to abate. Found parcels from Evie &amp; from Lawry waiting for me &amp; was glad to have them : a real treat, the excitement of opening them &amp; then the pulling out of one article &amp; then another. A Gas alarm at night.</p>
