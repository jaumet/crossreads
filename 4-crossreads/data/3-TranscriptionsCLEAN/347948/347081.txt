live with fish.  Never have I seen so many at once.  Within 1/2 a mile radius you could hardly see 5 yards where there was not splashing in the water, dozens of fish.These fish are up to 1 foot long and resemble tailer.The natives have nets about 20? long and these they throw overboard and pull up hundreds.Looking round we can see guns protruding from every headland. On one there are 5 big guns side by side
