The 3rd Bde along with a mtd Bde carried out operations against Jacko at Katia this morning with every success, our captives now are 3050 prisoners, 4 guns, 8 m guns, 800000 rds small arm ammunition tons of equipment we got all the signalling gear its fine being made out of aluminium is extremely portable the holding capacity is about the same, our planes have kept them on the move very few Taubes are to be seen anywhere. Hal has been recommended for promotion as Sig Officer to 4 Regt is to proceed to France for duty, none of the other Bdes have officers to spare so he should get it.
Bed early ? no mail.

Expected to be on the move any minute today but no such luck the 3rd Bde NZ's are pushing them back gradually should be into Oghratina tomorrow with half an ounce of luck, my loot is still increasing is getting quite a problem now mail is arriving spasmodically the railway is used for munitions only now, troops are everywhere if they had been here during the attack out horsemen could have rounded up the lot put up even a better performance than we have prisoners now number 3300, 4 guns many machine guns with complete German so the boys did splendidly.
