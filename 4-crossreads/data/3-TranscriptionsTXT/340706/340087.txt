staunchest friends & have always taken me into the society of their best friends. I leave them about 11 pm. & promise to write some day & adjust a claim for them.
Arrived at billet I say farewell to my friends from Armentieres & then to bed leaving all my packing for Melhuish in the morning. I have tried to get Melhuish on this draft but unsuccessfully so he is only a late arrival
3-5-19 (Sat)This is morn of departure & the wet weather seems likely to continue so much so that I pay a special visit to town to get my overcoat. Our contingent which is No 45 Quota falls in to time save Welbarn who is in town looking after our luggage & train leaves to time at 3 minutes to 12.
Journey is at first in centre of a wide valley of the vividest green imaginable with a river that winds & unwinds itself in an almost unbelievable manner. Up from the valley rise hills on either side - bare of timber & cultivated forming a smooth & pleasant contrast with the forest clad summits - [indecipherable] on both sides here for many [miles] is the exterior edges of two big forests.
Then landscape changes to purely farming areas but the speed of train increases
