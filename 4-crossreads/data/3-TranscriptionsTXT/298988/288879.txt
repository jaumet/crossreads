 May 10th (Monday)  Very quiet day today, just the usual few shells from the Warships &amp; a steady rifle fire on shore all day.  Had some excitement at 4 pm though.  The wireless operator rushed in to my room &amp; said "come on theres going to be a fight in the air.  Sure enough, just discernable was a German aeroplane coming towards us &amp; one of our own making to it.  When they got fairly close (I suppose it would be about half a mile), the German turned &amp; made off, then our chap turned, but the German started to come back &amp; ours then wheeled around &amp; made for him.  The enemy however then made off &amp; disappeared.  The Britisher then flew around there for awhile but there was no reappearance of the German.  We were quite disappointed.  Every ship one looked at, all hands were on deck craning to see what would happen. 
 May 11th We are now taking in water from the Water ship &amp; presumably we will supply other ships. They also put 100 live sheep on us today, so evidently we are booked to stay.  A very heavy &amp; continuous bombardment by Warships has been raging all the afternoon &amp; it is still going strongly at 8 p.m.  The firing on shore is also terrific &amp; it is rumoured that our men at Cape Helies have had a success &amp; their joining up with the Australians here is imminent, so I guess the Turks are getting slightly battered about tonight.
