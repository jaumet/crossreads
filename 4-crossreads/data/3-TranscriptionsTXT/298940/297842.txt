Yesterday  being rather cold was nine or less a slack day but today we went through the usual routine of route march lecture & physical jerksYe Gods. How many more lectures on physical jerks am I going to hear. That today by Corporal Pollock (late of who was at Anjone) was a good one & strange to say he had several bits of information I did not know before. Too often it is a dreary repetition  of the old old story.Then the interminable route marches. Today I was thinking of the huge number of them & wondering how it is they are as bearable as they are.
