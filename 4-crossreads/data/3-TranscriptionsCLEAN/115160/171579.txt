you a better indication as to how things are going.  I'm pleased indeed to know everything is panning out so well.
Did the Nurse take a photo of wee Peggy?  You didn't mention her in your last.
I think I have had all the money you sent over.  I've a nice wee balance over here at present, and will come in handy if any more leave comes along.
I'm glad you've got all the cards.  Did you get the registered packet I sent just as I was going on leave,.  Here's a few more, and I'm hoping to get a lot more of the latest sets.
I hope you are in the best of nick and kept going at 87.
Sincere wishes for a Happy & Prosperous New Year.
Your loving Cousin
John.
