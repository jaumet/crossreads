<p>"It is required a forest-trapper or a hunter versed in the art of ambush and bush-craft &ndash; and the Australians, bold seekers after adventure, are these &ndash; to venture to attack on a stormy night a strong position like Mont St. Quentin.  At the back of their barbed wire defences the German machine-gunners thought themselves impregnable and immune from capture.  Their sentries watched behind their parapets.  The citadel, with its three rows of trenches, stood like a dark shadow on the banks of the Somme.  Only a few hours were necessary for the Anzacs to conquer this impregnable mountain, and of the garrison of 3,000 who defended it, more than one third are today lamenting in the prisoners' cage behind the line".</p>
<p>The operations for the capture of Mont St. Quentin were arranged at a conference held at 10 p.m. on the night of the 30th August.  As rapid action was necessary and the time available did not permit of a detailed creeping artillery barrage being worked out artillery support was arranged in the form of successive engagement of selected localities.</p>
<p>The 5th Infantry Brigade was formed up for the attack in the limited area in our hands immediately S.E. of Clery and the attack was launched at 5 a.m. on 31st August in conjunction with the advance of the 3rd Australian Division up the slopes South of Bouchavelsles.</p>
<p>In spite of very considerable opposition and a complex system of hostile trenches covered by exceedingly strong lines of wire the attack was successful and by 8 a.m., the hill and village of Mont St. Quentin Halle and Feuillacourt were in our hands.  This was a most brilliant feat of arms on the part of 2nd Division.  It was, however, rendered possible by the very vigorous action of the 3rd Division, which by its energetic action cleared the ground to the north and gave elbow room to develop the action of the 2nd Division.</p>
<p>Owing to repeated counter attacks and constant heavy enemy shell fire on the village of Mont St. Quentin our troops were temporarily withdrawn to a line which was consolidated just west of Feuillacourt, and Mont St. Quentin and East of Halle, and this line was held during the night 31st August &ndash; 1st September.</p>
