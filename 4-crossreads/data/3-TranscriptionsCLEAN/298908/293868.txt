  
 him this evening so I having nothing to do gladly accepted so I tidied myself up & off we went, his uncle turned out to be a parson & not a bad sort of chap.  I thoroughly enjoyed my evening & we had a jolly fine tea.  I had 3 big cutlets of salmon & a piece of sole, 2 rissoles, jam tart, custard & fruit, cakes bread & butter & a few odds & ends, not a bad war time tea for a parson, they have a lovely home & it was quite a pleasure to sit in a big easy chair & yarn after scoffing a good meal like that.  We had lots of little arguments & as usual drew all sorts of comparisons between England & Australia, these were the first people I have met in England who prefer old Asquith to Llyod George & we had quite a heated argument over the pair. 
 21st.  Another cussed boat roll was read out this morning & I missed again so tonight I am not feeling particularly bright.
