 Hot & dusty - Had a route march & heavy drill on the desert. 4th & 5th Artillery moved out - The Royal Sussex Reg't moved in - one fellow gave me a badge for half a loaf of bread - We are not at all displeased at not moving - as we hope to have so much less time bivouacking at Moaska - We found a set of gloves & had some rare sport. I found a bottle branded O.O. Whiskey, but was disappointed as it was Kerosene; I made an improvised lamp out of a Fruit Tin, so we can now have a read of at night, have just found a good book "Lorna Doone".
