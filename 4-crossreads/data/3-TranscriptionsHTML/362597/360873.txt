<p>had since we left Sydney. We did not finish the concert till 9.45 pm.</p>
<p>Ellis &amp; I slept on No 1 Hatch now &amp; it is glorious. Talk about Fresh Air. It is like living on a house boat. I heard 8 bells go (12 o'clock) &amp;    Bells (   o'clock) but you do not feel tired even if you only have 3 hours sleep.</p>
<p>Sunday 16.1.16 (25)<br/>I got dressed up &amp; went to Church Parade &amp; when I got there I was told that those who did not wish to stay, could go. So I went. Another day you would be fined for not being present.</p>
<p>It was the first time</p>
