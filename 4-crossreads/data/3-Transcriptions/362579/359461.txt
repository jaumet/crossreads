<p>We sisters had a good time. On our breakfast plate was a box of handkerchiefs from Red Cross for each   &amp;  our letters &ndash; I had three &ndash; one from Esther Hart with a pretty handkerchief, also Miss Mary Sergeant   &amp;  Miss Sharlie Sergeant with handkerchiefs enclosed.</p>
<p>Had some pretty little Xmas Gifts from friends, but can tell about them later. Anyhow they all   <strike>went</strike>  helped to make life much happier than any one expected.</p>
<p>Helped with patients dinner, then went to see the other wards. We had our dinner at 1. p.m.   &amp;  a real jolly time we  had. A Turkey, ham   &amp;  vegetables, excellently cooked. Plum pudding, mince tarts   &amp;  coffee. The room   &amp;  tables decorated beautifully. Crackers on our plates, the prettiest ones I've seen.</p>
<p>Returned to ward   &amp;  talked to patients. Set the table for tea   &amp;  got everythin going then I left at 5. p.m. Dressed   &amp;  caught the 5.48. p.m. to Paddington.</p>
