 March, 1916 Thursday 16 After the parade this morning I got two bundles of letters, one from Mum dated 4-1-16 which gave me some pleasant reading. After tea went &amp; played cards w/- dad &amp; had a long chat about the various things the letters brought up. 
 Friday 17 Sent off a cable to be despatched to mum.  Every spare minute I get during the day I spend answering my letters. In the evening I went into Heliopolis to get my watch from the jeweller 8 am to 1 pm on Abbassia Range
