in the afternoon & rowed out to HMS Talbot  We got a good supply of stuff there.
Wednesday 4thDid nothing all day but sleep, read & smoke.  There seems to be a lot of preparations going on for a big move.
Thursday 5thHad a washing day.  First time Ive had a chance to do some in fresh water since we left Maadi.  Got ready for guard in the afternoon & at 6 pm 12 of us relieved the Border Regt Guard.  Was on 2nd shift & No 2 post.  It seemed quite strange marching a beat again & I didn't go too much on it.
Friday 6thCame off guard at 6 pm.  There was a big bombardment in the afternoon & at dusk it was a splendid sight to see all the guns firing at Anzac.  There was a big advance & it is believed a large body of troops were landed successfully
