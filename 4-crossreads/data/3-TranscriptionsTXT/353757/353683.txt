 We are camped just behind here.  This place (Cairo) contains a lot that is good &amp; all that is bad.  There are 70000 of us here now comprising the Army of occupation.  Will write &amp; give you some of my experiences as soon as I can get an envelope &amp; pen. You ought to pay this place a visit.  The Country is wonderful.  The great Pyramid which I climbed right to the top is very fine.  Wishing you &amp; those at home a Prosperous 1915.
