  
 couldn't get away as all town leave was stopped owing to the big row the previous day. 
 Sunday 4th There was a combined Protestant Church parade in the cinema tent in the morning.  Segt Major Knowles sang a couple of solos.  Nothing doing in the afternoon.  No leave granted. 
 Monday 5th A very windy dusty day.  Was on pumping fatigue with 2 men from each squadron.  We paid a couple of niggers a few piastres to do the work, & did nothing ourselves.  The 2nd & 3rd Reinforcements to this Regt arrived in camp today.  There were nearly 100 of them.  Wrote a letter to Doug. 
 Tuesday 6th B Squadron went out on patrol duty.  2 troops did the scouting going out & the other 2 coming back.
