<p>Left Columbo at 11.20 AM. Before going some natives came near &amp; dived in for pennies thrown in by us. Could get them before they got 1 yard down. Travelled 4 miles up to 12 o'clock. Had a very interesting lecture from 3 till 4 by the war correspondent about the Emden &amp; Sydney fight. The Sydney lost 3 Killed &amp;  13 wounded of which 1 died. &amp;  the Emden lost 132 Killed &amp; <strike>52</strike> 53 wounded of which 1 officer &amp;  4 men died. The Emden was a complete wreck when she surrendered &amp;  fired 1500 <strike>0</strike>  shots of which 15 took effect. The Sydney wasn't damaged much at all &amp;  fired 650 <strike>0</strike>  shots of which 70  took effect. We took altogether about 150 prisoners. While we had this lecture the prisoners on board were being exercised. Lights were made very dull at 8 o'clock. Fell asleep in another cabin &amp;  woke up at 3.30. Went into my own bunk then.</p>
<p>Wednesday. 18th. Nov 1914.<br/>No water on. It is getting scarce here. We only took on 100 gall. where we should have taken on 800. We believe our Escort fired 3 shots last night, challenging boats. Our escort is the <strike>Yarmouth</strike>  &amp;  Hampshire only.<br/>Travelled 250 miles to 12 o'clock. Went to another lecture on the Sydney Emden fight by Mr Bean the reporter. It was exactly the same.</p>
