<p>he has arranged that my job is to be kept open besides which they are treating me very decently. The chaps gave me a presentation watch &amp; the Rifle club are giving me a service revolver. So away I went &amp; arrived at Broadmeadows.</p>
<p>The first morning they wanted a clerk so I got the job. Well it was work from 6.30 am to 11 pm for weeks. Anyway after about 6 weeks of the solidest graft I've ever put in <strike>we</strike> about <strike>2000</strike> 500 men were picked from 2000. This formed the 7th Lt Horse Regt.</p>
<p>I was one of the lucky ones &amp; got a position as Corporal 9/- a day here &amp; 10/- after embarkation. Have been looked after well since the regiment was formed &amp; have got a good horse &amp; equipment.</p>
