<p>Quarter-master's store painting and stencilling.</p>
<p>4th Jan (Tuesday) Though not yet recovered from our last march we were called upon to do another today of approx. 10 miles. We were given the afternoon off to do some washing. Its mighty hard work in cold water. Launch sunk in Canal with ammunition, rifles and kits aboard.</p>
<p>5th Jan (Wednesday) Off duty all day with boil or abscess, not sure what it is. Frightful sandstorm blowing. Bitterly cold. Fragments of war news now being posted up for first time</p>
