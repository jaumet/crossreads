  
 Thursday 9 January 1919 Went Belah to get evidence from a man in Hospital.  We had a Ford Car & ran along the netting road which was put down over 2 years ago & is still in good order.  By netting road I mean laid flat on the sand. We are just on the Boundary of Sinia & Palestine & altho' sleeping on the ground it is softer than the black soil, but more lice.  We have a delousing parade tomorrow using Boilers captured from the Turks.
