<p>Our A.M.C. consisted of about 36 all from different units &amp; inexperienced.  We had two doctors one a loafer pure &amp; simple &amp; they both seemed so taken aback by things that they did not attempt to dress wounds till Tuesday.  From then one of them worked splendidly but the other man was almost a passenger  Some of our chaps did what they could but at first it was little. We had over 900 wounded who had to be fed etc &amp; other wants fixed up &amp; we received 16 loaves of bread per day for their food.  The result was hard biscuits were used by the A.M.C. &amp; the majority of the wounded.</p>
<p>Tuesday  Received a visit from a General &amp; then we received orders to sail for Alexandria.  This day the Doctor worked well &amp; many of the worst cases were bandaged again, only first aid being attempted however.  My duties were chiefly concerned with the Dispensary giving hypodermic injections &amp; opium for pain  at night.  We got through pints of it  My first day I put in 22 hours out of 24 getting practically no sleep for the first few days each night  getting better however  Many were minor wounds but some were very serious &amp; we had about 20 deaths.  Many were the miraculous escapes  Just to mention a few cases, struck in the head while lying down the bullet glanced off ran along the skull &amp; protruded half an inch out of the forehead, bullet passed through both cheeks in several cases, from temple to temple</p>
