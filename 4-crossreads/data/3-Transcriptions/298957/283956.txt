<p>8th March (Wednesday)<br/>Visited Ismailia to bring back Red Cross cases and also to make enquiries respecting money sent to me from Australia. Moascar Camp, near Ismailia, is even larger than that at Tel-el-Kebir. Seven aeroplanes were up flying over the camp. I passed trainloads of the Royal Horse Artillery en route for France. Our 1st &amp; 2nd Divisions here are preparing for their departure to France. In Ismailia I passed General Birdwoo's house and, walking past the lake, I saw quite a number of warships including the monitors</p>
