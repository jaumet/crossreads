6/11/17 Milan
Piazza de Mercanti which is a quaint old mediaeval place and surrounded by ancient buildings. Owing to the early hour could not go out to see Leonardi de Vincis ?Last Supper" but returned instead to the Hotel where I settled up and took a bus for the station. Left in the 9.20 train changed back into uniform the first time since leaving Rome. The country between Milan and Turin is much like portions of France, intensely cultivated and well irrigated. At Turin found quite a small military colony ? the Prince of Wales, Painleve Lloyd George are a few of the heads who have been here lately. A number of French officers about too. Had a good run to Modane passing through magnificent Alpine scenery and had a quick run through the Mt Cenis tunnel. At Modane got a sleeper and M.P.s others nearly killed themselves doing things for me all on the chance of a tip. Bad news today flocks of French Alpini going through.
