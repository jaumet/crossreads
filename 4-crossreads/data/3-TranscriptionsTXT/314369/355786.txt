 Change places w/- the Bee. We move away from the peir   &amp;  she moves up and takes in stores. Her men get a run ashore but cannot get drunk which is a great advantage. Weather very hot nearly everybody gets prickly heat. Lie about all day watching the pearling schooners. Divers examine Bee   &amp;  report all serene. Leave port at 7 pm.
