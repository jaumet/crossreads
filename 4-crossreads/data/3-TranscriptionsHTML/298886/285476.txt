<p>that we amalgamate and peace reigns again. Four of the Signallers went to "A" Squadron tonight. They pulled long faces but had to go. 14 bags of mail came in tonight  Work to morrow.</p>
<p>31st March Friday 1916</p>
<p>Waded through 14 bags of mail this morning It takes about 3 hours to do it. Got a parcel myself. Very windy to day and this Camp is cursed with fine clinging dust when does not improve matters when it blows.</p>
<p>Smith and Allen of .A. Squadron went to Zeitoun to the school of Signalling They will remain there working very hard until the end of the month then they will return with their Certificates of Efficiency. The other signallers are suffering from a bad attack of 'professional jealousy which is usual in such cases. They all contend that they could give Smith points in Signalling and leave him hopelessly behind But I have my own idea about such matters and my ruling stands good. Smith goes: the others don't Nuf Sed!</p>
<p>Got new nose bags now. Nearly time we had them for the last</p>
