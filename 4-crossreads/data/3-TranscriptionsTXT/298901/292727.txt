is resting, I still carry on requisitions & supplying outside units with drugs & am looking forward to a quieter time with the prospect of writing a couple of letters & reading some papers I received the other day.
Jeudi 23rd MaiA steady day of hard work  Had my 8 G.S. panniers checked & all contents cleaned up, also my medical & surgical panniers.  All are now ready to load on the wagon to move off at a moments notice.  The day started hot but changed to a little rain with cold wind.  Fritz was over bombing last night again but left us alone.  He dropped bombs near the place we evacuated & also set fire to a large dump of some kind & it made a splendid sight, blazing up fiercely & dying down every few seconds, lighting up the country for miles.  Report says that one of the raiders was brought down near Corbie.Very few wounded coming through.
