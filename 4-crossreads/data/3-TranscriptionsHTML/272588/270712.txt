<p>Sunday 26 May <br/>Last night's attack did not eventuate but the Bosch raided instead but was completely repulsed.  He is shelling Pradelles &amp; dist. heavily with gas which I think is a prelude to the second phase of his offensive. Glorious weather still prevails.</p>
<p>Monday 27 May<br/>Glorious day again &amp; things are quiet about here. We go up to the A.D.S. at Borre to-morrow.</p>
