The Drs put us through the same rigmarole this afternoon but its only a farce for they know very well that there is nothing the matter with the men, our protest was printed in the papers today
Had a sharp reminder that we are back once more among flies at tea this evening for I found maggots crawling in my meat the first I have seen for 4 years.
Brotchie a Sgt at our table is a long way overdrawn through the Authorities fault, because of this they would not pay him any money 
We did not like to see him go ashore penniless so our table threw in 5/- each made him up a 1 or two
Have had the Victorians biting like one thing this evening over their papers, quarantine, rivers etc
