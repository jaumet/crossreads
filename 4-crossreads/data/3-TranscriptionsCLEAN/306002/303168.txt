  
 30.5.15 Sun. 30th.  My cold rather bad last night so I did not get out at 3.30 & slept till dinner time.  Soon after dinner we had the order to pack our gear ready to move off.  At 1 o'clock our boys from  Popes Hill  Quinns Post charged the Turks & captured a machine gun, a two lines of trenches, there is some doubts as to whether they will be able to hold them or not.  We received orders to attach ourselves to B Troop till further orders & were then put in the trenches on the right side of Popes Hill & told that the Turks had been heavily reinforced & an attack was expected before the moon rose (about midnight).  Two of our aeroplanes have been scouting all day & it was a fine sight watching them as the Turks were trying to bring them down with shrapnel but with no success.
