Thurs. Ap. 19. Glory: Got 6 more Letters today. 1 each from Mother, France, Sam Ibbs, & 3 from M.S. I’ll be kept busy answering them now. Started one to B.E. Its very nice to get a Letter from Ibbsy, after such a long interval. Good news in the Papers.

Fri. Ap. 20. Finished my Letter to Lill Got a new Anzac from "Dados" in Albert.

Sat. 21. Went to see the Anzac show in Albert, but there were only 2 turns on, the rest being Pictures. Not much chop.

Sun. 22. Fine day. Plenty of planes about. Ted Grey returned from leave after having a good time in Blighty. Johnnie Moore went away today. Hock Douch went to C.C.S with appendicitis.

Mon. 23. Another fine day. A Taube came over just after Dinner & 6 of our planes on their way back from Fritz’s line met him. Goodbye Fritz
We are trying to arrange a Concert for Anzac Day the 25th but the Transport are going out op the Line so our orchestra is very weak.
