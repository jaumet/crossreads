<p>July 1915</p>
<p>Saturday 10</p>
<p>P.M.O.</p>
<p>60 recruits to 12 P.M.</p>
<p>Busy morning with records.  Got through with them in good time.</p>
<p>Camp flooded with visitors when I returned, so I laid low.</p>
<p>According to present feeling  I don't care becomes of me.</p>
<p>I wonder as [indecipherable] down with measles] whether Christie will stick me in the office when 40 go. Not much chance.  Probable [indecipherable] P.M.O.</p>
