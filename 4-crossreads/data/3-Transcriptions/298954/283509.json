<p>1917<br/>Fri 17th Aug.<br/>A rather exciting night last evening.</p>
<p>At 11 pm a revolver was discharged amongst us by the German sentry.   We woke, naturally.<br/>The shot was the signal for pandemonium on deck, the Germans thinking we were trying to escape en masse.    The open hatchway was quickly ringed round with Huns holding ugly-looking hand grenades, which they were apparently quite willing to drop amongst us at the least opportunity.</p>
<p>The searchlights flashed out, star shells were fired, &amp; then the machine guns began to rattle over our heads and rifles commenced to crack.   Alligators in the water had been taken by our guards (half drunk on the "Matunga's" whiskey) to be escaping prisoners.</p>
