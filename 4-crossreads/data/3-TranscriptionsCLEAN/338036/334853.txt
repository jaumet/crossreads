  
 [10th  Dec. contd] when we visited Nieppe and saw on return journey a battle that was progressing south of us, probably Estaires.  To hear the roar of numerous heavy guns to see the star shells and other shells bursting was a sight that hypnotised us for a while.  It was grand. 
 Monday 11th [Dec] Sergt Williams & Geo Pickering have not been too well for some days and today they were both sent to Hospital.  Probably influenza.  Consequently I filled the position in Orderly Room and found things rather busy today.  Had my head down all day on returns,                                                           and wages etc. and bed at 10.15. 
 Tuesday 12th Still going hard on C Section Acquittance Roll and returns but outlook better than yesterday.  By night things were pretty straight. 
   Ommission    Yesterday was one of the clearest we have had for some time consequently air craft were active and a German nearly flew over our Baths.  Quite a number of the 'scraps' took place during morning plainly visible to us and a German machine was brought down near Armentieres.  The white of ours and black powder of enemy's was clearly marked. 
 Tuesday (contd)  Snowing rather heavily in morning but not cold. 
 Wednesday 13th Things pretty straight.
