<p>1917<br/>Oct<br/>On the way back I met some of the other fellows who had found a "eggs a cook" joint, so we had some, also some vin rouge which tasted very well. This was rather exceptional as most of the wine sold to the soldiers was not up to much, the vin blanc being regular poison. We visited this place two or three times while we were at Caestre. One very fat girl there became enamoured of a aft chap named Hunt who came over with us and insisted on hugging and kissing him each night before he left. The day following our arrival we were given a hot bath down by a dam. It was a "toute de suite" affair &ndash; what is known as a Russian bath because you rush in and rush out again before you have time to get very wet. (toute de suite is colloquial French for very quick). During the afternoon I walked to Fletre, about a kilo away. (1 kilo = 5&frasl;8 mile). It was a village, about the same size as Caestre with nothing of much interest except an Army</p>
