<p>deter me, I was always stooping down suddenly in front of someone and very often he or she would be in a great hurry, it was doubtless very annoying to them, but I couldn&#39;t help it.&nbsp; The greater the opposition to my foolish habit the more determined would I become, thinking no doubt that the good luck would be all the better.&nbsp; I held up the vehicular traffic one day in Victoria Street getting a pin that had become embedded in the asphalt on the road, and was very nearly run-down by a huge lorrie [lorry?] as a consequence.&nbsp; I am not superstitious in the least, but a common pin if I see it lying about, I must pick <s>it</s> up.&nbsp; Bent or straight, rusty or bright, it&#39;s all the same to me.&nbsp; I&#39;ve picked up as many as forty pins in one day.&nbsp; Is it any wonder that a fool like myself gets lost, and makes such a hopeless mess of things generally.</p>

<p>Many a time have I arranged to meet someone at a certain place and when the time comes have wandered about in some other locality, blaming them the whole time for not keeping their appointment.</p>

<p>Times out of number have I left my latch key in my other tunic and either had to waken the land lady or risk a policeman seeing me crawling through a window, at dead of night.</p>
