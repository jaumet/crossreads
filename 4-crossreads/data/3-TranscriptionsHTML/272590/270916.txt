<p>La Madelon (A Yankee translation)<br/>Below the camp where many soldiers muster,<br/>There is an inn that they call the "porlus" [?] rest,<br/>A modest house, whose walls with ivy cluster<br/>Hard by the sheltering woods, a cosy nest,<br/>The girl who waits on us is pleasing<br/>Like sparkling wine her eyes in fun<br/>She hardly halts to hear our teasing<br/>She's only known as Madelon.<br/>All through our dreams at night all through our day's dull chance<br/>She's only Madelon perhaps, but she's Romance.</p>
<p>Chorus<br/>When Madelon comes tripping to our table<br/>We boldly pluck her skirt as she goes by<br/>And each one whispers low his pretty fable<br/>Made up to win her, on the sly.<br/>Our Madelon is not a surly beauty.<br/>So when we chuck her chin to lead her on<br/>She laughs &ndash; that's all &ndash; and feels she's done her duty.<br/>Madelon, Madelon, Madelon.</p>
