  
 Result down I went, with a swollen nose and discolored right eye. I got on my feet again and got one "home" on him, then we were separated and eventually shook hands, and were the best of friends afterwards. Poor old chap, he was blown to bits. 
 How often do you here the expression "What a fine looking man!" all agree he is a fine man, because he is big. The small man passes on his way unnoticed, but he is content, he gets there eventually, we read about him. 
 Again I apologise for straying from my story, but directly I touch the topic the topic of big men, I seem to lose all control of myself. I envy them. I want to be one of them, to be admired, to be made much of on account of my stature. You wont blame me, will you? I am so small, and insignificant, only 5ft 3 3/4 ins. I promise not to diverge again, so please read on. 
 During the later stages in camp, I got (or took) leave pretty often. Nearly every week-end would find me home, in fact I was really very rarely to be found in camp after 5 o'clock any evening. I followed the lead of most of our reinforcements. 
 Discipline became less stringent, as our departure approached. Many irksome duties were relaxed. we felt more (shall I say) important. We had our correct uniforms, and taking everything into consideration, we were having not at all a bad time. 
 After about the first week in camp, we all settled down to solid drill, route marches, fatigues, and the many important and less important duties necessary to convert our bodies into live, pliable and muscular machines. We one and all took a keen interest in our work, listened with interest to the lectures studied and practised visual training, in fact it was like being back at school again. We were all pale, and we found ourselves unconsciously studying the comforts of each other rather than our individual selves. What a fine crowd we were, and what a sin that they (or so many of them) should have to remain under French or Belgian soil.
