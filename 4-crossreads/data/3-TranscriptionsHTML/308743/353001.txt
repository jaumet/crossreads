<p>The Turks made another attempt to give us a little more trouble last night but didn't do much good only wasted a few shells but at daybreak they came for us properly with all their arty after an hours bombardment they took up the rifle &amp; fired continuously for an hour not a shot did we reply they were to cunning to come out though so beyond giving us a little entertainment they did no damage.  A full brigade of 5.2 howitzers landed last night 8 guns are to go on our left &amp; 8 on our right this brings the total guns up to 72.  Gen Hamilton paid us a visit in a racing motor launch today from Imbros  Night before last the troops down at the Cape advanced 2100 yds in one place &amp; in others took two sectional lines of trenches.  The Monitor has been firing continuously all day at the rear of Achi &amp; getting great bursts evidently the Turks are keeping their reserves there now as they are being continually faced back.

<p>Nothing of note during the night only several bursts of rifle fire accompanied by bombs &amp; grenades.  Capt Fiaschi has been attached to the 1st Regt as M.O.  During the morning Cecil Oliver called &amp; informed me that Eric Parki  was killed whilst attending his gun both his mates were wounded by the same shell so that's "finish" Parky's.  Went down for a swim which was just perfect &amp; came home under a perfect hail of lead  I don't know how I missed it both sides were at it tooth &amp; nail for 2 solid hours &amp; at the Cape the guns were continuously on the roar.  Another baty was landed last night the first one opened fire toady on the Chess board &amp; did effective shooting, finished the bomb proof shelter last night &amp; made a good job of it.  Turks towards evening threw dozens of bombs at our structures at Quinns but without effect they then made a false attack but nothing was doing so they fell in.  Aeroplanes have been over all day so Turks must be in force in places</p>
