<p>will soon be nobody left<br/>Thursday Ap 11<br/>Turks made an attack to day across Flat. They advanced in close formation &amp; we waited until they were practically up to wire before fire. The Artillery let fly putting a barrage at back of them preventing them from getting away. They were machine Gunned in front &amp; shelled from behind &amp; were repulsed with very heavy losses.<br/>Friday  Ap 12<br/>Another Bomb raid this morning. Turks have retired back into the Hills of Moab after their bad mauling yesterday. It is hot here</p>
