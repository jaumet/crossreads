1/2/18 Boulogne
did a fair amount of reading at the Club during the morning. A fine sunny day. Walked out after lunch and noticed the dirtiness round the quays. Tough looking old fishers and their women hereabout. Nothing doing up the street but, at a picture sellers was rather nauseated by the French taste and their glorification of intrigue. At the Club the decadence of the class of officer noticeably subs drinking on until boozed. Caught the 4.17 train for Desvres a distance of 16 miles which took two hours to do. Had arranged to meet the messcart here but it was missing so I was stranded on a dark platform miles away from anywhere. Met our party en route for the 6th T.B.and then set out on a voyage of exploration and found a Wing of Divnl Rest Camp.
