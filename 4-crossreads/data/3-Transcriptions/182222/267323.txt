<p>Lately I&#39;m beginning to remember some items very faintly, like impressions of&nbsp;a dreams&nbsp; -- or are they dreams?&nbsp; Falling for a year through a black cloud full of hard things &amp; red flames --- laughing &amp; swearing at the fool&nbsp;that shoved me in a hole &amp; tipped rubbish on me --- Crawling or trying to do same over people that wouldn&#39;t get out of the road &amp; using some malevolent language --- Then being picked up by an M. O. -- where that idea comes from how knows for it couldnt be ---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worrying over eighteen pounders and feeling relieved when told they were OK</p>
