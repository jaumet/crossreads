 Mon 11th [12th] Some have to walk nearly two miles &ndash; Heavy shelling Achi Baba 
 Tues 12 July [13th] Heavy gun firing in morning on our front &amp; enemy shelled Courtnays during noon Rather many casualities going down to beach. Had a good bathe in evening with Besier. Called on Tite on way back met a S.M. who knew R.E. Wright well in Fiji. Posted PC &amp; letters to Mater &amp; PC to Janet. 
 Wed 13th [14th] Stand to Arms. At 3 am then told to carry on till 4 am. To move off at 8.30 am for Popes Post Up packs &amp; moved off. Many got to top of hill &amp; some half way then were told all to go back again as we were not wanted &amp; so back again to our possies &amp; unpack. This is the best our Heads (!) can do after 11 months of it. Waste of mens strength &amp; temper in this heat.
