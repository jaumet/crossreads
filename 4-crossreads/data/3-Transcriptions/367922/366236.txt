<p>Dear Mr. Fry,<br/>I must thank you for sending the photograph of Dene. I shall value it greatly &amp; keep it as a mememto of our friendship.</p>
<p>I had the pathetic privilege of paying a tribute to him at the last meeting of our Royal Society. You have doubtless received an official record of our resolution. As several of our members knew Dene personally, I shall show his photo at our next meeting.</p>
<p>Very sincerely yours,<br/>Heber A. Longman.</p>
