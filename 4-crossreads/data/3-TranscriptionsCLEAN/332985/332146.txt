  
 this evening, killing 2 men, A few yards from our lines.  Hun counter attack during night.  Our people answered him with a terrific bombardment.  In which the heavies joined.  Lieut. Hogan's groom just landed, been lost two weeks, hell of a row.  Hogan is going to draw and quarter him.  Appears one horse went lame, and could not travel, so this Australian made the best of a bad job, put up at a village, and had a royal time.  8-30 p.m. Sun just set. 
 10-5-1917 Raining.  Some of our planes about.  A few 5.9 shells on a big gun position.  These guns are just in front of a Hospital.  A bit of a stunt on Artillery firing like fury.  Raining in torrents.  O.C. in wagon line. 
 11-5-1917 Moving camp near Haplincourt.  Three miles away.  Started at 10 a.m., still going, now 3 p.m.  I am waiting for a wagon to move my stuff.
