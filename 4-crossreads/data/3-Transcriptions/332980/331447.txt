<p>holes are everywhere, I was told away from the Station the damage is not near so great, it is awful to think what destruction War does, Rows after Rows of Houses smashed in &amp; not a Window left anywhere, luckily the beautiful Cathedral has not been hit &amp; a Thanksgiving Service was held in it a few Sundays ago for the Town's deliverance from the Enemy, as it was in great danger of being captured a little while ago. I am anxious for a trip out as far as Bailleau which we have recaptured which has been destroyed which I hope to later on. I was not long at Hazebruick having only to take some Material &amp; Men back to St Momelin past St Omer &amp; then I came back &amp; at 1 Pm finished &amp; signed off.</p>
<p>From Tuesday Sept 17th until Mon Sept 30t.,<br/>very little worth noting happened, I being on local work in the District, On this day 30th I was booked up a Stand by Pilot at St Omer to Pilot any Driver from another Depot who did not know the Road.</p>
