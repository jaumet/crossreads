8 May, 1916 Monday
82 wks from home
Reveille as usual
Things exceptionally quiet today, pulled the old scrap down gave her a thorough clean out found her OK inside, she is standing up to the work splendidly.
Mail is expected in a day or two will come in jolly handy as news is very scarce.
Played cricket in the evening then chess met train at 10.30 turned in at 11.30 tired out.
9 May, 1916 Tuesday
Revielle as usual
Nothing doing what-so-ever, horses men went out as usual to the palms, tents have changed hands we are now issued with a marquee. Mail from home last night the news of Frank Carter's death is confirmed, pretty bad luck for them it will go pretty hard with them in future to make both ends meet.
Went down the line a few miles in the direction of Girga to report on the condition of roads, telegraph lines etc, tyres tubes are giving heaps of trouble lately as the rubber is all mifish on account of the heat.
Played more cricket chess turned in at 10.30.
