<p>tion we are at present holding &ndash; I am getting so weak that I have to sit down and rest every few yards &ndash; one gap which was exposed to snipers I was told to run across but hadn't the strength to do it; I had to take my time and my chance of being picked off. This doesn't worry me much, I think I am about done &ndash; thank God men of my temperament are few and far between &ndash; I am quite satisfied that I'll never make a soldier; a thousand pities to have been born an artist at a time like this &ndash; I do wish I could take War in the same spirit with which my comrades face its horrors.</p>
<p>May  6<br/>Relieved from the trenches &ndash; back to the Rest Camp. I set to work to make a dug-out, but can only do very little at a time. We are handed out cigarettes, some of which are quite mouldy, though I smoke them as smoking only keeps me going now.</p>
<p>May  7<br/>Little sleep  - I dread being asleep more than awake as my dreams are so frightful. I am making no effort to keep a concise diary, I can only hope that I shall be able to forget it all.<br/>Amuse myself designing stained glass windows &ndash; it's awful having no reading matter; am reduced to reading labels on jam tins.<br/>All last night the Turks have been bombarding heavily with shrapnel; a quite ujnusual occurrence, as they never used to commence before dawn.</p>
