  
 7 I enter the wood, and wanter some distance in till I find a tree more aged tan the rest, and larger, its rugged butt green with moss. 
 It seems good to rest upon the sweetness of the fallen needles there with my back against the mossy butt. 
 Seated in this wood alone I am not lonely 
 I am strangely befriended by all that is round me. 
 Almost there is intense silence. A silence which seems to dream 
 There is stillness 
 Stillness, which holds, as it were the very breath of movement 
 Stillness so perfect it pictures silence, and make silence absolute and local 
 The little which is not of silence is remote 
 There is no stirring of the air 
 There is stillness 
 Profound stillness
