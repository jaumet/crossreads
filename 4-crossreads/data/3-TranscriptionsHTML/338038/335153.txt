<p>Gaba Tepe<br/>Gallipoli Penin<br/>22nd Octr 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother<br/>Not having time to write any sort of a note last mail, I find I have quite a sheaf of letters and papers from home to acknowledge. The last 2 weeks have seemed to pass particularly quickly as I have been well treated with home correspondence &ndash; the following letters having reached me during that time &ndash; Father's of 22nd Aug. 23rd 28th (enclosing diary for week) 5th and 6th September, Mother's of Aug 2nd 22nd and 30th and Septr 5th, and Pat's of 14th and 30th Aug, also numerous "Heralds" &amp; T&amp;C Journal. It is the one bright spot in my existence when I have your letters and know you are all well &amp; to hear the latest home news.<br/>I am afraid from some of your letters that you have been somewhat disappointed at the lack of local color contained in my despatches, but really when engaged on a job of this kind, fluency does not seem to be at<br/>I</p>
