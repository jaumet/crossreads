<p>Thursday Feb.20.1919.   (102)<br/>Second day of leave. Belfast.<br/>The boat arrived at the warf in Belfast about 6.30. We went over to a free buffet run by the ladies of Ulster and had some breakfast. Then I went to the "Service Club" and stowed my kit there with the intention of having a look around Belfast.<br/>The big strike in the shipping yards of Belfast ended today and the men started work this morning. I followed the big stream of workers to Harland and Wolff's yards and as no admittance was available today I went over to Workman's Clark &amp; Co. Ltds yards where the men had started work &amp; I was admitted.<br/>I went through the machine shop &amp; where large machines were punching drilling and shearing ships plates. Then through the smith's shops where pipes, &amp; irons were being bent, shaped &amp; fitted for ships. There was an oxygen &ndash; aceteyline flash at work welding joints bends &amp; angles on pipes for various sizes. It was very quick &amp; effective.<br/>I returned by tram to the service club in Waring St.</p>
