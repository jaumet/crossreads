our Hqr's the dugouts here are built under the railway line & are not much good for they are so crowded I had charge of a party of 18 men to night & had to take them to an altogether new position, so the Captain called me in to his dugout & showed me the map of the sector, it was a fair way off & behind "Zillebeke" up towards the 2nd Bn. the name of the joint was Rudkin House but save the mark there's not 2 bricks left standing.
On the way up I was not quite sure of the way so I called in to the 2nd Bn Hqrs to enquire, I was shown in to where the officers were having their mess, & the Colonel told me I was on the right track
