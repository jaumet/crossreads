that I have it myself. The men all seem very quiet and dopey and I can see it will be necessary to get to work and stir things up thoroughly in the way of amusement and recreation for them. The fizz has long since gone off the War and everyone is most heartily sick of it all and wants to see it end. Last tour of duty we had more deserters than ever before in the history of the regiment and it hurts to think of good work spoilt by these bad ones. From here we see the flashes of the guns but hear no bombardments. The troops about and all the military business must make existence here a very different thing to what it was before the War. Some of our 6th. Division details reached us today men who have not been in France since the Pozieres fighting. The padre writing to the people of men he has buried. Our new doctor, Stevens, seems a good young chap.
