  
 5/4/17. Moved on this evening and camped for the night in a certain village. The whole countryside is a ruin, trees, shrubs. Villages have been ruthlessly destroyed, our gentle Hun is nothing if not thorough. He made great belts of barbed wire entanglements to stop our cavalry. He is still retiring slowly. 6/4/17. Went to the line last night with ammunition for Machine guns. It was strange to be walking about over stubble feilds ducking bullets. There is not a bit of cover. We were moved to a bivouac in Velu Wood. Have made a shelter of the boughs of a Yew Tree. It is an evergreen. Generally from the pastoral aspect of everything it is hard to believe there is a war on.
