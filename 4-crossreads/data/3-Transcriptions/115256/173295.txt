<p>Friday 5 February 1915</p>
<p>Nothing of any particular importance about which I can write to-day.  We are settling down to the ordinary routine of camp life which is briefly as follows:-  Reveille 6 a.m., Parade 7-7.50, Breakfast 8, Parade 9.30-12.30, Dinner 1 p.m., Parade 2.30-4.30, Tea 5.30, First Post, 9 p.m., Last Post 9.30 and Lights Out, 10 o'clock.  So it will readily be understood that there is not very much of interest.  The parades are held in the desert of Suez, or rather on the outskirts of this extremely barren tract of land.  The dust arising from the sand is disagreeable in the extreme.  And that is performing simple company movements.  What it will be like when we make a start with our Brigade training, march discipline with full pack up, and all the Divisional concentration, I do not care to anticipate.  Sufficient to say that many of our town bred Australians will curse the day they left their jobs to join the Force.  And yet these dusty marches through the desert will be nothing compared to what will be the hardships not of ragtime active service but the genuine article.</p>
