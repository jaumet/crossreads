<p>Mrs Steward &ndash; the nice N.Z. woman who came to Lemnos to see her husband Col. Steward die &ndash; is managing the tea room with her sister. They have fixed up a writing room and reading room as well and the boys were thoroughly enjoying the homeliness of it all. Such nice well groomed boys. I wish you could see them. Their clothes are old &amp; worn from Gallipoli, but they've brushed them up and get their boots &amp; leggings cleaned and hair well brushed &amp; shaven faces &ndash; so full of fun and health. It's a great work these women are doing for these men &ndash; and I often think how grateful the mothers at home would be to see that place with their boys happy and being cared for in an atmosphere of home. Keeping them out of the vilainous hole of places in this filthy city so reeking with temptation &amp; gaudy jaws of every sort absolutely being flaunted in</p>
