Was on stretcher squad yesterday but did not get more than a few cases.  We are only evacuating from the Borre & Strazeele areas now as the English have taken over Castre & Meteren.  Our A.D.S. run by the 1st Field Ambulance is at Borre which is being shelled just as badly as Castre I believe.
From rumours to official reports I have got clear idea now what happened when the Germans were finally held up here
