<p>prisoner refused to walk, a real rotter.  Got back to camp just in time for dinner.</p>
<p>1-5-1918<br/>Warned again to move off at 5-30 p.m.  Today is showery.  250 Artillerymen marched in here this morning.  An Infantryman shot himself yesterday.  This base camp is a home for some men.  Men have been here for 12 and 18 months at a stretch, name not on the roll.  Plenty of entertainments here such as moving pictures, concerts, lectures &amp; etc., mostly free.  The Bishop of Bathurst, C. of E. is in charge of the C. of E. hut.  He is a captain.  The Salvation Army caters for the troops in their hut.  You get a cup of tea and a packet of biscuits for 3 pence.  The Y.M.C.A. is doing the same.</p>
