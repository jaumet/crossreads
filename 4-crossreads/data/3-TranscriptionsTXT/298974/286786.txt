 4 There are no soldiers like them. Anzacs especially these lame and sad faced lads all around us, are the pride of the empire. They have acquitted themselves magnificently and paid a cruel price. I feel proud beyond words of Alan just as proud as I felt when I knew dear little Marion was to be all mine. 
 The question of whether I should go to the front now that Alan has gone must only be solved in one way Mother dear. I will go. Don't worry over it you know I was born lucky. There is not much chance of us being moved over to France for months. I don't think I will alter my mind, and even if I wanted it, I probably could not get a transfer. If conscription comes in it might make a difference. I will give it every consideration. 
 Give my best love to all at home. We have indeed suffered a sad sad thing in our happy home but it is a glorious thing. Goodbye Mother dear. 
 Your loving son Dene
