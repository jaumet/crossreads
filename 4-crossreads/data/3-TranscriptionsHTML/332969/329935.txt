<p>The chief games they play are Crown &amp;  Anchor &amp;  Banker. last night was very warm again most of the boys slept on deck, yest terday afternoon a large Mail boat passed us it was travelling much faster than we were our speed for yesterday was 243 Knots we had another concert last night it was very good. This morning 6.11.14 is much cooler &amp; very cloudy I got nockilated yesterday &amp; my arm is very sore this morning</p>
<p>On 7.11.14 nothing very startling happened we had another bath perade &amp; they threw a couple of the men into the water clothes &amp;  all. my arm is still very sore.</p>
<p>On the 8.11.14 we had a boxing &amp;  wrestling contest last night it was very good when ever there is a row between two men they always settle it in the ring. The days are getting very warm, nearly all the men are sleeping up on deck. I had rather a good sleep last night a little better than the night before as somewhere in the middle of the night a bag of turnips rolled down on a couple of us. Its just a week ago today since we left "Albany", time soon flies. It is very amusing to see some of them taking their usual early morning bath, when they are hoseing the deck down.</p>
