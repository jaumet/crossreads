 My darling Eddy. 
 Perhaps I shall be home before you get this. Have been told to be ready   &  to go off duty Tuesday-morn. Am longing to see my big nephew. Hope he is very well   &  will be able to take Auntie Eadle out. Sorry I have not another P.Card but this is like the French girls enjoy winter. The snow soon melts here   &  is not so clean as what we saw in France. Fondest love   &  heaps of kisses. From  Auntie Eadle.
