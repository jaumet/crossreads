<p>Tuesday<br/>I have been up to the lines again today.  The Bosh put in a great number of shells this evening.  We stood &amp; watched them.  I am sure he put 200 in one spot, evidently after a battery.  There is a shrill whining sound as the shell comes over then an upheaval like a huge water spout flinging dust &amp; dirt &amp; mingling smoke &amp; shell with it for 30 feet in the air, then the deafening crash.  No doubt that will be put on to his score &amp; probably tonight he will get about 6 times as much in return.  Mills came in with his Batt. today.<br/>It has been raining today &amp; the place is a bit sloppy.</p>
<p>Wednesday May 23rd<br/>Our men have now gone up to the wood at Ploegsteert and are camping in the wood under low canvas shelters.<br/>Plugstreet wood has been the scene of heavy fighting in this war.  It is a beautiful tract of woodland, I suppose about a mile &amp; a half square &amp; just now looks very nice.</p>
