<p>A shell burst at the back of the trench &amp; I ducked my head good job too as a piece of shell came crashing through my waterbottle &amp; let what water I had left out on the ground.  my equipment was on the bank just above my head as I had taken it off to do some more work as it had been raining &amp; the trench was all sloppy so that was the end of my water bottle.</p>
<p>The same night we got orders that as soon as it was dark I was to have all the men ready &amp; get as many picks &amp; shovells together as I could muster &amp; lead out of the trench &amp; the men were to follow me at two paces interval &amp; when I got out I was to advance half left &amp; go two hundred yards then halt &amp; the men would form up at two yards interval on my left which we did as soon as the shell fire had died down &amp; it was dark enough to move.</p>
<p>As soon as we got there we started to dig a new trench (we were dinkum diggers all right) &amp; dug all night long &amp; next morning we were in a bit more comfort tHan the old trench &amp; besides that we dodged the shells as Fritz was shelling an almost empty trench which we had left only two stretcher Bearers were there.</p>
<p>in the morning Fritz started early to put over a lot of Gas shells &amp; as there was a dense fog on early that morning until about 8 oclock when it cleared, we could not distinguish Gas from Fog &amp; there was a lot of sniffing going on to try &amp; detect gas which came along alright on the breeze &amp; we had to put</p>
