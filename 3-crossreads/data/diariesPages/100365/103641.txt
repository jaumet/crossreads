We are situated from 6 to 9 miles from the firing line on the Armentieres Lille fronts, at times the noise of the bombardment is terrific. Even now one can hear the dull boom reverberations of the big guns. At night time the whole sky is lit up with Star Shells, while one can smell the Gunpowder for miles.Where we are quartered the Uhlans were billeted in 1914, along the main Road where I had to proceed one can see signs of battle all along.Just where our horses waggons are parked the British Germans had a hand to hand fight which ended in the Germans being thrown out.
23.3.16 Friday There was a very pretty but terrible sight this morning plainly discernible from here. After a very heavy bombardment a Squadron of our Aeroplanes went up were immediately fired at by the Germans.You could see them skimming along amidst myriads of little white puffs, caused through the bursting of Shells. As far as I could see none of our planes were hit. They just went on calmly observing when finished flew away. So far we have not be troubled by German planes. We are all expecting to see a fight
