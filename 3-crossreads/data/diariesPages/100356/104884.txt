Air Fight
An hostile plane came over again early this morning visited us, then on to Duiedar, then to Hill 40 70, meanwhile one of our own battle planes had time to get up was waiting for it right above us, the enemy was unaware of him until he swooped right down on him opened up with his machine gun, meanwhile the deutcher was off for his life, our chap gave chase rattled the lead into him, the deutcher was twisting, turning, banking, etc later he was seen to wobble finally he landed about Bir-el-Abd, our own also had to come down for Fritz planted a shot in his petrol tank.
