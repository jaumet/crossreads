  
 July 1917 1st   (Sunday)   We had a heavy shower of rain during the night, & the place is very sloppy as a result, but although the weather has been dull all day, the rain kept off, & we were able to make final preparations for the Regatta. All the pontoons & superstructure of the three companies, was removed from our old position, further up stream to about half a mile above the Lock.   A suitable place for the sports has been decided upon & we made a start to prepare the place.   A large lagoon adjoins the canal, & the swimming & diving part of the programme is to take place in there.
