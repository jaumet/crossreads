<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I have joined the Battalion now, so in future my address will be Pvt. D B Fry 4992 A D Coy. 3rd Battalion. A.I.F. Abroad. Keep to this till I tell you of any other. The censorship is very strict indeed so you must not expect any news concerning things. I have met Cleve Edmonds &amp; we are together now. Cleve has seen a lot of fighting and is so far all right, but lots of the boys need a good rest Capt Tyson is O.C. Coy. I'm not likely to see stripes for some time, as it all goes by seniority in the Battalion here, &amp; I've only just joined up. I'm the first of the 19th Reinfs over here</p>
