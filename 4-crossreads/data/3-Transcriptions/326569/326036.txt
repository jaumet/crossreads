<p>arrival in England.  In afternoon had route march to Barford.  Roads being very hard, are inclined to make the feet sore.  Saw aeroplane for 1st time.</p>
<p>Sunday, 8/4/17<br/>Daylight Saving started this morning.  Reviewed at 11.30 a.m. by C.G. Wade from N.S.W. &amp; some high military officers.  Afternoon turned very cold &amp; strong wind blowing.  Took down laundry (with L.J. Smith)  to the same farmhouse.  Bought  &frac12; mess tin full of cocoa from canteen for 3d. to wash down dinner.  Plenty bread &amp; soup for tea.  Treacle &amp; dripping rushed as usual but I got my share.  Another aeroplane passed over camp this afternoon.  Engines of it make tremendous noise.</p>
