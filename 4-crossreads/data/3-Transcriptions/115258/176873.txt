<p>chaps were nearly fighting over a bit of dry tea leaves to smoke. I was bale to laugh at them and I reckoned that was good enough to leave it alone altogether. The comforts fund put a tin of butter in their parcel and I was just going to open it this morning for breakfast when I gave it a shake and it sounded just like water, so we are putting it in soak <u>till</u>&nbsp;along with my water bag until breakfast tomorrow, and we hope it will be a bit harder then. I had a look at the stiches round your parcels before I opened them and I could pick out each word Father had said as he was sewing them up by the look of the stich. He must have said some awful words! Will stop now. Love to Father &amp; Fred and yourself. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson.</p>
<p>P.S. One of the chaps in with our <s>lead</s> led horses wrote a letter to a chap out here yesterday, this is how he addressed it.</p>
