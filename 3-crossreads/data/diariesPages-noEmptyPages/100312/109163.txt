Another grey dull day. James came over for some Courts Martial and stayed to dinner. During the morning specialist training but we blew ?dismiss" when cold rain started. Cleared up after lunch for tug of war and other sports including horse mule races. Some of these provided much amusement. Looking round from here the country is seen flat and with a few scattered farms surrounded by trees now bare of leaves. Should be rather pretty in spring but now it is a typical old world winter scene. A few of our planes circling round. Pay was issued yesterday and the usual waste in drink takes place for a couple of days and they then go poor for the rest of the month. Recommended Bunning for an instructional job at a School
