My dear AuntyI received your letter of March 18th &amp; was very pleased to hear from you.
I had a letter from Frank a week or two ago &amp; he was quite well at time of writing, he also said that the weather had begun to improve &amp; that where he is now there is not so much mud.
We are experiencing very decent weather here, not nearly so hot as "the Sinai Sands". At present we are camped near the beach, we were sent here for a rest, we have only been here a day or two &amp; have no idea how long we are likely to stay
June 4I believe there is some prospect of us getting two or three days leave. It is about seven months since we had our last leave to Port Said &amp; Alexandria, so they ought to be able to spare us a few days each.
Things have been quiet here lately there is practically "nothing doing"
