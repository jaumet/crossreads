 To night we advanced our trenches to the other side of the "Pozeries" wood    Some of our chaps got some bonzer trophies, Zeiss glasses watches, rings, compassis, revolvers & etc & helmets by the thousand. 
 This afternoon we got 15 German Red Cross prisoners, they were marched down & searched & 13 of the dogs were found to be carrying daggers & revolvers they promptly put against the wall & finished.
