<p>THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; warm. Jo drove Dad &amp; I into</p>
<p>Quirindi in the big car to the</p>
<p>Graziers Meeting. Nothing much</p>
<p>doing at the meeting, but saw</p>
<p>most of the Plains folk. The red</p>
<p>buss jibbed coming out at bottom</p>
<p>of the Who-d-thought-it, but got</p>
<p>her home all right.</p>
<p>Daly was over and handled</p>
<p>the stalion. Tickle round the</p>
<p>paddocks. He skinned two cows</p>
<p>in the Boundary.</p>
<p>Joe Perry shifted cattle</p>
