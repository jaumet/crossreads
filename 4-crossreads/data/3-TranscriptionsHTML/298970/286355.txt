<p>come from a Captain's letter to one of the Australian Papers I think the information is really good and reliable.<br/>Having got to this stage I was almost forgetting one of the most outstanding and brilliant episodes of the fight.  While working in the firing line when the fray was at its height we passed Major Williams of our Ambulance carrying a stretcher with a Private from the infantry.  With no headgear on and perspiration running off him I was simply astounded, so much so that I paused to watch him.  Yes, a Major silently working in the very front line and doing a private's work.  Until I saw him I understood that he would be back at the Brewery to perform operations and rearrange dressings as required.<br/>Here we have the White Man so well remembered and respected by everyone since the memorable great march in Egypt.</p>
