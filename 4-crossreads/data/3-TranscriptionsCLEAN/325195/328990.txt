 This morning Nelson & I had to into Mule gully where we met the Sergeant & senior Cpl from the 2nd& 3rd also Srg-Major Latham who took us around & showed us where each others lines ran. So as we should be able to know them in case any of them got cut by a bullet or any other cause; We were on duty at FRA till 6 oclock last night & I had to leave Les &Reid to attend to the work  while I went to Bde; I got back to camp after an interesting walk round Destroyers Hill & Camel Hump & back to camp through FRA & FH . made some jam tarts this afternoon out of flour, suet, sugar & jam. cooked them in fat, & they turned out real good. We have been keeping what little flour we get for some time hoping for Baking Powder, but I now think I can produce better pastry without. Came on duty at FH at 5 oclock.
