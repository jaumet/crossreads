<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>COMBATS IN THE AIR</p>
<p>On the 26th the pilot of a BRISTOL FIGHTER patrolling near SHELLAL saw an enemy aeroplane North of GAZA flying South. The BRISTOL climbed to 16,000 feet, and approached the H.A. with the sun behind him. The H.A. which appeared to be a RUMPLER, turned inland at the mouth of the WADI CHUZZE and was apparently taken completely by surprise when the observer of the BRISTOL FIGHTER opened fire on him at close range. The enemy machine circled, losing height rapidly and flew off in the direction of his own lines. The BRISTOL followed firing with the front gun, and driving the H.A. down to 1,000 feet.</p>
<p>The B.E.2.E.'s escorted by two BRISTOL FIGHTERS were attacked by a scout machine on the 28th. The H.A. apparently had not seen the BRISTOL FIGHTERS which both attacked him at once, driving him down close to the ground.<br/>On the 29th the pilot of a BRISTOL MONOPLANE met three two-seater enemy machines. He immediately attacked the nearest, but had only fired three bursts when his gun jammed. In spite of this the enemy machines showed no inclination to come to close quarters but fired at the monoplane at long range without however, doing it any damage.<br/>On the same day, two B.E.12's returning from a photographic reconnaissance met and attacked a small two-seater enemy biplane. The H.A. owing to its superior speed, escaped in the direction of BEERSHEBA.<br/>On the 30th one of our BRISTOL FIGHTERS attacked an enemy two-seater near HKALASSA. Several good bursts were fired at the H.A. at close range, and he was seen to dive into a cloud. Information to the effect that he had landed just outside our lines and that both occupants were captured by our troops was received later.<br/>On the 31st, a BRISTOL FIGHTER escorting a strategical reconnaissance saw a H.A.  2,000 feet below him. The BRISTOL dived and with both guns fired about 200 rounds. The H.A. spiralled down, and the BRISTOL had to leave it to return to the reconnaissance machines.</p>
