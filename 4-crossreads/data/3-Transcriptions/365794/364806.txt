<p>Saturday 26.10.'18<br/>Just 1 year since our arrival here (by calendar date), a w'k over really.  C. Loddiges gives good cough mist 10 a.m. Friday &amp; examines wrist, orders bandage.  Saturday 9 a.m. has both wrists x-rayed by Capt. Reid &ndash; result, slight thickening &ndash; strapped if no better.  Very smart M.O. in ward, said to be the best in 31st.<br/>Off 2-5, print photos.  Convoys fewer today but every bed full in D. i.</p>
<p>Sunday, 27/10/'18<br/>Off 5 p.m.  Major Birch came, took me Shepheard's tea &ndash; very pretty scene &amp; enjoyable talk &amp; motor ride back to 31st.  Convoys are beginning again.  Sent all Xmas greetings across the water.  Did duty in home 'till 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Monday<br/>Very busy day, had ward thoroughly cleaned.  No M.O., C. Loddiges ill.  Major Gaffney did a "round" 7 p.m.  F.E.H. not at all impressed.  Off duty 2-5.  Photo printing, writing, etc.  Lovely day only still rather hot.</p>
