After dinner 4th Mate & self went ashore and visited what are supposed to be "the sights" of Alexandria; hiring a carriage and a guide we first went to Pompeys Pillar, a great column of stone towering over 100 feet in the air, & which was erected about 1300 years ago.  Underneath the pillar, and cut through the earth are long subterranean passageways, running in all directions which lead to different places where members of the Royal families of that period were buried, here we were given a pencil to write our names on a piece of paper which we placed in an alcove, were there were already thousands of slips of names & addresses of people who have visited the caves, or catacombs since their discovery 14 years ago.  The guide who showed us around, independent of our tour guide had a string of beads which he kept in his hand all the time to scare off evil spirits.
