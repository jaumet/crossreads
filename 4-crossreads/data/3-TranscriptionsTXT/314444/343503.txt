 My Dear Spencer, 
 You will probably be surprised to hear from me, but to tell you the truth there is small time for letter writing over here. When we are up at the Line there are few opportunities, &amp; when resting, I am afraid, our time is taken up with other things, mostly disapations. Anyway we are out now for a good spell, hence this note. 
 I often wonder how you &amp; the rest of the old lot are progressing, and wonder if these old times will return. It is now nearly three years since I left sunny New South for my years holiday,  some  holiday.
