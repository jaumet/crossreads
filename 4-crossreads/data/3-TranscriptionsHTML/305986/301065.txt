<p>here, left at 10.30 this morning and marched through Warloy &amp; Albert and on here, I didnt feel the march extra much, but I was jolly glad when it was through. Everything is frozen hard here, all the Taps on the water carts and pumps frozen hard, you are constantly reminded of the facts that you have ears. It was very cold yesterday and miserable, but today the sun was actually shining, the first time Ive seen it for a long time</p>
