This afternoon we had an open air concert & Y.M.C.A. flag day & as you know this was the first time I had ever had the opportunity of buying a flag, sounds funny after nearly 3 years of war, but as you know I have always been in the thick of it & never even saw such a thing before Lena Ashwells party gave the concert in "Candahars" ground & we had a fine band & all there it was a lovely afternoon & I think everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves, & at 7 oclock tonight the Australian Band is going to give a concert.17th.
