<p>cavalry reached Aubigny in 1914  I believe.  No damage done &amp; everything looks beautiful on this clear cold morning.  The sun seems more brilliant after the dull weather yesterday.<br/>Scenery: mostly wild &amp; beautiful woods on the sides of hills.  Plenty of cultivation.<br/>11 A.M.  Less foliage now.<br/>Large fields of cultivation.  Every few minutes a long train passes us on its way from the direction of Arras, full of coal.  Nothing but coal has passed us this morning; no troops at all &amp; the traffic on this line some 50 miles from the front line, (I should judge) is practically negligible</p>
