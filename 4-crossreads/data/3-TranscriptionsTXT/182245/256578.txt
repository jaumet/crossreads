  From  
 Sat 7 th &nbsp;April 
 fight lasting about quarter of an 
 hour. One came down safely, with 
 observer killed &amp; pilot wounded 
 &amp; the other came down in flames. It 
 was one of the most terrible sights I 
 ever want to see to see this thing 
 coming down in flames &amp; the two 
 men slowly burning to death. There 
 was lots of mysterious lights &amp;&nbsp; 
 sounds all night, &amp; aeroplanes or 
 air-shIps going about all night. 
 I had one of the most interesting 
 times I have ever had today. 
 Fritz lobbed a shell in 
 left section position.
