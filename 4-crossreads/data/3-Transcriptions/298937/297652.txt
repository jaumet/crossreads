<p>a chance before, of seeing the effect of the war on these fine people.<br/>Had they come here first, they would have played the game all the while.<br/>Truly the war is doing good in an indirect way.</p>
<p>Sunday 13th Aug.</p>
<p>Went to Marseilles again yesterday &amp; visited Notre Dame de la Grande, the fine Roman Catholic Cathedral on a hill to the <strike>west</strike> east of the town.<br/>Travelled by tram part of way &amp; then walked up hill</p>
