<p>graves etc but never dream't I would be a party or a witness to such things. Nearly every tent here has a skeleton outside as an ornament or something esle &amp; from some grave. Not far from our camp is the Cemetery of ancient Heliopolis - &amp; the whole ground is strewn with bones &amp; skulls, all graves are exposed &amp; left open, some of the Australians have dug for days to be only rewarded with a skull &amp; perhaps a few poor specimens of beads. No doubt it is on records some fellows have found valuables among the vaults. One gets that way that you think nothing of doing such things.</p>
