All hands were anxious to have a glimpse of the head lines & when they were read out, satisfaction was expressed on all sides that the Surrender of Turkey & Austria seeking an Armistice & the Revolution in Vienna and Budapest was a good sign of hostilities [ceasing] very shortly. After that we continued  our sidings & left for home at  pm taking a number of loaded trucks back to Conchil to go forward over the truck lines to their destinations & then back again to the depot & signed off at 10 pm when I had a hot cup of coffee & toast & turned in & read the paper.
As the paper is of special interest, I will write some notes from it for future reference. On the front page dated November 1st 1918, large head lines were printed -
Turkey Surrenders, Fleet to Sail to Constantinople
Austrian Army seeks Armistice
Revolution in Vienna and Budapest
Germany fighting alone
In smaller print -
Turkey has surrendered to the Allies
