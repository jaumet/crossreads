Apl 30  stained floor, with a strip of brown lino up the centre. Centre table with green & white tiled top & with brass edging, & several small tables acting as stands for flowers & ferns. Had a nice hot bath but unluckily attempted to blow my nose; thought my head had come off, by the jar it gave my eye. Told the C of E parson I was an Aust Freethinker, & he sheered off. Been sitting at the main entrance gazing out to sea & watching the nice girls go past, & they are nice too.
May 1 Cloudy & cool. Chaps keep coming & going. There are several Australian Sisters giving a hand in this Hospital. Met one this morning. A fellow cant even look out of the main entrance gate now. The D- Tommy police block him. Stone the crows I don't want to be in any more of their Hospitals. There's a Canadian on my left whose speech is very like that of Uncle Albert. I'm going over to Blighty (home)[in margin] R
