<p>Saturday 4 May</p>
<p>The central relay is a cottage whose back door is away from Fritz's lines, but whose surroundings are under direct observation.  Capt Young &amp; Sgt [indecipherable] live here, &amp; we all mess together at a hard double table in the living room.  There was a food stove in originally, but a better has been salvaged (with an oven) &amp; put in today.</p>
<p>Our squad sleeps in a tunnel of [indecipherable] in an adjacent building.  This was once a hop drying kiln, &amp; is</p>
