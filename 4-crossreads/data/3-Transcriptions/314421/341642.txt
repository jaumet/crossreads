<p>Our aeroplanes were thick in the sky from dawn till dark. Visibility was unusually good, &amp; they had exceptional opportunities for attacking enemy infantry, battery positions, and transport with their machine guns. Many tons of bombs were dropped behind the German lines, in addition to the systematic harassing of troops in forward lines. German aeroplanes were also active. Four of them cleverly camouflaged (disguised) in order to be undiscernible until only a few hundred feet above the ground, swept towards our lines from Polygon Wood in the morning, but were quickly chased away. The German version of the battle confirms Haigs report, and admits strong english attacks on a broad front. Heavy casualties were inflicted on the enemy &amp; we have over 2000 prisoners &ndash; Prussians &amp; Bavarians.</p>
