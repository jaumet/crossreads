<p>March 1915<br/>Wednesday 17<br/>Feeling better. Headache left me of a morning. Just coming on to my appetite. Wrote three letters yesterday, one to Hal one to Flo, &amp; one to Mr. &amp; Mrs McKie From the balcony I can see the pyramids. They are only a quarter of a mile up the old avenue on the large sand ridge. Many tourists go by here to see them</p>
<p>Thursday 18<br/>Complained to Sister attending our ward that we were not getting enough to eat at meal times. She promptly ordered more food for us and we got it.</p>
