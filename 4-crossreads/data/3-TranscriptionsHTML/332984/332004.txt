<p>Huns continue to come over.  Look like a flock of sparrows after a fly.  A few shells whistling about our lines during the night, never any in the day time.</p>
<p>10.11.1916   Beautiful day.  Big stunt, 5.30 till 9.15. A.M.  Air alive with Hun aeroplanes.  One gun 1st Bty blown.  One of our guns sent to workshops for repairs.</p>
<p>11.11.1916   Foggy morning, Indication of more rain.  The 1st Bty had 12 horses killed and wounded, also 2 men wounded.  The Bty was retreating,  We the 2nd Bty had to lend a hand, supplying horses and men, Turned out at 11 P.M.  Stupendous bombardment, all night, particularly intense just now 5.A.M.  Advanced 1600 yards, capturing a number of field pieces.  Major Matson A.D.V.S. inspecting our horses.  A bright lot I must say, about 30 out of action.  Asking why they were not groomed, nice question, considering that they were ploughing through mud up to their bellys all night.</p>
