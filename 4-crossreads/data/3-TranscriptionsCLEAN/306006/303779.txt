Ben came over at 11 oclock this morning to say he cannot get away this afternoon, it was too late to apply for a pass when I got up this morning, so I faked an old one & at 2.30 I was at Abassia put in an hour yarning to Roper, James & Scott who are in hospital & then went across to the Sisters quarters. Harris came on the scene shortly afterwards & Hills, Cobb, Harris & I drove in to Cairo engaged a car & went to the Citadel, then for a spin around Gezerieh after tea at Groppis arriving back at Abbassia shortly after 6 oclock, left Hills there &
