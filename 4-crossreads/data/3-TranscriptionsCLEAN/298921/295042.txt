  
 March,1915 Wednesday 10 Did musketry today at Abassia Range & shot well, the Dust & heat are getting worse - This country is very rough on your skin being so dry only 21/2" per annum yet the natives celebrate the time when the winter is over & the warm weather begins - We are still uncertain of our destination, but all will be glad to leave Egypt now that the Sarroceo winds blow daily & the heat is like the Back country.
