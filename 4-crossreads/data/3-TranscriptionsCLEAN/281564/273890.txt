The forest is, despite the fact that no rain has fallen for four months, on every side impregnable. The taller trees such as figs, & banyans, readfruit, cocoanut besides hundreds of others without name, & matted together by lawyer canes & numerous other vines all joining to make an impenetrable labrynth. We saw one pig but did not get a shot at it & eventually retuned at five to barracks. Of course we had shot a pig - a monster with wild eyes and curling tusks which charged us through the scrub & fell dead a few feet off us with two bullets buried in his brain.
