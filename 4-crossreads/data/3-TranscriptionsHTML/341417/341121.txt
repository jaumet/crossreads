<p>Dear Mrs. Dunlop</p>
<p>Just a line to say I am well &amp; happy in wearing your knitted socks. The Autumn is here &amp; soon I think we will get real Winter but as <strike>for</strike> we have had only 2 months of cool weather with a snap of cold in it for the past 10 &frac12; months it will be a change.<br/>We are engaged in plenty of daily work some of it grim, some pleasant, usual lights &amp; sounds of active warfare one sees almost daily but our men are cheery</p>
