<p>naturally a very fine book, but why, because one of the characters was at the battle of Waterloo, should I have to read the whole history of that battle and the lives of the generals thereof? &ndash; this, to me, makes the reading of this book too great an undertaking, at least under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Jan; 7<br/>We often have the Band &ndash; though rather nosiy, to get away from it some little distance it isn't so bad. Also occasionally we have concerts &ndash; Lieut. Geddes has a very charming voice, well-trained; but there is always such a crowd of men and so much discomfort, interjections and noise, that I prefer not to go to these concerts.</p>
<p>Jan; 8<br/>Practise despatch running &ndash; general instructions. I have dinner in the sergeants' mess, which is quite excellent; stewards, etc., though I get into trouble for this. Up to date somehow I have always managed to have thin bread and butter; the boys say they like theirs thick, something they can get their teeth into; for my part this puts me off it &ndash; afraid I'm a snob even in my feeding; can't stand food in big quantities &ndash; for four days I've eaten ;practically nothing; even now I cannot get used to the rough conditions with which I am surrounded.</p>
<p>Jan; 9<br/>Have a chat with Willoughby Bell &ndash; he's awfully een for me to read a little book on the South African War. I skim it</p>
