<p>Lt. McCarthy of "C" Company was wounded (died shortly after) by one of our own shells dropping short.<br/>They had the wrong range &amp; the more we signalled an aeroplane the more shells we got.<br/>Poor Ball the bomber got struck on the chest &amp; killed &amp; Sam Warke wounded on forehead.<br/>It took an hour or so to get word through to stop them.<br/>After that all day long we could walk about the ruins of Pozieres &amp; what is left of the orchards as if there weren't such insects as "Fritzs" in the world.<br/>Then poor old Bill Dixon got sniped through the head from some "possies" so we started to clear out the hiding places in the intact cellar under heaps of ruins.<br/>We got 3 machine guns &amp; about 90 prisoners out of them but only allowed ourselves the pleasure of some of the prisoners company.<br/>One prisoner, a Medical Officer said he was surprised that we thought there would be an opposition as they were Bavarians.<br/>That's alright &ndash; but they'll turn a machine gun on to you if they get a chance. They are good fighters when there is not much risk to themselves. "Hand to hand" you can go through them as easily as a dose of Epsom. They up with their hands &amp; put in the good old "Kamerad".<br/>Thought the "Germs" were going to counter attack this morning but it was only a party of them that were cut-off in the melee</p>
