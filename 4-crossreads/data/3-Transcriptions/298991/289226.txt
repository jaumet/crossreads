<p>Thursday Oct 11th<br/>A more strict watch was kept over the natives selling fruit etc to the troops today, by Officers &amp; the provost staff. Very few things were sold by the natives. Sultan of Egypt reported dead today. Nearly everyone is getting about with only a pair of "shorts" &amp; a shirt on, owing to the very hot weather.</p>
<p>Friday Oct 12th<br/>The natives keep well away from the boat now through being so constantly pelted at &amp; hurt by the military police. A good deal of gambling goes on since pay day, one fellow was caught &amp; got 7 days detention. The guns of the fort here were practicing today, some fairly good shots could be observed.</p>
<p>Saturday Oct 13th<br/>Was 21 years old today. Left Sierra Leone about 2.30 pm this afternoon. Sea was very calm. We have a different "Cruiser" with us this time &amp; one more ship.</p>
