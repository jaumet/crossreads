panorama and over the Messines ridge and all the German positions to the fair land beyond. Ypres scarred and white lay beyond the Dickebush Lake. Further over was the Zillebeke by the shores of which we had a wet Battn H.Q. just a year ago. Now a place some miles behind the front line. From out of this grey plain an occasional gun flash lashed upwards. The towers of Menin could be plainly seen despite a ground mist that the wind had not shifted. Armentieries lay plain to view and further over in the dim distance could be faintly made out with difficulty, the outlines of Lille. A party of Japanese officers was up here looking round. Returned to Battalion H.Q. in time to see the guard mounting. Nothing special about the guard tonight. After mess a debate on conscription took place the Ayes were captained by Wall and the Nays by Gorman. Some very good speeches were made by both sides. Summing up by Southwell.
