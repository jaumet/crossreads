 Marcinelle 12/3/19 A mild springlike but dull day. To the 22nd and fixed up divers things and then round to see General Robertson at D.H.Q. where we made preliminary arrangements for the final winding up of the Brigade. Put in the morning completing the arrangements. G. Bailey having done us in the eye for 1000 francs I arranged to bring him to book at a Court of Inquiry. The afternoon was showery. Visited Charleroi &amp; then trammed to Mont-sur-Marchienne where the 2nd beat 4th Div at football. Dined at Bde.H.Q and then did a round of the town where Mme Germaine was taking a walk. Called for some photographs and then went to Thewlis billet and then to the Officer's Mess where I had a good talk to Frenyer and others. Tonight V.N. Moore was running a dance.
