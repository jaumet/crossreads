We are just at the Equator, except for a few hour's, or day's, sailing, &amp; the sun is warm, but the weather is so perfect that we don't mind the heat at all &amp; enjoy getting sunburnt. As we had to be dressed in dungaree clothes for Church Parade this morning I only wore shoes &amp;  socks  sox, short dungaree trousers &amp; dungaree coat, buttoned up to the neck so that the officer wouldn't notice that I had no shirt on. So far so good:  but Church Parade got warm &amp; as Alan &amp; I were not in front we soon had our coats off  &amp; but fo  &amp; then felt quite all right. At breakfast this morning four at our table came dressed in shorts only.
