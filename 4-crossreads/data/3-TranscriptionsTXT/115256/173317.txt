 Saturday 27 February 1915 
 The usual half-holiday, or rather the apology for same was granted this afternoon at exactly quarter to four!  Morning parade ends at 12.45 p.m.  Dinner is always finished at the latest by 1.45 p.m.  Where the delay comes in, nobody seems to know, but the fact remains that this Saturday half holiday business is becoming a farce.  Of course, it is argued, there need be no holidays or no leave granted on active service.  But when orders to officers commanding units distinctly state that work is to be arranged in such a way as to make the half-holiday possible, and especially as the other battalions of the brigade are off by at the latest at 2 p.m., the grumbling at the falling in to inspect the lines, then the falling out until the "disperse" is sounded, and then the falling in again to be dismissed, is obviously excusable.  It is exactly this continual suffering of petty annoyances and petty tyranny (you can conveniently hide a lot of things under the phrase "military discipline") that is causing discontent and ill-feeling towards the officers.  For myself, being young, and always used to a certain amount of discipline at school and at home, I do not feel this being constantly humbugged about.  But for older, married men with families ("Wait till I get him in the firing line").
