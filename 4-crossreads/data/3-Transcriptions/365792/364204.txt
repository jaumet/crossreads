<p>Apl 30 Sunday today, &amp; some of the boys have gone to C of E early Communion which is held at 6.30, as for me I must get busy &amp; write a few more letters else my friends will be thinking I've passed it in. Asked the Colonel about a cable but he doesn't appear to Compree, so have posted it to Uncle Jim. My present wealth amounts to 22 odd Francs but cant get out to spend any of it. At the 1st F.A. on the 26th the Doc inoculated me in the stomach; what for I havnt the least idea. Yesterday, because I did'nt stand up all the time the Doc was in the Ward the old cat of a Matron went dead sore; &amp; today she did her block because I spoke to the Canadian next to me.<br/>'Talk about rough'. These Tommy Hospitals are the dead limit &amp; I'll be damn glad to get away. The buildings are of iron &amp; lined with a sort of smooth iron. Plenty of ventilation, dark blue blinds, red bed covers,<br/>[in margin] <u>Sunday</u></p>
