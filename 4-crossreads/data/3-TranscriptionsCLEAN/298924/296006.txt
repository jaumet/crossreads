  
 Friday 24 January 1919 Rafa Got as far as the Regt. reaching Egypt in my History, but records are poor to work on. Attended a Lecture on the problems of the East in the Y.M.C.A. but too cold for comfort. Here at Rafa is a large ammunition dump & at different hours loud explosions take place in destroying quantities of Turkish ammunitions.  Great numbers of arms of all sorts have been thrown into the Mediteranean.  More Australian mail in.  Mother & Day December 1st with Diary & cutting, many thanks.  Hope Joe has arrived safely long before this.
