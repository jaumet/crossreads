<p>Our transport joins us up once more so the unit is complete.</p>
<p>11 January 1916 Tues 12 January 1916 Wed<br/>Route march to the old trenches of Tel-el Kebir. Very tiring marching through the sand. This place reminds me so much of the One Tree plain of New South Wales only I know that the old town of Booligal does not lay on the other side of it. Will I ever forget my trip across there with Tom Freeman. I wonder if he is taking part in this great war. I have met several of the coves who I worked side by side with in the shearing shed in day of yore. Fine chaps as some of them were left the bones on Gallipoli.</p>
