<p>chance to have a ood feed of fruit which is very cheap here The nigers nearly draged us to pieces trying to sell us stones and all sorts of rubbish It was that hot we lost about two buckets of perspiration. We came back to the boat loaded up with pineaples &amp; Bananas. One chap brought a little monkey aboard and a big bag of nuts &amp; fruit. to feed him on.</p>
