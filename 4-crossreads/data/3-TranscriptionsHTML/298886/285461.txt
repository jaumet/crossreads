<p>we generally off saddle for a couple of hours for lunch and to escape the worst heat of the day. I am lying down under a lovely green shady tree on a natural carpet of grass. And I don't think I could find a more ideal spot if I tried. This is a glorious life. Up at 5.30 AM each morning breakfast and saddle up and move along the road in the lovely morning air. Then at midday halt under some inviting clump of trees later on march again &amp; reach Camp at about 5 p.m. tie up our horses anywhere handy. No particular place give them a groom and feed them then we have our own meal wait for the transport wagons for our blankets &ndash; find a comfortable spot and prepare for another nights repose and so it goes on. What could be better or more natural?</p>
<p>We don't have any ailments It's a sure panacea for all ills to which the flesh is heir to. The only time when the boys don't feel good for the march is when they have returned from some neighbouring hotel the previous evening with &ndash; what Blatchford describes as "Vine leaves in their hair!" The after effects are of course felt next morning But as they say in Arabic "Malish" (Never mind) The boys say they will be a long time dead why worry over trifles like that?</p>
