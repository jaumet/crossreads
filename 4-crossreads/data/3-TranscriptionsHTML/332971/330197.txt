<p>English Hospitals are at Mudros &amp; East Mudros.  The first afternoon I was here &ndash; Sister Rush, her Brother &amp; I walked over to the village.  Portiana 3 miles away &ndash; everything was so quaint and primitive &ndash; we saw some women weaving cotton, bought a few luxuries in sweets &amp; nuts &amp; also were lucky to strike some tomatoes.

<p>21st  How interested you would all be in our Hospital could you only pay us a visit.  It's all what you would expect a field Hospital to be &ndash; rows of Marquees (as wards) &amp; bell tents.  We have beds for 1040 patients &ndash; though at present we have 1200 patients.  So some still are on Mattresses on the ground, they don't mind though &amp; seem perfectly contented.  I am on duty with Sister McMillan (Sir W McMillan's) daughter HH;;;;Hiiiojuuh7ygikl<br/>- She is the essence of Sweetness and lacks any red-tape &ndash; so I am very happy.  We have 30 boys half on beds &amp; half on mattresses.  We hope soon to be fully equipped &ndash; here we have to have patients.  We are really roughing it but the majority of us are as happy as can be.  We feel as if we are doing what we came out to do, and as long as we can benefit the boys in making them better comfortable &amp; contented we do not mind.  Our chief luxury is exercise &amp; fresh air &amp; we get those in abundance &amp; which gives us a keen</p>
