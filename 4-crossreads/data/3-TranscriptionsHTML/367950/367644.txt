<p>About 1.30 am we had a heavy shower of rain which lasted for about half an hour most of the men got wet through &ndash; not being prepared for such contingencies we are now halted about 1 mile east of Bir El Abd for a spell, of about one hour we give the horses a drink then off saddle and the horses have a roll in the clean sand which is very beneficial to them then put the pot on and make a drop of tea and have something to eat the horses are enjoying the contents of the nose bags. The sand has been very wet coming along this morning and the horses perspired a good deal  3 of our aeroplanes came back from El Arish going back to Kantara flying very high.<br/>6 pm.
