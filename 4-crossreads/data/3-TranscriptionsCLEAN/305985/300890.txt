  
 "My little wet home in the Trench" To the tune of my little Grey home in the west. 
 I 
 I have a little wet home in the trench Which the rainstorms continually drench There is a dead Turk close by With his feet to the sky And he gives off a beautiful stench Underneath in the place of a floor There is a mass of wet mud and some straw And the Jack Johnsons tear Through the rain-sodden air Oer my little wet home in the trench 
 II 
 There are snipers who keep on the go So you must keep your nappers down low And the star shells at night Make a deuce of a light Which causes the language to flow Then bully and biscuits we'll chew For tis days since we've seen a stew But with shells dropping there There's no place to compare With my little wet home in the Trench
