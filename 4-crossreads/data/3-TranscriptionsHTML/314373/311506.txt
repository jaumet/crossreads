<p>Hiding a portion of it and stretching as far as the eye could see were the hills on the horizon of rich blue colours, whilst separated from them by a band of purple was the endless red desert looking as vast and endless as the ocean we had lately crossed and as pitiless as when seen at midday when the sun makes it a waving mass of heat.  Draped over it is the morning mist and through this veil thousands of camels  from the camp silently wend their way across it, led by their Arab drivers swathed from head to foot in their loose black robes, making it all look like one hugh procession of spirits. However, the thoughts that such a scene as this gives rise to are dispelled only too soon by the order to double, for every one of us has sore feet, and unless spirits can use some rather strong language we could certainly not be described as above.
