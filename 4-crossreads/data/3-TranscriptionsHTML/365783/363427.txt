<p>At 8.30 next morning we started off on the excursion to the Tombs of the Kings, a donkey ride of about 12 miles there &amp; back.    Our dragoman had provided the sheepskin &amp; this proved to be an inestimable boon.  On this trip we went right up into the mountains through a wild &amp; barren gorge.   At the end of the gorge are some 30 or 40 tombs of Kings, we had time for three only &ndash; in one of them we saw the mummy King in his sarcophagus just as he had been placed ages ago.   From the top of the mountain pass we enjoyed a beautiful view of the Nile valley &ndash; the descent was too steep to ride our donkeys &amp; we had to pad the hoof for a couple of miles.   We arrived at the Ramesseum at lunch time &amp; here found a nice hamper waiting for us.   The Ramesseum is the temple &amp; palace of Rames II the Pharoah of the Oppression.  After lunch we got aboard the donkeys once more &amp; retraced our steps to Luxor  &amp; after visiting the Temple there got back to the hotel &amp; had a bath &amp; some afternoon tea.   We left Luxor at 6 in the evening &amp; had the good luck once more to get a compartment to ourselves.   Cairo was reached at 7 in the morning &amp; at 9 we were back in our tents at the camp.</p>
