Bulford2/9/17Dear Mum, Dad & George,I have not much news but I must write to let you know that we are both well.  I rode to Salisbury again yesterday.  It was a Knock-out going in, as there was a dead-on headwind.  When I arrived there, My Mate who had gone in by train was just going to the Matinee of Peg O' My Heart.  I thought I'd go too, so he & His Lady Friend & I had a very nice Time.  I afterwards went down to my Friends in the "Close" & one of the Girls & I went again at night to give my Friend a Treat.  It was pretty late when we got out & we were just in Time to get in, as the Close Gate is shut at 11 p.m.  I had supper & left about 11.10 pm.  It was a perfect & glorious moonlight night.  I took off My leggings & made Myself Comfy.  I waited for another Cyclist, there is always a crowd riding Home, & picked up a N.Z. Sergeant.  He is a good rider & we made good Time.  At the Top of the Amesbury Hill we had Tea & Sandwiches at the Y.M.C.A. at 12 p.m. & had a nice spin Home after that.  I received a nice letter, & 2 Khaki & a Khaki Silk Hand-kerchief to-day from Marie as a little Token of Remembrance & a Birthday Gift.  It was very nice & preferable to any expensive Gift.  Times are so hard now.  I do not know How the deuce People live over here.  Food & all things have increased in Price as much as 200 % on some articles.  Yet, Tommy only gets 1/- per day.  I think it is a curse that Tommy gets so little money & He
