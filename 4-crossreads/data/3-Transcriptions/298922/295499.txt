<p>Monday 2 July 1917</p>
<p>MAZAAR</p>
<p>I noticed GUNNEDAH was on the case of Rabbits anyway they were very good. Just seen a photo of myself in Sydney Mail when I had a septic neck dated May 16 1917 entitled enjoying a Shave rather sarcastic.</p>
<p>I note mice are eating Motor Cars etc. <strike>I suppose if the war keeps up they will be frozen &amp; sent to feed Tommy.</strike></p>
<p>Our men &amp; Horses are often hungry &ndash; Commissariate is wonderfully good &ndash; far better than Africa &amp; all delivered by a single line of rails across 200 mile desert. All units get Cigarettes or Tobacco sufficient for the week plus 2 boxes of matches every Saturday free.</p>
