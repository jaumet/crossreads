<p>11-6-1916<br/>Wet again last night. Just heard of another big success by the Russians. Our Battery to be relieved on the 15th inst by the 9th Bty. 286 rounds fired by the Bty yesterday. A new Vet Officer on the job Capt Hindmarsh, from Vet College Sydney. Capt McNield, and English Vet, has gone away, not wanted. He was always drunk, and neglected his work. A large number of infantry went to trenches last night<br/>12-6-1916<br/>Again wet, cold, and miserable, mud all over the place. Nothing doing, too rough for aeroplanes. The airman I mentioned some time back, using his machine gun on trenches, has been captured. He was a Major in our air force. He used to do all kinds of peculiar stunts; Loop the loop, dive in spiral formation, and fly very low. The leave to England is cut down from 8 days to 7. A new class of rocket, as used by the Germans, are so good, that the authorities are offering a reward of  &amp; pound ;50 and one month</p>
