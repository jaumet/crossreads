 July 1917 Friday 27th Got the mud hook up at 1 PM &amp; made a stack 5 troopers &amp; escort HMS Afric. Made quite an imposeing line steaming out of the Bay No excitement this time a few Helieas flashing from the town. Formed into two lines in the afternoon. We are in the centre of the left hand line. 
 Saturday 28th Beautiful day uneventfull. Ship Orderly Corpl to day 
 Sunday 29th The usual programme. We do not appear to move at all now. The 6 big boats seem to all be at anchor except for a small ripple of foam at the bow. The lines are about 700 yds appart, and about 500 yds from Stern to Bow
