  
 Bus to Trafalgar Square, after going to Peel House, &  a walk around the Strand & accompany Cunn. to his hotel, have a long chat & a smoke &  leave them to keep my appointment with Legge at 2 pm. Luckily meet him coming in a taxi with kits etc & we all set off to Grosvenor gardens. He is staying here. Close by is Victoria Rly Stn. After a good lunch (rather late) take a bust past St Pauls to the Exchange corner. From here to Shepherd's Bush by Underground Railway & here we have afternoon tea. There is no doubt of the popularity of Australians in London    & my short experience shows me that opportunities to no extent are given us. After another ride past Piccadilly, St James Park, & eventually we arrive back at the Strand, have dinner & Legge leaves me. Meet another pal, one of the boys, with two girl friends & together we take a walk round Hyde Park. I arrive at my diggings at 11 pm & enjoy a good    & well earned sleep.
