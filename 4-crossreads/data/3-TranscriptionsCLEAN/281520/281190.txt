  
 Mametz 10/4/17 was there with the D.A.D.O.S. and some of their figures regarding stores & were particularly illuminating.  After they had done the General came in and we had a discussion on our attack of a few days since over some afternoon tea.  Our argument lasted until 6 so I phoned to Spiller to carry on with the mess.  Pedler walked back with us & we found that Major Parkes & Dr Campbell Smith had already dined and all hands were on the way to the concert which had been well organised by Capt Alderson.  Every item was excellent - the voices were good and there were no duds.  A large audience - the men all fresh and smiling and looking fit.  Their minds well off the War.  Stewart returned from leave today and he brought me my new tunic.  Ella sent a splendid parcel of chocolate from Paris.  Fierce arguments re the War - all consider USA entrance must shake the Hun up
