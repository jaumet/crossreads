The pickets were asleep on the bags of chaff &ndash; the officers are not strict regarding the pickets being asleep as they seldom require calling &ndash; the horses standing quietly &amp; the old A13's engines going thump, thump, thump. Little did any of us know that two hours ago we passed an enemy cruiser only 15 miles away. The escort evidently knew that the enemy was close &amp; kept a strict watch steaming up &amp; down the lines of transports. At 6 am I laid the phones on the table &amp; had a shave &amp; a wash occasionally listening in the phones for a few seconds. At 6.20 am on picking up the phones I heard the NZ transport Arawa who also had a low powered wireless set, calling HMAS Sydney &amp; saying "Did you hear Cocos Island sending SOS?" I, naturally, waited for a reply but none came for a few minutes until the Orvieto called the transports to "stand-bi" &amp; keep quiet. I then woke Teddy &amp; he said to keep a strict watch &amp; if anything further came through, to call Captain Jackson. Some minutes later on looking through the port hole I saw the warships all together signalling by flag to each</p>
