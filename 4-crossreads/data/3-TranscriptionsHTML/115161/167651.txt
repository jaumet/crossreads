<p>goes on, we are still outside waiting for our turn to come.&nbsp; Eventually the time arrives, and we are conducted to some stables or sheds, where everything looks clean and comfortable, and we think we are lucky to get such a nice place.&nbsp; We quickly unroll our rug and &quot;get down to it&quot;, thankful that we are at last out for a rest and that we have such decent billets.&nbsp; No rum issues now, we are out of the line.</p>
<p>We have been here for an hour or so, some of us are asleep, when the billeting officer comes along and informs us that we are in the wrong billets, that these we are in were intended for such and such a company.&nbsp; There is nothing for it but to dress and turn out, while other billets are looked for.</p>
<p>We are eventually located in some old broken down stable or sheds which are really useless for the shelter of the horses or cows of the owner.&nbsp; We settle down here pretty quickly, knowing that we shall not cause envy to any other company by our occupation of same.&nbsp; Cold, muddy, and decidedly &quot;chatty&quot; we fall asleep.</p>
<p>No shell-fire disturbs us now, the only inconvenience we suffer is caused by the &quot;chats&quot; which were already on us trying to drive off those which occupied the buildings and thought they were fully justified in enjoying themselves at the expense of us new arrivals.</p>
<p>This is practically what happened to us on our arrival at Buire.&nbsp; This was the third time I had been billetted in this town, and the billets we are now in are the worst I&#39;ve been in here.&nbsp; However there is a canteen and there are civilians here, so we don&#39;t mind, as where the latter are, some sort of amusement is bound to exist.</p>
<p>&quot;Out for a rest&quot;.&nbsp; Rest! why do they insist on referring to it as a &quot;rest&quot;.&nbsp; Why don&#39;t they call it&quot;a change&quot;.&nbsp; Rest is most misleading.&nbsp; One who is not acquainted with the life generally of soldiers on active service, is liable to misconstrue the military meaning of the word, which like most other things in military, are directly the reverse of Civil.</p>
