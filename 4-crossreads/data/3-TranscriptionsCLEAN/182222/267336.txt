  His Bo ne              Polygon Wood.                                      I saw a man  go  walk out into the night                            From a ruin heap in Flanders.                                           And I heard                                                                        The snarling   breath  rush of a big shell's downward flight  Blend with his laughter and his parting word:                     "So long, you bastards! Keep a drop of rum                  for me in case my issue doen't come!"                           He stumbled  out in the dark to mist to the battle field                      on thro the hell of Polygon wood                 And died a thousand deaths as he walked along          And dawn was high ere again he came and stood          By the dug out door to  wake  rouse them with a song.
