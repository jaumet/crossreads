<p>The same six destroyers also taken in oil &amp; coal &amp; will escort us to Egypt.</p>
<p>23rd  [Apr]<br/>9 am Destroyers proceeded out of harbor. 3 trawlers &amp; 1 hydroplane. Orders for transports to follow. All steamed out one after the other in line like a line of battleships. Hydroplane flying around &amp; escorted same 50 miles off the coast. The trawlers returned after steaming out 10 miles through the swept channel. These trawlers sweep the channel in front of the transports.<br/>11 am Transport column formed five in front row &amp; two behind each. 400 yards apart speed as per Admiralty orders 15 knots 16 mls. per hour to Alexandria. Course set zig zag all the way. Each ship altering courses per zig zag together the line kept perfect speed distance apart etc.<br/>A splendid sight surrounded by destroyers. Probably the largest convoy &amp; the fastest line of transports that has sailed across the Mediterean &amp; may be the last after this great war. A sight that may not be seen again during the present century. The Kaisar I Hind being the leading convoy transport this trip (the Guide) she having a Naval Captain aboard in charge</p>
