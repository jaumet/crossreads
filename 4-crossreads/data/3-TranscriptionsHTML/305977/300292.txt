<p>December 1915<br/>Aeroplanes were up every day continually so as to keep any Taube away.  The place looked very deserted by Sunday &amp; in the morning the Turks shelled us with a big gun they must just have put in.  They fired about 30 rounds 8.20 I think they were.  Very little damage was done &amp; very few casualties as there were so few men left  1 man to each 10 yds of trench the last day.  The last party that left consisted of about 35 picked men to form a covering party.  It will be on them to cover the evacuation of the others &amp; then get away themselves  On the last night, <u>Sunday</u> [19th] the men were divided in 3 parties  A party left at from 5 to 6 pm B party 9 to 10 pm &amp; C party (covering party 2 to 3 am) &amp; each party again was divide into 3 each</p>
