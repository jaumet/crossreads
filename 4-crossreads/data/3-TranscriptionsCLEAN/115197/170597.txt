Return to the car and commence the return journey.  After a run of a mile we stop at Minstead and enter the most quaint little church I have yet seen.  The structure is of the 13th century, being restored 100 years ago.  Private family pews - A double gallery - and the "old three part pulpit" provide an interesting inspection.  The run back to Milford-on-Sea
