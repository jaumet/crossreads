30/10/17 RomeSabine and the Appenines and we were on the wonderful Appian Way. Drove back to town and then went afoot. Round the Cross the people were taking a great interest in new proclamations just posted up and evidently something to do with the War. The 4.30 Communique was feverishly awaited and heads could be seen bent over the papers in the cafes. The many fountains here diversify the streets. The trams seem good and generally round the quarter here it may be said to be a fine and beautiful city. The scaffolding is still up in places round the statue of Victor Emmanuel. They speak well of their King here. Bank of Italy has gardens in front. Waiters bow low. Went to Carmen at Teatro Cotanza 9-12.30. A fair performance. Unshaven actors but fine music.
