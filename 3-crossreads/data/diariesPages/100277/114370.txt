like blazes they have hit a few I know.
1st November. Wet again today Im hanged if we can get 2 fine days in succession. Had a big party out last night in "Nomans Land" digging trenches out towards the Germans, my wasn't it cold just freezing we had no casualties but a lot of narrow escapes from the German shell fire.
I brought the party in at 5 went down drew our rations which now includes daily a fair tot of rum per man, the men seem to think they are better for it but I don't think they are any warmer than I am I never touch the stuff.
Had an unexpected visit from G. Vaughan this morning he has got a commission has had it nearly 3 months, I'm glad to see him with a star" for he is quite a good sort is George.
A German plane brought one of ours down
