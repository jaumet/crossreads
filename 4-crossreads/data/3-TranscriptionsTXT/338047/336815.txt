The town was very battered, and looked weird at night with the little moon there was. I remember singing to myself. "T'was deepest night in the city square; hushed were the drums and the trumpet's blare". it seemed appropriate - "Solemnly, silently, through the night - grim set faces and eyes so bright" -although we were not spectres, but very much flesh and blood. We went along a causeway by the side of the canal for a while, and then took the road through Le Mesnil. I found this out afterwards because at the time it was difficult to see where we were going.Sept 6We stopped at a trench about two kilos further on till about 7am on 6 Sept when we advanced supporting the 31st Battn, about a kilo to the North of the East West Road. We crossed over the main road leading to Peronne about 9 am
