<p>Thurs. 4 July<br/>To-day is American Independence Day and is being feted as such throughout both France and England.  The Americans are very much in the public eye now and probably will continue to be for more weary months yet.  As I am writing now there are several "Yanks" talking to some of our chaps close by.  We get on very well with the Americans.  They seem to be a mixture of nationalities.  A fritz prisoner was brought in a few minutes ago and turned out to be a Pole.  One of the Yanks was talking to him in German and another in Polish.  Two Poles &ndash; one on one side and one on the other.<br/>Our Division attacked this morning &amp; we advanced 500 yards on a front of 1200 yards.  Our casualties were fairly light &ndash; less than 200 wounded going through our Dressing Station</p>
