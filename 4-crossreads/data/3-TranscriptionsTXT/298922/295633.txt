Friday 30 November 1917
Word has been passed back from our escort that a sunken wreck is not far off & nine submarines!!!  I dreamt last night I heard the crash of a Torpedo & ran out into the passage but as all was quiet I went back to bed not before I had the disturbed the wife. She does not know anything about our daily fears & worries & I take good care goings does not reach her.
Carters little Liver Pills may stop the dreams.
