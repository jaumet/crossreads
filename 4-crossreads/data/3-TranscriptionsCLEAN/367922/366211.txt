 My dear Arthur, I has just learned of the loss of both your dear boys & am grieved for you and your dear wife. Sympathy in such a loss is at best very barren but I would like to be permitted to say that the cause in which their lives were sacrificed was a noble & worthy one - In youth you were  never  daunted & opposition or apparent failure only spurred you on - May the old determination still remain with you and enable you to bear with fortitude your dreadful loss and comfort & cheer your wife whose excellent brother also paid the penalty. 
 Yours sincerely [indecipherable] Edward
