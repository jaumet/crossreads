The salut farc is play to the bitter end and poor crippl tri to salut too . There seem to be a great mani histor hous here . Overlook the town is a rang of cliff and the town is compact in a valley . In springtim I should say that this is a veri love place ? even in winter 's grip there is a charm about it . Dine at the hotel .
