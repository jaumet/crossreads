<p>1917 JANUARY</p>
<p>16 TUESDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; frosty all day. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all day. Got word</p>
<p>that I was to go up to the</p>
<p>firing line with a G.S. waggon</p>
<p>tomorrow, but it was cancelled</p>
<p>later. I wish I could have gone</p>
<p>as this place is getting very</p>
<p>monotonous. I have come to</p>
<p>the conclusion I was not</p>
<p>meant to to travel, but to stop</p>
<p>at home all my life. I would</p>
<p>give anything to get back</p>
<p>home again &amp; get a start</p>
<p>on my own home; &amp; yet if I got</p>
<p>the chance I could not go, till</p>
<p>I had seen this business through.</p>
<p>Got a parcel of tobacco today</p>
<p>but dont know who its from, unless</p>
<p>its from Maimie Hill.</p>
