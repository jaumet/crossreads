  
   on high ground, you can see villages nestling amongst the trees & in nearly all cases, they have a Church with a similar spire, there are Crucific's all over the place. The houses are very poorly built, a kind of mud bound with straw on brick foundations. The stables are in front, house in the rear, with a farm yard in between, some have the surplous rain water in a hollow of the yard & all have a manure & rubbish heap in the Centre, for the fowls to scratch in, though the houses appear to be clean, the surroundings don't seem to count. Every village has its water hole in the centre. Tuesday 5th September a cold, rain looking miserable day. We are under orders to leave for Doullens, some time tonight.
