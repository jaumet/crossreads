<p>To right of BN. In front of the Windmill outside Strazeele. Taking over from B Coy tonight. During the day "Fritz" put up an intense bombardment &amp; attacked towards C coy's position. He came a thud though he must have brought up a lot of artillery.</p>
<p>Thurs Apr 18th :-<br/>Although we have had a lot of casualties here we have also had good living on the poultry &amp; sucking pigs. The inhabitants must have had to get out suddenly.</p>
<p>Fri Ap 19th :-<br/>Cold weather is in the<br/>Fashion again &amp; it has started snowing. Bitterly cold in the trenches.<br/>The cows, pigs, &amp; horses around here have been having a lot of casualties from shells &amp; have to be put out of misery.</p>
