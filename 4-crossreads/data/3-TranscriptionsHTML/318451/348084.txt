<p>have appointed their man to this Bde., that means that either McCook or myself will have to go &amp; we are wondering who it will be.<br/>The Turks have been driven back to within 14 miles from Bagdad &amp; our Cavalry are in hot pursuit &amp; the Russians are driving them back also.  I hope they can keep the pressure up till they capture the city.</p>
<p>Sunday Mch. 11th<br/>Today has been a strange day.  I have had no services.  The Anglicans have appointed their man to our Brigade so it is a certainty that either McCook or I will be transferred somewhere else.  I feel very sore about it &amp; very annoyed with the Anglicans, they will now have 7 C of E Chaplains with the Division &amp; Methodists will only have one (if I go) &amp; Pres. two.  I went to the Brigadier but the Military authorities have no power in the matter at least not in the Division.</p>
