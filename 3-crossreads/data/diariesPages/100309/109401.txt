13/6/17 Paris
Had usual petit dejeuner of coffee and rolls and a pleasant bath. M'selle the femme de chambre on the strength of last night's freedom drops in for a talk about things in general. By 9 a.m. was well abroad per tube and up to L?Opera from there to try and get some bon-bons but all the confiseries were closed on account of it being ?a day without confiserie?. Bought some postcards and a few other things and once again had the wretched experience of floundering along in bad French when the person addressed could speak good English. Returned to hotel with the intention of ?making the Bois? but Mdme. could not come so we went up the Rue de Rivoli and then through the Jardin des Tuilleries and sat down in the pleasant shade before walking home in pleasant shade across the busy Place de la Concorde and the delightful Champs Elysees. Had there (at hotel) a cup of coffee and a roll and then took a cup taxi post haste to the Box office near Opera and collected my ticket. Went into Opera noticing the splendid foyer and arrived just before the overture of Verdi's "Ada" commenced. A fair house at
