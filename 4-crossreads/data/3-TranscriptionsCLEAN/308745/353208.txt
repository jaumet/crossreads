[Letter on Bellevue Hotel, San Francisco notepaper, possibly from Brian Pockley's younger sister Helen, to him from a ship on west coast of USA]My dear BrianMy pretty little brotherYou see you have anotherLovely letter misterFrom your sweet young sister
I hope that you're all thrivingAnd that you're not driving Your poor old self too hard(I was born a bard)
We are all well now, thoughKindly don't ask how soMatters with poor HelenWhen the ship is sailin'.
We can't reach VancouverThough she's a quick moverUntil early on the 4thMuch to poor Pockley's wrath.
She was a day late leavingBecause these cracked coal-heaver [?]Rascals in AustraliaMade her plans a failure.
