Oct 28 [indecipherable] On the SommeStill here in reserve owing to bad weather.Nothing but wind & slush, with a shower of rain occasionally to make it worse. This is a very barren place, a few weeks ago the scene of heavy fighting, the ground is covered with shell holes large & small. Almost without cease there is a heavy bombardment going on it is like as if there were huge iron works on the other side of hill a few miles away. At night there are hundreds of camp fires on the side of this hill, it looks well.It is surprising the number of observation baloons here. I counted 23 the other day all our own, never see any of Fritz's.It is very cold just now I have on two pairs socks, flannel shirt, wool khaki shirt, cardigan jacket beside uniform & yet it is cold.Yesterday I got a letter from Lou, Mother Wilfred & Ethel.Oct 29th  16 On the SommeMore rain wind & slush & colder than ever to day. Yesterday I received two parcels, one was cigarettes the other was lollies, cigarettes more a lovely pair socks.
