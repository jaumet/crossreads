man - very sensitive - and his eyes were full of tears many times. I believe it was for him to recommend J. for return to Australia. The General put the responsible discussion on him and he felt it very much. He told me he had a long talk with J. before he left and that J was very submissive & childlike and friendly. He was very touched - and would like to write to Roslyn, but finds it such a difficult subject. So asked me to write, about J needing a prolonged rest and no anxiety. He made J promise him that he would not be hurt when he got home and resentful and confess to him that it was the only [indecipherable]. It was all very difficult and I am perfectly sure that J could not have stayed here. He would have been very miserable and unhappy - and he was not fit to cope with work. Poor dear he was very sad about it all. Brought me Roslyn's last letter and read it to me like a child. He cant understand why he cant work.
