 Since coming down for the rest cure, I have been unfortunate enough to lose 5 killed & 19 wounded. Many of these are because they will not take any care in walking about in this safe retreat, or too lazy to dig their dug outs deep enough or under cover from bullets. 
 The way the bullets come in is a very loud smack in the air as they pass above or near you - very startling & in the valley there are five distinct echoes to each bullet. Some only sing past & those are richochets or 'spents' & one has time to duck - The bullet that hits ones head one never hears - Then shells of different sorts & sources scream over head & only whirr with their expulsion sound & explosions - 
 Air howitzers are very loud & the nerves of those who are not good, make them bob when they are 1/2 a mile away. Luckily my nerves & general health are as good as they have ever been & am in tip top condition -
