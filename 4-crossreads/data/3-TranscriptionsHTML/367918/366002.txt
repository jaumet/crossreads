<p>My dear Judge<br/>I have reached the first stage on the way home. Am now at Le Havre. The camps are wonderfully well organised and I cannot find anything at all to do. All the cleaning, equipping, enrolling &amp; so on are taken over by the camp staff and the quota staff are not even asked to look on.</p>
<p>Arrived here two days ago and do not leave until 13th. The 12th, by the way, is the anniversary of my embarkation in Australia. There is a strong probability of our being held up for a long time in England but as the school is moving as a complet unit some arrangements may be possible over there.</p>
<p>I shall send you a cable as soon as word of our embarkation is received.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
