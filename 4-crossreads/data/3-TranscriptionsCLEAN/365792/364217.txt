  
 May 13 Raining the greater part of the night & still at it. Going before the Board this morning to take the verdict - Later - They'd give a fellow the pip these Doctors. Have got to wait now for a special report from the Doc at No 13 Hospital. Visited the Barbers & was shaved by a lady, not a bad shave either. 
 14  Parade as usual, but no Church as far as I can make out. Fine & clear. The old S.M. went crook & told me off to fasten up the flaps of the Guard tent. These Tommy N.C.Os are a lot of damned rotters. The grub is improving some; yesterdays dinner was OK & there was rice pudding to finish up on - Mistake re Church. A Y.M.C.A. chap chatted to us for half an hour or so & then I trekked for the Ref Canteen & demolished tea & sandwiches. The Parson spoke fairly well, but he's young - younger than yours truly - & that's saying a lot. Put up a score [in margin] Sunday
