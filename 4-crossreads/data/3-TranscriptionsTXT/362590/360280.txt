 4. Blighty. Haven't heard anything more of Brissenden since he told me he was a sergt in 3rd Div H.Q. Flannery is with the 1st &amp; is very fit. The men like him immensely. 
 There are a lot of the old 3rd D.C.C.[Division Cyclist Corp]  knocking round &amp; they are all doing well. 
 Well goodbye for the present, Judge. 
 Remember me to Mrs Ferguson &amp; Dorothy 
 Yours very sincerely
