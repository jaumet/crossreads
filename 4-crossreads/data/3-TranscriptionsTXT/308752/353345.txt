 Sunday 25th June. Arrive at Juvisy at 6 a.m. biscuits &amp; bully beef served out for breakfast (How I enjoy this meal)   All looking forward for the arrival at Paris but unfortunately we proceeded along a branch line. At Fourveaux the Eiffel Tower of Paris could be seen in the distance. The country we are passing through is indeed very beautiful. Amiens at 5 p.m. have now been 47 hours in train. 7 p.m. Abbevielle stopped here 15 minutes for tea. Forgot to mention about the twilight it is indeed very pleasant. It is day light right up till 10 p.m. Shortly after leaving Abbevielle we sighted a big Australian Camp, we all got very downhearted here, as we though this may be our destination, the country was very  sandy  but we still travelled on. At 4 a.m. on the 26th inst. We were rudely awakened from our slumbers, &amp; left the train &amp; marched to our billet, which was situated in a pretty little French village, about 1 &frac12; miles from the station. The train tip was wonderful &amp; a great experience  56 hours in the train . Bob &amp; I enjoyed a good breakfast at a farm house, eggs, toast &amp; plenty of milk. Bob shouted me this luxury as I arrived in France with only a penny.   (So I was not absolutely penniless).
