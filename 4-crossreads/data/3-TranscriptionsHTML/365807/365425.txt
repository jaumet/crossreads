<p>25.5.17<br/>Mr Justice Ferguson</p>
<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>Would you send over the  <u>full</u>  address of your dear wounded Lad &ndash; my better half will send it on to her sister Mrs I.F. Payne now living in London &amp; who no doubt will do whatever she can.  As parcels are being received today for troops abroad there is sure to be a mail early next week &ndash; I shall not be in town tomorrow but if you send the address to my chambers I'll get it in time &ndash;</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>A.S.Dawson</p>
<p>I recd the photos etc &ndash; very good werent they?</p>
<p>I had a note from my boy yesterday date 16th Ap &ndash; he was to go out that night with a flying column &amp; expected things would be "pretty thick" &ndash; His first independent command &ndash; in   [indecipherable] F. Am:  with 1st Light Horse Brigade &ndash; He was to cable if he got this all right &ndash; but none has arrived  yet. I fancy things   <u>were</u>  very thick &amp; he has had his hands full &amp; not been back to Cairo as evidently there was a set back at Gaza.<br/>He was camped in an orchard (fig trees &amp; nectarines) but no ripe fruit yet &ndash; lovely after the sandy desert -</p>
