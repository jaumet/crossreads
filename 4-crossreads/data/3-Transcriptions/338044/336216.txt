<p>small station, Muskerry, &amp; here by small train we arrange to visit Blarney. The train leaves at 12.10 pm &amp; meanwhile we take a walk around the main streets, purchase some Post Cards in Patrick St., make arrangements to lunch at Hotel Metropole &amp; take the small quaint train, where many old ladies are returning from market  After 20 minutes reach the Castle &amp; have but 15 minutes to view the famous old place. After walking round it    &amp; entering a few places, take some photos &amp; catch the 1.15 pm train back to Cork. Another walk around &amp; meet one solitary Australian  Coo-ee him. A good lunch at Metropole &amp; we take 3 pm train to Queenstown. A lovely little ride. Queenstown a great naval base. The Cathedral on the hill is a beautiful building. The curiosity with which we are regarded is astounding  Absolutely alone. The Harbour is rather good but far behind Sydney's. A few boats of "Wallflower" type at anchor. One of "Sydney" type. Walk all around the hill &amp; see many fine residences</p>
