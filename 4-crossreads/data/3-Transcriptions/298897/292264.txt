<p>Altogether Ferry post is a wonderfully busy spot a perfect hive of industry.</p>
<p>Sunday 9th April.<br/>More pit digging before breakfast.   Attended church parade during the morning.  In the afternoon we had a game of cricket but the sun is too hot for play so strenuous.</p>
<p>Monday10th<br/>Spent the day assisting dentist as he was short handed.  Only made a few fillings and did some clerical work.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11th<br/>More pit digging in morning &amp; swim in afternoon.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12th<br/>On guard for the day.  At night a strong wind storm blew up with a little rain &amp; all hands were into securing the tents several of which collapsed.</p>
<p>Thursday 13th<br/>A lull in the morning during which time I took on bricklaying &amp; built a range &amp; chimney for the cooks.  The wind blew up again about 10 A.M. &amp; continued all day.  It was a perfect sirocco &amp; one of the most severe I have experienced, quite equally anything we had met the year before.  Some of the gusts are extremely strong &amp; sand is blown</p>
