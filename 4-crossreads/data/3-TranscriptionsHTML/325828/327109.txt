<p>however, I have to get my "Wings" before I get my commission, or rather at the same time.  The difference between A &amp; B categories is a whole host of aerial tests such as X-country flights, forced landings, etc. but with anything like decent weather, I hope to get through in about 6 weeks from now.<br/>The last week has been awful weather here as far as flying goes.  Rain, wind, &amp; storms every day.  Meals are fine here, &amp; I am putting on weight; turn the scales at 12 st. 2 now; I was just under 11 st.  when I left Australia.<br/>Hope to send some more snaps next time if I can get some negatives I am after.<br/>Must close now, with love to you all at home,<br/>Ever your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
