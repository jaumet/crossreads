 none of us strip in the 1st Div. we all took it as a great joke , everyon offic includ had to take their hat off some of them did not like this for they knew without their hat they could not fall out and go away to some littl estaminet or villag , the whole crowd start off togeth soon they were strung out for mile , I had no idea that I would run ani where near so I did not even take the troubl to take my coat nor putti off either , but at the end of 2 mile I found myself in the first dozen go well , but my putti were give me fit so I was forc to pull up take them off I lost a good 300 yard by this but I set off caught some of them by degre it was a great race home I finish up by run in 6th first home for the 1st Div. there were over 120 starter all told
