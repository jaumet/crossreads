<p>No news of interest, just the same old training principles which have found to be absolutely up to shit in a war like this.  Brigade &amp; Divisional manoeuvres, a little Musketry, and a little night work.  It is all for the benefit of our reinforcements &ndash; the dinkums or the "comforts fund soldiers" as we call them.</p>
<p>Am writing to Mum &amp; to H.T. this week.  Have received my Sheepskin, also another bonza parcel from the Stores.  So long for the present.</p>
<p>Ever your affectionate<br/>Eric.</p>
