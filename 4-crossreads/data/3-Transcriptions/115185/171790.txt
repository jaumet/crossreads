<p>3 - Munro and Aunt Rosamond so she is getting plenty of advice. Poor child, she seems very uncertain and has not any definite wish to do any special thing. I thought the 3 months regular hours &amp; work at Bart's might be useful to her to start her off on daily dull routine which she finds so disagreeable. I think physically and morally it would help her and it wouldn't be wasted time. I will still try and persuade her. I have not the least idea what they are doing today. I have rung up twice but cant get them. They go out a lot with the girls at the house</p>
