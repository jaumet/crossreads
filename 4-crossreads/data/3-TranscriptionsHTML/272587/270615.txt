<p>Oct 22nd.  Still at Bouchon.  Visit L'Etoile again.  This morning our transport left it is rumoured that we go on to-morrow per motor wagons<br/>Oct 23rd.  Vauchelle  March about five miles where hundreds (5) of French motor wagons were waiting to transport our division to the front.  We travelled through Flexicourt &amp; Amiens &amp; left the wagons at Ribemont 9 kilos from Albert.  From these we had another night mare march to Fricourt where we camp for the night<br/>Oct 24th  This morning we continued our march through mud slush &amp; rain &amp; took about four hours to make  three miles so congested was the traffic  Our route lay on Fricourt-Bazentin Road, past Mametz &amp; Montaubon &amp; finally we were landed in Mametz wood at almost dark to look for dugouts for ourselves.  Luckily we found a decent one, only a few drops. <br/>Oct 25th.  Bivouaced in Mametz wood.  Today has been a repetition of yesterday in as much as it has drizzled all day &amp; made the ground more muddy than previously.  I hear that things are awful up in the line &amp; it is impossible to get wounded through &amp; I can easily credit it.<br/>Oct 26th.  Still in Mametz Wood.  Early this morning a violent bombardment commenced and has been going on all day.  Eric Hurt tells me that the Australians have to take a hill overlooking Baupaume &amp; failing that we will have to return to a more advantageous position   He says that it is impossible to get wounded through.  Observation is impossible as the clouds are so low.  This is the first bit of real rough living we have experienced in France and we are living in dugouts which are of a doubtful dryness.  I have had wet feet now for about four days but manage to dry clothes at night by a fire</p>
