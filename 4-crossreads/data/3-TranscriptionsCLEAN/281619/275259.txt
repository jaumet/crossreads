From one of the towers you command a fine panoramic view of Cairo.  The place is right on the outskirts of the town & the whole city lies before you.  The river runs through like a silver streak & away in the background are the Pyramids & Sphinx.  Napoleon occupied the Citadel in 1798 after defeating the mamalukes at the Battle of the Pyramids & while there he bombarded a mosque a few hundred yards away with 45 cannon shots one of which is in the walls to day.  Of the mosques there are two worth mentioning one a new one & one that of Sultan Hassan, 608 years old.  The latter is not now used but there is much fine work in its construction, gold & silver figuring prominently.  Dove tailing of marble is feature.  Circumcision bowl.
The new mosque, opposite to the old one is also a fine edifice.  The place is covered with fine carpet & lighted with hundreds of electric lights.  The work is in sandalwood, marble & alabaster inlaid with gold & silver.  The marble is representing all kinds of familiar scenes as a stormy sea, cloudy skies etc.  Women pray apart from men & have a part partitioned off for them.  There are no carpets.  It is now that I realize that Cairo is essentially a city of extremes.  Immaculate & filthy, rich & poor etc without any medium.  It is the place where East meets West, where Eastern peoples live in close contact with Western.  Port Said is only the place where East passes West on their respective journeys.
