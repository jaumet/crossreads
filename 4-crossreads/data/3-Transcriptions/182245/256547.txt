<p>1 THURSDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; Sunny. About stables all</p>
<p>morning &amp; went up to Armenti&egrave;res</p>
<p>with a G.S waggon in afternoon</p>
<p>Things were very quiet up there</p>
<p>though, hardly any shelling at</p>
<p>all. Got a letter from Mother.</p>
<hr />
<p>from PAGE 157&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.6.17</p>
<p>tonight God keep you sweetheart</p>
<p>&amp; remember I always loved</p>
<p>you &amp; that I tried to do</p>
<p>my bit for the good old</p>
<p>homeland &amp; you Linda dearest</p>
<p>Heard Alan was safe, but was</p>
<p>a prisoner in Germany &amp; had</p>
<p>lost his left arm. Poor Alan</p>
<p>but its great to know he is</p>
<p>safe.</p>
