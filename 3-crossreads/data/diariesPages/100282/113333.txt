strings of men coming from all directions of the compass, the most hopeless "box up" as ever I have seen, when our Coy were going out they come across a poor little Tommy who was stuck in the mud nearly up to his armpits, his mates were standing open mouthed gaping at him didn't know what to do. Lew a few more dug him nearly out with their hands they had to stand up to their knees in mud water to do it even then they had to take their equipment to pieces pass the straps round his body pull him out by sheer force when they hauled him out he was a sorry looking object covered with mud from head to foot nearly dead with fright cold, he lost his respirator when he saw it was gone he burst into tears said that he would be crimed punished if he went back to his Battn without his respirator so Lew took pity on him gave him his own, that's how the Imperial Army treat their men.
