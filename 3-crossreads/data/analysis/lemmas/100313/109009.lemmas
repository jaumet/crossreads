 24/12/17 Kortepyp cake of soap for a Xmas present ! The cobbl pave road was busi with motor lorri and caterpillar haul big gun . Return to camp and after dinner tri some order room case . Left at 3.15 p.m. to inspect Swanton 's parti at the 6th Engineer . Found them clean and veri well . A thick fog came down over the countri and the remain of white frozen snow and thick frost still lie on the ground . All pool are ice cover to a depth of inch . Such is our Xmas Eve 1917 and it might be much wors . Neuv Eglise has been well strafe . Its larg church is roofless and ruin . A few direlict inhabit wander round it littl street now full of soldier . A. Smith return from the Anzac Corp School and say it has gone off . Heavi snow has stop train traffic round Amien .
