 Tel-el-Kebir Egypt 25/1/16 
 Dearest Mother Father &amp; Dolly, Recieved your letters, also sent you a cable addressed to Ross Smith. Everything is going on well &amp; I am feeling better than I have for years. Am as fresh &amp; strong as a lion. We are likely to move off any day but have no idea where to. Get plenty of letters from Aunt Florrie &amp; parcels occasionally. I write to her very often too. Give my kind regards to all friends &amp; tell them I am tip top. Have not seen anything of Normy yet. Have seen Oscar w Walford &amp; Young McCauley. They are all well. There is not any news. Hoping you are all well With all my love &amp; kisses Your loving Son
