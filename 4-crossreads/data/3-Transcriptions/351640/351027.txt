<p>S.S. Ismailia<br/>Mediterranean Sea<br/>10 October 1915<br/>8.45 p.m.</p>
<p>My Mollie dear:/</p>
<p>Look at the heading to this letter and think of your map. Jerrom and I joined the Ismailia at No. 45 wharf at Alexandria Harbour at 10 oclock this morning, or rather that was the hour at which we were ordered to be at the embarking place, we got on board <strike>in</strike> at <strike>fact</strike> 1-30 p.m. Large numbers of bags of mails for the various units on and near Galipoli were being taken on board, and about 4 p.m., when they had been safely stowed away the ship was pulled out from her mooring place, &amp; sought the road to the door out to the Sea. Truly it is now a door because but a narrow passage is left between the Net which extends Westeward from the Eastern breakwater, &amp; the end of the Western breakwater, at night the gap is closed by the net, a huge metal one being placed to fill up the gap. The object to be attained is to keep out all enemy raiders or attacking craft of every kind.</p>
<p>When I walked on the deck just now there was some difficulty in moving about because all the lights are turned off. Why because in these times ships must not be brilliantly illuminated lest they attract the attention of those terrors of the ocean, the submarines. It is said that there are some enemy vessels of this class somewhere in the Mediterranean, <strike>weighting</strike> waiting to <strike>pay</strike> prey upon any</p>
