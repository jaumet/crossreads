<p>on Monday, but whether local or general I don't know.<br/>I could do with this job until the end of the war, but I expect it will end only too soon.</p>
<p>2nd May<br/>Yesterday we heard that the Turks were expected to attack at 8 a.m. in the neighbourhood of Shellal but I don't think anything came of it.<br/>Our quarters here continue to be improved.  Yesterday I put in a kitchen range with oven etc. complete, which works very well.<br/>This morning I banked up the edge of my bed with sand bags, a great improvement.<br/>Have not caught any more lice on me yet, so I hope that one was a mere stray.</p>
<p>10 p.m., 4th May<br/>Just had another 'mauvais quart d'heure'.  Those damned 'planes have been over again &ndash; it is almost full moon &amp; have dropped about 20-30 bombs.  Thank goodness that</p>
