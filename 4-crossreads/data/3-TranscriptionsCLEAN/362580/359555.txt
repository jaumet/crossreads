  
 dirty conditions under which the low class of native exists are most disgusting.  However as Britain is about to completely take over this country no doubt they will be improved.  Cairo, also, is most interesting, especially the Mosques.  I was shown over the Mosque of Sultan Hassan the oldest, about 600 yrs, the stonework is entirely of blocks which were removed from the outside coating of Cheops Pyramid, & are marvellously carved with beautiful designs & also inscriptions from the Coran.  The floors were all tessilated & some of the heavy bonze doors are inlaid with gold & silver, really a most gorgeous & interesting building.  Well, Bella, our trip across was delightful too, the weather was splendid, we were treated jolly well, & it's great being with all the chaps I went to School with.  We did not know until half-way up the Red Sea that our orders had been altered & we were to spend the Winter in Egypt instead of England.  The Canal was patrolled by Indian Troops who gave us a most enthusiastic reception.  We landed at the historic town of Alexandria & proceeded to Cairo by rail & I've enjoyed tip-top health all the time & am feeling jolly fit. 
 Hope Eddie is getting on alright, also Auntie Bella.  With love to you all 
 Yours affectionately Chas H. Copp.
