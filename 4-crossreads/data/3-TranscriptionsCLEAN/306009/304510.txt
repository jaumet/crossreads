1915Nov. 24 Wed.Went for a walk before breakfast this morning for a bit of exercise. Pretty chilly & foggy at this time of the day.I get out very little now - am so much tied down on this new job. Usually sneak out for half an hour's stroll through Gezira Gardens about 4.30 p.m. when the "Old Man" is out.Mail from Aust. to-day. Received 4 letters. Thankful for small mercies - but where in the dickens are all the letters going to.
