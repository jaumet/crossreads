<p>was sent to the A13 to proceed to the inner harbour for water. The captain &amp; second officer were ashore so the Chief officer &amp; the pilot navigated the A13 through the narrow gates in the breakwater. These pilots are British &amp; live in luxury. They have a native to carry their small hand bag &amp; they themselves are dressed in spotless uniforms of white &amp; polished buttons. In the harbour (inner) which is simply a portion protected by three breakwaters, were the Japanese cruiser Ibuki, &amp; the British cruiser Yarmouth. Outside, was the quaint old Russian cruiser Askold with her five tall thin funnels. The inner harbour was packed with transports &amp; not very far away was the Anglo Egyptian who was just moving out towards the outside transports. Suddenly she dropped both anchors &amp; went "full astern" but too late. With a crash she struck the breakwater near the gates, sending up a shower of spray. The tugboat Goliath immediately went to her assistance &amp; towed her near the shore for fear she would settle down. The damage was practically speaking slight &amp; she afterwards took up her position outside. In absolute silence H.M.A.S. Sydney steamed down the lines of transports &amp; took up her berth.
