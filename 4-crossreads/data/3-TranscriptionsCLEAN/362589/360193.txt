I am however deeply grateful for influence and kindness used in getting her the refusal of the position - Everybody about Harlow vies in Kindness and Hospitality to me - I fear Sir F Frenes has not  told  the simple truth about me for I am treated by all in a way that my knowledge of myself  does  tells me that I do not deserve. For the present you will see that in spite of the climate which gives me constant leg-pain I propose to stay on in England for the next 2 or 3 months till Roberts fate is settled as to his coming to England. If he too goes the same uncompanioned way as his brother I don't know what will become of us. I think a speedy end will be the best thing as long as it is decent and credible - The Zeppilins sailed over this puthe House two nights ago - on their way to town both coming and going - I missed seeing them - but they left their cards 2 miles away, in a farm yard where a few hens died quickly, and again 6 miles further on, where the slew a couple of people playing bridge:-.
