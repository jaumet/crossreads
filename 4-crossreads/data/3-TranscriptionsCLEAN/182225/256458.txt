 1916   TUESDAY 5   DEC. 
 Fine & very heavy frost, which lasted all day. We turned out at 4.30 AM & moved off at 7 AM to do our third shoot. We did very well & the drivers were very good & the best in the brigade. Cleaning harness ect in the afternoon. Bunny Bundock & Reg Watt & Frank Shepherd came up to see me. They had just come over from Parkhouse
