<p>This month passes with another anniversary of our wedding day dear Bee;</p>
<p>I hope to be home before the next.</p>
<p>All of you must have a merry xmas</p>
<p>I'll make mine as merry as I can for the childrens sake</p>
<p>Their photos are always in my pocket</p>
<p>I received those snap shots you sent dear mother</p>
<p>And by the way I had a fine letter from Bert enclosing several splendid photos, have not replied yet, but must.</p>
<p>Have no reply from Norman since I wrote from England</p>
<p>Would like to hear from him very much somehow</p>
<p>Hope Tom finds good job in Vic</p>
<p>Kind wishes for all</p>
<p>Geoff</p>
<p>Have a large number of post cards to send you when I can</p>
