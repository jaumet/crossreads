<p>16th June<br/>The bombardment &amp; general upheaval which I mentioned was the outward &amp; obvious noise of our infantry making a local attack.  Rumour has it that they gained their objective.<br/>Certainly they have advanced for, formerly even from here (Abasan el Kebir) we could hear the rifle fire at night but now we cannot, or at any rate I have not noticed it.<br/>Absolutely nothing has happened lately, one would think that being at war there would be always something happening which would be noteworthy but it is not so.<br/>I saw the doctor about my back a few days ago.  It has been troubling me for the last six weeks just like a hunting back but a little lower down.  He says it is lumbago and I have to get it rubbed every day but it doesn't seem to be improving at all.</p>
