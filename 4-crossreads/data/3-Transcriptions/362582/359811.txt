<p>My paper are arriving alright now.<br/>1st A.G.H. Egypt. June 11th 1916.<br/>My dear old Jane, Think it is your turn for a letter. I received a lovely Aust. mail yesterday. &ndash; One from Belle from Sassafras &ndash; One from you &amp; Alice. I'm quite happy to-day to know you are all well. Sorry you did not have such a good holiday as you expected. I think it is a mistake to go to the same place so often. Hope you will all be able to take a nice holiday somewhere else. Belle should go to different parts too. I prefer a change myself. Hope you are not <u>too</u> worried about money matters. Everything must be much more expensive now. Wish I could send you a couple of thousands. It is hard-luck being short. I'm very comfortable &amp; money matters don't worry me &ndash; thank goodness. I have plenty to go on with &ndash; of course I could spend &ndash; heaps &ndash; such temptation to buy pretty things, especially when I'm thinking</p>
