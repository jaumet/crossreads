  
 is rather a big place of, I should say 1200 inhabitants, 2 or 3 old fashioned inns, a church and a school. 
 We passed through a rather pastoral district, and the land that was not utilised for farming was, in places covered with heather in Bloom.  It is nice when you are in among it but from the distance it looks just like a brown smear on the plains. 
 After this the road was entirely covered over like a bower with big green trees.  Sometimes Chestnuts, sometimes stately elms, beeches Oak and now and then rows of poplars.  All along
