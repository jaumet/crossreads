  
 Beersheeba [Beersheba] work & the trek over from there to this side I think it must be a record cavalry advance. 
 I have had several trips around on different jobs for the D.D.M.S. [Deputy Director of Medical Services]. You see I am a sort of spare part here - to do sick parades & any old odd job that may crop up.  It is very nice - living in a house & so forth - an improvement on a bivouac tent.  Food we do well for also.  The people here have been practically cut off from supplies for 2 years - no sugar, tea, salt or other delicacies.  Meat, milk, eggs & grain they have of course though the raids of the Turks have reduced these a good deal.  Salt they get from condensed sea water.  Sweetening is supplied by grape jam.  Brown bread they make.  Clothing material & other things ordinarily imported have been almost unprocurable - but they're all covered & don't seem to have done so badly. 
 The Turks they say did not come here much - just paid a visit with a requisition
