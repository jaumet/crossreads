<p>Three more men were put in our tent yesterday. That brings the total up to ten - the number quartered in most of the others. They seem very decent chaps.<br/>The ten men in the camp next ours were sent into contact camp last week owing to one of their number developing measles. Immediately on the appearance of any such contagious disease the whole tent full in which it appears are isolated - sent into a special contact camp - and remain there until there is no possibility of the disease being spread by them.<br/>In the case of measles the tent mates of the person contracting them have to remain in contact Camp for 10 days. If none of them have <strike>contracted</strike> developed them in that</p>
