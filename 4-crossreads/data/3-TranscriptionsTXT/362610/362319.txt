 Thursday 13 April 1916 A beautifully fine day after all the rain, but cold in the easterly wind. In all directions could be seen great-coats, rain-coats, boots, &amp; clothing of all descriptions spread out to dry. Was very glad to get my saturated things dried. In the morning the 3rd Battn. moved into the tents erected on the ground I laid out yesterday, &amp; headquarters also came along. I had to get 4 marquees put up for them &amp; was all day at this &amp; similar work in the camp. Most of the men were on various fatigue duties, but a few companies had their men on parade during the afternoon.
