<p>5<br/>woollens to breed. But enough of these faithful friends.</p>
<p>I have had two feed of steak &pound; eggs! I went to a "Butcherie" (note French) &pound; asked for 'steak sil vous plait", &pound; the dame said "steak finish". I went to go, but a youth who was in the know asked for "fillet please", &pound; got a lovely junk. So I sent a good looking pal up &pound; he again asked for fillet <u>please</u>. And then we dined. Oh! It was simply, great. The prices tho' are awful. They have special prices for Australians.</p>
<p>I spent an evening with Les Wynne &pound; Bob Newton tother eve. Bob is about 7 feet high Les looked very well &pound; is a Sgt now. Pattern has left the Battalion. I also met LeO Howard, so, you see I've been raking up old pals. It's good I can tell you.</p>
