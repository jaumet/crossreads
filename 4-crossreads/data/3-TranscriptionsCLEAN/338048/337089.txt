  
 Saturday 17th Weather very boisterous & barometer lowest since we left. As very heavy weather expected there are no parades & all men have been ordered off the top decks to their troop decks. Further good war news announced. 
 Storm increased and a furious gale blowing from S.W. High seas broke over the bow after the ship had risen on a high wave & plunged down into the next.  The  We had a good time looking for the waves coming over the bow & at times the blue of the waves rising right over the bow could be seen. The weather did not moderate all day. Just on darkness we saw a cargo steamer hove to. We past this as we were going at a good pace. 
 Turned in as usual though weather boisterous. 
 Sunday 18th The lights looked very pretty as we entered into the Bay.  The  Woke at 4 a.m. owing to rain dripping on me & heard chaps calling us to get up & see Cape Town. Could see very high hills through mist & soon a searchlight was directed on us. We gradually moved in took on a pilot, turned about a good bit & anchored in the outer bay. Had breakfast and then with two tugs moved into berth. 
 The bay is like a semi circle with a breakwater poking out from one side. Behind this is a series of piers like sketch. The Table Mount rises up straight ahead of us, & with tracks showing on sides & with a cloud (the "cloth") over the top it presents a great picture. Two high hills on the right & one of the left of the table make a great background for the town which lies around the beach directly at the foot of the hills
