<p>Thursday 8 November 1917<br/>Seen by Capt. C. 10 a.m. &amp; finally handed over by him to home sister.<br/>May go for drive "after seeing only these 4 walls since arriving".<br/>4 p.m. Marge &amp; Mr. Humphreys came in a car &amp; a lovely evening followed, all through Cairo wich is varied &amp; (to me) marvellous population.  5 p.m. tea at Groppi's then out over the bridge and across the old Nile to the Pyramids standing so wonderful looking with the evening star shining down in the water (for the Nile is in flood).  Back through the soft evening air more shopping &amp; back by a different route to No. 27.</p>
