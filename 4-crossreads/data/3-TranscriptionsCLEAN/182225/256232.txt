 3 rd  June. 
  MARCH   FRIDAY 17    1916 
 We went then to Butterworths hotel for dinner and a hot bath. I never enjoyed a bath so much before. After dinner we went to the Criterion Theatre corresponding to the Sydney National Amph. The show was rotten. Got back to the boat about 10.30 pm after a most interesting day. 
 Durban is a great little place the cleanest  & prittiest place I have ever seen. The town itself is only small but there are some fine buildings in it & they are very well set off. The Berea [in?] residential quarter is on a ridge overlooking the town; and it is just like an English home only there is more luxurient growth. The homes and gardens are just perfect. No fences around them either. Just hedges of all descriptions
