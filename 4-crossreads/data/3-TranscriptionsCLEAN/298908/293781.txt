  
 only for Mother's sake that I saw her.  I'd like to break Lens head for it was through him in one way that I got in to hot water he kept on saying oh yes do go & see Mrs. Oliver so I fool like got into touch with her.  At any rate the shock of meeting over she came home to the Winters home & there we had tea & a girl or two dropping in we had a musical evening.  Theres no one knows only those who have had to spend years in Kahki what a pleasure it is to get in touch with people like this.  Why it is a little bit of heaven & it seems just like a dream needless to say I enjoyed myself & after it was all over we had supper & then Eva & I walked down to the train with Mrs. Oliver & saw her off, & on getting back found Vera waiting with the table set for more supper so we 3 set to work & made merry & then after a pleasant evening to bed.  I like these girls very much, they are real decent & a pleasure to mix with.
