<p>when we were in Albert, Fritz sent a couple of big ones over near us, we had a big battery there. Taubes come over occasionally &amp; our guns have a go at them, but so far they don't seem to do much good. Flies are as numerous as in Egypt but they don't annoy you so much. Claude came out of the trenches today. Wednesday 23rd there was a big bombardment last night. Rumours say that the 1st Div. was cut up by our own fire while they were leaving the trenches, they lost more last night, than they did for 7 days. We are busy filling up old trenches outside our billet. Taubes came over again, but got away. More heavy guns have arrived round our billet &amp; they were going strong this morning   they shake you up some, they kept us awake last night. They shut up while Taubes are about. The weather is cool &amp; dull. Thursday 24th weather cool, we receive pretty good food here. The Boys are always looking for lice, so far I haven't found any. Taube's came over our lines. Friday 25th still trench filling.  I left Becourt for La Boiselle about 9PM with about 30 of our chaps. We arrived there in about &frac34; of an hour &amp; fixed a dressing station up in a German dug out, it is about 25 feet or so deep. Last night previous to leaving Becourt several of us chaps visited the "Crater" made by a British &amp; a German mine, it must be 50 feet or so deep &amp; about a hundred y'ds across each way.  The dug out is very strong &amp; is divided into rooms, there are several stoves in it, it also has had telephone &amp; electric light fitted up. There are several dug outs within 30 yards of this one. Saturday I have been messing about all the morning, the others are in the trenches. Fritz heavily bombarded us this morning, shells falling about 50 yds away, we returned the fire &amp; have kept it up pretty hot ever since. I filled a lot of sandbags this afternoon, to make the dressing station</p>
