 Thursday Sept. 2nd Several shrapnel shells fired by the enemy burst about 25 yds. from us today.  They also fire shells from a 75 captured by them from the French.  It is the last gun they have.  Two others belonging to them we christened Screechy Liz, on account of its noise going through air and Beachy Bill.
