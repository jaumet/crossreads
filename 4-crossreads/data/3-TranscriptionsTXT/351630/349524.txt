Broadmeadows for three days while the Orsova takes a cargo of wheat & more soldiers on board. The Orsova is a beautiful ship & a speedy one too.  It is supposed to steam 18 knots & hour so I am going to back this ship against the submarine if we see one.  All the soldiers are in good knick & seem high spirited if they sight a school of porpoises or a ship they all rush to the sides & sing out & joke about them, in fact they did so when we were in the middle of Church parade this morning much to the disgust of officers & the Parson.  You see the boys are not very religious & most of them never saw a porpoise before.  Well Auntie I will close this now as the Bugle has sounded for tucker & that's a very important event on this ship.  Will write again from Fremantle. With love from your affect nephewWalter
