<p>first thing we all do on taking up a new position is to dig a burrow for ourselves to sleep in when the opportunity occurs.  Neither of us have had the luck to get a trip to England yet &amp; as there is no leave to be granted until this offensive ends that will not be before the winter sets in, we have a while to wait yet, though.  We hear from Mother regularly.</p>

<p>With kind regards<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>Bertie Macnamara.</p>
