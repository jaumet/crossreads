We are steaming along the coast of N. Ireland - close in on our Starboard - We are going somewhere & shall get cattle & fresh beef for our crew - N. Ireland is densely wooded - You cant see an opening & five miles in the inhabitants are cannibals - Heritage told me he asked an Admiralty cannibal what part he liked best of the human & the aged blighter said "the breast of a young girl or the Kidneys of young people" -About 4 pm  we steamed up a channel & anchored off Myoke - Duke of York island - Fitz Heritage Walker & self pushed off to the shore & called at the small station - We were all but naked & quite unashamed - 3 Germans live there - They have taken the oath of neutrality - They were glad to see us & we had Beer - They asked us to dinner & we all accepted - Then we bathed - diving swimming - H - is a whisky bird - good chap - Tasmanian - Like Fitz he is an egoist - The breed know each other - However he was in S Africa & I talked to him & drew him out & learnt a good bit -
