<p>Tuesday 5 Sept. 1916<br/>Up at 3.30 a.m. &amp; went round part of the line with the General. It was beautifully starlight &amp; the early morning fine but everything underfoot was fearfully wet. An interesting walk round, landing us back at H.Q. a little after 8 o'c. Rain commenced soon afterwards &amp; continued more or less constantly throughout the day. Was able to remain under cover attending to gas alarms &amp;c.<br/>A real tragedy happened in the 2nd Bn. through a "minnie" landing in a Co. H.Q. dug-out &amp; killing Capts. Murray &amp; Chant, Lieuts. Callaway &amp; Dabbs &amp; 2 4th Bn. officers, together with several N.C.O.s &amp; men. At night Padres MacAuliffe &amp; McKenzie conducted the burial service in the darkness &ndash; a weird experience.</p>
