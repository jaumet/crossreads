I might say here that the feeling that's exists amongst the troops is one of good fellowship and brotherhood, and this fact means a great deal when consideration is given to another essential fact that comes home very hard to us at times, namely that we are all away from those who are most near and dear to us. In addition to these games, there are also competitions for boxing, tug-a-war, cricket, hop step and jumps, standing and high jump. The conditions in connection with these pastimes are very different here on board ship from what they are on land. Take cricket for instance, The first game was p[layed last Wednesday (fifteenth day out) and resulted in a win by an innings for the A.S.C. the playing area is about 25 yards in length and 7 to 8 yards in width and is what is generally known the salloon deck, the two ends and one side are protected by portions of the ship and the side facing the sea is protected by a net extending the whole length of the playing area, the whole of the over head portions is covered with a canvas covering, principally to keep off the hot tropical sun and also to prevent the ball being hit into the water. Proper matting was fastened to the floor of the deck and the three stumps representing the wicket were fitted into a block of wood to keep them upright, the area between the middle of the matting and the bowling portion was divided into four sections, representing 1 2 3 and 4 runs respectively
