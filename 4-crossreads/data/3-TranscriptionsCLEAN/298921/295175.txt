July, 1915Friday 23Again the rumour that I am to go to the front - so banked 15/-/- Anglo Egyptian BK [indecipherable] money & packed up Kit again - nails in my boots & hung round like Father Xmas - with equipment I believe 40/-/- has been spent by Red X on mosquitoe Nets for Gaba as the flies are very bad indeed & after feeding on dead Turks not nice to think of but WAR is not over nice at any time but has a great fascination.
