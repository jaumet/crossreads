<p>Headquarters 1st Anzac, B.E.F., France<br/>August 3rd 1916.</p>
<p>Dear Jack,<br/>your letter reached me alright after travelling for a month or more. I have seen Claude and Cadle and they were both well. It was the night they both first went into action. Claude I have seen since &ndash; he was in two attacks so I was relieved to see the old thing with his head sticking out of his company officers dugout the next morning. I have not got to Cadles battalion since.</p>
<p>Drop me a line to let me know how you go on. I had left Egypt before your letter arrived. Geoff Butler was in Alex, and Charlie of course was with the Dorsetshire Yeomanry. I think Geoff has left Egypt since, but I dont think Charlie has.</p>
<p>Just at present it is very much like Gallipoli here &ndash; but I suppose that if the rain comes it will change all that. Jack is in France again at the 2ng Aust. Gen. Hospital.<br/>Chas.</p>
