 condit as our it if boredom . No news yet of our sail date , - and eleven day from London ! The passeng all return as usual laden with parcel and this even an atmospher of a fair reign over the ship . A gramophon - an especi tinni one croak away on the Bridg . Another blare away aft and amidship a mandolin tinkl away amateurish . Oh ! to be at sea , and hear even the clank engin to this bazaar euphoni .
