Spt 16 is this morning, & let us hope that is a good augury for the remainder of the trip. Yesterday we saw the last of the birds which followed us all the way from the Cape, & now we are beginning to sight some of our Australian birds. On fatigue all the morning cleaning up between decks, sweeping , packing lifebelts, scrubbing tables etc.Old Sol disappeared at 5.53, & at 6.8 we caught the first flicker of a lighthouse. The WA boys (sandgropers) are all ready to go ashore.
