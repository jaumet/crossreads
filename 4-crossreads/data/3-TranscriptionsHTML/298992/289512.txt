<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>It is some time since I last wrote, but things have been "doing", the last few weeks and I have been unable to settle down to correspondence. They are still "doing" &ndash; very much so, - but I was told a mail was leaving here today, so I wanted to get a note home, to let you know I am still existing, and in good spirits. We are right there now, and doing our little bit towards the "big push" and what a "push" it is. No one , not even the War Correspondents can describe the things that are going on here. One has to see &amp; hear them to realise what goes to constitute a war. At present we are camped in dug outs &amp; trenches in a gully some 2 miles from the front line of trenches, ready to go up at a moments notice if needed, and are continually under shell &amp; shrapnel fire. I never knew that</p>
