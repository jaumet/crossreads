<p>April 1917<br/>morning, but it took him nearly all say inspecting the 7th &amp; the Machine gun Squadron</p>
<p>Saturday 7th<br/>A &amp; C Squadrons went out at 4 am &amp; one troop of B Squadron followed later.  There was much aerial activity &amp; anti guns were very busy nearly all day.  All the night on the 7th LH lines Chaplain Colonel Woods gave us an interesting lecture on Gaza &amp; its history.  There was a big audience &amp; they listened very eagerly to all he had to say.</p>
<p>Sunday 8th<br/>Had a quiet day in camp.  Church parade in the evening before tea.</p>
<p>Monday 9th<br/>The Squadron was up early &amp; got away mounted with picks &amp; shovels to Tel-el-Jemmi where we dug basins for the storage of 24,000 gallons of water<br/>We finished at 3.30 pm.  Whilst we were working 2 Turks came in unarmed &amp; gave themselves up.  One was a sergeant &amp; the other a corporal.  The 7th got a cavalryman but except for his sword &amp; boots his equipment wasn't very good</p>
<p>Tuesday 10th<br/>The day was very warm.  The brigade moved out at 11.30 to go out on outpost before the Turkish post at Weli Sheikh Nuran</p>
