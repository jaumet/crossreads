<p>My dear Travers,</p>
<p>I think I need hardly tell you how fully my wife and I appreciate the fact of the excellent arrangements made by your committee for the reception and entertainment of us during our stay in New South Wales. The private letter which I wrote to you yesterday on the subject will I think have shewn you what we feel, and I shall be grateful if you will now convey our formal and grateful thanks to your committee; and also thank them so much for their good wishes for us for the future.</p>
<p>We both of us so much hope that we may meet you again some day.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Signed] [W.R. Birdwood?]</p>
