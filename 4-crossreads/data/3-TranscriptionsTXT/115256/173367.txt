 Sunday 18 April 1915 
 Church parade was held this morning under extremely adverse conditions.  The whole of the thousand men on board were hustled up forard, and packed like sardines in a tin.  Our chaplain came over from the "Seang-Chun", the troopship which is transporting our Brigade headquarters, and arrived at service in a half drenched condition due no doubt to a swampy life-boat.  The usual Sunday farce, then began and ended.  Some more about this wonderful scene that meets the eye at Lemnos.  There is now quite a big fleet of troopships and men of war off Lemnos.  Fresh arrivals are frequent and today's newcomers including a transport on whose deck was seen the towering of a huge airship.  The flag of our ally, France, is also prominent;  the swift, silent movements of her small craft particularly arouse the interests of we Australians and her troopships are comprised of what must be the cream of her mercantile marine. 
 The scene at night is one of extreme novelty and fascination.  For the most part, the vessels are in darkness except for the continual twinkle of the Morse signalling lamps on each boat.  Contrasted with these dots of light is the glare of the searchlights.  And further up the bay are the outlines, in silhouette, of grim immovable cruisers and super-Dreadnoughts.
