<p>Saturday 29 January 1916<br/>Long Bay in the morning.  Dismissed at 3 o'clock in town, rang up Miss Busby and then went over to Mosman.  Mr. Radcliff &amp; I went to Manly to carnival.  Had fun of our lives, got fairly smothered in confetti.</p>
<p>Sunday 30 January 1916<br/>Hal &amp; Freddie came down, brought nice fruit.  Called on Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wilson.  In afternoon party of us went down to Manly for trip, to see the view, which was not very exciting.  Must try and knock a bit more fun out of the weekends!!  Got back to camp at about 11 o'clock.</p>
