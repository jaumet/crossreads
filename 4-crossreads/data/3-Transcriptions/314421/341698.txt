<p>from him about the locality of Brigade Head Quarters, where we were going to remove some German machine guns that were recently captured. Proceeding all the road some distance we were stopped by a M.P. &amp; could go no further, but had to return &amp; take a bye track through shell holes and mud and eventually came on to the main road again. During this time our guns of all caliberies were bombarding the enemy, and the noise was incessent. Huge guns were being brought forward &amp; put in position, and there was a constant stream of traffic of every description. Pack mules carrying shells, Limbres with supplies, road rollers, steam and oil driven, motor lorries cars, Service waggons, Field Ambulances, and Huge Tractors, and Troops going in and coming out. <strike>During</strike> Amongst it all our guns were in action and the enemy dropping shells. Eventually we came to the foot of the ridge over which we had to cross, and which the enemy was constantly shelling particularly the top and the road, at regular intervals. We got off leading the mules &amp; made a dash for it. We reached the top in safety, passing dead and disembowled horses &amp; mules,</p>
