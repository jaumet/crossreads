<p>France,<br/>June 28th 1917.</p>
<p>My Dear Mrs. Fletcher,</p>
<p>It is with feelings of very deep regret that I write to you of the death of your gallant son No. 413 Pte. T. J. Fletcher. He was killed in the battle of Messines on June 8th.</p>
<p>I deeply deplore the death of so excellent a soldier. During the battle he distinguished himself by his courage, coolness &amp; determination. At all times he was reliable and hardworking, &amp; he was always cheerful and ready in the performance of every duty. He won the affection and esteem of his officers &amp; comrades: we all mourn the loss of such a splendid man.</p>
<p>Officers, non-commissioned-officers &amp; men all join me in offering you and your family most heartfelt sympathy in this your great bereavement.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,<br/>Leslie J. Morshead.<br/>Lieut.-Colonel.</p>
