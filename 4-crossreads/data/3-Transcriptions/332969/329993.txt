<p>I can tell you the boys were fighting very hard all night hand to hand all the time &amp; I dont mind telling you the Turks kept on attacking our captured position to try &amp; gain it back but we were not to be shifted The Turks trenches are very deep trenches &amp; they put me in mind of an Ant's nest &amp; most of them were covered in with sleepers with dirt thrown over the top of them. I dont mind telling you I had some very narrow shaves. I was hit in the back &amp; nocked down by a piece of shell but luck happened it did not hurt me very much.  We were all very pleased when we got word that we were being relived by another Battalion for we were all just about <strike>k</strike> nocked up.</p>
