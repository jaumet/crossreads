quite a number of the men absented themselves from duty and we had some difficulty in carrying on the work.At this time the Bakery was working two eleven hour shifts by Major Priors order. The men on 2 P.M. shifts amount of work was considerably lessened enabling the shift to finish about 9 P.M.The two shift system was most unsatisfactory. The first shift commenced duty at 3 a.m. whilst second shift were supposed to take up the work at 2 P.M. It often happened that the first shift through failure of Fermentation or other unavoidable causes had not completed the task allotted to them viz 7 rounds out and one round in ovens. Therefore second shift would have to stand by.The system of two shifts had been worked previously. When I pointed out the advantage to Major Donnelly he said he was not a bit concerned how I worked the Bakery providing I got him the required amount of Bread. Under the three shift system the ovens were working full 24 hours consequently we were able to get out two more rounds viz two extra batches from each oven. Added to which the men got ample resting time and were much better fitted for the arduous duties. The Rations about this time were considerably lessened
