  
 June 3rd. We received our injection of Cholera. Afterwards whenu to Kaulorun Point for a picnic, followed by a concert at 605 &#126; quite a celebrated affair. We had a whole week off. August 11th. saw Miss Bigley at 66 General Hospital, and 50 Australian nurses arrived at our camp. Very nice girls. Guess we looked frazzled and worn out grappling with bed bugs. We tried everything - putting our stretcher legs into tins of kerosene, fumigating huts, but the bugs were that much smarter and evacuate into the next hut _ we couldn't win. Even in the wards as we'd life down a chart, they would crawl away. One nurse said she spent her spare time making them form fours. August l5th had orders once again to leave, and boarded the transport H. M. T. "Aragon" on Aug. 16th, escorted by two Japanese destroyers, ''Scorpion" and "The Comet". There were over 100 from No. 5 General and No. 1 Stationary Canadian Hospitals. Sailed at 7 p.m. sorry to leave the old town and the White Tower, and the very nice people we had worked with. We arrived at Skyros, had a very pleasant day swimming and sunbaking. Next day we saw Nulos Island but did not land. At Sudda Bay we went on shore. Went for a ride in a funny little buggy (Padre Morton and about 8 nurses managed to squeeze in) to the town of Baise. A clean place with very nice markets, and the cleanest kiddies we had seen in this part of the world. Venezelos was born on the Island of Crete. Two difference Japanese boats are to take us the rest of the way. Our next stop was Navarine &#126; the prettiest little bay we had seen so far - unfortunately we were not allowed to swim. We anchored about 4 miles from Corfu, but the lovely coastline was the only thing we could see. We were longing to land, in order to see the wonderful palace of the Kaiser which was being used as a convalescent home for Officers. There was a good concert on board that night. The Captain was undecided about leaving Corfu, as our escorts had left us dny many rumours were around. However, at 7 pm. we sailed. It was a wonderful moonlit night. At 7 a.m. passed through a boom and waited outside the harbour of Taronto. At noon we passed through a tiny opening with high houses on one side and an Italian Fort on the other. It looked hardly wide enough for the "Aragon" to pass through. Such a sight greeted us - a large harbour inside with all sorts of battle ships and dreadnoughts &#126; it was most unexpected. In the evening we were taken out in an old barge to see the harbour. The water was almost pink from the reflection of the sunset. We all began to sing and suddenly a sailor hopped us and called on us to praise the Lord. We duly did and returned to the boat after having a rollicking good time.
