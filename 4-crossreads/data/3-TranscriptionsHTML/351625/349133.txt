<p>Durrington Camp<br/>25 Sept. 1917</p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I will try &amp; write a bit although there is not much to say.  I am enclosing a photo of our N.C.O.s &amp; officers, it is not too bad for a post card.  I will send you another by next mail in case this one goes down.  Ken is not in it as he was away in quarantine at the time.  Today we have been at the range marking on the targets for another lot who were shooting.  On Saturday we went for a route march of about 8 miles &amp; in the afternoon</p>
