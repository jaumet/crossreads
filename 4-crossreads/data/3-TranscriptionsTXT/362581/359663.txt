 My darling Eddy, 
 Your letters were really wonderful this week   &amp;  I'm so pleased to hear that you like school so much. Suppose you will be playing football   &amp;  cricket by the time I Come home. Suppose the boys are all good mates. You must write   &amp;  tell me all about your School. Must write to Auntie Bell next for her birthday.  Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. From Auntie Eadle
