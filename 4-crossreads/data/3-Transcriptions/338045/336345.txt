<p>1916<br/>Nice hot baths are provided, pyjamas &amp; warm clothes, comforts &amp; I get my ticket for Ward 15, Bed No. 6.  Parted from my little Canadian friend, who goes to another ward.  This hospital is comprised of many long white huts, all connected, fine comfortable beds in every ward;  amusement rooms, billiards, theatre &amp; everything required for comfort as I soon find out.  The Canadian Nurses are very obliging &amp; attentive &amp; the place is very easy going.  A soldiers' paradise after what we have been through.  Beautiful English country village (or suburb).  A concert is held &amp; after some tea in the canteen, get to bed.</p>
