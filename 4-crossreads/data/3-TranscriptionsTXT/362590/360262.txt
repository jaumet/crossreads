 7-1-16 My dear Judge 
 At present I am thoroughly miserable. I have been passed "fit for general service" &amp; sent down here to a draft depot, a disgusting place where everyone knows no one where the men &amp; officers are constantly changing over with other men &amp; officers, where the cold is intense &amp; where everyone craves to get back to France. We parade 6 hours per day &amp; as the men have no rifles &amp; do not even belong to my own division you can imagine how interesting it is. 
 We had a splendid time the last few days of my sick leave &amp; I am now quite well. I do hope that the beastly cold of this place will not cause a recurrence of my complaint.
