<p>are a lot of young English troops who have been over in England training for the last two years.</p>
<p>Naturally being inexperienced in actual warfare they have got the wind up, hence the large number of self inflicted amongst them.

<p>Aug 12th. Saturday</p>
<p>Had a motor trip of about 60 miles to the infectious hospital near St. Omer. The day being nice and warm I enjoyed the trip immensely.</p>
<p>On arriving back from St Omer I received a parcel from home containing, pancakes, scones, and a tin of Rasp &amp; Red Currant Jam. Enjoyed them very much.</p>
<p>Have got Bunk fitted up in a little hut which has been set apart for the O.T. and D.R. Staff.</p>
<p>Aug 14th> Mon.<br/>King George V passed through in train to-day.</p>
<p>Rumour has it that he made a statement at Etaples, that within a fortnight, there would be something done which would startle the world.</p>
<p>The wild flowers which are growing in the fields and ditches are simply magnificent and I have found great pleasure in studying them.</p>
