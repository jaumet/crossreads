 Ribemont. Bty Position Weather wet and miserable throughout the day. Laid four lines including O.P. which is quite some distance away from our home. Fritz doing quite a considerable amount of ranging and gunfire during afternoon and night. I think he has pulled some more guns in action up this way. Our trench home completely flooded out during day. Had a very bombs during the night.  Mended O.P. wire during the evening.
