 22/10/17 Paris Abroad early and went to the Continental in quest of Rodda who had not arrived. Bought some bonbons and made some other commissions round the Opera quarter. Again a dull and foggy day. Found it quite impossible to buy any biscuits as they are not now made so one shopkeeper told me. Returned to hotel and met E. &ndash; together we made the streets looking at shops. She took me to a magnificent grocers shop &ndash; surely the most wonderful in the world crowded with people buying all sorts of things in jars and bottles. A loud vociferous crowd this. Returned to hotel afoot and then left for lunch at Henris with a list of his specialties. A fine place very chic &ndash; item 18 francs. Disgraceful in war time and quite inexcusable. Wandered round the Bourse and other places in the afternoon &amp; at 5 o'c went out to afternoon tea at the Ambassadeur and it was very pleasant here. Item 6 francs. Now back
