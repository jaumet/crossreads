Sergt Partridge is under open arrest & has to report to Bde H.Q. this morning for refusing innoculation.The troop from the 2nd Regt with Engineers who went out to tap for water returned this afternoon & reported good going for horses a little out & found the ground too hard to take the drill & considers the outlook for water is very bad along the flank;  a good number of Bedouins followed them several miles coming back, they sighted a Turkish patrol but did not clash;  A patrol goes to Aabash from here daily, they go in 10 miles & only 8 from El Arish & can see it plainly through glasses. Turkish troops
