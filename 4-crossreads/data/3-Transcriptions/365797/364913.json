<p>Dene Gully<br/>Saturday. 4.6.15.</p>
<p>My dear old Alan,<br/>Your letter has just come &amp; we are so disappointed that you are not to be home for dinner tomorrow.</p>
<p>Each day since you wrote we have been hoping for a wire to say you were coming. I am so sorry I didn't do what I wanted to do after your first letter &ndash; wire you some money but Father said perhaps you would be on your way home. I shall wire it on Tuesday morning &ndash; Monday is a holiday alas!</p>
<p>Your last instalment for Dene is here &amp; we are expecting him tomorrow so that he can leave an order for me to get that too. I intend running down to see if Uncle Jim is home this week end &amp; ask him what can be done to get you off for a few days. He goes about the 7th so perhaps you may go on his boat &ndash; they say he is to go in command but I don't know definitely.</p>
<p>There are ever so many letters here for you, I will send Dene's &amp; Una's &amp; wait to send the others.</p>
<p>Uncle Jim is going in the Ceramic and is Major of 19th Battalion, 2nd Company.</p>
<p>[The following text is written along the left-hand margin:]<br/>Hazel is better &ndash; your letters in Egypt will have all the home news &amp; I sent for some socks &ndash; will Tommie get your letters for you? All the girls have been</p>
