<p>our chaps got a splinter of a bomb in his leg, it was a lucky escape.<br/>29th. Our bayonet drill was advanced another stage this morning. I had charge of one squad on this work, another shot was fired accidently this morning but luckily no-one was hit.<br/>We also had some drill in bombing squad's which is also very interesting.<br/>I believe there must have been a Zeppelin up last night, for the aircraft guns were going pretty heavy about 7 oclock or so.<br/>There is to be an inspection of helmets &amp; iron rations this afternoon.<br/>Capt McVean came back from England this morning.<br/>30th Those who were short of iron rations went up this morning, &amp; got 7 days C.B. a bit hot I reckon.</p>
