<p>12-5-16<br/>woke once during the night, the sun was well up when I awoke this morning;  We arrived at Zag-A-Zig about 7.30 &amp; watered &amp; fed the horses in the trucks;  Some Tommies had tea ready for us on the platform &amp; we had breakfast.  About 9 oclock we continued our journey &amp; arrived at our destination (Kantara) about 11.30 &amp; by 1 oclock we had our horses tethered to oak trees growing along a fresh water canal about a mile from the station;</p>
<p>had rather a good trip since leaving Hassan Pasha &amp; very little messing about;  Anti-Air-Craft guns have been mounted in various positions on tops of houses &amp; heaps of sandbags;  English soldiers are here in thousands &amp; to the south east of us we can hear artillery apparently practising; these sound a long way off;  From here a light railway runs out into the desert 27 miles &amp;</p>
