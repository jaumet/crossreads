<p>Tues . Apr. 9th<br/>Read a very interesting account in today's "Telegraph" about the Australians fighting around Dernancourt. They are keeping up their reputation as some of the World's best Fighting men.</p>
<p>We were billeted at Dernancourt in Oct 1915, when we went to "the Somme" from Armentieres. We know the country around where the heavy fighting is quite well. Sent B'thday Card to B.E., and wrote Mrs Sam Ibbs.</p>
