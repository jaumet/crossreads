It is like Edinburgh Castle, built very high up on a hill, with the second finest mosque in the world built at the top, namely Mohammed City Mosque.

From this point we got a splendid view of the city of Cairo and the surrounding country. At our feet lay the city, flat roofed, and covering a wide area. There are said to be 500 mosques in Cairo and to look at the minarets and domes pointing skywards above the flat tops of the houses is a fine change from what one sees in European countries.

To the left lies old Cairo a conspicuous object there is the Old Roman Acqueduct, which at parts has tumbled down.

Away in the distance on the edge of the desert about ten miles away the Pyramids are to be seen. There are nine pyramids but only three can be seen the others are small and are almost in ruins. On the banks of the River Nile the beautiful green of the land there is delightful.

Leaving the Citabel we went down through the narrow streets and lanes inhabited by the natives. It was very interesting, and I felt as if I could never tire walking through these strange places and new scenes.

One could see the natives at their various simple industries. There are no windows to these shops which are invariable small and one could see all that was going on.
