The top of this Pyramid has been levelled off a pole has been erected to show the original height. On the way home we went via another route passed the Zoological Garden crossed over the River Nile. The Nile is a dirty looking river has hundreds of house boats on it has some very fine bridges across it. From the next day onwards we had to settle down to drill it was a strain too for we had had none since leaving Sydney. On the 27th we were inspected by Lt. General Birdwood the Commander of the Australian Forces. Next day I met Bert went for a walk at Night went to see him at No 2 Auxil. Hospital saw through it.
January February 1916
On the 30th I went out to see Ghezireh Hospital which is situated on the banks of the Nile is a fine building. For the next few day I just wandered round in my spare time looking mostly at the things which I?d seen before. But on the 6th February I went to No 3 Auxil Hospital or it is also known as the Sporting Club is in Heliopolis. While there I had a good look round inside the wards round the grounds. The grounds are divided into a Polo field, football field, Tennis courts golf links all these are surrounded with beautiful hedges gum trees. I also went saw the Aerodrome the same morning saw Aeroplane
