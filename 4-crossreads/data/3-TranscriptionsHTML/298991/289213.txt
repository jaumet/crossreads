<p>Thursday Sept 13th<br/>Very misty. Everyone is looking forward to pay day now, boat rolls are out of the question. Went to the pictures in the Gym, not too bad.</p>
<p>Friday Sept 14th<br/>I don't know what I will do if I don't get my pay book back befor Monday, which is pay day, as I have only got four penny stamps now. Tal Robinsons sends me down a good few cigarettes. Still very misty, at times you could hardly see your hand in front of you. This is supposed to be a very big base, but nearly all the guns are now dismounted. I saw where some 12.5 guns were mounted, but they had been old muzzle loaders. Seven years supply is supposed to be here, in case of a blockade.</p>
<p>Saturday Sept 15th<br/>It was a lovely day today, one could not wish for better. The weather is very changeable here now. It came over very misty tonight. Went for a walk to Portland, but it was very quiet down there. It was a very big strain coming back up the hill.</p>
