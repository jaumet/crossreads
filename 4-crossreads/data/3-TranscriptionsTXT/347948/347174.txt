 "Il Balen del suo Sorriso" Il Trovatore 
 All is hushed save night winds stealing O'er the lime trees and the river Sounds that called up gentlest feeling Now have lost their charm for ever The loved haunts then fraught with gladness Can to me no joy impart Memory brings alas but madness In the tempest of the heart 
 Oh could I behold those glances Brighter than the stars above thee Hear the voice whose sound entrances Breathing forth the words "I Love thee"
