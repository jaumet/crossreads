<p>November 1916<br/>joined up with the other patrol.  Signalled back to camp &amp; waited till about 1 oclock. Came back through Simara where there are plenty of dates &amp; got back to camp about 3.30.  Our pay had been sent out, so we drew the money which is of not much use to us here.  Our rations come out every 48 hrs also horse feed.  We have got nearly all our horses clipped &amp; they look much better for it.  Mosquitoes are very busy here have got my forehead bitten all over</p>
<p>We do a bit of revolver practice of which I find myself pretty good.  Also have a football, but had the misfortune to puncture it.  The nights are very long &amp; candles scarce, but Farquhar &amp; myself play the officers bridge &amp; have beaten them every time &amp; I am not an expert with the cards.  We got some mail on the 17th.  Received 3 letters one from home also a parcel with 2 pairs of sox</p>
