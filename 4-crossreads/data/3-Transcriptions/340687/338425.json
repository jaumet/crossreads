<p>May, 1917. Tuesday 1<br/>Day windy but fine. Felt very tired all day. Woke when Savage came round at 10.30. Got up and spent all day cleaning engine and looking for defect. Oil all clotted with water. Pumped a bit a still hot. Went down to Davenports for tea who arrived home at 12.30. Savage was over at 9 to pay for pipe &amp; stayed till 10.30 when I turned in but didn't sleep too well.</p>
