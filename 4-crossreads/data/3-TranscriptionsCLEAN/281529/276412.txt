 My 27th birthday.   Rode over to Frechencourt at 11 am and had about a dozen of my officers there.   General Birdwood said farewell on the occasion of his going to take command of 5th Army and there was no doubt he was much moved and sorry to leave us.   He gave us news of the German push on the Aisne and the consequent retirement there.   The unfortunate 9th Corps seem to have caught it once more and the Chemin des Dames so dearly bought is now in enemy hands.   After he had finished with the others General Birdwood had a talk to the other 3 Colonels & myself.   Rode back to Franvillers  for lunch and inspected some new drafts who had joined up.   After lunch tried a couple of malefactors & then took a walk round the trenches in front to decide on where to shift our people to out of the village - the Boche has been shelling it too much to be healthy.  He put one beauty right into the Cemetery tonight sending debris of all kinds flying up in one big shower.   The safest course is for us to clear right out of the place completely and this shall be done by midday tomorrow.   An artilleryman had his leg blown off out in the street.   A little group at the Cemetery were burying others.   We recovered today the body of a man drowned only a few days ago - Byrne D Co
