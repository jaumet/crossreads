<p>Septr 1915<br/>[Note in margin:] Friday<br/>3rd &ndash; Word received that an Austn T'port had been torpedoed by German sub. but that T'prt reached Mudros under her own steam. Few lives lost. Number lost &amp; name of T'port not mentioned. Nugget B, Hayes &amp; I went away round to Anafarta Bay About 6 or 7 miles &amp; all sandy &amp; rotten walking. Disappointed with walk, not much to see. Had fine swim off beach. Had few English blackberries on way. Melons also had been grown, small vines still there no fruit on. Thousands of Turkish bullets lying on ground, spent &amp; fallen there. Saw some of 1st L.H &amp; M.G Sectn of 2nd L.H. 2nd L.H. shifting round to left tonight. Gen'l Birdwood came up &amp; spoke to us a couple of times, also spoke to Gurkhas. Seems free &amp; easy going sort &amp; seems popular with men. Rather tired when we got back. Mail expected tonight. Capt Pitcher up at 5th L.H. vice Capt Dodd's. Tommies say that big attack expected in a day or two as large numbers of fresh troops being landed nightly.

Achi Baba bombarded again in afternoon.<br/>4th &ndash; Very quiet all day. Playing nap for matches to fill in time. Left about two mins early to come home, Colonel hauled us back. Destroyer with searchlight evidently watching road for Turks sending provisions to Achi Baba. Dave called at camp, went up to dressing stn 8AM so missed him. W.O. &amp; Pallet sent away.<br/>5th &ndash; Men started on digging hospital etc near Cookhouse. Another weird act of our Colonels. As he was passing, he tried to run the gauntlet of the shovels of dirt &amp; stopped one fair on the back of the head &amp; filled his shirt with dirt. Kept him <u>out of the way</u> for some time, in fact did not come back at all. On beach fatigue scored a good box for keeping odds &amp; ends &amp; tucker in. Up at dressing stn at 7pm Later Jim Burns came up &amp; said</p>
