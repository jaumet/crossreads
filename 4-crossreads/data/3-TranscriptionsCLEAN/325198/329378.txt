  
 3 Oct, 1916 Hill 70 We are fixed up here once again & its no bally catch as yet, all "Falling ins" & "dismisses" & numerous fatigues.  We left Romani at 8.0 yesterday morning & a long weary journey it seemed.  I was real crook too & thought we would never get here.  It was 2.30 when we got in & started to water our horses.  its a treat to get to fresh water again & I had a bosker bath after evening stables.  This morning we had to turn off from breakfast too abruptly for our liking & take the "mad- mick" & shovels & level the floor of our stables - We did do a yell but it looks much better now its done.  They do some wonderful things in this military though, they brought back 50 fantasies of water all the way from Romani on Camels, we are all wondering "Why" - There are two sections to a tent so far but the details are to be all absorbed into the Regt so I expect we'll have a few more in our tents, one thing it will mean more men for fatigue
