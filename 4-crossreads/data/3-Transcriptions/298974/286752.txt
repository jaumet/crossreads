<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I have just received no less than 46 letters and about 16 papers and 2 prs of socks! Think of it. It has just been too lovely for words.</p>
<p>When we first came to Egypt from England, after being 10 weeks from home, we got our first mail. You can imagine our excitement; Certainly no event on the trip has excited us to such an extent. Well, we went back to England, stayed there 2 weeks and, the last day before setting out for Egypt &amp; Australia again, I got one letter from Aunt Katie. You can imagine how delighted I was, for we long for letters. Now, 3 weeks later, I have picked up my last mail before seeing you all again. I hold the record for the remit; 38 was next best. I feel quite proud of my relatives &amp; friends, for they all noticed it (especially the sorters) and chiacked me over all my girls. But I'm afraid Ive been acting like a child for the past 24 hours over it; its just too ripping for words.</p>
<p>Therefore I ought not to be unhappy, should I? But I feel quite glum.</p>
