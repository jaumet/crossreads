Friday 21 February 1919Went to Horseferry Rd with Dad then to see about my application for Non Military Employment. It is over alright but they haven't a position for me yet. Will go to see a man about it tomorrow. Marie took me out to the Arsenal. Gee she knows a lot of people there. Had a look over the Small arms post. It is very good. Had dinner at an Italian cafe & then we went to see Box & Tricks. Wasn't very keen on it tho'.
Saturday 22 February 1919Went out to see about my N.M.E. but the man wasn't in so left a note for him & made an appointment for Thursday. Took Marie to see a soccer match Milwall V Chelsea. Game was poor. Chelsea won 3 to 2. Went to the Coventry for dinner &  then to The Officers Mess at the Prince's Theatre.
