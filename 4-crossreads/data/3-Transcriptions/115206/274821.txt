<p>September 1918.<br/>Sunday 8</p>
<p>In a reserve position, 4 miles from Peronne.<br/>Sunday, a beautiful morning a deadly afternoon.<br/>Had an early visit from Fritz, no material damage so far as I have hard. As we are in reserve we have not been firing and that means a spell for everyone. <br/>News to hand shews that the infantry advanced on Vendrelles, after capturing Matevillers and Villerscholles. The former village is fairly close to the Hinderburg Line and three miles from St.Quentin.<br/>&nbsp;I wrote a large number of letters.</p>
