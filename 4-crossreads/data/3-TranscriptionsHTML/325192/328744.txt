<p>Having my accomodation in a City Hotel under a Swedishe Name, I remained in the City 3 Weeks without ever even being suspected. Owing my friends Business being slack, through the European Crisis, we had plenty of time laying idle on our hands. So we viewed the City both during the day and the lovely summer nights, patronising Theathers, Concerts even Charitable Concerts in aid to help to swell the funds of several Socitys, as Australia had about 50 different funds, all claiming to do some good in this War. Their wher all begging for supscriptiones, and never getting anough. No doubt some wher with sence, others wher only to catch the unawhares. During these Outings, I allways acted the good kind and attentive Husband. The real Husband acting as our Guest untill we arrived back ay my place of acomodation, when my Friend had to take charge of his "better half" again.</p>
