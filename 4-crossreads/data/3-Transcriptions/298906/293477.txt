<p>Spoilt a film this evening trying to develop it, think I will turn the developing up &amp; do my printing only.<br/>14th. Had us all out on Batt. drill this morning, I had plenty to do &amp; was well in the limelight first as a Coy. commander, then platoon, &amp; finally guide to the Battalion.<br/>After finishing this hanged if we did not have to go &amp; get inoculated with T.A.B. they run the needle well in, &amp; far enough round so that you could not suck it out without a lot of trouble, this is a great game with all of us after inoculation, sucking the injection out of the arm, but the Drs. are beginning to drop to it.</p>
