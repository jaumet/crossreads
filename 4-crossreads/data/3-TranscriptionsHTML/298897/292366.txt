<p>It was my first entry into Belgium &amp; I soon came on Belgian soldiers who were very English looking their Khaki uniforms helping the deception.  The various names of villages etc were of great length &amp; most difficult to pronounce.  Altho' I failed to see Morris still I had an excellent day visiting old friends pedalling a distance of close on 50 miles.</p>
<p>Thursday 21 Sept<br/>Nothing of note the last few days except rain &amp; mud.  Days are noticeably shorter &amp; weather getting very chilly.  At night went into "Estairs" to see a concert at the 1st Cas. clearing station which was first rate.  All the fellows were dressed in Peirrot Costume &amp; the various gags etc hitting off various members of the unit were much appreciated.  8th brigade moving into armenturing during the day which I fancy foreshadows a move for us all.</p>
<p>Tuesday 26th Sept.<br/>Things very quiet everywhere bar the Somme. Yesterday I attended the Gas school &amp; spent a very interesting day.  During the morning we received a lecture which described the gas, how used &amp; its results etc.  Before we managed to get anything like an efficient helmet we lost 15000 men.  Now our new helmet is absolutely the last word enabling</p>
