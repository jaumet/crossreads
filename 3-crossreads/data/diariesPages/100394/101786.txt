Up at daylight this morning and went aboard troopship "Maniton" about lunch time. 20th Batt. 5th Engineers some English troops on board beside ourselves also about 600 horses. It is interesting to watch them being loaded. There are also about 30 prisoners on board including some women {(20/1/16) I have since found out that these prisoners included some consuls arrested in Salonika}

The food is very good but sleeping accommodation limited. I am sleeping with the horses. I have seen the "Aquatania" (47000 tons) and "Brittannic" (53000 tons) in the harbour now both Hospital boats. I havenâ€™t had any official war news for weeks but rumours are plentiful if not reliable I have seen Mick Heraghty a number of times on board and also on Anzac. He is a S.B. in the 20th.

Left Lemnos harbour about daylight this morning. We catch a glimpse occasionally of an escort The seas in this part are very dangerous on a/c of submarines I forgot to mention previously that I ate more oranges and chocolates on Lemnos than I ever ate before in my life We got some delicious blood oranges there.

We have been passing through numbers of islands since we started ideal places for submarines to hide. The "Persia" and "Geelong" I understand were sunk about here recently. (9/1/16) I have heard since on reliable information that an escort sighted a submarine and gave chase but it was lost among the islands. These Islands are apparently uninhabited and appear very barren.
