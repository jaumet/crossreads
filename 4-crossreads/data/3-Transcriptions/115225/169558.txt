<p>Weather wet &amp; miserable - When we got back to Park we had to move the park to Molliens-au-bois &amp; parked down a muddy lane where as there was no place to turn &amp; come out we had to back down, we brought our &eacute;chelon of amunition from Allonville &amp; unloaded it at the bottom of the hill -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apl 30<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went out on supplies again at 6.30 A.M. &nbsp;Raining all day &amp; very miserable. We call in at Madame Bully Beef&#39;s every morning &amp; have rum &amp; milk (hot) &nbsp;We got home at 4.P.M. &nbsp;I received some letters.</p>

<p>May.1<u><sup>st</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went out on Supplies at 6.30 A.M. to Ailly &amp; Fr&eacute;chencourt. weather still dull &amp; cold but no rain to day - They are stopping lorry traffic on a lot of roads &amp; making other roads for one way traffic &amp; they made us come back home through Amiens&nbsp;<sub>^</sub><sup>&amp; Rainneville</sup>&nbsp;&amp; we travelled thirty kilometres when we usually get home in six kilos. they say they are short of Petrol. it is foolish to think that the drivers will economise when they have to do foolish things like this, but it is the Army</p>
