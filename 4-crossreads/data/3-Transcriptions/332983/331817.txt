This driver went to the 15 Indian mule corps water trough to water his horses naturally the sentry, who was an Indian went to stop him. The sentry went to hunt away the horses, and the result was they started to fight. The R.H.A. man hit the nigger in the mouth, the Indian picked up a large stone to hurl at the driver. Some of our men arrived on the scene and put a stop to it. The Indians were greatly excited, they reported the case to their officers, who told them if it occurred again to stick them with the baynot. The water supply in this well is to water 1500 mules. The R.H.A. has a well allotted to them<br/>12/10/1915</p>
