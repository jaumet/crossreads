<p>3.  just given me the distracting news that there are to be no more mails home to Australia for six weeks, after to-morrow, so it is said &amp; if it is a fact it is too horrible to think of you having to wait all that time for news of the boys.  But you will be quite sure that no news is good news dear People won't you, &amp; probably the boys will be here safe in Egypt all the time, for after all they cannot leave Egypt unguarded &amp; some of them have to stay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We none of us have seen Le yet and his last note says that all leave is stopped now so we cannot just now.  He was not at Zeitoun where the A.I.F. told me he was while Rid was sick &amp; it was because I had addressed his letters there that he was not getting them.  Rid had a note from him last week saying that he is at Serapeum, the latter word was censored out but I had also had one in which it was possible to read the word and that as I think I mentioned once before is down along the canal but not actually on it, it is more in the desert.  He said that he is now to be addressed Driver &amp; that we are to leave out the Reinforcements altogether when we write to him.<br/>You will have had my last letter saying that Rid joined his unit at Tel-el-Keber on February 28th, he seems very happy there and keen on his work, but he told me that he had written to you giving you an idea of his new sphere.  His address accurately is <u>2nd Brigade</u> 1st Divisional Artillery. A.I.F. Egypt; this I add in case you have not got his letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had numerous letters from him during the week and then to my utter amazement yesterday morning, just over a week after his departure, he appeared here at the Pension.<br/>He had only come for the day &amp; had a lot of business to get through such as getting hymn- books, communion- set, and all sorts of places to go to &amp; after all had not quite finished at the end of the day though he had been at it quite hard, and so stayed the night.  We had a delightful quiet little evening together &amp;</p>
