Monday 22nd April 1917 [1918]Busy day as regards silk underskirt &, for me, it really is not too badly done.10 a.m. C.O. visits me & "well Sister how do you like your new room, nice & quiet isn't it", are his comments, remarks as all do about my "negative" & vanishes.  M.O. does not appear at all.Up for 3 hrs. & very glad to be back in bed once more.6 p.m. brings Sisters Leed, Peile & Moreton with lovely flowers, & my frock and kind enquiries from Matron (Mrs. Belcher), Miss Witherington, Home Sister & Capt. Grant.
