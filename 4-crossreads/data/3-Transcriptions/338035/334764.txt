<p>blew out.  Letters to Roy Cunningham and Eddy Hyde.</p>
<p>Tuesday 30th<br/>On awaking found a strong wind has sprang up during the night and a moderate sea was the result.  This became worse as day wore on and the old ship rolled more than was good for some of the boys &ndash; one of whom spilt a basin of porridge all over his clothes whilst coming down the stairs.<br/>For 24 hrs. ended noon we did 270 and now in 22 and 65.</p>
<p>Wednesday 31st<br/>Wind had abated somewhat when we awoke and the day turned out pleasant.  It was intended to hold sports promoted by Sargents on board but owing to inclement weather of yesterday they were postponed.<br/>During morning Capt. Meehan lectured on "Shock <strike>and</strike> Unconsciousness" and Collapse.  In pointing out difference between Shock &amp; Collapse he showed that in Shock no loss of blood or fluid was necessary whereas in the Collapse such was necessary.  In treating Shock disregard actual injury for time being unless Artery is severed and keep patient warm.  Give brandy &amp; coffee instead.  In Collapse it was necessary to replace fluid lost by a saline solution either as an enema or subcutaneously.<br/>Hysterics &ndash; Ammonia on a piece of cotton wool soaked in solution and covered by a towel is a good cure.<br/>Epilepsy &ndash; 3 stages, (1) Rigidity, (2) Spasms, (3) muscular spasms.</p>
