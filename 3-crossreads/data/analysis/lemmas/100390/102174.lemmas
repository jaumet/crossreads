 Night at Matrooh The littl mosqu across the ink-blu bay Gleam in the moon , an alabast toy ; Like golden firefli the mors lamp play Where line on line the pallid tent deploy . The moonlight 's finger linger on the sheen Of silent ?plane , like giant gnat asleep A cross of blood abov a bar of green The " ship of pain " steal out across the deep . Jack . Sommer Matrooh .
