We did not do much today so most of the boys found time to go and get drunk. "Digly" arrived back today, and ordered a muster parade this afternoon. He was disgusted he said; to see the whole company drunk. I borrowed five francs of him on the strength of being sober, and helping him with his horse. Will go to town this evening for we move very early in the morning and by the look of it no one will sleep much.
