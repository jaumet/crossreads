<p>B Company corporal I met in the street yesterday &ndash; but that is high praise these days. And we (Walter MacCallum Wright and I) who lived close to Arthur and often messed together on Walker's Ridge shall miss what the men to aptly call "a white man" dreadfully.</p>
<p>Arthur is gone with the consciousness of a life well spent and work well done; will you all whom he has left accept our sympathy for your loss.</p>
<p>Very truly yours<br/>Grant Richards</p>
