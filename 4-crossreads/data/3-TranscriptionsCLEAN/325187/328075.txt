  
 [Tuesday 28th November 1916] We will be at  Alexandria  by this time tomorrow & I am sending you a Cable to say arrived safely- A smooth passage & we have picked up another escort so should be safe  now- & the weather is quite warm again. Communion service in the Smoke room I took part as I was thankful to be still alive. Rooke's grandfather was James Cochrane but he knew nothing about the Weir family.
