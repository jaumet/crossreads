 Dear Mr Garling I was deeply grieved to learn on my return to Sydney this morning that Major Terence Garling had succumbed to his wounds in France. If this be your son, which seems only too likely, I beg to offer you heartfelt sympathy in the loss both to you and to Australia, and pray that God will lighted your grief.  Such consolation as there is, is in that he fought and died for his country and kindred, and that Major Garling was regarded by all who knew him whether in the 111th or 37th Battery, as a gentleman and as a most gallant officer. If there is any way in which I could be of service I would be only too happy for I shall always cherish the memory of the time when I served under him. 
 Yours most sincerely A E Hodgson [Arthur Eric Hodgson, 15605] [Note added later] X Gunner in 37th Battery wounded in France and returned to Australia
