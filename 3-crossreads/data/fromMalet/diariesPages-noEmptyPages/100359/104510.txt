Tuesday February 1st
"Turned out at reveille", the first time for weeks, as the "Big Roan" came round the tent to see who was sleeping in, so I was lucky. All the crowd went for route march in full marching order, and had sham fight. Signallers, gallopers, tent division, bearers, Latrine Builders, Cooks etc. all had their allotted duties. Tent No. 6 was well represented, as usual, only one being unlucky enough to be on it, all the rest being on special duty. Rations are getting scarcerer everyday and we are getting quite used to "Fresh Air" and Tea for dinner. Battalions still passing through from the Peninsular 7th and 8th went through to-day.

More trouble in "B6" Payne and Mob on pack drill for not having blankets out. "H.M.S. Cornwallis" passed through canal, looked very fine all her crew crowding her sides. Another Arab funeral, Big crowd of niggers followed the body to burying ground, chanting one of their weird ditties.
