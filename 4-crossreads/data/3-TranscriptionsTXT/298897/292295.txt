 Thursday 15th June Definite orders for shifting camp arrived.  There was not much to do in the way of packing up, only a few tents to pull down &amp; waggons to load up with blankets etc which went on ahead with an advance guard.  The night was warm so that we did not miss our blankets overmuch.  Had a last swim in the canal at night also a supper party as a farewell to the Sinai Peninsular. 
 Friday 16th June Reveille at 3.30.  Fall in fall Roll call 3.45.  Breakfast 4 A.M. ready to move off 5 A.M.  The brigade was late so that we did not get away till about 5.30 when we marched across the pontoon bridge a large ship being moored in the canal whilst we did so.  We did the journey to Moaskah quicker than any other brigade which spoke well for things in general.  It was very hot, the perspiration simply pouring out of us our uniforms being saturated.  On arrival we took over the tents of the 8th Field Amb. &amp; were glad to take it easy until the cool of the evening.  Spent a few disasters in the Gippo canteen on "eggs acooked" and some beira at night.
