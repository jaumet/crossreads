<p>What's up? We don't know  -  A good deal of feeling at the German flag still flying &amp; one or two inquiries if we might fire on the flag &amp; what wd  -  happen to the chap who fired  -  What wd happen to him? I wonder  -<br/>Two boat loads of men have gone off from the Parramatta to the shore &amp; that's all I know &amp; I know as much as most  -  They came round last night to find out who cd handle a rifle &amp; I put my name down as I am a bally  marksman at any rate I can handle a rife intelligently  -  Munn's boy is on the Berrima I fancy &amp; if I get a chance I shall look up any Glen Innes chaps &amp; have a talk  -<br/>There is one thing I do hope will happen &amp; it is this &ndash; that we stick to all German New Guinea &amp; to all these German Islands  -  This is a superb harbor &amp; a 300 mile island &amp; lots of real good land  -  Let Australia have it  -  never yield save to force  -  All this side of the Pacific should be ours &amp; our flag should fly  -</p>
