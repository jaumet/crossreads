<p>March Friday 2 1917</p>
<p>Something doing again early this morning.   Fritz counter attacked to capture some of our men.   Our chaps met him fair &amp; square.   Gave him a great  [indecipherable]  line up capturing about 40.   half of those who came over.<br/>We were kept very busy all day 7 stretcher cases of Fritz  [indecipherable]  tho" &amp; about 9 walking cases, also some of our own boys.   One with right-foot blown off.   Had to hold it while M.O. dressed stumpy.<br/>Interesting talk with prisoners &ndash; a corporal who spoke English very well.   Receive 15 letters some of the late ones arriving telling about Xmas.   My mouth watered that much over description of dinner that I had to get up &amp; chew some dry biscuits.</p>
