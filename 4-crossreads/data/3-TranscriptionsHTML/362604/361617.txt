<p>She was soon downstairs &amp; I had breakfast &amp; then a shave &amp; clean up.  I lay down part of the morning &amp; in the afternoon.  J. &amp; I went out for a walk &amp; booked seats at the Theatre.  We went to the show at night at 9 p.m.  We filled in the afternoon by the Drawing Room fire or I played the Piano.  I met Ben Henry that is the eldest Boy.  He is quite nice but real quiet.  Uncle is the same.  Real slow, quiet Yorkshiremen.  Well Mum, I will wind up now and give Dad the rest of the news when I write to-night.  The Heads have come &amp; gone &amp; I will go out for a stroll round the Block before Tea.  Regards to all my old Friends.  Tell 'em I can't write.</p>
<p>Fond Love to you all<br/>Harry</p>
