<p>1917<br/>Dec<br/>who had seen cement works in Australia told me that this works was about 20 years behind the times with their machinery. On the Sunday night before Christmas I went to the Protestant Church in Desvres, which had been lent to our padre for the occasion. It was only a small place as there were not many Protestants in the town. The texts on the walls were in French, some of them were "Je suis le chemin, la veritie et la vie" (I am the way, the truth and the life). "Dieu est amour (God is love). "Regardez toutes les choses, retivez ca qui est bon" (Look at all things, Hold fast to that which is good). I heard about this time from Mrs MacKenzie, about Cleve's death and from Dulcie about Ivo woods being killed.<br/>Dec 25<br/>Christmas day was fairly uneventful. I intended to go to church but by the time breakfast was over, it was too late. The service was held in the Church I had been to the Sunday previous. Protestants are in a great minority in France. the inhabitants take it for granted that one is a Catholic and they seemed quite surprised</p>
