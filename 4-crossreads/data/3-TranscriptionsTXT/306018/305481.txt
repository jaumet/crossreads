January 1918on Tuesday Captain Todd turned up & I went round to the National Hotel & had dinner with him and a Lieut Philip from the same Battalion.  We had champagne & quite a dinner.  After dinner they got a box at the Kursaal & we heard the "Scamps" in the "girl on the Train", enjoyed the show.  Captain Todd & Philip I saw a great deal of when in town.  We had a motor ride to Helouan one afternoon & afternoon tea at San Giovanni  Went out to Briggs one aft evening Todd charmed them all with his playing & singing.  On Saturday afternoon the 3 of us went to the Races.  I did no good but the other 2 won.  Met a French lady friend Madame Bannarow on the lawn.  Another French woman was with her.  They made us take afternoon tea with them.  She was taken with Todd's Croix de Guerre, & wanted me to bring him out to see her at her home in Helmich.
