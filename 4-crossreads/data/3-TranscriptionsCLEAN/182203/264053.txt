  
 I have enclosed a parcel for Miss Rhoden, so if you just send her a P. Card, telling her the parcel has arrived she will call for it - The address is on it. Sister Calvert also has enclosed a small parcel  &  I think it has an envelope on it, with instructions. Sister said something about sending it by carrier but I've forgotten now. We are only allowed a certain amount of luggage - so must reduce mine in this way. You will find Les. Peel's camera  &  mine in the bag. Give his to The Peels to forward to his
