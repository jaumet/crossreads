<p>years in useful work amidst my own people.   But when will this show end?   Ask of the winds that far around with rumour fills the air?   To bed.   Good night.   The atmosphere is hot and moist, my eyelids close and my fingers are not inclined to work further.   Good night. Good night.<br/>[Lines of Xs and Os.]<br/>Caggie. Joseph. Kitty.</p>
<p>I met Colonel Holmes this morning, he told me that he had seen you just before he left Australia, he looked very well.   He told me that Colonel Watson was in Cairo.  He is encamped with his force near Heliopolis.  I must call to see him, as he lives but short distance from where I sit writing to you.</p>
<p>Good night, again good night.</p>
<p>11.7.15. 11 p.m. To night I had a long chat with a man who was on the Majestic when she was torpoed and sank off the coast of Galipoli.

The men upon her saw all the engagements and the stirring episodes, in connection with the sinking of ships that took place in connection with the presence of our ships at the entrance to the historic straights.</p>
<p>The sinking of the English and the French war ships.   The running ashore of the E15 submarine, the work of the two picket boats going to blow her to pieces, in order to prevent the Turks from getting her afloat again for use on their side.   You may remember that one of these boats was sunk the other got safely back to the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They saw the Australian submarine EE II [HMAS AE2] which was afterwards lost in the sea of Marmora, the second and the last of our submarine fleet, each had a short life but not a very merry one.  Think you not so?  The British fleet put a net across the narrows of the Dardanelles, the object being to catch the floating mines which night be coming down stream from the sea, and which already had caused destruction to many of the fighting ships?    The best catch taken <strike>by the net</strike> was <strike>the</strike> a German submarine which, unconscious of the presence of the</p>
