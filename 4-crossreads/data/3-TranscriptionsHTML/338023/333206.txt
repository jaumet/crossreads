<p>[Letter written on paper with Church of England Soldiers' Institute  letterhead]<br/>27 August 1916</p>
<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>Am seizing a fleeting opportunity of writing &ndash; for cash!!!  Could not go to Melbourne as am on the beastly guard, but expect to get next week end. Things are "crook" here in dead earnest &ndash; raining in oceans &amp; every  corner is flooded to the point of drowning. All of our crowd are stony &amp; destitute <strike>with</strike> through buying tucker at  1/6 per meal &amp; it seems impossible to save a penny as things are. Please send &pound;1 by wire. It will only cost about 1/6. Wire it to Seymour Camp Depot Post Office Victoria.</p>
<p>I have your last letter &amp; am not surprised to hear about Chas. Poor old chap, I hope he's not having a rough time of it. Will write, when I come off this job, a less hurried letter, but must catch this mail if I want to see Melbourne.</p>
<p>Much love to all<br/>Harry</p>
