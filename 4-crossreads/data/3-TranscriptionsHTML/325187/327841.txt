<p>150 miles from here there is an Oasis with old Roman Wells- timbered for about 50 feet &amp; then bored &amp; cased with wooden pipes the wood is still quite sound a sort of Sycamore- 600 B.C.  As very little timber is now growing in this part of Egypt these Wells must be 1000's of years old.  Artesian &amp; warm.<br/>Visited an old Monastry 1600 years old occupied by Copts who had to build strong holds to save themselves from the Mohammedans.<br/>So very old &amp; so very dirty no wonder the Children died.<br/>VERDUN seems to be the place of affairs at present   We only get what news is good for us</p>
