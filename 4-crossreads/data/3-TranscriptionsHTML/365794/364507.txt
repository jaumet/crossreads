<p>Monday 16 [15] April 1917 [1918]<br/>After pills No. 13 &amp; Cal. gr. i, a depressing day follows.  Pain in cardiac region all day, no notice taken when mentioned.  Sister More not in the room except with M.O. never again.<br/>I ask how much longer?  In response &ndash; "Now Sister cheer up you are going on nicely" puts me on a tonic &amp; gets out quickly.<br/>My chart which for the 2nd time reposes in the fly paper for a time, is taken out &amp; recopied by the young man next door.  Sister "Pats" time waster.  On my remonstrating with V.A.D. with pts. marking Apr'o B.O.s etc. she expresses surprise "never thought of it" etc.<br/>11 a.m. Miss Oram, Matron &amp; S. Hodges stand &amp; gaze at me what time I feel most depressed &amp; weary so was a long day.  Dinner impossible to eat.</p>
