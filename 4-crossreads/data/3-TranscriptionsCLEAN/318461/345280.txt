Jack Nelson died yesterday also Kanan, must write about Jack. my leave is nearly due now owing to all the rest having had theirs. Pay. 23/1/ 25.18.0. Going out in two days time to Beaulincourt. Keeping fine & sun hot 5 p.m. Been fairly quiet all day Wrote too soon about it being quiet had to go for our lives twice put 8 inch shells all round our dug-out in fact all over the place & what a crash they do make came back after 2 hrs expecting to see our place buried, but altho covered with dirt & bricks no harm done hope he does not start again to night. 2 or 3 hours of that lasts a long time. 
 Thursday 24/5/17 Night passed off quietly except for artillery exchanges. A Beautiful morning clear sky with a few clouds floating over, guns banging away in spasms nothing defenite. Just washed my feet had shave, cleaned Boots Ye Gods fancy cleaning your Boots in a place like this, but hate to be dirty. Expect the Boys will chiak me over it. Pay. 24/1. 25.19.0 wish that leave would hurry up. Sent the gas over in cylinders to Fritz about 2 a,m & sent in the heavy stuff must have given him a shaking up. had to leave our dug-out, put a gun about 6yds away from us & near the entrance; first shot thought my head  was gone, but it wasn't long before I left to them entirely, am in one I found this afternoon, not bad.
