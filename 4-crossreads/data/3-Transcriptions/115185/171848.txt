<p>I think the same place we thought of &ndash;<br/>Much love darlings &ndash; take care of yourselves &ndash; be kind to Mrs Greatrix and see as much of Emmie while she is in England. She is such a sweet woman. Don't forget to write each week &ndash; don't wait for mails, just post when you have written. I shall be on the look out for letters from you both and they will bring me great comfort &amp; joy however short and whatever little news you have to tell.<br/>Papers will always be very gratefully received</p>
