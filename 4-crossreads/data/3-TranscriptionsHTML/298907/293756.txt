<p>bred mongrel, pinched it in my absence there is quite a lot of this sort of thing goes on in this hospital &amp; it's a damn disgrace.</p>
<p>16th.  Another coldest cloudy &amp; unsettled morning, have just come back from Church &amp; am now patiently waiting for the dinner bell to ring</p>
<p>This afternoon I went into town &amp; put the time in at the Royal Theatre they have some very fine music there &amp; its quite a treat to listen to it, especially after the stuff we generally are treated to from here I went down to the "Bull Ring" to listen to some of the stump orators &amp; believe me they are very funny</p>
<p>17th. Was marked out as cured this morning they are sending me to Dartford I believe, its better going on leave from there for its closer to London.</p>
<p>Very misty today no sun at all</p>
