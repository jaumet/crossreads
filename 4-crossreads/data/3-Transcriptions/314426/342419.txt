<p>last night has got the Measles. Sister Cann discovered it this morning, &amp; the Doctor when he came round confirmed it. He was taken out of the ward to a special one. This Ward is isolated for 20 days, which means that we cannot go out of the camp, nor the orderlies either, they are to sleep in the Ward. We will therefore miss our chance of going on the Ulysses. All are greatly disappointed,  for it may be 4 or 5 weeks, perhaps, before we can get away.<br/>(63)<strike>Monday</strike> Sunday Jan 12.1919.<br/>A fine day. The sun shines out bright from among the clouds and the wind has died away.<br/>Nearly everyone is resigned to staying here for the period of isolation,  a few hold out hopes of getting out in a week if the case turns out not to be measles, but it is a vain hope, the only colour lent to it is that the spots or rash on the patient has disappeared this morning so we were informed.<br/>With others this evening I went for a walk to Chicherell, a village about a mile away &amp; felt much better.<br/>Monday Jan 13. 1919.(64).<br/>A beautiful day &ndash; bright warm sun, a clear sky no wind, &amp; a clear healthy atmosphere.</p>
