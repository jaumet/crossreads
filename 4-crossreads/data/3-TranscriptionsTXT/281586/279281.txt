"The Christian Soldier to his Soul"SunsetWhen the Sun goes down in splendourIn the Golden tinted WestAnd the Shadows onward creepingBring a night of peace and restThen I think of Life's great SunsetWhen all that's dear to meThere will come the evening gloryAnd I wonder how 'twill beWhen the Shadows, onward creeping Shall bring eternity
