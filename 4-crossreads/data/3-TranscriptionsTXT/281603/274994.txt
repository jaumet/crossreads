 On reaching support trench found it situated on the   western  Eastern side of a sunken road &amp; from here could be seen a couple of small villages a little advance of our front line &amp; away in the distant about two miles could be seen a chimney stack &amp; steeple belonging to the town of Bapaume.  Next day our company releived "B" Coy in supports &amp; one platoon went into firing line &amp; it was while in these position we stood some fairly heavy artillery fire from the enemy.  The next morning the 4th we lost our Colonel, he was shot by a sniper &amp; afterwards died &amp; it came a great blow to the battalion for he was a good soldier &amp; a great leader &amp; was shot while in execution of his duty.  During the same night the First &amp; Third Battalion set out to take a line of trenches.  The First were knocked back but Third gained objective &amp; early next morning a number of "A" company self included had to set out &amp; dig in a little advance to line taken &amp; after get well down had to evacuate   at d   just before day break for owing to the First Battalion not coming up on our left Fritz occupied his old line which we took &amp; he was then on three sides of us.  It was hard luck but these unforeseen occurrences will happen.
