<p>as 'tis dark at 8P.M. nowadays. All our divisions are round about &amp; our spell will now be taken in this neighbourhood instead of near Amiens as at first intended, rather hard on the men but perhaps unavoidable.</p>
<p>Thursday 12th.Sept.</strike>More rain &amp; cold. Made up my requisitions for the Battalions &amp; set out after dinner with Capt McGlashan who wanted to go to Divisional H.Q.ts. Went via Peronne but the bridge being out of service we had to cross the Somme at Ham passing through Clery. Peronne is badly damaged but has been a fine town with wall surrounding. Shops &amp; all had German Signs out but gangs of men were rapidly making everything shipshape, a lot of salvage being about. Reached Division  at Fontaine les Cappy where the A.D.M.S. signed my req. &amp;amp learnt that V.H. our W.O. had his commission. R.L.K. to W.O.H.C. to W.O. at Dartford, 3 promotions in my Unit. Went to Chuignolles to No.18 Advanced Med. Depot &amp; collected my requirements then home by Amiens-St Quentin</p>
