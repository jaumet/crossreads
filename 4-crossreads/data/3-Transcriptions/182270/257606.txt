<p>TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine, but had a gale of wind and</p>
<p>a dust storm which lasted nearly</p>
<p>all day. Round paddocks in morning</p>
<p>and helping take Mountain mill</p>
<p>down in afternoon.</p>
<p>Tickle shifted Darby&#39;s plant over</p>
<p>to the Mountain bore in the morning</p>
<p>&amp; we pull the mill down in</p>
<p>afternoon.</p>
