1915Nov. 6 Sat.The Sergeants' Mess is just A1, situated under big bamboos just inside the main gates. The tucker is splendid & such a contrast to the stuff the men get. I understand it only costs each Sergeant P.T. 25 each 16 days. This includes the wages of 2 natives employed by the Mess to look after them & wait at table. The entrance fee is P.T. 50.
