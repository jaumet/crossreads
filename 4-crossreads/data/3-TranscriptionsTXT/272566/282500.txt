Left at midday per motor ambulance for Bernafay Wood, ascertained from Divisional Hd. Quarters the whereabouts of the 56th.  Went there & found that the position has been filled by a man from the Batt.  Good Luck for me because I don't like the idea of going to this unit.Interviewed the Field Cashier & then returned to our own unit.
