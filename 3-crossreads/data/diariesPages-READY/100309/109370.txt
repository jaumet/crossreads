5/6/17 Bouzincourt
Allowed Stewart and Alderson into Amiens Parade at 9.30 without band or buglers owing to our having lent them to the Artillery. A very hot day ? quite homelike. The 4 Vickers instructors again reported and put through another lot of Lewis gunners. Other ordinary work carried on with. After lunch received word that General Birdwood was here and found him looking round the billets wearing an old felt hat, Australian flag on lance. General White was with him. General Birdwood was stuttering very much and his manner was peculiar ? different to usual. Afternoon parade, lecture and pictures of strong posts ? dreadfully hot. Not feeling in the pink came in early. Dealt with a few cases of absence without leave. The most common offence in the Army. Major Evans our guest at mess. The Band played a very good programme. Argued the point with Evans as we walked the garden until darkness had fully come.
