  
 I've kept a detailed journal but am posting this as well - We got to Rabaul on Thursday Dec 17 - Not a vessel in the harbor but during the day the Una (Comet) came in & the Store ship Eastern - I was ashore & visited Dr Skeete on the Una & then the P Office & the old Square & had a walk round - Rabaul is still in military occupation & so far I cd judge as dead as mutton - Men in Kharki everywhere but no one else save Japs or Chinese - When at sea we learnt that the Scharnhorst G & Dresden & Nurnbourg had been sunk by Ad. Sturdee's lot - Good luck to them - That sets the Pacific free & stops little isolated risings among Germans who looked to seeing their cruisers come back - What is our job - Police & patrol - We may go round the Admiralty islands - thence to Eutete on the N Guinea coast - then Wilhelmshaven - thence Rabaul or we may not Dear girl - No one knows - Well much love - Kiss the children - Fred -
