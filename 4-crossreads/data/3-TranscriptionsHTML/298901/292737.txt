<p>sacked one sgt &amp; put I. Watkinson in his place.  Waggons all painted etc &amp; in good nick.  Went to the 15th Brigade sports this afternoon, they were very good &amp; the antics of two Chaplins &amp; sundry other wags made the day happy.  A little rain but not enough to spoil our bivvys, fell during the night.  Had a bad turn again but feel better tonight.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11th June<br/>Inoculated this morning with T.A.B. &ndash; (Paratyphoid) it being 12 months since our last prick.  Later on decide to take the day off &amp; go to see some renowned caves at Naours about 8 miles away.  Set of about 11 oclock with the W.O. &amp; Q.M.S. &amp; walked all the way, having dinner at Villers-Bocage  A good omelette of 3 eggs, 3&frac12; francs also some decent beer &amp; coffee.  The caves were very extensive having innumerable passages vaults &amp; rooms all being cut out of lime stone.  It appears to me as partly natural &amp; partly the work of man &amp;</p>
