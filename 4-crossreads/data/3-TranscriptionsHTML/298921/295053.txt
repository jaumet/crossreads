<p>March, 1915<br/>Sunday 21<br/>I am at last going to see Tommy Redford, he is at Mena, near the Pyramids &ndash;<br/>Suffering from "Boils" on arms &amp; neck, silly thing for a soldier but most uncomfortable, also had to pay a Dentist in Cairo to refill a tooth, minor troubles one forgets &ndash;<br/>The Arab waiters are very amusing in endeavouring to speak English, a blood orange, is called Chicken orange, i.e.  like an egg with a chicken in it. Called on Sister Jennie Lemporine but found she had gone back to Australia, found Myra [indecipherable] poor girl she has been very ill with Pneumonia, which one is it? Better tell Murray she is now getting on A.1.</p>
