<p>shoving it in.<br/>We are going to move out to supports tonight the 3rd Battalion are relieving us, we have had 16 days pretty constant going now &amp; the Battalion has had nearly 70 casualties, so we have had it pretty warm<br/>The storm is all over &amp; the larks &amp; other birds are singing gaily &amp; everything smells nice &amp; fresh after the rain.<br/>24th. As we were leaving the trenches last night the German's started to shell a part of the line pretty heavily, but fortunately kept off the communication trenches &amp; "Convent Avenue", our chaps took up the challenge instantly, &amp; they soon shut up, one of our chaps broke his leg he slipped on the clay &amp; did the trick, you have no idea how slippery this Flanders mud is, it bangs all, I have never seen anything like it</p>
