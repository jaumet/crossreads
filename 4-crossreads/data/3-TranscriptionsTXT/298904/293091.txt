" Only a Letter "
Youre looking tired & weary,And you feel you cant be cheery.And from your dirty trench you cannot roamTheres a sight to stir your heart,Makes all care & pain departA letter from the dear old folks at home
Maybe its from your brotherOr your old grey haired motherOr sweetheart true who sends the welcome lineBut it sets you at your ease,When that message oe'r the seasJust tells you all the folk at home are fine,
Theres the other side to tellAnd it don't sound half as wellIt seems to give your heart a sudden wrenchWhen the mail is given outAnd you find without a doubtYoure the only one forgotten in the trench
In your throat a lump will rise,And tears start to your eye'sYou wonder why on earth they fail to write
