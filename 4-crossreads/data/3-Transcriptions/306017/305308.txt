<p>January 1916<br/>9th to 19th   We have had an exceedingly busy time reorganising &amp; getting ready for active service again.  I was orderly sergeant for the 2nd week in camp &amp; the parade states proved a perfect nuisance.  Being strange to most of the men, it took me a few days &amp; the transfers of men in &amp; out of the squadron was abnormal.  It was hard to know who was in &amp; who was out, but at the end of the week we got things sorted out &amp; now we are getting along quite smoothly.</p>
<p>Most of the deficiencies in equipment have been made up.  A good deal of our saddlery had disappeared during our absence at Anzac.  The niggers about the camp, I think, are responsible for a good deal of the shortage.  We have been doing 2 mounted parades a day squadron drill &amp; regimental &amp; one route march to Helouan which went off very well.  I am still riding the same horse I have had all along.  He</p>
