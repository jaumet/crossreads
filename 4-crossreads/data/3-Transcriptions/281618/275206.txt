<p>Copied 27/12/16<br/>Sat<br/>25/11/16 at 6.37 Experienced our first incident of note since leaving Cape Town. Came in the manner of a heavy jolt, followed by peculiar stunts on the part of ship &amp; an avalanche of officers into the engine room. Excitement; speculation Struck a mountain trout, a whale, a rock, a derelict, or a jettisoned carcase of cape mutton (I favor the latter theory.) Actually she has flung a blade &amp; split her tail shaft: Cause floating wreckage of some kind unknown, but as we're in the Gulf it may have been a log of African hardwood tangled in floating weed. She scraped it &amp; got it finally with her blades.</p>
