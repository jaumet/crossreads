 Lovely weather, a little on the warm side, has been prevailing since the 17th inst.  My Despatch Riding continues with success.  We are to move to Bapaume tomorrow.  It is believed that all Australians except the 5th Division (ours) are leaving this front to go up Armentieres way.  The 5th are being left behind for a while as reserve to the Tommies. Papers now daily report on the severe fighting which is going on at Bullecourt.  This is our sector of the front.
