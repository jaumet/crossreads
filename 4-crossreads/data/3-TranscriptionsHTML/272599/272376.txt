<p>April Sunday 15 1917</p>
<p>A terrific barrage fire broke out at dawn something must be doing up the line.   Our surmise was correct.   Fritz counter attacked, coming in under white flag.   12th Batt. fare rather badly.  He advanced over 1,000 yards.   Later.  His victory was short lived.   All the ground has been recovered &amp; several prisoners taken.   He what is familiarly called by the troops, came a "Gutser".<br/>Fritz had several balloons up this morning, next thing we knew he was sending over high velocity shells, several came very close, one handed up in the village I saw fragments of horse blown high in the air.   visiting the spot later, saw a horrible sight.   Two limbers with horses attached were fairly struck.   Both poor brutes were blown to pieces fortunately the drivers escaped.</p>
