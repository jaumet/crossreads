<p>We went from Rossel Id to Hervey Bay arriving there Fri 21 Aug and anchored there some miles off Sandy Cape awaiting the arrival of the troopship "Berrima" (P &amp; O Branch 11,000 tons). This ship carries about 1500 troops and others; with the crew the total would be about 2000. We went ahead on Sat 22nd at 1.15pm and allowed her to catch up at Buchard Head at 4pm. She then kept station with us.  On Sunday about 5.30 we went through the beautiful Whitsunday Passage and reached Townsville at 7am Monday 23rd. Here we coaled 400 tons (Newcastle) rather good. The "Berrima" was ordered on to Palm Ids where</p>
