 11 March 1918 Monday Maison Lyons Cake Oxford St London&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.H. Raining still, a cake arrived from London isnt it wonderful the Army Postal Service-  2 letters from Dolly also   Turks being driven back &amp; we hope to be relieved tomorrow, still raining, 4 enemy Taubes over but no bombs-  A Mountain Battery got a shaking yesterday &amp; the men have been passing us all day-  We can see  Jerusalem  behind us quite plainly- it is built on a HILL &amp; we expect to be back that way again soon. Notwithstanding cold I am fit &amp; well.
