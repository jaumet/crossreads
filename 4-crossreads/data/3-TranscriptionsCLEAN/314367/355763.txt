  
 In looking back I see I made no mention of a 6 mile walk yesterday (Friday) - on my own - thro the bush - across a neck of land - I  started at 2 & got back at 6 & had a swim in addition - I got a maiden hair fern & also a golden fern both new to me here - Coming back I met the Administrator in his car & he offered me a lift - I declined for I wanted  the walk & I wanted to see the plant & native life - This was my last time ashore in Rabaul & I was & am very content - I know Rabaul fairly well - 
 Sunday Feb 14-15   Saty night was a beaut - hot - damp - we darkened ship - I slept on the poop deck & had to shift in the night for the rain - you break your feet up in the dark - I put in the morning at sick parade & then at the accounts - I'm glad to say we are on the safe side - completely - thanks to our sales in Rabaul - Our ice is done - Beer but 14 bottles left - Fresh meat leaves us to-day - a week of low diet - The cider seems to me to have soda Salycilate or Boracic Acid in it - I seems to depress a little - so we - who know - are selling it - Its a good drink but one doesnt want too much of it - The sea is calm but its hot - I've  nothing  on but a singlet & am just nice - at least nice & cool -
