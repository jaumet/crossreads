  
 The first to go of the fighting units were the 5th & 6th Battalions 4th Light Horse & anything between 40 & 60 guns with artillery, & I think the 8th Field Ambulance luckily the night was fine & the sea smooth & they got away without a hitch each night after this there were big drafts of men leaving, & very soon old Anzac" looked deserted, what few guns were left kept on firing bravely & to us it seemed as if the Turk's must surely notice it, our daring bit of bluff seemed so very thin & poor an excuse, but they were fooled properly. I don't know what they must have been doing for there was a constant stream of small barges  boats all day long
