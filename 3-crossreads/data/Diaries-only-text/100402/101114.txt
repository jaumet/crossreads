Saturday 3 August
At Racquinghem, into which village I went for a walk this morning. This afternoon I went into St. Omer walked round but the town is fairly dead. The gardens are very pretty. Very wet at intervals. News of a brilliantly successful attack from Rheims, the French retaking Soissons I think that that front is our destination.
Sunday 4 August
Fine to-day.
A walk round the country this afternoon the country is beautiful, cropped heavily nicely timbered in the valleys. The view from the hill to the south includes Cyere Lillers the slag heaps of Bethune.
