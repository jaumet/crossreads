Well, it is supper time now & then I'll have to be off to bed.  We are only allowed until 10 p.m. in this Hospital.  It is too cold to wash in the mornings now & use cold water so we have to find hot water somewhere in the place.  We are both well & Hoping to be on the way Home in less than 6 months.
Love to you allFrom Harry
P.S.  Could you manage to send a few small Circular Head Potatoes home to Uncle Tom, just to see if they will grow on the Isle of Man.
Harry.
