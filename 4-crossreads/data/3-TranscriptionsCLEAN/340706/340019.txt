 23-2-19 Sun Went to Chinese camp this afternoon to tell Capt Grice (West Susssex) that we would be up to dinner on Tuesday & not Monday & to go for a walk with him. He is out so I walk over to Dargnies passing Heyman & another officer on the way. 
 Dargnies is a small village in the wood as straggling as most villages. Here I saw a man in a little carts drawn by two dogs & moving much faster than I could run. He seemed unusual as all the villagers stopped to look at him. Thence I went on to Woincourt through the village & home again.
