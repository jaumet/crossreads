It was nice coming up the harbor in her  -  She conveys a sense of power to you as she rapidly moves with  8  her 1600 horse power Diesel engines &ndash; (2 at 800 each)  -  Everyone comes to the shipside to see AE2 as she passes  -  Personally I think the Destroyers give me as big a sense of power &amp; a lot more feeling of Security  - 
 Tuesday Oct 27 - I am posting this aftn  -  Nothing fresh &ndash; Cumberledge was on board this morning &amp; I gave him C's message which he reciprocates saying he remembered him well  -  We'r going to have a 'Shivoo' on the Destroyers on Thursday 29  -  I'll tell you all about it later  - The weather is glorious &amp; Suva at its best &ndash; opposite us a boat is loading Fiji bananas  -
