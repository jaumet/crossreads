<p>Bay, Lions Head and the red roofed houses of Cape Town, I see nothing of the City, and so pass a quiet and rather a slow day.</p>
<p>In the afternoon mail is despatched to London &amp; Sydney.&nbsp; At midnight Roy &amp; Alf return with great reports of Cape Town and its people.&nbsp; A midnight meal of cakes and pastry is much enjoyed.</p>
<p>June 22nd</p>
<p>(Sunday)</p>
<p>A wet day!&nbsp; Malteureusement!(?)</p>
