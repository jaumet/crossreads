<p>Wednesday August 1st<br/>Raining nearly all day. Very strong cold wind blowing too. The more I see of this job, the more I hate it, &amp; wont be sorry when I have to go to Weymouth, expecting to go any day now. Haven't had any Australian mail for a long time now. Went to concert in C of E Hut, &amp; very good too.</p>
<p>Thursday August 2nd<br/>Still raining, &amp; very cold. The idea of messing is a great success. Our little mess in the Q.M. Store had to be broken up, as absolutely everyone is to dine in the new mess huts.</p>
<p>Friday August 3rd<br/>Came out sunshiney this morning but cloudy this afternoon. Very busy folding up blankets nearly all day, another chap  &amp; I folded in all twelve hundred, so we had the day cut out. They are folded in tens &amp; stacked.</p>
<p>Saturday August 4th<br/>Raining nearly all day, came down rather heavy this afternoon. It is supposed to be the heaviest rain in England, for fourteen years. It is very muddy everywhere. Very quiet day.</p>
