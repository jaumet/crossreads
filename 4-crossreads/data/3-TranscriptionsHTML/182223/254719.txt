<p>Monday 29&nbsp;November 1915&nbsp;<br />In Cairo last night with Dr Henry &amp; others at a picture show, too sleep to enjoy it, home about 1 A.M.&nbsp;<br />In Cairo at 10 am. saw Col. Featherstone.&nbsp;<br />Writing &amp; reading during the rest of the day</p>
<p>Tuesday 30 November 1915&nbsp;<br />Reading &amp; writing all day.&nbsp;<br />The coldest day I have felt in Egypt. Wind from the North&nbsp;<br />Report says that snow is falling at Galipoli.</p>
<p>Wednesday 1 December 1915<br />No wind this morning<br />Put on winter clothing today. Too heavy.&nbsp;<br />In Cairo during the afternoon. Had a chat with Knox who is managing the Red Cross work. He told me 3000 to 4000 Australians in hospital here today as against 7 or 8 thousand some time ago.</p>
