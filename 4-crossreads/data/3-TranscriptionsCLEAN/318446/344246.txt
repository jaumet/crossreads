March 1stHave not written up this weighty tome for a long time, mainly because there has been nothing to say.We have enjoyed a blessed immunity from enemy 'planes & life has pursued a very even tenor.From the 22nd Feb. to the 26th I spent in Cairo at the National Hotel - quite a good place.  Had a very quiet time mainly visiting friends amongst whom I find that the Curtises - who gave me a great evening at Shepheards last year - have come into a baronetcy!  Also I was nearly run over by the Sultan in a huge red car so I moved in very exalted circles.  I brought back a good Arabic grammar & have started to study it.  I hope to join the Camel transport soon so that I hope to be able to get a fair amount of practice & should be able to pick up a fair idea of it.
