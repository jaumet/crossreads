One of our stretcher bearers got hit with a shell today &ndash; poor fellow fine patient &ndash; not a murmur, broken arm &ndash; 6 wounds of shrapnel &amp; a 3 inch wound in the small of the back, right through the spine &ndash; I am sure he will never get off his back.

We expect some big movement hereabouts at an early date, a lot of troops &amp; artillery moving towards Lille. The French Interpreter who is attached to the 15 F. Ambulance happens to be a Priest &amp; is a very nice</p>
