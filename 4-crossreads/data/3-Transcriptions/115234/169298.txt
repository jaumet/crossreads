<p>my pals are all in the little dugout sleeping the sleep of tired &amp; weary soldiers&nbsp; Fritz is putting Mennin werfers &amp; pigeon bombs all round us but luckily so far he has not located us.&nbsp; There is a damned sniper skimming the parapet every few minutes.&nbsp; He is a nuisnace &amp; I&#39;m going to have a go at him in a few minutes</p>
