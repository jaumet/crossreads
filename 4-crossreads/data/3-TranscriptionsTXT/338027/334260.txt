Saturday, 24 October, 1914I awoke at daybreak & on looking out of the porthole was surprised to see land.  We were approaching King Georges Sound & the scenery of the harbour was very pretty.  We were first into the harbour closely followed by the Omrah.  We anchored just outside Albany & before 10 there were five other troopships anchored also.  We were informed that we have to await the convoy here & may be here four days.  I sent wires & mail home.
