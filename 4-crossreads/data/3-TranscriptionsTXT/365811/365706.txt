 10 reading &amp; rereading of the Old Testament again: such a Tale as you need it here. Then the future is intensely interesting. 
 Here on the threshold of Europe you have in this land-[indecipherable] opportunities for settlers (&amp; tens of thousands of them) [indecipherable] in a material way than in Australia or [Canada] or many of the new lands. With the markets of the world at your door you have a vast area of fertile soil [indecipherable] &amp; untilled: all cleared for the plough: graced by a perfect climate: a rainfall of 25/35 inches as regular as the seasons: water for irrigation watering to be pumped from a thousand wells, &amp; limitless labour at 1/- a day or so from Egypt. 
 Wheat as the Arabs scratch it in with a stick gives 20/30 bushels; the barley is the barley which gives the tone to the brew of Burton-on-Trent; in the Jewish areas, the Jaffa oranges &amp; the vines &amp; almonds &amp; olives are equal to the best grown anywhere. 
 But I am running amok on it &ndash; you will weary of my overflow. Also my pen has ended! Please accept my kindest regards to you all 
 Yours sincerely Harry [Gilbert].
