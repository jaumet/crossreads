Crowd gave them hearty cheers. Abdul cleared out after working about an hour. How we have another beauty, another Abdul too. He informed me this morning that he was a Christian and turning up his shirt sleeve and shewed me a "cross" Tattood thereon. Being a Christian does not make him work any harder, I set him on digging a hole and in about two hours he had sunk about 6 inches, I was afraid to say much to him, for fear he would knock off altogether
