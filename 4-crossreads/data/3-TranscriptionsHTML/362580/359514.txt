<p>My dearest Belle,</p>
<p>Received your welcome letter No. 35 on New Year's Eve.  It is lovely receiving the letters so regularly and very pleased to hear you are getting mine alright but I think now our letters to you will not be forwarded so quickly because they are censored.  Anyhow I'm sending this with Sister Watt who leaves for Aust. on Transport in the a.m.  She has promised to Post this in Melb. For me.  She will try to get out to see you but she may not have much time.  She is a great friend of Essie Craig's, hope you will like her, she has been very kind to me on many occasions.  I'm not sending out any presents, am saving to buy a few little curios to bring back with me but want to wait until about May before leaving here to escape some of the heat.  I am very well indeed and the weather</p>
