<p>Thursday Sept 27th<br/>Up at 3.30 this morning, &amp; it was cold getting out too. Had breakfast at 4 am. 90 out of the alphabetical order of A's &amp; B's marched out at 4.30 am. They went to make up the full train load from Monte Video. We fell in at 6 am, &amp; after the roll call, receiving of rations, &amp; boat tickets, we marched out at 7.30 am. The Verne Band played us down to Portland Railway station. entrained at Portland &amp; left at 9 am. It was a very long train &amp; necessitated two engines to pull it.</p>
<p>We had about 25 minutes at Exeter, where a cup of tea &amp; a bun was supplied to us, by the Mayoress &amp; committee of Exeter. Altogether it was a very nice train ride. Arrived in Plymouth about 5.20 p.m. detrained &amp; went aboard the "Suevie". Seems to be a very nice boat. It tonage is about 13,000 tons, &amp; can do about 12 knots. There are about 1400 troops on board. I am at 57 table on D. deck. Of course everything is in a muddle for the first. Issued with two blankets &amp; a hammock, but as I could never sleep in a hammock I will have to sleep on the floor.</p>
