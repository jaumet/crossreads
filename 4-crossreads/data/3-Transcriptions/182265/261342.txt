<p>young lady, so I returned to my hotel, read a few papers &amp; went to bed.</p>
<p><u>Sunday</u> - Had a cup of tea in bed, a bath and breakfast, finishing breakfast at about 10.40. A heavy thunderstorm then came up. After it cleared up I went in a motorbus to Avonmouth, but the docks were closed to visitors. It is a very pleasant trip from Bristol to Avonmouth - about 6 miles for 6<sup>d</sup>.</p>
<p>I then had a few tramrides &amp; on one I met a gentleman &amp; his wife named Holman of Barry in Wales. He is connected with shiip building. He was just recovering from effects of Drunkeness. I joined them in afternoon tea at the <u>Swan</u>. I had intended spending the night at Bath but this delayed me, so I booked a room at the Swan.</p>
<p>Monday <u>16th</u> - Left Bristol at 6am &amp; arrived at Wylye at 8 and motored to Camp.</p>
<p>Raining on &amp; off today. Made out Mess Accounts &amp; collected some this evening.</p>
<p>Wrote to <u>Jess</u></p>
