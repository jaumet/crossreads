<p>Fine &amp; Sunny, &amp; fairly warm. The</p>
<p>snow started to thaw a bit to</p>
<p>day &amp; about time too. I was on</p>
<p>stableman all day &amp; had a</p>
<p>good day on my harness &amp;</p>
<p>got it all in A1 order. The</p>
<p>whole battery was called out</p>
<p>&amp; had to take amunition to</p>
<p>the pits at night. We only</p>
<p>sent up 4 horse teams so</p>
<p>I did not have to go, thank</p>
<p>the Lord.</p>
