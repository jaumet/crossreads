<p>20 January 1916</p>
<p>A bright beautiful day. In the morning the low sandy coast of Western Victoria was in sight some distance off. There was a fresh breeze &amp; a rather heavy roll increasing towards evening. The extra motion caused a diminished number of men to be present at parades ad an increased number to be seen in various attitudes scattered over the decks: none of our men were seriously sick as far as I could find.</p>
<p>At the early morning parade issued sandshoes purchased with comfort-money to the men, most of the time usually given to physical drill being taken up this way. Hard at it during the forenoon parade &amp; again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The men specially enjoyed the organised games which the medicine-balls were used: these are large round balls something like footballs but heavier, being stuffed with horse-hair or straw, &amp; are not kicked, but passed from hand to hand in various games in various ways.</p>
<p>The sickness of so many men of different units meant that there was so much more space available for parade ground, &amp; we took advantage of it to the full.</p>
<p>In the evening the men gave a concert lasting from 7.30 till nearly 9.30, some of the items being really first class. The passengers expressed great appreciation at the close.</p>
<p>Ship rolling fairly heavily at bed-time.</p>
