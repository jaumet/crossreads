 4/12/17 Mt. Kemmell. Locre &amp; Bailleul Training of raiders and bombers. Some tiny flakes of snow were falling during the morning. Colonel Brazenor and Savage were round during the morning. After lunch rode into Bailleul to see the dentist of 6th. F Amb. and got an impression taken. Roads &amp; cobbles very slippery. A good number of people about in there. Before entering the town we pass an aerodrome and a religious institution of some kind with nuns about it. Our chaps are getting very slack about their saluting again and want tuning up. Furphey that we are not going into the line work &amp; the 5th. &amp; 7th. Bdes. will go into the front line. Alderson received word to report to the India Office for his commission in the Indian Army. We drank his good health and wished him good luck before we sent off this good old original officer.
