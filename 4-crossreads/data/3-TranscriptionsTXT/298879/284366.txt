April 1915Monday 26Fighting still very briskFine  dayIndians landing with mountain batteries to help us as we had no guns to help us against the Turks shrapnel so far, Our losses are heavy. The enemies losses are unknown but they are being pushed back. Snipers are doing much damage to our men. They are fair shots. The Batts. & Bgds are all mixed up now. The N. Zealanders have fought with us all through.
Tuesday 27Weather grand still with very cool nights. Navy still helping us. Our Coy. Com, Captain Concanon killed while leading his men in a bayonet charge. The Brigadier & Major Irving the Brigade Major have been shot dead. Our heroic Col. (Braund) saved a grave situation in the evening with his Reg. (or what was left of it) and one machine gun. He was cool and fearless.
