<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>Sunday again, and a big mail is expected in tomorrow so I&#39;ll start this now out here on out post where we have been all day. This letter is from no-man&#39;s land, but its a much better palce than you would expect it to be - you see the lines here curve away from one another for a bit, so we come out to watch Jhonnie and as we are in a good place where he cant see us, we have a very quiet peaceful time. Two signallers come out each day, and the same two caome every second day so we are able to keep cooking utensils etc out here and live very high. To day wehad porrige cold meat and bacon for breakfast - for dinner</p>
