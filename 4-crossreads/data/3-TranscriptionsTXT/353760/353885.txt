 March 15 a lovely extravagant Gothick church, some of the interior designings of doors and windows very lovely:  I think it would be Italian design partly. 
 220. Posted home books of Versailles and of Musee de Cluny and half of Post Cards of Notre Dame &ndash; bought about 190 in all, or 'full' set. 
 230. The harlots of the Olympia parades disappointing beyond writing.  Gaiety of their affectation is charming if well carried out, but half heartedly as it is, mean and piteous.  Those who fail in the house and on the promenades during the shows urgently seek company on the boulevards, and somehow the agony of their failure seems to pass to you as they flaunt their sex. 
 Licentiousness in the abstract is charming:  in the [indecipherable] horrible. 
 The very expression of these women repels and physically nauseates:  somehow it is difficult to find beauty where a hunger lives behind. 
 One contradicted her deep crepe mourning veil with white rouged cheeks, black eye, and a long cigarette between vermilion lips. 
 March 16 231. This morning to the Musee Gugerli Galleria:  there an Exposition D'Art Decoratif, disappointing, but some fine exhibits, made some rough sketch notes on cover of Saturday's Evening Post.  A fine cover design by Legdendecker [Leyendecker], through the Champs a Elyee, dinner at Hotel, and out again.  To Smiths and bought two Erskine McDonald books of verse, a book of English Cathedrals by Bond, and Thomas Burke's "Limehouse Nights", to be sent on to the Ambulance.  Later bought there a Riccardo and a Florentine Press book &ndash; "The Heroes", 72F. and "Little Towns of Flanders", 18.50. 
 To the Opera, Faust, good singing and a fine Ballet. 
 Our last night in wounderful bed sheets, we're to leave tomorrow at 5.30, meeting at Place de Concorde for Fontainbleu.  Great Expectations.
