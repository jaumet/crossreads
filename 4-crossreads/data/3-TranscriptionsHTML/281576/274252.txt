<p>Arrival in hospital</p>
<p>Sun. July 29 (cont)  We boarded the train at about 6.30 pm.  The orderly gave us a cup of cocoa &amp; some Bread &amp; Butter. Then he handed round the cigarettes.  It is quite comfortable on the Hosp. Train.  The Nurses came round &amp; the M.O. asked us if we were comfortable.  We left C.C.S. about 10.  Arrived Rouen  about 4 a.m.</p>
<p><strike>Tues</strike> July 30. Monday  <br/>Were met by motor char-a-bancs &amp; taken to No 5 Gen. Hospital.  <br/>Here we were given a clean change of clothes &amp; the Hospital suit of Blue, with white shirt &amp; red kerchief Tie.  Had Break. Porridge, Bread &amp; Butter.<br/>Then we had a good bath &amp; put on our clean clothes.  There are plenty of Nurses about &amp; they all seem very nice.  They brought us round Cigarettes, 5 per man &ndash; per day.  After Dinner the Doctor came round &amp; gave us all a thorough examination.  My Temp. is quite normal &ndash; worse luck.  The nurses are very nice &amp; will have a yarn, if they are not too busy.  That's twice today I've said the nurses are nice, but really news are so scarce that one must repeat ones sayings occasionally but its quite true that the nurses are nice.</p>
