 17 January, 1916 Cairo I am at present waiting at the dentists in Cairo to see about my plate, it does not fit too well. I put in for a pass last night &amp; they said I could get one alright from 3 oclock. We had to go on mounted parade with all gear up ready to move off at 2.30 &amp; the[y] marched us out to the desert &amp; back again, it was 3.45 when we got back. I felt like blowing them up as I wanted to catch the 3.38 train &amp; had to be here in daylight however I went to the Station &amp; got a train at 4.40 which served alright. Every thing is packed ready to go off &amp; we are wondering whether we will do a route march only or get a move on to-morrow &ndash; The front of Shephards Hotel is crowded with officers. The garrys are rolling along filled with people coming into town
