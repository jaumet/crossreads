 Am feeling better, much to my relief. 
 Arthur Gray called on me with Red Cross Sergt.  Had a chat about home &amp; the war.  He had received no letters beyond a couple from Clara.  Gave him 6 pkts cigs, 2 tins bloater, 2 lemonade powders, 1 pkt tobacco, as he had been short.  I was glad of his call; it is indeed refreshing to come into contact with one so closely connected with home.  I live a pretty solitary life here &ndash; no pals, no one to chat with as they are mostly N.Z's &amp; complete strangers to me.  Beyond a good day salute &amp; the usual formal talk connected with my work with those around me, I have little distraction.  It's a long day &ndash; I am awake at 6.30 &amp; go on duty not later than 8 am.  9.30 pm is my average hour of knocking off &amp; there is nothing to do but to creep into one's dug-out &amp; try to sleep.  My active brain does not give me much peaceful sleep however.  Each night I am visited with grotesque dreams of vivid variety but little coherence &amp; in the morning I awake with a thick head &amp; no remembrance of the fantasies of the night. 
 8 pm &ndash; Seem to have entirely recovered from yesterday's sickness.  Hope recovery is permanent.

 Mab says in her  first  letters she has been expecting another letter from me every day.  She does not realise I was on the water right up to the 26th July  when  on
