at intervals when the firing got heavy, but something went wrong & some of them would not drop, result was that the firing increased & drew larger stuff. This was not the desired effect, & as they would not drop we turned our own machine guns on to them, we were afraid that the enemy would discover the hoax. We had some casualties over it & one officer badly wounded.Fritz is throwing a lot of gas over, two of our H Q runners got some of it the other day. Effect was a very dry feeling at the throat & smarting of the nostrils, making them want to pull their nose off, they did not think that they had it bad, but were given two days rest, free of duty. However they both got worse on the second day, one went to hospital, the other whose leave was due, left for England.
