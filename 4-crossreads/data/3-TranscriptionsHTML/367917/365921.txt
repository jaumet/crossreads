<p>Houses.</p>
<p>We are about &frac12; mile from the other offices &amp; incidentally from my medical outfit. I am not looking forward to walking in &amp; out when the rain commences as I am no great walker, at any time. But we are free from bugs etc and from mosquitoes &ndash; the houses are full of the latter.</p>
<p>This is a great place for water. A large canal runs from the lake &ndash; about 7 miles S of Homs. through the town and empties further N into the Orontes River. Every house has its well &ndash; all good water except that it is contaminated by the inevitable filthy habits of the Arab population.</p>
<p>Last night a cloud burst occurred somewhere up in the hills and a torrent of water came down a wadi &ndash; previously dry &amp; literally swamped the town out. I could not get in from here for some hours this morning &amp; when I did get across after it went down somewhat I found the streets under water in many places.</p>
<p>It is still running but almost petered out this evening</p>
