  
 To live in - to get as good a meal as we used to get at Harper's for 1/- you have to pay half a crown here; in fact I'd rather have Harper's because you get sencible tucker there and here everything is cooked in Olive oil which I do hate. There was an Indian fortune teller there so John and I each had our fortunes told - I cant say I believe in him but it is simply marvellous how they can read character and can tell you things that have happened to you before, I know he astonished both of us. He told me that something unusually lucky was going to happen to me in March 1917 so I am waiting to see what it is; Miss Stirling will be interested in this; you can tell her that I'm always going round now looking at my hand just like her and when ever I do it I think of her and cant help laughing; the way we used to tease her about it! Oh! Rubbish!! I suppose you will be shearing at home by now and I hope that you and Father are not working too hard: I often get Hal's photograph of the shed and yards and imagine I'm at the house and watching the boys bring sheep up and can hear the engine going - My word would not I like to be pressing up the wool this year again. The wool ought to be pretty good; wonder what Father expects for it? I saw a good many Fords at Port Said and had a good look at them all as they all seemed to have some conection of home some how. Bill West & Dick Dawson got two bonzar parcels from home so we have had another feed and are looking forward to your parcel which ought to come in a day or two. Hope every thing is going well at home; you will be cutting the wheat when you get this Love to Father and yourself Mother dear Your loving son Robert C. Wilson
