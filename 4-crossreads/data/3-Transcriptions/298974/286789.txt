<p>3<br/>he was ill in bed. I told him by wire about poor old Alan but I have not had a reply yet. Olly will be awfully upset. I would like very much to see him this weekend, and will certainly try. Tommy's address; Cpl. R. Thompson. H.Q. A.I.F., Bhurtpore Barracks, Tidworth Hants. England. The one you gave me is an old one. He is near Olly &amp; I want to see him this weekend. I have been made a full Sergeant again, one of the boys, a very nice chap too, but not a particularly brilliant soldier, having been reduced to Corporal. I had a letter from Fatty Penfold from France, very jovial as usual. In London I saw Goog Tyson who is now a Captain in the 3rd Btn. He is easily 6' 3" high and looks very well tho' wounded. His last of Cairns Niven &amp; Noel was all O.K. I do hope so.</p>

Some do not thoroughly understand the copious exemptions and as they leave brothers to support their families they don't feel inclined to have them sent over.
