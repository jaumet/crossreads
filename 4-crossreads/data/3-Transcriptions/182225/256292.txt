<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; THURSDAY 22&nbsp;&nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>Another muggy day. We had our full dress parade in morning; or rather a full dress farce, as we get into full marching order and kit at our tables for about 5 minutes &amp; then get into fatigue dress again. Had a lecture on Semaphore signalling before dinner from M<sup>r</sup> Neylan. Had a buzzer practice in the afternoon for a little time.</p>
