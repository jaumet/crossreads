puts in a word.  After tea we went over to aviation corps to a concert.  It was splendid.  The opening singer sang "Somewhere a voice is calling".  Never have I heard anything so fine.  One of the sheds were emptied of planes & filled with men, cheers rang for 5 mins. or more.  The boys not wanting anyone else than --- one of England's best singers they say.  He returned & sang "Nearer my God to thee".  We encored again & again until he came back - sang "A long, long trail".  By this time the boys went wild & no wonder.  He surpassed anything I have heard.
