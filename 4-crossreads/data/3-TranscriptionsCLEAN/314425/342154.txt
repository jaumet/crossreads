All day yesterday & this morning an enemy big gun is shelling the main road on our right. This morning a Battery of big guns pulled in along side of us and they will be sure to draw the enemy fire. They are 6 in.Bill Wilson & G Dodd returned from leave on Friday Aug 9. & the two Haynes went on leave on Thursday Aug 8. This is the first Blighty leave for them.Our artillery is using the enemies guns and ammunition against them. This evening I had a unique experience. I carried up 3 6 in shells set the fuse, loaded the gun and fired two of them at a village occupied by the enemy. A. Homes fired the third shot. In all 17 shots were fired at this target when I was there. They were all armour piercing shells.
