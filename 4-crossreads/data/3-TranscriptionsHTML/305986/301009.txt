<p>bye. The 32nd Batt, came out of the line today been in for three weeks, in the front 9 days, we were in 18 days but it seems its getting worse. They hopped over once and went looking for Fritz's, couldnt find any and went on and got spread around the landscape by our own artillery, 30 came back. Our officers went to have a doppo at the line today so we will be going in shortly. 14.12.16 Lord Im tired not in a physical sense just mentally. Fed up I guess would be a better</p>
