<p>Smith boiled some water on the stove of the house near our hayshed, I went in to see if the woman would fry us some potatoes, &amp; it was funnier than a circus, trying to make a bargain. She couldn&#39;t speak English, I could speak enough French to tell her what I wanted, but when she rattled out her answers, she had me. I told her we wanted fried potatoes for 4. She poured water in a saucepan to imitate boiling the spuds, &amp; pointed to the fat in the pan &amp; said it was &quot;tres chere&quot;, but finally I got her to cut up some spuds and fry them for a franc. To show how well we made ourselves understood by each other, I learned that her husband is wounded through the head &amp; in hospital at Paris, she is 32 years old &amp; has 1boy &amp; 1girl. We had bully beef, fried potatoes &amp; tea. In the stall next door some French kiddies are playing, &amp; fowls are scratching on the straw in our billet. We made some tea again at tea-time.
