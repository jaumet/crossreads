It is funny to hear our chaps trying to learn a smattering of French but I get it confused with Arabic.I believe my star is lucky because we have come in a very dangerous voyage have so far been O.K. although what France has in store for us no one can say.

We reached Marseilles about 11 pm last night anchored in the outer Harbour. This morning we came in tied up at a pier.The Coast for miles round is thickly populated and as far as Toulon it is one great big shipping centre. The costumes of the French Sailors and Soldiers is very picturesque. There seems to be many great big buildings churches but as yet I have not been ashore, so will write about it when I go throughWe got news of the big Russian Victory also of Lord Kitcheners deathWe are now awaiting orders to tranship the Horses baggage so I will be up to my eyes in it directly.
