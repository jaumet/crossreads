I am right as rain.9th. Here we are at 3.30. A.M. & lying just outside the boom at Southampton waiting for the port to open so as we can get in, was rather surprised to find that I stood the little trip well, have not felt the slightest bit sick, the ship was crowded & I slept on a sort of counter which had been overlooked in the crush.Landed at 7. & struck off for the town to get some breakfast, got in to a restaurant, & had the following a minute piece of bread, & still smaller ration of butter, cup of coffee, fillet of plaice, small piece of steak & chips, we got the shock of our lives when they made the bill up, 4/- each, well you could have knocked me down
