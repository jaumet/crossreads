Received word today that things are looking rather serious in Australia, it is asserted that several places in Sydney had narrow escapes from being burnt down the the I.W.W.'s &amp; that all the workers in <strike>Australia</strike> N.S.W. have decided to go on strike if the men who were called up for home defence are not liberated, needless to say practically everyone here is disgusted, &amp; the men in Australia would be flattered if they could only hear a few of the remarks made about them &amp; Patriotic Australia; Innoculated against Cholera again this afternoon</p>
