 I made very excellent meals the last two evenings cooked by myself.  Yesterday's dinner menu was 
 Fried bacon &amp; Fried bread Toast Marmalade &amp; Swiss milk Tea &ndash; Egyptian Cigarette 
 Today's ran as follows 
 Fried Bacon Fried Bread Corned Beef Fried in Bacon fat Cabbages (machon ochies) Toast Swiss milk Tea - Egyptian Cigarette 
 Not so bad in fact.  I enjoy cooking &amp; eating these meals more than any others.  One has to live absolutely for the moment here or else one would die of melancholia.
