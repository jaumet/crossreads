My dearest Father,You will be pleased to hear that I am up again & am getting about slowly after my operation.  They transferred me from Rouen to the above address on Sat Monday last, & the Hospital boat we crossed the Channel on was the "Wondilla" who used to be on the Australian-Tasmania run   She is fitted up splendidly & is very comfortable   The doctor gave me an overhaul the day after I came in & said I was progressing satisfactorily   I got up yesterday for the first time & feel alright other than a terrible looseness in the head.  We are having awful weather at present.  The electric lights in the ward are on all day on account of the heavy fogs outside which make it pitch dark   Needless to say it is very cold & miserable, but the ward is nice & warm so that we don't notice it so much.The nurses & sisters are very good to us here & do anything they can to help us
