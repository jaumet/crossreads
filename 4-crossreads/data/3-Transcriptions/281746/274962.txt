<p>sailed.</p>
<p>Oct. 21st<br/>When we awoke the next morning there were rugged hills on either side of us.  The sea is very calm.<br/>Food is very plentiful on board.  On hospital duty again.</p>
<p>Oct. 22nd<br/>Awoke this morning and found that there was no land to be seen.<br/>We have struck three squalls to-day.  The rain fell, the lightening flashed, the thunder rolled and the wind blew terrific.  Suddenly the sky cleared and things brightened up a bit only to come on again during the night.<br/>The weather has been exceedingly hot since we left Suez.  The Officer in Charge of the ship is making life unbearable.  It is Parade, Parade, Parade never ending parades.</p>
<p>Oct. 24th<br/>Concert to-night.<br/>Hospital full up with sick.  Chatting their shirts is a favourite pastime amongst the troops on board.<br/>Plenty of books aboard.  They have been provided by the Red Cross and the Y.M.C.A.<br/>There being no intoxicating liquors aboard the effect of this is seen in the quiet behaviours of the men.  The crew seems a very decent</p>
