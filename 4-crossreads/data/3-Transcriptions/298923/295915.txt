<p>6 September 1918 Friday   (Whole page crossed out)<br/>Censored   Wrote 8 letters including Joe- it will certainly be a good experience for him &amp; a pity he was not younger.  Am keeping fit with 2 Baths a day in spring water here,   Joe has been away 3 months now.  How time goes-   I hope he gets back inside his 6 mns leave.<br/>Australasians arrived many thanks, with Pastoral Times enclosed-</p>
