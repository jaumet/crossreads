BOULOGNE[21st   Sept. contd]civilisation on a large scale that I had seen since leaving England in Novr last.  We actually saw an electric tram, gliding along full of humanity & some pretty humanity included  & felt quite at home again.  Passing thro a very fashionable quarter we arrived at the Quay and saw myriads of masts & it was indeed a picture.  Some French sailors - some pretty visitors - nurses, wounded boys etc all thrown in made the picture complete.  Next came the ocean itself & what a relief it was after feasting our eyes on desolation.  Quite Manly-like.
Passing the beach we got on the hill on northern side of town & could see miles & miles up the coast and almost to our surprise we could see that in spite of the Huns boasting of 'U' Boats, I could see shipping going on apparently just the same.  The surf was not quite as big as our beaches but showed promise the beach as I remember it not as big as Manly or Coogee.  The surroundings were highly colored & looked like a fair land.  Our car stopped on hill for a while to give us a chance to visit the Exped Canteen & take in the surroundings.
