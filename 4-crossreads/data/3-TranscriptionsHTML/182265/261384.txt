<p>On <u>23rd</u> we marched from Caestre to Reninghelst, a long wearisome march and arrived at Reninghelst at 4.30pm. Camped in tents that night. A very stormy wet night. The next day 24/10/17 we went into huts &amp; billets in Reninghelst. We messed at Officers&#39; Restaurant, managed by Belgian women. Here we had plenty of omelettes - each egg about a franc. I bought 30 francs worth of Clunes &amp; Torchon Lace for Jay. We were bombed here each night but luckily none fell on our quarters. We left Reninghelst at 5am 27/Oct &amp; marched to a siding near <u>Vlamertinghe</u>. Here we were issued with rum &amp; as we had had no breakfast &amp; had just had a long 5 mile march, it soon made everyone talk.</p>
<p>Some men collared two jars of rum. These could not be found by the officers looking for them - naturally in crowded carriages. Hence we had a great many very drunk when we&nbsp;detrained near St. Omer,</p>
