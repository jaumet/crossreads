  
 17/5/17 Bouzincourt 
 the street is the chateau. Fine gates surmounted by a coat of arms and a grand old building behind - one wing in ruin. A glimpse of  lovely old garden and many rows of trees so delicately green. Green, green, and restful loveliness everywhere. Through Millencourt - a neat little place - to Warloy which is entered by a tortuous winding road with a delightful avenue of blossoming fruit trees - a sight not to be forgotten quickly. A nice little town is Warloy - very clean and some good houses. Went to Bde H.Q. and had a talk with the General and arranged some Court Martial business with Colonel Watson. The latter is very comfortably installed, broached some Burgundy and talked in his usual way. A good billet. Rode home through this lovely scenery and war seemed a long way off. Reaching Bouzincourt found the streets full of soldiers many half tight. Much loud argument. A reaction after hardship, sex starvation & enforced temperance. Let us not forget these men have been through Hell and took the Hindenburg line.
