The NileThe Nile is the 2nd longest continuous waterway in the world.  From the Ripon Falls at Lake Victoria to the sea it is 3473 miles long & the last water it receives is from the R. Atbara 1900 miles from the sea.As Practically no rain falls in Egypt (about 1/2 inch per annum) so as a fertile country it would cease to exist were it not for the Nile.  The height of the inundation is regulated by the rains in Abyssinia - the river begins to rise in June
