<p>Dear Mother,<br/>Since I received the bundle of letters dated in April and May, a couple of weeks ago I have not had any more home mail. I am thankful to say that I am getting on splendidly and am feeling as fit as can be, and I hope all of you are enjoying good health at home. This is a very nice time of the year in England, and we are having exceptionally fine weather. I am just beginning to know Oxford now and have made a few acquaintances, but there isn't much time to go</p>
