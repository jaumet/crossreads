Friday 18 February, 1916
Had two trips over to the right half of the 20th Batt for another gun & tripod, we saw some fine desert scenery round Australia Hill.
In the evening we moved camp & I was put in a different tent to Mac & Bernie, it feels strange being away from them.
Two of our chaps, "Sis" Ellis & Bingham had a fight, Bingham won. It is the first fight we have had in the M.G.S.
