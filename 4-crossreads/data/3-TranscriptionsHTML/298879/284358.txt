<p>April 1915<br/>Saturday 10<br/>Weather still dull<br/>Lots of chaps have been ashore. They say that the Hospital tents are very full. Nearly all the patients have pneumonia they say. The town or village has a few shops but looks like a <u>"has-been"</u>. The women all wear shawls. The price of all things being judged by the price of beer, they say that beer is 3 piastres per bottle. Many French soldiers are here. They have a long thin, three cornered bayonet &amp; a long rifle.</p>
<p>Sunday 11<br/>Woke up about 7 P.M. Had a wash under the salt water tap. Hydroplane from one of the warships did a short flight over the water &amp; then lighted on the water near the warship. Cold Southerly blowing. Had a church parade forrard. The Dean of Sydney (Dean Talbot) preached at the C. of E parade ground. Rained heavily last night. Some of our chaps went for a row round the various troopships. Weather fine.</p>
