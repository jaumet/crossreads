<p>May, 1916<br/>Monday 29<br/>on the first 5.30 am Parade we start squadding &amp; I get a class of seven officers, which is the biggest piece of luck I have had yet.</p>
<p>Tuesday 30<br/>Am going to have an easy time this course.  All my officers have some knowledge of the gun &amp; require very little explanation.<br/>Weather takes a turn for the heat again</p>
