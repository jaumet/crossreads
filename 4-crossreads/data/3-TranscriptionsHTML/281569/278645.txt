<p>Revielle at 5.15</p>
<p>Teed up at 5.30 &amp; had breakfast at 6. Boot &amp; saddle at 6.30, the boys then trek out 5 miles to a large palm grove where the horses are to be kept during the heat of the day. I went out at lunch time &amp; took their dinners out. The day was frightfully hot &amp; I got burnt some whilst riding.</p>
<p>The aviation people have got an aerodrome fixed up about 2 miles N of our camp &amp; machines have been up all day.</p>
<p>Have had another attack of fever or rather the after effects &amp; am now not feeling too good, went over to the Doctors but I only got pills &amp; I don't think lead &amp; opium is much good for counter-acting fever.</p>
<p>Turned in  at 9.30.</p>
