<p>regimental  stable parade on the battle field, never heard of such a thing. A general muster parade at 9 A.M. then harness cleaning, and after that inoculation, second dose.<br/>A 6 inch shell landed 100 yards in front of Battery, bounced about 20 yards, and then burst, a most extraordinary thing. It was a high explosive, and strange to say no one wounded, and no damage done. A French aeroplane broke one of its skids on landing. The Turks put in about 50 shells, and the nearest went 200 yards off of it, of course it landed on the sky line. The Naval baloon is up, 6.P.M. a warship is blazing away, putting shots the other side of Krethia village<br/>31/8/1915<br/>Very quiet today, A few large time bursts. Visited the R.N.D.  Q.M. Sgt, got 80 lbs of flour also a pair of slacks. A few shots over last evening. I am thinking that the new French division camped where the R.N.D. were, will get cut up in pieces<br/>1/9/1915<br/>Another month gone and we are still at Gallipoli, Cape Helles. A dirty windy day. A harness inspection carried out yesterday</p>
