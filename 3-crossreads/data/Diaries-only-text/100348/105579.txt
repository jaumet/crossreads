searching for the range. Dirt flew over us in showers. We all breathed easier when he got set, though showers of debris came over us continually. He shelled everything in the vincinity but the guns were not put out of action. It was laughable to see the gunners scampering away from their position. A liberty the infantry do not possess.

Not so many shells today a few fell about. Went up to releive the front line this evening. The releif was carried out swimmingly and without hitch. In my section of the line I occupy a dugout, measuring 6ft by 2ft with Wallace. Thanks to our labours during the previous weeks the line is in exellent repair. There was a thunder storm this evening.
