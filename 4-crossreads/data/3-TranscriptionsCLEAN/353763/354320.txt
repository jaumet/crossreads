  
 Sunday Nov 8  - 14  I'll just narrate the sequence of events up to noon  -  At 5.30  we were to go alongside & take in water  -  We got under weigh & then got orders to go back to our old position  -  We did so & anchored  -  Immense fuming on the Captain's part  -  At 10 we heard that Patterson was to go inboard the Parramatta & the P & Warrego & AE2 to proceed to Sydney & we to remain where we were  -  At 10 .30 we saw - from the deck of the Upolu - the Pta  & Wg  & AE2 steam out of the harbor - bound for Sydney  -  Immense & loudly expressed disgust by Captain & Chief Officer  -  Silence by everyone else  -   It is said  the original idea was - for the Upolu to join up this convoy & if we were slow AE2 wd go into Noumea  -  Let her men go ashore & then wait till we came up  - 
 Well it's the other wy  & now here we all are waiting for fresh orders  -  Its glorious weather & all is well on board  -  I am as you see shorn of both my Submarines - one lost - the other leaky & must be docked & overhauled before she dives anymore  -  You people will wonder where we are if its generally known that AE2 is at Garden Island  -
