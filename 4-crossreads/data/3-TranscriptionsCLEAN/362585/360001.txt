miserable when he first got back to the field, but (in a later letter) he says he has got into the life again, feels all the better for the little break, and, little as he may say, he must be in the thick of things now - if only he may come through it, poor boy.
Keith says you write telling him what he wants most to hear - about his dear ones of course.  I wish it were in my power to tell them all they must long to hear about him.  Many will try to do that, yet never give them news enough about him.  He looked in the best of health.
The old General had just time to tell me on Saturday how Arthur Ferguson was with him when he was killed, and how he had taken Keith as his A.D.C., when we were interrupted.
In another letter (by last mail) my cousin tells of Keith taking her to a theatre she adds "as I didn't approve of the way these boys spend enormous sums on taxis, I insisted on a motor bus which took us near the theatre.  Keith was astonished at the way I piloted him through the labyrinth of darkened streets and said he was quite 'bushed' - I think that was the expression."
So you see that, thanks to Keith and my nephews, she will be able to understand the Australian language, when she arrives!
Kindest regards to the Judys and Dorothy.
Yours very sincerelyDowell O'Reilly
[Margin note]  Please don't trouble about answering this - it is just in place of last Friday's visit, and I shall see you the first Friday after your return, if I may.
