<p>We ran a draw for second place.</p>
<p>Saturday. 14.9.18<br/>Demonstration of cooperation of infantry weapons. Most interesting &amp; instructive. Left at 11am &amp; walked to Rue for train to Boulougne. Rained when we got to Boulougne &amp; didn't stop till Sunday morning. Hardaker &amp; I strolled around a bit. Had dinner at the club &amp; then did some more strolling. Met Os. Charlton &amp; had a good old talk of Sydney days. He goes on leave tomorrow to Blighty.</p>
<p>Sunday 15.9.18.<br/>Went to church. Gee it is the first time for years. Took communion too. Real bonny day. Had all our meals at the club. Lunch at the new one &amp; the others at the old one. Get served quicker there (by french  girls while the new one is by Waacs.) &amp; went out to the Dublin Rest Camp in the afternoon &amp; saw some boxing. Bandsman Rice &amp; Jimmy Drison</p>
