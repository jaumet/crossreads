Glad you gave me your exam results.  They are jolly good and you ought to do all right in November.  I will be thinking about you, and wishing you all sorts of luck.  (Hope you will be able to read this, my pen has run dry, and I can't write with a frowzy pencil.)
Sorry you did not get my letter about being wounded.  I have it all in the diary however which you will see some day.
Laughed when I read that Mother's friend, the Folly-Pointer had taken over the Salon de Luxe.  She's a fair goer.
Mother has written that you are just it, Mick since I have been away.  Keep it up son, and you will make me feel happy with regard to the Mater being looked after well.
You have probably heard about our advance on & around Aug. 6th.  I will not give any details as you will probably have read of the doings of the 13th Batt. ere you get this.  I was fortunate enough to have taken part in the big operations, and had a fairly exciting as well as a trying time.
No more news.  I have received letters from Kath Begbie, Myra, Enid Chandler
