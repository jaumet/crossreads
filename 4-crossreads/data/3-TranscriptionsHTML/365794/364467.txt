<p>Wednesday 7 March 1917 [6 March 1918]<br/>With 15 empty beds our ward is hopelessly quiet &amp; consequently Sister Peile fusses more &amp; more.  We nearly came to blows as regards "words" today but I remained outwardly quiet &amp; calm &amp; she cools off.  Bridge 3 to 4 p.m. &amp; tea provided by S. Major Blair.  Town 5 p.m. &amp; happy evening at A.S. [Australian Soldiers] Club whist drive, took S. Reid &amp; she won "booby", home 11.30 p.m. with Mr. Andrews &amp; Mr. C., nice boys all of them.</p>
