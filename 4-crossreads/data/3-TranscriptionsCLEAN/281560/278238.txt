We must have taken an enormous number of prisoners or something to cause the shortage. 16/4/16. Went to the training ground that our boys have nicknamed the "Bull Ring". An English Office took the company over and put us through our paces. I think we surprised him. Troop trains pass continually on the line to Bolougne. Some New Zealanders passed today. My company was passed as efficient today in the list at the Bull Ring, and do not need further instruction. This is rather a feather in our caps. But we will have to supply Guards etc.
