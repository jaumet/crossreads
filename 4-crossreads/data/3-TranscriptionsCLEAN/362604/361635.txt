  
 it sounds as if only one man was playing a huge organ. 
 Next day I travelled around London Bridge, St. Paul's, Lambeth Bridge & Westminster, Whitehall & St. James Park.  I saw a procession of women farm hands going through the Park up to be viewed by the Queen.  They all dress like men & look so funny "all a-- & pockets" like this [see image for drawing]. 
 Well, Mum, it is getting on to supper time & I'll have to get it ready.  I'll write a few lines to Dad & George after supper.  Best wishes to all the Neighbours, Mrs. Stephen, Bunting & Annie Dobson.
