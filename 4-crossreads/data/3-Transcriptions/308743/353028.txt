<p>The Australian Divisions took up the offensive at 2000 &amp; succeeded in gaining ground off Brown's Dip, the Turks with a severe counter in which they lost heavily got it back, the losses must have been 2 to 1 in favor of us, Fritz &amp; his brother have been over paying us a visit regularly lately but he needs heaps of practice in bomb dropping for his shots were falling in the Turks lines as often as in ours the Russians are reported to be making a stand at last but they must have got the worst of it in the last three wks of fighting, Gen Joffe paid a visit to the Italian Frontier &amp; found everything satisfactory Our submarines have been active again in the Sea of Marmara sinking more transports &amp; another destroyer The 2nd in command of 215 swam ashore &amp;undertook to blow up a bridge single handed he only partially succeeded after running the gauntlet &amp; having to swim for it at the last.  Throat getting sore [indecipherable] again I'm afraid off duty for tonight</p>
<p>9 September 1915<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Had rather a bad night &amp; throat a little worse but that didn't stop Hal &amp; I making 3 good meals off the canteen stores, paid a visit to Anzac in the afternoon &amp; things are very busy there, especially in the ammunition line, this points to a further engagement shortly, they are establishing our Winter base under the Sphinx &amp; with Railways out to the piers the stuff is just pouring in &amp; will have to to for the gales are expected to start any day now.  The Turks have been giving us hell with their artillery lately &amp; they have kept the ball rolling today especially in the region of the Sap where the Indians have been in a habit of taking the mules outside instead of in &amp; consequently have fallen in over it, the 7th Brigade are expected to land tonight &amp; to come up tomorrow they relieve the men who are going to [indecipherable] for a fortnight's spell then they in their turn relieve others until everyone has had his turn.  Wally Moore paid us another visit</p>
