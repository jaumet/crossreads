<p>May 1916<br/>Meditteranean Sea<br/>31st   We have passed numerous ships to-day &amp; yesterday, some with convoys, both British &amp; French.  We have no convoy yet but have passed four or five warships since we left.  At night all lights are shaded &amp; none are to be seen outside at all.  We passed Malta about 10 P.M. on our Starboard side about 5 miles away.<br/>1st June.  We passed Cape Spartivento (Sardinia) about 5 P.M. &amp; are on a N.N.W. course, but still zig-zagging about as we have been doing since we left Alexandria.  Later at night we changed our course to W.S.W.</p>
