<p>30 December 1916<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Easy night, few casualties  Nothing doing specially.</p>
<p>Sunday     Dec. 31</p>
<p>The last day of the old year.<br/>Go on duty at 8 p.m. We see the old year out &amp; new year in in rather pensive mood. Gathered round a smokey brazier. At midnight we drink each others health in Port &amp; whack up a couple of Xmas parcels. Continue duties till morning. No fusilade of shells to welcome in the New Year. Just the usual desultory firing</p>
