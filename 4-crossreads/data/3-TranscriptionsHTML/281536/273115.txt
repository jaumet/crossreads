<p>1/8/19 Cape Town<br/>To get here we passed through some fine residential streets. The hotel is well situated &amp; has good grounds and in the lounge were many foreigners &ndash; Dutch, Italians, French. This hotel was famous during the S.A. War and was cleared out by Kitchener who stripped all hangers on there back to England on one occasion. Saw General Ravenshaw who was in mufti &amp; about to go out golfing. Though at first brusque and disinclined to talk I pressed him enough to induce him to talk for half an hour and complained about the port authorities messing us up. From here through quiet streets to the boat. No trams at all on account of a strike make the town look</p>
