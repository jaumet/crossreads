<p>Tuesday 14 September, 1915</p>
<p>Very dull &amp; cold. Very lively artillery duel, our guns firing about 6 times to the Turks one. We got a burst of shrapnel on our hill from goodness knows where as the Turks can never get a shell there it must have been a badly timed shell from out own guns.</p>
<p>Have had a long guard to do, have been on duty 4 out of 18 hours it is too much as we have to go on fatigue work, carrying water when we came off.</p>
<p>We are getting all this extra work because so many men are sick.</p>
