[Saturday 25 November 1916]
Still anchored at Salonika, went ashore for an hour, it is a pretty town of many colors filled with a Cosmopolitan crowd of Soldiers & Cut-throats.  A big Roman Wall & Tower show the old City now surrounded by Tents Stores Haneaks & Soldiers-  Olympus is covered with a Cloud like Table Mountain & mule tracks lead over the mountains-( Following paragraph is crossed out)Police are everywhere & it is not wise to express your opinions  Many gunboats in the Harbour have their guns trained on the town a Hostile Plane flew over but did not drop any bombs- as usual all lights are out & we are not allowed to even have a Concert in the Saloon
