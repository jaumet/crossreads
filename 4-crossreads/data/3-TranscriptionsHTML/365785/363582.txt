<p>I have not been in Cairo since the end of June last so can't give you much news from that society centre.  I don't see much hope of ever getting to Cairo again.  Some say [place crossed through] is our next place for leave but it seems doubtful to me.  Anyway I think we are secure in the desert for some months to come yet though I do hope we don't have to put another <strike>winter</strike> summer in here.  The weather now is truly beautiful but another summer out here in the desert would just about be the limit.<br/>Ned Bartels is with this Brigade as a Sergeant in the Engineers.  He is keeping well &amp; has plenty to do.<br/>Well Mrs Read, I must thank you again very much for the parcel &amp; with kind remembrances to Dr. Read &amp; best love for the children.</p>
<p>Believe me<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>Jack Robinson</p>
