12/8/17 Rouen
After a hot bath and a French petit dejeuner walked round the Rue Jean d?Arc to the Church of St Vincent which is a small church and not unlike St Giles Edinburgh. It is full of the most beautiful stained glass most of which like the church itself dates right back to the 12 13th century. Passed the Palais de Justice ? a rather plain and official place and walked down the old winding Rue de Ganterie to the Church of St Ouen a very large old church older than the Cathedral. Inside it has a bareness not being full of seats and is very high in the roof. There are no side chapels and the glass is mostly plain so the lighting is excellent. There are gardens at the back and from there the exterior looks very fine. A group of statuary ? a centaur taking off a woman. She resists and has her hand warding off his face which smiles in triumph. Adjoining is the Hotel de Ville and the gardens are very pleasant. Walked down now through more pleasant old fashioned streets to the Eglise Maclou a little Gothic church
