<p>9/9/18 Cappy</p>
<p>The Battalion formed up and was instructed by me at 9.15. Roused several people up. They then got on to cleaning their equipment. Walked round among them and watched the work. In the afternoon rode down to D.H.Q. and there saw [blotted out]. These staff lilies bore me to death. No doubt the feeling is reciprocal! After mess went to an excellent concert given by the 3rd Division  Coo-ees over at Suzanne.</p>
<p>10/9/18</p>
<p>A quiet and wet day. C. Brumby on his way to join 8th Bn came in and I phoned for Jack. We foregathered and had a pleasant yarn recalling old times. Great preparations for G.O.C's inspection on tomorrow &ndash; a Brigadier's inspection only. Our band played at mess. The rain made the camp roads &amp; the bivouacs most uncomfortable and wet.</p>
