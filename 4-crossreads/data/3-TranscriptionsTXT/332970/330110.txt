As far as can be judged, there is no answering fire & the pontoons laden with troops are effecting a landing without opposition. A little later: -  the bombardment has now ceased from the big guns though shrapnel is still bursting along the hill top.About dusk the firing again became very heavy, and it was a wonderful sight to see the hillside literally swept by shells, while the thundering of the big guns was almost intermittent. Troops were still going ashore in loads on Torpedo boats of which some half dozen are operating, and from the bridge came the report some were having a rough passage. We can't ascertain what return fire there is, but we could see several shells land between the boats going ashore, and several plumped into the water about 1/2 a mile shorewards of us, sending colomns of water into the air. About 11 pm, it is nearly our turn for a torpedo boat is alongside & we are standing by ready to go aboard, but I believe a lot of the real preliminary work has been done, and the hill is now occupied by our troops.
