<p>Decembre 4<br/>Went to Steenwerk &amp; Bailleul work shops &amp; try &amp; get some material. Most of the Section are still working on Corps Reserve &amp; Support defences wiring etc. Set-back near Cambrai has not been so serious although a fair lineup of [indecipherable] &ndash; some guns which were turned against us &amp; a good number of prisoners to the enemy.</p>
<p>Decembre 5<br/>Section nearly all out wiring. I have been in camp today just looking after a little <strike>more</strike> camp work. Haven't heard anything further from Cambrai.</p>
