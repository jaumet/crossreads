December 2959.The Col. back:  and expecting his arrival shortly on an inspection.  A cold grey day, and a quiet night last night:  hardly a gun fired and no bombs dropped hereabouts.
60.The first journal I ever kept was started after reading Ibsen's "Lady Inger of Ostrat" and I opened it with an attempt at Dramatic Criticism, with a reading of Schopenhaur essay on style - in a writing in my memory Schopenhaur at the time greatly impressed me, and all he had to say in writing pleased me as though I'd first said it myself.  And I read Walter Pater, it was the first of the Imaginary Portraits, and in the journal I wrote the last sentence of his Imaginary Portraits of Watteau's lover, the words appealed to me then as affecting myself, and now I think their truth was more than I then realised.  And tonight I feel lost in a melancholy I can't put aside, even the good books I have seem ridiculous and quite useless, the days are monotonous, the prospect of a change is as it was a year ago.  Tonight there's a rumour of the American planes having dropped bombs on one of the Rhone towns, & their success counts to over a thousand dead, hideous bloody horror dropped suddenly from nowhere and a thousand human bodies blown to tattered animal palpitating meat, bones in bodies that crunch quietly as they are moved aside, and naked grotesque revelling revelling in blood.  A machine callowness - the proud product of man.
