Went round to baths this morning and had bath and change. The Battery is split up again one [indecipherable] being about 2 miles away. Was out all afternoon establishing communication to there out near Le Bizet a village absolutely in ruins. Armentieres is knocked about a good deal in places and 50 civilians were killed a day or two ago.

Jackson, Dutch and myself came down to F.O.O. today for 3 days with Mr. McMullen. We are at Batt Hdqrs in what is left of a fine old home. The place was evidently left with all furniture as pieces of it are strewn everywhere As soon as the Bty started firing today Fritz got onto them and Norman Tayt was wounded and 2 engineers near by killed.
