  
 Letter No. 1 
 20th June '17 
 Dear Mother, 
 This is just a short note I am writing in case it gets posted back sooner than I expect.  I am getting on tip-top and keeping pretty well on the whole.  I had one day pretty sea-sick, the third day out but I got on all right after that.  It has been very rough ever since we left.  We have just come down from parade as the sea kept coming on deck and wetting every one.  A letter collector has just come round so I thought this might get you on the off chance earlier than I expected any would.  Ken has been pretty sick on it but is all right again now, pretty nearly everyone has been sick more or less although Corp Hosier has been one of the lucky ones and kept all right.  Things are pretty nasty here in wet weather as every one has to stay down below and the port holes have to be kept closed.  I suppose you have had Ida staying with you for the week end.  I was very glad to have that party at Liverpool before we left, so that I could see so many relations.  My air cushion has come in very handy.  We sleep in hammocks at night and find them very comfortable although we have a good deal of trouble in keeping the same hammocks every night as they have to be rolled up and put in a bin every day and at night every one grabs the first he can lay hands on.  We have a great supply of water laid on for washing and can have a hot salt water bath, fresh water shower and wash whenever we like, but I am afraid some men don't like very often.  A compulsory shower parade would be a good thing once a week or so.  We have a canteen on board but things are very dear excepting tobacco which is much cheaper than in Australia.  I was glad to see Father on the wharf when we left but sorry we got into Sydney so early.  Oh well, this letter is not supposed to be too big, so I will have to close this one.  I expect I will be repeating myself in some of my letters but they may not arrive together. 
 Best love to all and much to yourself and Father, Douglas

 Dear Mother, 
 I am starting a letter to you now but don't know when it will get posted.  We put out to sea about 2.30 Thursday and have been going ever since.  It came up windy and rough on Thursday night & has been the same ever since.  Nearly every one has been more or less sick, Ken has been pretty bad and is still down to it.  I was pretty bad yesterday afternoon but am all right now.  I think we are approaching the Bight now and therefore will get it much rougher soon.  Did you get the card I sent you before we left the Harbour?  I was very glad to see Father on the wharf but I am glad no one else was there.  We are in the stern of the boat and pretty crowded.  We sleep in hammocks which we hang up after tea and roll up at early morning parade before 7 a.m.  The men are allotted off to mess tables, 13 men and an N.C.O. in charge to each table.  I have charge of the table.  We have to get up at 6.15 a.m. and fall in for first parade at 6.30.  Breakfast comes on at 7 and we fall in again at 9.15.  Have dinner at 12 fall in again at 2 p.m. and dinner comes off at 5 p.m. but things are still pretty upside down and irregular.  There are a lot of Tasmanians on this boat and we met several Duntroon boys, amongst them is the boy in the snap with me that Les Read sent me from Duntroon.  We have passed several rocky islands this afternoon, but I don't know the names for sure but I think they must have been Flinder's Island.  This afternoon we have all been issued with head comforts and jack knives so we are all well set up now.  What do you think!  I left that writing wallet that Woody gave me at home or else put it in my other kit bag.  Yesterday afternoon when I went to parade at 2 p.m. I had just got on deck when a big wave came swish! all over the deck.  I got my legs and feet all sopping wet, but it has not been so bad as it might
