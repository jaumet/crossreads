 Very warm - Quite a record for France - That wet heat. By mid-day our unit had been relieved by the 5th F. Amb. and the last of our men had left  by .  I rode the new Douglas motor cycle. Our new camp is on a hill overlooking Senlis & the country is very picturesque.  The hillsides are a mass of colours due to the wild flowers. This little village is quite intact - untouched by shell fire or the any other signs of warfare
