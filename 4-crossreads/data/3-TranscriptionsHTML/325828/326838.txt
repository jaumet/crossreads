<p>Tichborne.<br/>9th June 1915.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I must thank you for your welcome letter of 7th inst. to hand to-night.<br/>I am hoping that by Saturday next the leg will be completely healed.  In this case &amp; the Dr passes me I expect to leave Tichborne by Monday afternoons mail at 10 to 4, reaching Sydney about 5.30 on Tuesday morning.  If I come down however, I will have my breakfast at the Peoples Palace in Pitt St, with one of the Bentley boys who is staying there, as I land home too early for Mother, by going straight from the train.<br/>If the Dr. rejects me again but only temporarily I will stay on here until I do pass him, but should he reject me for any other reason, I haven't quite made up my mind what steps to take as I don't think I will stay on here, or in fact in the country at all.<br/>We have had lovely rains up here all day to-day &amp; part of yesterday.  But for this interruption we should have finished seed-sowing yesterday, but now we will be unable to get on to the ground till Friday.</p>
