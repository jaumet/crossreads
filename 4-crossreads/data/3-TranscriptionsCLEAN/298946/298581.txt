  
 than the day I originally left England. Further, I have met Marshall the troublesome A.M.C. chap who left with me on the Suffolk.  He is taking his wife back and appears to have aged somewhat.   He is however improved  I imagine. 
 Classes are now running smoothly, and I am putting every available minute into English and Latin. 
 There is a girl on board who reminds me of Rita when I met her on the Rangitara. She is younger - coarser slightly but she has the same immature beautiful eyes.  I have spoken to her as a result of discovering that her father is Totty, late of the third.  She is very simple, but a nice good girl.
