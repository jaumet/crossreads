<p>off.  I did not like leaving as I had been made to feel very much at home during my stay there.  I had to stand until the train got to Newcastle.  I there saw the engine that George Stevenson built many years ago, it is on a huge stone platform in the centre of the station.</p>
<p>Wednesday Mch 6th<br/>Arrived at King's Cross, London, 8 AM then went into the Y.M.C.A. and had breakfast there, then had a trip in the tube to Charing Cross station.  I then walked along the bank of the Thames as far as Parliament Houses then along past Westminster Abby, then got the 'bus as far as St Paul's, had a look all round the Cathedral, when I went in there was a Service on, and I stood and listened to the singing of the choir of boys, it was very fine.  I went all round the statues and monuments erected to the memory of England's famous men, some them are marvellously cut out of marble, and are very large.  I was allowed to go down into the Crypt and see the tombs of Nelson, Wellington, Gordon, and others too numerous to mention, it was very impressive being down below the floor in the vault in the half darkness, after coming out we walked down Ludgate Hill and right through to Trafalgar Square and there saw two Aeroplanes that had flown from Turin, Italy to England in 7 hours 22 min.  There was a Tank on View that had been in action, showing a few holes</p>
