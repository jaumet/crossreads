<p>24 February, Monday</p>
<p>F.<br/>I go walk around block then back to mess. I am in a very bad skin &amp; tell Slogger Jones at the mol[?] what I think about the Place. I play Billiards &amp; go to bed about 9 pm.</p>
<p>25 February, Tuesday</p>
<p>F.<br/>Neary 300 admissions. I go to bed at 2 pm but have to get up again. Carry on until 7 pm &amp; then go to bed. Can't go to Dance too sick. We discharge 130 men also.</p>
<p>We are a mess 'cos we don't know where all the Patients have been put.</p>
