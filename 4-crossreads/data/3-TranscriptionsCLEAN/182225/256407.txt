 OCTOBER   SUNDAY 15   1916 
 Saw a bit of sunshine today the first for some days, but it was counteracted by a bitterly cold wind. Poss & I had leave for the day to go to Bournemouth, but Poss has been bad for a few days with influenza & he did not feel like the trip so I stayed with him. I wrote a few letters during the  day & cleaned out my kit bags ect. Saw Joe Clonan in the morning, he was A1 & had just come back from a week in the trenches, about 12 miles away.
