<p>Fine. Poss Nivison &amp; self were with a fatigue party loading &amp; carting stable manure down to Durrington in morning &amp; we had to load again in afternoon. The 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Division held a Sports meeting &amp; we all got a holiday for it. There was not anything very exciting in the events in afternoon at all events as Poss &amp; I were there. We saw Joe Clonan, Billy White &amp; Jack Walsh and &quot;Pop&quot; Lloyd up there. We went to the pictures in evening &amp; they were not to bad.</p>
