 October 1916. a fairly long march from the railway station, &amp; soon settled down. 10th   We went for a route march of about 7 miles through the country &amp; I enjoyed the scenery very much.  We passed through two small villages &amp; through beautiful cultivated lands &amp; returned in time for tea.  The Sergeants Mess here is very comfortable &amp; is the best I have been in since leaving Sydney.  It is a mixed mess &amp; includes Engrs., Artillery A.S.C., &amp; A.M.C..  We went to the pictures after tea &amp; had a very enjoyable time.
