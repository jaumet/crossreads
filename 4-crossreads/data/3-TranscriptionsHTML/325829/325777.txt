<p>The 7th Regt in the centre &amp; 2 Sqdns of the 6th Regt on our extreme left, guarding over our Northern Flank. This Regt was kept in reserve with B.H.Q owing to all wheels being left behind,  the only Artillery available being The Hong Kong Camel Mountain battery, &amp; as the enemy were strongly entrenched with number of machine guns well supported by artillery, the advance was held up. Next morning at daylight a battalion of the 60th Division had arrived from Es Salt &amp; a resumption of the attack was ordered. I now rec'd instructions to put 2 Sqdns in the line to link up the Infantry to the left &amp; the I.C.C. Bgde on our right. "A" Sqdn under Major Patrick was the left Sqdn &amp; was to gain touch with the Infantry &amp; "C" Sqn under Lt [Indecipherable] MC was to get in touch if possible with I.C.C. Bgde. The 2 Sqdns advanced &amp; mounted as far as possible, &amp; were under a heavy shell &amp; machine gun fire all the time, but they never wavered or hesitated an instant, even though it was impossible to extend owing to the boggy nature of the ground which also made it impossible for them to gallop &amp; deprived them of their mobility. After getting their horses under cover, they advanced dismounted, but were but were met by such a storm of machine gun &amp; shell fire</p>
