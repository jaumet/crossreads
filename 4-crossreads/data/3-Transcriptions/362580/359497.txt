<p>Went along a channel with beautiful Palm (date) plantations along its banks.  Returned to Alexandria at 6.30 p.m. just 30 minutes late to meet my little Manch. friend &amp; there he was waiting patiently &ndash; anyhow they are friends &amp; Cap. Combes explained how we lost our way &ndash; so made things alright &ndash; Then we went our own sweet way &ndash; had a delightful drive and to Savoy for dinner then Motor drive &amp; reached Rest home at 10.30 p.m.</p>
<p>Have taken things easy this morning but busy writing &amp; packing to leave here at 3.30 p.m.  Have had a glorious week altogether, lunches &amp; dinner with different ones &ndash; Mr Cuming took me out several times, he had to go to Cairo on Friday on business.  Had dinner at Ras-el-tin convalescent home one night &amp; a motor drive home &ndash; Dorothy &amp; I invited there &ndash; Did I tell you that Dorothy came down last Sunday for a week, so we are all returning to-day.  She is very well &amp; enjoying herself &ndash; not so much in love with her man &ndash; I did not think it would last, not sorry.</p>
