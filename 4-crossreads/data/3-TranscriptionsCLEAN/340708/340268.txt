  
 July 1917 Sunday 8th We shifted our quarters today to the attic over the Hospital. Monday 9th Fritz flew over our way again tonight the anti aircraft guns were going to some [indecipherable]   He dropped a lot of bombs around a munitions works but did no damage. Tuesday 10th Very cold & rough today so we were free from aeroplanes to night. Wednesday 11 A big lot of patients evacuated today so we ought to have a quiet time for a day or two Thursday 12th The Hun has been putting it into Baillieul again so they have sent all there patients in here so our good time was short lived
