<p>journey in six &amp; a half hours.  Leaving Pozanti that night we arrived at Afion Kara Hissar.  This was a hugh [huge] concentration camp and before being admitted we were isolated in a house for 15 days, here I had the misfortune to contract Maleria Fever, owing chiefly to our house being ten feet from the ground, and having a stream of dirty water running underneath it.  This is a common occurence in Turkish Towns, most of the lads contracted fever and one died.</p>

Here my trouble began again, suffering from Maleria fever I was allowed to live in a tent four days before being removed to a Hospital from which Hospital I was discharged after fourteen days, suffering with Dysentry, but soon found myself back with both Maleria &amp; dysentery.  Christmas 1916 &amp; New Year were bitterly cold, snow falling heavily, and here we suffered many hardships, we were billeted in small mud houses, no wood provided for</p>
