<p>H.M.A.T. A29 At Sea<br/>Dear Ferg, Ah's it? As for me its none so bad. We have had a ding dong trip so far and are now in the Gulf of Aden &amp; well on our way to the Red Sea. With the exception of one or two minor blows &amp; light falls of rain the weather right through has been perfect. As I write this now it is a gloriously calm moonlight night. I am first officer of the guard (on from 8PM till 12 midnight) and the only sounds I can hear are the low murmur of voices coming from the men sleeping out on deck, and the thud of the engines. Life on a trooper is at once enjoyable and dangerous. That will probably need explaining. It is enjoyable because of the small amount of work done and dangerous because we are, every one of us, becoming soft and lazy. Principally we eat read and sleep. Our routine is Reveille 6 a.m. As we have no early morning parade we don't get up till about 7 a.m. 7.15 am Mens breakfast. 8.0 am Guard mounts. 8.30am Officers breakfast. 9.30am till 11.30am morning parade consisting of lectures physical drill and organised games. At 10.30 am the ship is inspected by the Chief</p>
