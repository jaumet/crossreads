<p> the men shall give of the best to their duty, &amp; gain the best of all possible chances of rest. They are divided into three watches, Red, White &amp; Blue. One stands alert to the call, and there is standing by, dozing, another is resting properly in hammocks. I do the rounds every night.

What a difference to the ship is made by the whisper of war. A fair amount of valuable property has already gone into the ditch &amp; if we meet the enemy, as is hoped, on Wednesday Aug 12 other things up to the value of thousands of pounds will be thrown overboard to minimise the danger from splinters and fire.
