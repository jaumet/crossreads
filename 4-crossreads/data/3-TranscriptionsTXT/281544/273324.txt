Our 12 & 15" Guns all around were blazing away at Fritz, it is was like the old saying (Cannons to Right, Cannons to the left in fact Cannons were all around us, & what a terrific noise, you could hear the 15" when they fired they gave a double bang & the 12" a single bang. As Fritz was sending heavy stuff over, our Guns were warming up to the engagement, & as the 12" were fired I could see long tongues of Flame belching forth in their Anger, it was a glorious Sight although terrible, every time a 15" would fire my Engine would tremble (No 3092). The Patrol party had a job to do as the line behind the Big Gun had been blown up by Fritz at 6 am in the morning, it was a very close call for all hands, the Shell exploding about 20 ft behind & the concussion knocked the gunners over but did not hurt anyone. It took 40" to unload the truck & as it was getting to hot around about, we were ordered to clear out to Reigersberg
