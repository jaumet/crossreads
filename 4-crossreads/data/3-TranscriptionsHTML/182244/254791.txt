<p>Anecdote</p>
<p>Jim Roach&nbsp;&amp; Rose the Chemist. At a New Shop that Rose&nbsp;&amp; his partner (McManus) opened in King St., it was desired to install a freezing plant for Cold drinks. A local man contracted for the Machinery. When completed the outfit was useless. Through patriotism the firm had it made locally. A lawsuit followed. McManus&nbsp;&amp; his family being good Romans offered up, everyone, a Novena that they should win. The jury decided against the firm, though the members of the partnership believed&nbsp;the facts&nbsp;&amp; evidence to be all in their favour. The McManus Snr&nbsp;was much chagrined that after&nbsp;their piety the case went against them,&nbsp;&amp; he feared for the effect on his children. Roach said to him &ndash;&nbsp;&quot;I know why things went against you. Rose is an unbeliever, a heretic. What esle could you expect?&quot;</p>
