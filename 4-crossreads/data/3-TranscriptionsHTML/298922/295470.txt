<p>Thursday 24 May 1917</p>
<p>RAID.</p>
<p>We got home after a 70 mile ride at midnight last night &ndash; all ranks very tired but we did our job, blew up 2 large Stone Bridges &amp; 5 miles of Railway &amp; burnt many stacks of wheat. I could have got plenty of mutton &amp; Fowls but TIME was the essence of the Contract so only got 2 Sheep &amp; 10 Fowls.</p>
<p>As a consequence the enemy are bombing us today. We could have taken many Camels but had not the time, it was just a quick rush there &amp; back. My Squadron was in the advance &amp; we went 32 mile the other side of the Railway line &amp; first cut the Telegraph line each side of Station. All well built German controlled.</p>
