  
 Monday, 1 January 1917 
 Posted notes yesterday with Photos of Turkish Officers etc., -  enclosed. Rough night & No. 1 Pier & a Steam Trawler are wrecked just like Anzac over again. Our efforts always seem so puny against the Sea - am Prosecutor on a Court Martial today. 
 Weather cleared up & we have a sunny New Years Day. 
 Evening, 3 planes bombed Al Arish while Court sat. Some men stand up & try & photo, but I'll admit if I hear the bomb coming through the air I like to lie down - but in the sand bombs are more demoralizing than effective. DUST STORM blowing tonight everything sand, & the Horses move & are reformed.
