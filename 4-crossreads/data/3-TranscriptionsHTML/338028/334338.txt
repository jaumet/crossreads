<p>Big sick parade in a.m., many casualties during day, etc, kicks, falls and one man who diving in Suez Canal hit the bottom and fractured his spine, I had to take a stretcher party to the poor boy, he was a fine lad, and is now totally paralized, saddler, parades etc etc all day long. This is not a very systemated Reg.</p>
<p>Spent evening and spare time with my mate Sullie over at the 1st L.H.F.A. Transport camp, he has had a great time.</p>
<p>Thursday 20th July</p>
<p>Great rumours in that a force of 10,000 Aust[rian]. Germ[man], Turkish troops have entrenched 3 miles from Bir el Abb. We are making great packs. I was surprised at the number of heavy guns that went through, if it does realize I hope we can get into it mounted.</p>
<p>Friday 21st July</p>
<p>Rode down on old Zigi to Scottish Field Amb to see the poor lad who fractured his spine. The renowned Surgeon Professor Weecks took me to him, I found him in a low condition totally paralized and dying. The poor boy was very cheerful and he died at 5 p.m. He was one of my pets, and the finest lad in the regt.</p>
<p>I now have very big marquee up doing big sick parade. All our horses are bunched into the shade of some lovely trees during the heat of the day.</p>
