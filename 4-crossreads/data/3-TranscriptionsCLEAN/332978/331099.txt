 July 6th (20) Good sleep. Started a chess tournament today. Played cards again today. 
 We were locked in tonight at 9 pm first time since I have been here. At 10 pm the  night  under-officer who sees all lights out, came around & made an awful fuss because our light was burning. He said we should be in bed & light out by 9 pm but I argued with him & as a result our names were taken. (like school days again). 
 July 7th Very little sleep. Awakened by anti air craft guns at 2 am. Recalled old times again. They were firing at a great rate for 2 hours also machine guns.
