Thursday, 2 January 1919Posted notes yesterday.  New Year passed all right after all, a good deal more talk than anything else.  Officers Mess Tent was cut down last month & a drunken Corporal tried to get men to raid it.  We drill over the old Rafa Battlefield but it is hard to recognize country again.  Big engine shed, Water Towers & a [indecipherable] Beersheba Railway came in on the old line of Trenches.  We have had the wooden crosses repainted & an officer & men have gone to Gallipoli to do the same thing there.  Frank Chase & Trooper in 6th L.H. came over for a year last night.  His brother Lyle died of pneumonia.
