<p>good order, and I got quite a surprise when I saw it, Mrs. H. had written to tell me that she was sending me some of Harrys Things .. and for a moment I thought the parcel was from her but soon found out when I had time to examine it  ..   The last few days have been very cold, and for three days now there has been frost on the ground all day long. and all the little pools, have been covered with Ice, the roads a week ago were muddy but now they are hard and dry, that is one good thing the cold does.   This is a very quiet little place   Like nearly all the other villages in this locality it is hidden away down in a valley, and in Summer I think it would be a rather pretty little place, but now the trees and hedges' are quite leafless.   The farmers are busy harvesting the Beet Crop and send it off to the Refineries</p>
