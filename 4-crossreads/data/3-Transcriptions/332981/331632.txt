<p>it was very cold and wet. The rain beating in on my side nearly all the way. I was glad to arrive in the depot at Conchil at 4 pm and finish, as soon as I had stopped a clerk came out to me asking me for my pay book and where did I want my pass for as I was going on leave.</p>
<p>What a bombshell. I never dreamt for a moment about going on Blighty leave, it was furthest from my thoughts as I had only been back 8 months and expected two months to go at least, anyhow I was well pleased and could not really realise going on leave, I was told to report at 10 am for examination before the Doctor and would leave on Sunday or perhaps tomorrow Saturday, anyhow I have fixed things up this evening and may get away tomorrow.</p>
<p>My mates are to remain in the van for a while and may get another run om the Nord Line and I hope to join them again on my return.</p>
<p>I spent this evening writing up this diary and will continue again somewhere in England, I have booked my pass for Inverness</p>
