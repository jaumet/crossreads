buildings about. Returned to hotel for a read and a rest. Afternoon walked round the winding streets of the town finding them busy with good shops but hard to find ? as tortuous and twisty as can well be. Some of the side streets resemble the Turl at Oxford. Old houses with bulging overhanging upper stories. These old places must be unhealthy and though some are fine big places I notice that the dwellers seem of the poorer class ? laundries little shops c. To the Minster from the tower of which an elaborate peal was sounding. Very dark inside and circular gas lights were burning like Notre Dame at Paris. A service commenced ? a few priests and about 20 of a choir. No congregation to hear the mummery. Back to hotel, passed gardens (ad. 1/-) and the old city wall gates. Feel extremely tired and fatigued at dozed for a while at hotel.
