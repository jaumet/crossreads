remained were good & the wonderful work inside was worth seeing. Saw a wonderful table made of tortoise shell inlaid with Bronze also two paintings which appeared as statues & cannot be copied today. Other notable things were pictures of battles, the glazing gallery, the chapel etc. etc. Visited the Congress Room in which the President is elected every 7 years & many of the sittings of the Versailles council have taken place. The grounds were uninviting, the statues being covered over as protection from bombs but we visited the Grotto of Apollo, rather a fine thing. Ice was on the water & it was bitterly cold. A photo taken of the party turned out very well & I sent a couple home. The dinner we had was very fair, the whole trip costing only 12 Francs. Returned to town & I had dinner at the Club for 21/2 francs & very good for the money, later meeting
