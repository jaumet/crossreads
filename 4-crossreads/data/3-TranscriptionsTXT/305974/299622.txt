 19 Monday Drilling all day.  Rained during the afternoon.  Wrote letters to Doris home, &amp; Olive Turner, also sending some photos.  No 29 hut had their photo taken by Q.M. Sgt.  A few changes occured  in the hut.  News of a great victory pending for over a week for the Russians. 
 20 Tuesday No 1 Section detailed for fatigue, I fell into cleaning 3 stoves in the dyspensary.  No1 &amp; 2 section men examined to see if fit for a field ambulance or a hospital.  I managed to get into a field ambulance &amp; expect further arrangements at an early date.  Went to the photographers at Tidworth for photos but found that they weren't finished.  Returned early. 
 21 Wednesday Drilling very hard all day. Rather cloudy. Done some printing but am leaving them for fixing until tomorrow.  Got photos from photographers, the Egyptian photos turned out alright.  I am going to try to develop my own Films, I have rigged up a bit of a red lamp &amp; am now hoping for good results. We see plenty of aeroplanes here during the day, 3 or 4 being visible at one time.
