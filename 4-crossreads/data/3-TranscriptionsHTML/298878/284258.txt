<p>till 11pm when a dash will be made to land the troops on Turkish soil, shortly before daylight.  Ceasing duty at 8pm I went to bunk shortly after.<br/><u>*Sunday 25th April 1915.</u>  When I got up at midnight, the ship was under way, and was the 4th boat in a large line of transports, consisting of 40 great ships, steaming along, great phantoms, with not a single light visible, carrying their cargoes of human freight.  The moon shining brightly, and the sea perfectly smooth, gave the scene an appearance of weirdness.  On the outskirts of the column the T.B.D's acting as escorts could be seen.  By 3am the moon had set, and a mist enveloped us, making navigation very difficult and dangerous.  At 4.30am the mist cleared off somewhat, and objects could be dimly distinguished, and at that time a few rifle shots were heard away in the distance.  By 4.55 the sky being lighter, we could discern the great line of transports stretching away astern of us as far as the eye could see; and on the starboard side, land could be seen enveloped by mist.</p>
