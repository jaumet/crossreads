May 19179th.   This morning I started on a new job, making the butts & targets at a range for a sniping school which is to be held here.  The position is an ideal place for a rifle range of this description & the Tommie Labour Battalion, who are our "fatigues" have dug the trench into which the targets are to be fixed.10th.   The weather yesterday & to-day has been gloriously fine, the temperature being between 50 & 60.   We continued with the rifle range & started on the dissappearing targets.  I have five sappers with me, & two Tommie carpenters, as well as about 40 of the "Labour Battn."   The remainder of the section are working over at the chatteau.
