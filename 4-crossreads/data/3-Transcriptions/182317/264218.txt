Take care of yourself, dear old boy. Do your duty, fearlessly, but simply, and without rashness or any touch of ostentation. Make up your mind that whatever is in store for you, discomfort or danger or misfortune, you will face it with cheerful fortitude. Amongst your fellow-officers you will find men of many minds; you are sure to have differences of opinion, &amp; sometimes will have to put up with things that you don't like. Determine to take everything good temperedly &ndash; whether you are right or wrong, &amp; when you find you are in the wrong, as you will often be, don't hesitate to say so frankly. Set an example of good temper, &amp; reasonableness, &amp;  consideration for others; putting it on the lowest ground, you will find it a fine investment. Come back to us the same dear, clean-minded high principled boy that it tears our hearts to part with. Your affectionate Father David Ferguson</p>
