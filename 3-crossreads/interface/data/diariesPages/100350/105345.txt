(14) Sunday. Another "Snifter" cold morning. Our own Artillery fired a couple of Shells very close to our own trenches, but no damage done. Snipers again busy this evening. Enemy fire over many fish tail Bombs to night.
(15) About one o,clock this morning a German came towards our line and was made a prisoner, he belonged to the 231st Regt of Infantry. We had some fine shooting just after daybreak at some German working parties and made the scramble for cover. About 11A.M. Fritz put over a shower of Rifle grenades and fish tail Bombs several came close to our line but the majority went "well away"
(16) Enemy Artillery put over a heavy "Barrage" fire about 2 this morning, it was quite furious for a time, remarkable what a lot of shells go to waste do no harm. A. Coy 45th Bn had their Post raided by a party of Germans early this morning, but had several of their men put "Hors-de-Combat" A Coy lost a Lewis Gun. More Bombs about 1 oclock but no damage done. We left front line about 6 oclock to night, being releived by 46th Bn. After wandering around the country in the dark for a couple of hours we finally reached our destination known as "Gap Trench".
