His duty nobly done.[Photograph]
In proud and loving memory ofMy dear nephewTrooper William Victor WeaberDied of wounds in EgyptJune 7th., 1918.Aged 37 years
No pen can write no tongue can tellWhat he went through when he lay ill;To God alone his pains were known,He loved him best and took him home.
There are griefs that cannot find comfortAnd wounds that cannot be healed,There are sorrows so deep in our heartsThat cannot be half revealed.
Often my thoughts do wanderTo a grave so dear to me,Where a noble hero true and brave,Peacefully sleeps in a soldier's grave.
Deeply Mourned.- Inserted by his loving parents.
