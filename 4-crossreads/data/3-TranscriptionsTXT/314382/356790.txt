afternoon free, Reg, Bob, Nick & I went again to Netley to the hospital.
Returned early, and, went after tea to the Palace Theatre where a piece "Kings & Queens" was staged. The performance was enjoyable and we finished up with a midnight supper at the "Grosvenor" arriving on board at 1 am.
October 19th: -Leave stopped and therefore ward duties began again.
Sailed at 4 pm, having aboard, only 10 officers, 1 nurse & 6 men, the latter coming from Weymouth depot. This turn of events was a surprise for we anticipated leaving with a full ship but it was announced that the rest were to be taken on at Malta, so we had the prospects of an easy trip until this place was reached.
Night cool but calm and sea smooth.
October 20th: -Cool still and very windy.
On ward D1 where the officers were situated and busy all day as the meal getting is a big item for men of rank.
Relieved at 5 pm and went to bed soon after tea. During the night sea became very choppy and a number of the boys heaved to again. I was fortunately OK.
October 21st: -Cool and very windy all day. On duty in D1 again throughout the day. Sister Treyhearne operated on for appendicitis. Slept on deck the wind easing after tea.
