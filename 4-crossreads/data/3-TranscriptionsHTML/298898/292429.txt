<p>of 4 miles, receiving a great welcome from them. They were a typical old English family doing things in good style without any false nonsense. Had a few hits at golf that afternoon &amp; ended up with a walk, sleety weather but exhilirating. At night had a long discussion on things in general with the eldest girl, a very brainy person &amp; much travelled, quite a treat. Slept very well that night a thing I could not do in London.</p>
<p>Wednesday 10th January</p>
<p>Went for an 8 mile walk through very interesting country saw Milton's Cottage with many of his relics &amp; then went onto the home of the Quakers. Here we visited the meeting house of the friends &amp; saw other places of interest reaching the house about 1.30 after a very fine walk indeed.
