<p>Nothing doing this morning, Sunday  Still rumours of our moving, this is our sixteenth week here under fire  I was inoculated against Cholera yesterday. The reinforcements belonging to the R.N.D. are dying already, most of them have been soldiering only 3 months  One of them got drowned, and another contracted fever and died. 1,000 mules of the Indian Mule Corps, water at a well near our lines every evening. In the morning they start watering at 3 A.M.<br/>The weather is still warm in the day time but cool at night, Very few mosquitoes here, in fact hardly any. Not 25 shots have been fired by our Battery this week, but a big stir up is in the wind.  The C.O. was through our lines yesterday, he was down at Artillery head quarters. The French are occupying almost the whole of this peninsula. They are putting a Battery of 75, behind our Battery. Also another in our left rear. 4 aeroplanes over making for the Asiatic shore, surmised a French attack<br/>23/8/1915<br/>Another mishap last night, 7.30 one man wounded, a shrapnel bullet entered</p>
