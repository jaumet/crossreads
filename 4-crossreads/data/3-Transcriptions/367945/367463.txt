<p>Dear Brew<br/>I was very pleased to get a few words from you &amp; to know there are still a few bricks of the old monument left.<br/>Thanks very much old boy for your kind offer &amp; I certainly will give you a look up when I get out there.<br/>Well things are going fairly well with me the last few days I have been getting along on crutches &amp; I'm feeling much fitter. I have to get another operation later on, one thing its only a minor one.<br/>The damned thing that did give me trouble was three abcesses</p>
