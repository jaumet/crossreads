<p>We were much struck at the sight of an old sun-dial on a house-wall facing the main street on which were engraved these words from Shakespeare "Life is but a walking Shadow". How appropriate &amp; how true!</p>
<p>However it would take volumes to tell all we saw at Shrewton, but when we get our pay I will buy as many views of the place as I can obtain &amp; these will give you a better idea of the place than all my words could.</p>
<p><u>Feb. 4. Sunday</u>. Cold &amp; frosty this morning. Church Parade in Y.M.C.A. hut in forenoon &amp; we sung the old hymns <strike>&amp; listened to a strong address on</strike> "Fight the good fight" etc and listed to a strong address on Paul's exhortation "Quit ye like men, be strong".</p>
<p>On our return from this parade we went through a snow-fall &amp; got back to our huts with about 1/8" of Snow</p>
