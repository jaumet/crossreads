of the city. Here are situated all the Cafes & just off it the Hotel Moderne (where a room for night costs 25f) Bouise, Theatre Taverne Royale (now an EFC Officers Club) are all situated. The main thorofares are all thronged & in the square one finds little crowds assembled & finds singers selling the songs & at intervals singing them & teaching them to the crowd.
Fall in with an English officer & with 3 girls with whom we go as far as a cafe & then leave them The proprietor of an adjoining cafe wants 25 fr for bottle of Red Medoc wine.
I return to Club & dine not having had any luncheon for the day Here I met 2 Canadians & have sundry whiskies After dinner meet a Scotch officer & set off for a Cafe Moderne where one can laugh & play & dance. However this place is closed we wander off to (*) Rue de la Bassee where I part company from my friends. I continue to wander round town but cannot get a room though there are plenty in the town because the cafes & hotels have been closed to soldier at 9 pm by APM.
At Hotel de la Place I met two other Canadian Officer Major McDonald & hearing of my plight they say they will not see me stranded & hunt round with me & then put me in their car after a visit to Cafe
