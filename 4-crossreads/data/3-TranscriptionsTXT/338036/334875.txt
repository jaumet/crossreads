[26th Feb. contd]Most of our boys had been dispatched to Houplines the "hop over" area and were held in reserve & told to get to bed at once.  Sure enough at 8.30 she started & the sight.  After an hour the bombardment eased off & we went to sleep.  But at 12.30 she opened again & spit fire all Armentieres seemed to be alive with guns.  She did not cease until about 2 am.  We slept until 5 when our boys returned with the news that raid had been very successful.  Regret to add though that 2 of 11th & one of Tenth Ambulance had been killed & several wounded.
Tuesday 27/2/17Got back to baths again & saw the raiders with faces blackened & excited and got the news from horses mouth.  About 1000 had gone over and they got right to third line capturing many prisoners machines & 2 searchlights besides blowing up a "minnie" store.  Talk about "Coons" & minstrel shows they cut a funny figure.  Wintry at night.
