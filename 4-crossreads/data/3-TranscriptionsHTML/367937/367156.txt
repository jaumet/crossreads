<p>just fairly rolls off you.<br/>I am wondering whether I will be able to ware frannel pyjamas in Egypt; they say it is pretty cool there at night so they may be not too hot but if they are I can buy some cool'uns I suppose, silk ones perhaps.  I wash the pair I have with me every time I go on piquet as then they have two days to dry as we cant take our clothes off when on duty. The five pairs of socks I have with me ought to last a good while as we don't wear any on board; in fact we only wear shoes when working with the horses.<br/>Full dress parade here consists of identification disc and a short pair of pants, so you see we are not extravigant on clothes.<br/>Soon after we left Fremantle Bartrim developed mumps and he has been in isolation ever since. Poor kid: he finds it very slow and is rather home sick I think.<br/>There is no doubt that this is the life for a chap alright, we get a fair amount of work but only short hours, go to bed about 8 PM and eat our heads off on good tucker.  They all laugh at me, say they would rather keep me a week than a fortnight even on a months allowance of tucker.<br/>I have seen an awful lot of flying fish the last day or two; they are jumping all round the boat.</p>
