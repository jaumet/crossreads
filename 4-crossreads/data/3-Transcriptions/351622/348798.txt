<p>19 March 1916 Sun<br/>Beautiful day &amp; sea very calm. Life-boat stations alloted. Inoculated another 1000 men. With Colonel Phipps went to do Generals Johnson &amp; Holmes. Any amount of limejuice during the morning. All lights out on deck. Pacing neck to neck with another troop transport about two miles away [text continued at top of page]</p>
<p>20 March 1916 Mon<br/>Slept on the orderley room table last night. Another glorious day. The sea is very calm &amp; of a beautiful blue. No wonder there is so many summer cruisers in the Mediterranean. Passed several transports. Passed Malta 4.30 &amp; the island of Gozzo not long after. Met Wilbert Carroll &amp; [indecipherable] Wakeford on board. A very sober day. This boat was originally the old Ortana of the [Orient line].</p>
