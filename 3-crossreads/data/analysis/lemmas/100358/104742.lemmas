 be abl to stretch out , and , as the tunnel was onli about 3 ? 6 " wide , we had littl comfort and no sleep. But we were 20 feet under the ground , and had the satisfact of know that we were beyond the reach of Fritz 's shrapnel and heavi stuff . Some of the boy were detail to carri food to the front line , a distanc of about 2 thousand yard , and so had veri littl rest after a tire few day . This trip to the line was a nightmar to us all . I was detail for various duti and so , for a while escap it . But one night at 11 P.M. my name was call amongst 15 other , to fall out at 2 in the morn on food fatigu to the line . I was work all day , on aerial observ and dugout fatigu ? Fritz had got in a lucki one on sever of our expos dugout ? and was feel tire befor we start . At 2 am we fell out . It was rain and bitter cold . We wade along the sunken road to Fler , and ginger pick our way amongst the ruin of that villag to a protect cellar where our cooker were . Here we found 8 food contain , 4 tea , 4 stew . These are huge thermo flask about 2 feet by 15 inch and oval in section . Two strap fit over our shoulder and under the armpit , make a good load for a mule , let alon weari men . We work with mate , two to a contain . This was quit the most despair trip to the line I have so far experienc . Not 100 yard from the cookhous , I fell backward into a shell hole and was pull out drench to the skin . Further on I sunk to my thigh in some most tenati mud , and my mate had to divest me of the contain to extric me ? minus one putte . He took a spell , and I pick the path and help him out of muddi place . The whole way we walk in 6 " to 2 feet of wateri mud , wind our way along the rim of the shell hole , which are here as thick as the dent in a rasp. After an hour and one half we arriv at a sunken road ? close support .
