  
 Friday, 5 February, 1915 Another skirmish at the canal in which the Turks had 2,400 casualties, and the loss of  a machine gun section.  The British losses were very slight, we are all eager to get there and are fretting in camp whilst our mates are fighting.  The camp now that the 2nd Infantry 13th & 14th Battalions are here reminds us very much of Broadmeadows & the L.H. Brigade had another sham fight to-day.  The artillery are firing live shells regularly whilst we are doing ambulance drill suitable for this country.  We picked up a N.Zealander to-day who had cut his throat & wandered into the desert. 
 Saturday, 6 February, 1915 There is another field ambulance next us attached to the Infantry.  There equipment and methods of training cannot compare with us.  The 2nd contingent are spending money wholesale and the natives are making the same fortune out of them as they did out of us when we first arrived. 
 A fine Y.M.C.A was opened yesterday with all kinds of conveniences for the troops.  Our hospital is not doing so much now as we are transferring all patients to the base hospital in Heliopolis formerly the Palace Hotel the largest of its kind in the world it cost 2,500,000.  The Aust red cross nurses look very well in their smart uniforms.
