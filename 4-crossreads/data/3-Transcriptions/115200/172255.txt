<p>Yesterday we came on Board this Ship and we are going Back to Gallipoli to have another go at the turks&nbsp; this is not a bad Ship at all I Suppose&nbsp; She is about 20 000 tons&nbsp; on our mess Decks there is very [poor?] outlet. If a Submarine did happen to get at her there would be an appaling loss of life. There are about 2500 troops on Board independent of The Crew. I Dont Know What they number But it must be a couple of hundred or more. There are on Board Ship</p>
