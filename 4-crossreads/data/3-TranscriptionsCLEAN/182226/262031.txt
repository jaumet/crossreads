  
 Sunday 9 January, 1916 
 The weather was dirty early in the morning but during the afternoon it has been lovely, even the birds, we have some canaries on board seem happy & all singing away. 
 The air is warm & the sea is a lovely blue, it is a delight to be on it even if you are in an old tub of a transport. 
 We came in sight of land towards evening but did not go into harbour.
