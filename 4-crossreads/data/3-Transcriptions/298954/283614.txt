<p>1918<br/>Thu. 4th Apl. (cont.)</p>
<p>Karlsruhe was in darkness;  all necessary lights were shaded, &amp; all arriving train passengers were subjected to strict examination I was passed through the military examining gates.</p>
<p>Big notices are on view all over the station "To the cellars", [indecipherable]   Fliegergefahr" (air-raid danger.)   My Unteroffizier took me through the darkened streets to the ex-hotel "Europaischer Hof", now a receiving depot for officer-prisoners.</p>
<p>In the lobby he obtained a receipt for "ein Gefangener, Englische."   The old blighter took quite an affectionate leave - (for one awful instant I though he was going to kiss me!) and wished me a "gluckliche Gefangenschaft" (a happy imprisonment) &amp; the old thing was not sarcastic, either!</p>
