 FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1919. 
 Fine. Barry &amp; Al &amp; I &amp; Graham went 
 down to rocks early after 
 foxes. I got one, &amp; it&nbsp;was the only 
 one got. The girls brought our 
 lunch down &amp; we had it in the 
 mountain. Tickle lopped in 
 Top paddock 
 Barnes came out &amp; brought Darby&#39;s 
 tools and 1 ton of chaff for me.
