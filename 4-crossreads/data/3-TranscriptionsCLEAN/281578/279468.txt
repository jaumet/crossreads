  
 halt for a few days, we wouldn't see each other, as he doesn't buck up & drag himself away from the dull routine of army life when he has the chance. Saw the 47th Bn. of our lads fall in to march up to the line, it was rotten to see them go up so short; they have had heavy casualties, but held their ground, & wiped out far more Germans. As usual there is a very fine church in this village. It rained tonight, & came through our roof in places. Just a few yards outside are some big guns, 60 pounders. Lor', when one fires, it makes our building shake, & if you happen to be doing anything, your arm jumps & you nearly drop whatever is in your hand, & the roar is deafening. Couldn't sleep much at night, had a nice comfortable bed on straw with blanket, greatcoat & waterproof sheet, but the big gun was blazing every now & again, & making a fearful row. Sunday 28 April Had a nice quiet day, one parade to inspect arms &c. It is dull & cold after a very wet night, & altogether too cold to go into the river for a clean up, worse luck. They are great gamblers in this company, always playing two-up, &c.  331/3 % (one third) of the Bn. stay out every time we go into the line, those who are left out are envied (in spite of newspaper rot to the contrary) & those who go in hope
