off then for dinner intending to finish it during the afternoon, but we were playing D Coy. football so Capt Witby rang up got them to postpone C Coy. shoots as Len, Edwards I were playing with the Coy. in the afternoon so they did
D Coy. won the toss kicked with the sun on their backs, all through the first half we stopped them from scoring we thought we had a fine chance, but they scored a lucky "try" soon as we started on the 2nd half try as we could we could not catch them, so they won by 3 to nil, after a very willing game during which I managed to get 2 very nasty cuts over my eyes, one of them nearly stunned me I bled like a pig. I now have two lovely black eyes my Paris leave about due, stiff isn't it. the shooting comes off tomorrow its bound to affect me to a certain extent but we will play football, bet your life. Got about half a dozen new men for my platoon today they are badly wanted for our strength is dwindling away.
