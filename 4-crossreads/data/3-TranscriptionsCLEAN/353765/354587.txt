  
 April 1916 [Note in margin:] Thursday 6th - for 6 of us. Camped on good ground. Mess rooms & canteens being provided. Understand N.Z. M.R. leaving Serapeum today for Salhia. Father Mullins of 7th L.H. said, that as far as he knows we are only to be here for a few weeks, then to France (!!!) Not inclined to agree with him. He probably knows more than I do. Flies very bad here also. Went up to camp about 2.30pm. Pitched E.P. tent. No E.P. prep so had to improvise. 7th - Arrayed panniers so as to protect our drugs etc. Sun very hot. About 4pm managed to erect another E.P. which had to serve as dispensary, orderly room, Sgts mess etc. Bde of N.Z.M.R. arrived from Serapeum about 11 am. Worse off than we are as regards equipment etc so all their sick parade here. 8th - Getting things ship-shape. Rumours prevalent saying another more very shortly. Wrote Mater & Molly letters to be posted in Cairo. (details of trip) Grant Ritchie & Gee returned to unit from Ismailia hospital. [Note in margin:] Sunday 9th - Weather getting hot, in fact is hot. Church parade at 9 AM Balance of our equipment supposed to arrive at El Salhia today 10th to 13th - Nothing of any consequence happening. N.Z's got going & took their own patients also going to take all Med & Surgical cases we keeping all infectious cases. Rest of equipment wagons etc arrived. [Note in margin:] Thursday 14th - Rotten strong wind (Khamseen) sprung up about 9pm last night, dust galore, winds at Serapeum nothing in comparison to it. Chap from R.H.A. brought in, suffering from acute appendicitis. Abscess had burst.
