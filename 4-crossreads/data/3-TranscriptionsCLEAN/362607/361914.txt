  
 Dear Mum, Just a card this time as I feel too tired to write a long letter & it is very late, I have been getting along famously with my work & so has Ellis & we have very responsible jobs. I will tell you all news in a letter by another mail. This is a Photo & is typical of the villages we have passed on the way from Suez. We are all well & we were very glad to receive letters in answer to the ones we sent from Freemantle.  Love Harry.
