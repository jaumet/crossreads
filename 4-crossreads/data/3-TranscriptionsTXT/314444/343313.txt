 tucker etc now &amp; a great line of pipes bring water.  So we don't have to depend so much on camels as we used to.  They had to follow us with our drinking water in cans, horse feed &amp; our own rations until the line was brought further out, so at times tucker &amp; water was rather scarce.

 Will enclose another photo or two. Backhouse came back to us about 2 months ago, he looks &amp; is pretty well. 
 Lots of love to everyone from loving son Jack
