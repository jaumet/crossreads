came tumbling over & over again & finally crashed to the earth about a mile away, & our Machine slowly followed him down at a certain distance & the off again he went looking for more, at about 4 Pm a Fritz came over making for one of the balloons, The both observers jumped clear with their parachutes, all the while Fritz was fireing his Machine Gun at the Balloon but could not destroy it, when one of our Machines tackled him & he turned & made off at full speed, it was wonderful the speed he flew at & he was away in the distance in a moment & there were 3 trains full of working parties waiting to go away to their Camps & I expected Fritz to put his Machine Guns on to the boys, if it was not for our Machine who tackled him & made him clear out he would have done a lot of damage to the troops. After a little delay I got my train of troops away to Reigersberg & I signed off at 4.30 Pm.
