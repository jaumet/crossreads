<p>I went to most of these places with a chap named Walker from Potts point Sydney I think. He is a nice young chap. We did the sights together - took a guide and went to Pompey&#39;s Pillar then the Catacombs back along the Nile and round to the Museum - Cant say I enjoyed it very much as I hate guides and cold dusty ruins and dead mummies; but at the museum there was &nbsp;an interresting exhibit of War Trophies from Palestine and a wonderful collection of photos taken from aeroplanes. When I got back up to Cairo I heard about the scrap in the Valley. Our regt was right in it and did the counter attack. I was sorry to have missed it as we were standing to arms and expecting them to come for nearly a month until when I left we did not think they would come at all, but they did and our chaps are awfully pleased at capturing all those Germans. The Turks and Germans seem to have had a great old row and would not help each other<s>e</s>&nbsp;and after they were captured they had to be kept apart</p>
