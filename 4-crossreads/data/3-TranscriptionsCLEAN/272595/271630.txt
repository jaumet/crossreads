  
 for the afternoon I am making one of a party which are going out driving round the Island I am no less than 9 days behind so I am just going to scribble on from memory & without dates that's the worst of leave one has never time to keep his diary up for he is going all the time. well I suppose I must start where I left off the drive I think it was, we were driven round some of the beauty spots of the Isle & no doubt they were lovely real old country lanes & every thing smothered with flowers, I have never seen such a variety before in my life, we were out 8 hours during which time we visited Castletown an ancient & quaint old place with a very old prison
