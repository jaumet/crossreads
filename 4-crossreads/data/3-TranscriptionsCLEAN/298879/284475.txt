I and Frank Green (my dug - out neighbour) got to work on our dug - outs to make them more cosy as it was a fine day & I have improved mine greatly. Cardigan jackets, gum - boots & macintoshes have been issued to a number of men. 
 Wednesday Dec 1 Tonight was warm up to about 1200 when it began to feel decidedly frosty. I and a number of the others collected some snow which still lies in places on the trench sides and melted it down for shaving water. Some of it was clear enough to drink. We do four hours on the phone now and sixteen off.
