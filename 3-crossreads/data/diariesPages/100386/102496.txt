trough on it is wheeled underneath the mixer and with a half turn of the drum the dough is emptied into the trough and conveyed on a light railway shown on plan, into any particular trough desired and allowed to "proove", which as worked here takes 8 hours.
Taking a 40 sack output, for instance, 1 dough-mixing machine mixes enough for the capacity of the first round's baking; namely 2560 rations or 7 sacks roughly, and then preparation is made for the next round, when allowance must be made in temperature or time so as each dough will have the correct amount of "proof".
By temperature is meant the heat of the ingredients of which the dough is made, for should one dough be made with a certain temperature and straight away the next round is mixed at the same temperature, the second round would be overproof and
