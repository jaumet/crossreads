in perfect order as it disappeared behind some houses in the town in the direction of the enemy's line. Shortly afterwards a big machine circled over my head (ours had gone home) & I looked up & got a nasty shock when I saw a black cross on the wings, the German sign, but he didn't drop a bomb. Our 'planes have a circle with a dot in the centre as their sign. One was up behind us most of the day, & the Huns were pelting shrapnel, & you could see the black puffs in the sky where the shells burst, but a moving aeroplane is a very hard target to hit. Fritz didn't shell us about 7 p.m. as usual. I carried tea from the road to our company tonight, & about 10.30 we moved up to the front line to relieve A Coy. March in single file silently, & as flares are being sent up all the time, each man stands without a move when it a flare goes up, there is less chance of being seen than if moving; it seems a long time that the pretty flare, which lights up everything like day, takes to circle up in the air & fall to earth & go out, & while it's alight, you expect a machine gun to open up on you. When it goes out the procession moves silently on, but stops dead when another soars up. We got to A Coy's trench finally & they got out without trouble, & took up our respective positions. We are holding it too lightly, one platoon of ours only taking up the same front as two of theirs, & 5 others & I occupy about 50 yards. Wouldn't keep him back
