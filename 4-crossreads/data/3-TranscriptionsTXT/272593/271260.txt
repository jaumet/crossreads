12. for in the afternoon were going to have a "Field day" the whole Brigade were going to practice a stunt,  so accordingly after dinner the bugles sounded the "fall in" & away we marched to our Battalion parade ground, here Capt Jacobs took charge & marched us about 2 miles to the joint where the affair was to take place, over towards Contay.After we had got all our men in position & everything ready I'm hanged if we did not have to wait for a good 2 hours shivering in the icy cold winds but this is the real military styleAt last they gave the "order" to advance & away we went ,& for a wonder we did not get mixed up but everything went well, & the heads seemed well pleased at the way in which it was carried out
