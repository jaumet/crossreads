9/6/17Bouzincourt Warloy ContayAwakened about 5 a.m. a bright cool and fresh summers morning. Stewart was also awake and from him learnt that the promised movement order had not arrived from Brigade and consequently I could not go from Albert by the morning train. After some deliberation decided to breakfast and get down to BdeH.Q. at Warloy & find out what had hapenned. Took Snowden as orderly and had a pleasant ride in the good fresh air. Just coming into the town Snowden's crock crossed legs and crashed throwing him off. Fortunately he was not hurt. Both the knees of the horse were broken and bleeding very much so I pushed on leaving him to bathe his horses wounds and to brush himself. Saw Heath at BdeHQ and getting another orderly and horse I decided to push on to D.H.Q at Rubempre. It was a fairly long ride and took me through Contay first of all. A very pretty little place with such nice surroundings. This little village has a number of French protestants.
