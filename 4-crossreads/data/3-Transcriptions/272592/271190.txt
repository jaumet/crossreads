<p>content to tell the truth I rather enjoy wading through the water it puts me in mind of when we were kids &amp; used to splash &amp; play about in the water &amp; thoroughly enjoy ourselves, but it is only Autumn as yet &amp; the weather with the exception of the nights now &amp; again is fairly warm &amp; mild</p>
<p>I have been on the go all day long &amp; tonight I am fairly tired for walking about makes one leg weary, for today I have been doing practically the Sergt Majors work &amp; my own besides &amp; I have not had a minute scarcely to myself except at tea time tonight 16 hours solid going, but tonight I am stopping in.</p>
