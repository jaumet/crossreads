<p>men who turned up late &amp; drunk &amp; whose places were filled, caused other alterations. They come &amp; go &amp; are forgotten a day later except when after "Lights Out," in <strike>conversations</strike> nocturnal [indecipherable] we recall the old faces and often try to recall names, &amp; wonder what has become of the old faces. Even here we are not exempt, for amongst our NCOs only, one sergeant gone to hospital with a bad ear, another with a poisoned hand, another with a broken arm, have caused vacancies. Another in Egypt gone to take a commission in the British Army, and so on. There will be other vacancies no doubt, in a few days, but day after day slips by &amp; we are still here, still in suspense as to what lies before us, and at this time comes a mail, letters from home, and hundreds of men retire into corners to read from mothers &amp; sweethearts, things which make one very homesick. <strike>It is</strike> I hope it will be better later, because though one doesn't let on much the suspense makes one very susceptible to sentimental influences &amp; makes the heart ache a bit at times. I notice there is very little shame or shyness amongst soldiers</p>
