<p>S.S. Finland.<br/>Off Holyhead<br/>March 6/16</p>
<p>My dear Ferguson</p>
<p>I can quite sympathise with the Children of Israel &amp; understand why they did not please Jehovah.  Forty years in the wilderness <u>was</u> tough!  Of course our pilgrimage has not been so bad or so long:  but its been bad enough &amp; long enough.  It <u>seems</u> ages since I left Sydney.  And it has been <strike>over</strike> <u>6 weeks</u>!</p>
<p>Through Canada we travelled in state.  The Government cars &ndash; 2 &ndash; at our disposal &amp; everything very well done.  From Vancouver to the Atlantic seaboard all the country is covered with snow.  The Rockies are a glorious sight &ndash; through a steam-heated window.  But when as was the case with some unfortunates whom we saw, you are snow bound for 23 days.  Well then they are <u>some</u> mountains.  You bet</p>
