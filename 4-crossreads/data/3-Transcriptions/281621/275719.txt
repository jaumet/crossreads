<p>Sunday 7<br/>Move back to Dickebush for next 24 hours. The weather is awful, wet, &amp; the conditions up the line must be worse than previously.</p>
<p>Monday 8<br/>Spend day at Dickebush &amp; tonight we move up to Westhoek tunnell. We are due for a stunt in the morning but the more important part of it is on our left to the sea.</p>
<p>Tuesday 9<br/>The result of this mornings stunt is successful. The artillery on our side is very active but Fritz is comparatively silent. In a great air duel one Fritz decended in flames &amp; one of ours came down. The airman came through our post but was dead. From the artillery just now 6 p.m. a counter attack is in progress.</p>
<p>Wednesday 10<br/>Move back to about 4 Kilos north of  Poperinghe. What is exactly in the wind I know not but rumour has it that we move from this area.<br/>The Australian part of this last stunt was a great success &amp; now all the high ridge commanding all the surrounding country is in our hands.<br/>The treatment the 1st Field meets out to its men is anything than a credit to the unit regards food, clothes &amp; general.</p>
<p>Thursday 11<br/>The weather we are now having gives evidence of the rapid approach of winter, raining off &amp; on daily.<br/>Visit Poperinghe &amp; see Eric Greenwell. Poperinghe is much the same as last year but in darkness. Enemy aerial activity</p>
<p>Saturday 13<br/>Visit Rininghilst. Weather still wet &amp; miserable</p>
