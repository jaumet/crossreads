Tuesday Jan 19-15 -  Fitz & I swam at 5.45 am - After sick parade I went to the Garrison Hospital - I saw Strangman & then I learnt that several patients had been discharged who should not have been discharged - He told me this himself - I had suspected as much - Young inexperienced chaps had acted - I then left & went inboard the Sumatra - the usual glass of lager - then to the Fantome - There I found 3 more dischargees from the G. Hospital - At the Hosp they told me none had been discharged - This will show the incoherence of the management to say the least -In the aftn I personally returned one of the sick - Do you think I cd get hold of a medical officer? Not one - I wrote a note to Strangman & left - I took a stretcher party with my SBA & I gave him the benefit of naval language (acquired by me since Aug 22) on his gross mismanagement - It is so characteristic of Johnson - He pretends to know how to run things but is beastly incompetent
