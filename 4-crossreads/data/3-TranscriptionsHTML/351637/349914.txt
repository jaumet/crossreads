<p>While waiting for the Trawler I went on board the Swiftsure and met several old freinds. Got back to Imbrso at six but it was too late to go to G.H.Q.</p>
<p>August 24th<br/>We all three went across this miming. Found they wanted us in order to give a trifle of scrappy offical information about the recent operations which was of absolutely no value to any of us. They had even held up my Anzac dispatch innorder to make me add a paragraph about Sgt Major Wallingford and some machine guns. I was highly indignant and told them so in no uncertain terms. My coat has been returned to me but not the camera or glass case. I m afraid they must have been blown to smitherens. I went on board No 32 and dined with de Crespingny. Feeling very seedy the doctor gave me some bromide and I slept on board</p>
<p>August 25th<br/>Went on board a yacht called the victory and bought a lot of stores and ordered others to be sent from Mythelene. Then returned to camp and had to write a long cable on the last battle. I made it pretty hot and do not know how much will be allowed through. De crespigny Cooper and Monty Parker came to dinner.</p>
<p>April 26th<br/>Had a settlement of accounts in morning and then attacked my immense accumulated private correspondence. Got a signal to come to Headquarters in afternoon. Found they wanted me to take out all references in my last cable to the gallant deeds of the 29th Divisionbecause they said it was a strategical move nd they did not want the Turks to know the Division had been brought round as they might seize the opportunity</p>
