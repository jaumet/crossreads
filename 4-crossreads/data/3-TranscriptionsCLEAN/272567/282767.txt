An aged bent man carrying a drum was tottering along here - the town crier. In the streets were plenty of flags, civilians and  Billjims were falling on each others necks. Many were drunk and an aged gendarme was standing in front of the church firing a shot gun. Met Leon Barbier who was much elated and passed many riotous souls as I neared the Chateau. At dinner all the officers took a glass of wine with me to celebrate the occasion. A furphey today that we move in 4 days time! Great joy in Amiens today - what a time the brave French have been looking forward to this day.
