1918Feb 21much explosive was under it as there were over 600 tons of ours as well as what the Boche had. My feet became bad at this time, with chilblains, which burst and went septic. We got a much needed bath at Palmer Baths on the Bailleul side of Neuve Eglise about 3 kilos away. As it was rather a complicated performance, this is a description of it. Before going in we had to scrape the mud off our boots. Then we went into a room and put all our valuables in our hats. Then I took my hat boots and puttees to No1 window and got a metal ticket in exchange. Next I took my tunic and trousers to No 2 window where they were pressed with a hot iron (to kill the chats). Another ticket. Next to No 3 window where I put in all my dirty underclothes. Another metal ticket. The next business was to have a bath. The showers were in a convenient room adjoining the undressing room. They were fairly hot. After the bath into the drying room. When I had dried myself, into the dressing room. I took the metal ticket to No1 window
