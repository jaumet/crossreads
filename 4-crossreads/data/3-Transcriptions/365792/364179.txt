<p>Apl 9  Patent beer carts here 2 long stout poles about 24 ins apart are fastened to an iron axle to which is attached the wheels. The poles serve at the same time as shafts &amp; the beer barrels (from 5 to 9) are placed between. Well built &amp; comfortable farmhouses, but the pits &amp; dams etc are almost invariably placed right against the house, consequently one gets a not too pleasant odour in many instances. fruit trees are trained along the walls just like we train a grape vine, &amp; the effect should be rather pretty when the leaves are right out. Many of the men &amp; boys wear black peaked caps similar to those worn by a motor driver. Guard finished at 7 pm &amp; we had to pack our kit as soon as we returned to camp<br/>[in margin] <u>Sunday</u></p>
<p>10 Left Renescure at 7 am for Uttersteene &amp; picked up the rest of the Brigade enroute. Marched over 3 hours without a spell; many of the chaps fell out &amp;</p>
