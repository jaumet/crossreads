She can post it in Australia for me.<br/>Well, I'm in bed have been ill since Friday but am doing splendidly  Col. Maudsley is very attentive but will not let me get up yet &amp; then have to go to Alexanderia for a week. So you see I've scored a holiday. Our little trip to Alexanderia last week was stopped through my little sickness, we were very disappointed. What I shall do without Con. Murray I don't know, she has been so good to me  &amp; been to see me every time she was off duty, bringing me all my necessary things. I hope you will have an opportunity of thanking her for her goodness to me. She has that parcel still, so you will receive it in due time.    <br/>Poor Sister Craig has been very ill with Typhoid Fever but is much better &amp; improving fast, she has had a very bad time. Sister Murray's sister is in our ward she has had throat</p>
