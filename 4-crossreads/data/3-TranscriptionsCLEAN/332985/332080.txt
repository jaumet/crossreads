  
 Horrible journey today, in places the road is like glass, several horses fell down.  Our wagon line is 4 miles behind the Bty.  Appears to be a quiet spot. 
 31-1-1917 Snowing all night, cold.  A stir up amongst the batmen, they were put on picquet.  Fine class of men these, duds of the Army.  Frost cogs used extensively, even then horses fall down and cut themselves to pieces, roads like glass. 
 1-2-1917 Still freezing, no snow, bitterly cold.  I am not too well, heavy cold.  Rations very light, not enough to feed a rat. 
 2-2-1917 The 1st Bty. had a man and horse wounded, rations plastered on the sky.  Artillery active last night.  My feet are sore again.  Things all up side down.  Country still covered in snow. 
 3-2-1917 Freezing day and night.  Washed a shirt, hung it
