 The Zoolog Garden here are about the poorest I have seen for the size of the place , everyth look so dilapid dreari , the reason whi is that labour is so scarc thing have to be let slide , they have onli a hand of anim , among them be the Kangaroo Tasmanian black opossum rosella parrot white cockatoo a few more bird , take them all round they are a veri poor collect , but the Pari of today is not a patch of pre war day . There has been great rejoic over the fall of Jerusalem the whole popul are as happi as lark , one can easili see that they are much more sway by their emot than the hard cold British it take quit a lot to stir our blood compar to the French , the place to see it is in a theatr you would be surpris . The road street here are a pleasur to walk or ride on they are splendid so wide , level as a billiard tabl a lot of wooden block have been use
