<p>yourselves &amp; that Ted would like to stay another week. Hope you &amp; Belle are having a good rest &amp; feeling better for your holiday. The weather has been better than we expected, at this time of year. The old gardener was there to-day &amp; cut back a lot of the trees near our house. Much improved. The garden looked very nice. I'm not sending my present but the usual  &pound; 1.0.0 will be waiting for you. Hope you wont get Drunk on the strength of it. Much love &amp; kisses to Teddy Bear.
