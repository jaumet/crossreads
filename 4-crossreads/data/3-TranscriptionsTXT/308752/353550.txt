that a satisfactory decision will come of it. What is the use of this slaughter & destroying of the country which goes on day after day?  It is all very well for the people safe at home, to talk to the Soldier of "King & Country" and "Honour" & Death for Liberty, & all the rest of the glories of War. All these may, perhaps, satisfy the people at home, & the Warriors in the War office, & some soldiers issue orders at the base, but the man who has seen his mates killed, & has seen the ghastly scene of a battlefield etc., combined with the awful suffering of men - he requires something more real or definite, than long winded sentences & promises of Glory etc.,    After being nearly three years on Active Service, I have come to the conclusion that there is no Glory in War.
I hope you will all excuse the above "out burst" but, it is the mood I am in to day. Sad news to hand two members of the 8th were killed to-day.  Dvr. Saunders, W.  & Pte Howarth. The former was an original member of the Unit.
5th May 1918."Hurrah!" Our relief turned up at 6 p.m. another squad from C. Section came out to take our place. It did not take me long to reach our Headquarters at the factory, where I enjoyed a refreshing hot bath. The next few days I had rather an easy time, enjoyed a good rest. Very frequently Fritz's planes flew over our home but luckily for us, no damage was done in our vicinity. On the night of the 7th inst. a concert was held in the factory by one of the Battalions in our Division, those men of the Ambulance who were at Hd. Qtrs. were invited. The show was a splendid one, the roar of the Artillery, from mid-night to the early hours of the morning was terrific, & the news in the morning was good.
The enemy attempted to counter attack, but failed in his efforts.  Judging from the roar of the bombardment I guessed that something of the kind was on.
