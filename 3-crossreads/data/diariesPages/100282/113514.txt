since starting the competition we have scored 120 points have but 6 against us, thats going if you like after the match the Colonel told the team that he would try his hardest to get them a trip to Paris, after coming out of the line this time, he takes a very keen interest in the team is as pleased as Punch over our victories At half time the final for the tug of war was settled between the 9th Battalion the Pioneers, the 9th were far the heavies team, to look at them one would have thought they would have pulled the legs off the Pioneers but they never had a look in, the first time they were pulled off their feet in a few seconds the second pull they were over again when the judge stopped the pull gave it to the 9th because some of the Pioneers were laying down to it, there was much criticism over this decision so when the 3rd one was being decided there was much barracking
