<p>255</p>
<p>JANUARY 1917</p>
<p>21 SUNDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; cold. Our section was</p>
<p>on duty &amp; we took ammunition</p>
<p>up to the gun pits in the</p>
<p>evening. They have great</p>
<p>positions for the guns. Ours</p>
<p>is under a house in one</p>
<p>of the streets of Armenti&egrave;res.</p>
<p>The whole place up there</p>
<p>is knocked about a lot</p>
<p>&amp; nearly all the civilians have</p>
<p>left it. Our fellows roam</p>
<p>round the houses &amp; get</p>
<p>anything they want to</p>
<p>make themselves comfortable.</p>
<p>We had our first casualty</p>
<p>today &mdash; Bob Fowler got one</p>
<p>in the knee. Got a big</p>
<p>mail in the evening</p>
