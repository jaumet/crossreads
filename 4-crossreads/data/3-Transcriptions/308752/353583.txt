<p>It was rather a little late to go looking for a hotel, especially as the bus strike was on, so I decided to stop at the War Chest for the night, which is next door to the Hd. Qrtrs. The War Chest is really a wonderful institution, it is open day &amp; night a good bed, &amp; meals can be obtained there, &amp; the guides are always on hand if the soldier wants information, or a pleasant place to spend his Furlough etc. etc. I enjoy another hot meal, &amp; I turn in <u>between the sheets</u>, (what a luxury). Arriving at Hd. Qrtrs. so late I was given an extra day's Leave, so I am up early <strike>in</strike> the following morning with the pleasant prospect, that I have 14 clear days holiday ahead of me. Of course the first item after breakfast was to visit the hairdressers, &amp; enjoy a good shampoo etc.,   Being Sunday morning not many barbers were opened so naturally had a long wait, &amp; it was close on midday before I was fixed up. Decided to go to East Sheen, which I did, &amp; had dinner with cousin Lily.  My visit was unexpected so you can imagine her surprise. In the afternoon, she gave me a hand to parcel up all the souvenirs that I had brought over from France, &amp; we got them all dispatched. Back again to London, to the Golden Cross Hotel, where I am staying for tea.  In the evening I attended an American Concert at the Palace Theatre, a big crowd of the leading Actors &amp; Actresses of the London Theatres, give a free concert here, every Sunday evening to Soldiers &amp; Sailors.</p>
