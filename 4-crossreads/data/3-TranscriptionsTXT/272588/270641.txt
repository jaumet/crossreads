Tuesday 8 JanuaryOn guard for 24 hours.  A very heavy snow storm again last night but it is freezing again.
Wednesday 9 JanuarySnowing very heavily again. Attend lecture by Sir Richard Lodge, Professor History at Edinburgh University on the "Unity of Italy" & the "Unity of Germany", a contrast.  The lecture was lucid and I think it is a great thing for the troops & I only hope it is a forerunner of more.
