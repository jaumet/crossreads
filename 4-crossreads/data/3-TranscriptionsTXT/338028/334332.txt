 Monday 26th June Feeling pretty bad, had an acute attack of gastrick. We are all delighted with the success of the Sherriff of Mecca and his success, we expect big things will grow out of it. 
 Tuesday 27th June Rumour we may go back to Kantara this week, Camp becoming very monstrous in heat. 
 Wednesday 28th June As I am very short of drugs I rock into Hill 70 to the N.Z.M.M.C. Although a heavy fog met some old friends and we had just messed when a Taube flew overhead. The alarm sounded and all the horses were got off the lines. He was beaten off by our machine gun fire and went to Dueidan, he then came back to us and we thought he was going to bomb us, but he was beaten off again. I was anxious to get back to Dueiden to see if any damage was done, I rode [indecipherable] and on arrival learned that all the regt went mad and fired rifles at him, then one of our own came on the scene and chased him in the direction of Romani.
