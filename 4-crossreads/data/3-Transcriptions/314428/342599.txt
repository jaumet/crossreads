<p>There is a good deal of speculation as to whether we will call at Adelaide or not. The Captain's orders are to proceed to Adelaide but there is a possibility that this may be cancelled by wireless as there are not many more than 100 S. Australians on board &amp; it would mean reaching Melbourne a day &amp; a half sooner. However, I doubt if the orders will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Today &amp; tonight nearly all the troops are below decks, as the weather is too rough to remain long on deck, and one can only walk with difficulty.</p>
<p>Today I got the Colonel's signature in my autograph book and left it with him to obtain some more officers.</p>
<p>The distance travelled today is 294 miles &amp; the course is practically due East.</p>
