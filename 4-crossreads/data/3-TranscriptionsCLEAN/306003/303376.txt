 The sixth & seventh bombs were dropped close to the anti-aircraft gun but did not get a bully;  The eighth bomb also fell amongst the 2nd & 3rd Regts & was the last & the Taube then made off & we returned to our lines to find 4 horses between us & the wireless that were wounded in the 2nd Regt & managed to go a few yards before dropping were being finished off with bullets;  We had breakfast & then
