 Wednesday 17 This morning we found the ground covered to a depth of four inches or more with snow and we had much enjoyment snowballing. This afternoon we all turned out on a hare hunt over the hills at the back and after an hours best of fun we got one hare. Many managed to get through our cordon. 
 Thursday 18 Still snowing. We had another hunt this afternoon with same results as yesterday. 
 Saturday 20 The ground is still white with snow. It is rumoured that we move soon to a [indecipherable] sector of this front.
