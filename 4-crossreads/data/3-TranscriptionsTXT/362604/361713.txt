duty" hours that one misses the click, click of the Balls.  We had our monthly mess meeting to-night.  One cove is a huge joke.  He always sits in a corner, the same corner, & has at least 15 proposals to make.  He is on the Committee & was dissatisfied & tendered His resignation.  I proposed to accept it & it was carried.
Well, Mum, Dad, & George, we are both tip-top.  Ellis & Tommy came Home like two drowned rats but they'll not take cold as the weather is very warm.  Ellis & Dick were playing a game of Billiards when I left the mess to come & finish this letter.
Fond Love to you all & Regards to my Friends Round about,Harry.
