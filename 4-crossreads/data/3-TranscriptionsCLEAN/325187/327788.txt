 On Patrol today saw 1 Jackal 1 Gazelle- What they live on I don't know. The Jackal dig up the dead natives I think & the Gazelle eat the Camel Bush & Desert Thorn. We are making a Military Road here to get the Guns out on the Desert, great gangs of Natives & Camels carting Stones, no doubt spys are among them but the English are a trusting lot.  We now are looking to Roumania for help.   Posted
