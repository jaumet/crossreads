 103 8-9-19 Some few things that strike me as peculiar which came under my notice this morning. Here in Paris there are still town criers &amp; with a bell to announce facts to populace Men bearing placards &ndash; [advt] &ndash; walk along all day in the street though not to same extent as in London. 
 Police here all carry a useless bayonet &amp; even on hot days a cape overcoat. In Paris itself many of the roads are rough cobble instead of wooden blocks &amp; makes omnibus travelling very uncomfortable. 
 I have lately commenced to eat horseflesh &amp; like it better than beef. I commenced with a fillet of steak both at same time &ndash; one bite of horse &amp; one of bullock &amp; I prefer horse It is tenderer &amp; much cheaper. 
 Prices here are exhorbitant. A Commission has just been formed which regulate the prices for the week &amp; even so prices are high. Here are the prices of commission for 
 8th to 14th September (a Kilo = 2 &frac12; lb) Butter 5.20 for &frac12; kilo Eggs .50 each Beef Filet 12.40 per kilo &ndash; Rumsteak 9.90 Porc Filet 12.30 &ndash; Hams 11 &ndash; trotter 2.40 an kilo Veal Gigot 9.20 shoulder 7.10 Poulet per demi kilo 5.75 &ndash; Rabbit 2.25 [indecipherable] 3.30
