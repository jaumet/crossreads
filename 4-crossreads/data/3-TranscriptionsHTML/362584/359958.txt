<p>make ready to move to Chiseldon in the morning, so I could do no more. I have not written to the battalion yet, as I am still waiting for a letter from you. The last mail brought me letters from yourself father &amp; Dorothy dated June 25th &ndash; they came this morning.</p>
<p>We shifted camp to Chiseldon &amp; I learnt that Cyclist Coys had sizzled out to an inglorious end. Their place is now taken by cyclist battalions which we &ndash; no doubt will reinforce. Our designation is now No 2 Coy Australian Cyclist Training Battalion of which I am in command. Capt Ross is transferring to the machine guns. You can imagine how sick &amp; tired of it all I was. Everything had gone wrong; but thank Heaven there was plenty of work to keep me from thinking too hard.</p>
<p>When Australians come to England, they are always given four days leave shortly after they arrive. An officer must go in charge of them to London &amp; march them up to A.I.F. Headquarters Horseferry Road, where they are told how to behave themselves, what to see, the best &amp; cheapest places to stay etc, etc. there are a number</p>
