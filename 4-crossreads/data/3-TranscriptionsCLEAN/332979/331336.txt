our way to the Artillery Sergeants Mess where a Ball was being held, on our arrival we were made Welcome by one of the Committee & invited to have Supper, I was not in there very long before I found out that it was restricted to Sergeants & Officers & me being a Corporal I did not take my Cape off so I was not identified. My Chum however was a Sergeant he enjoyed several Dances. One of the Commitee asked me to have a Dance with a Lady & I said I had a bad ankle so I amused myself looking on until nearly 12 midnight, when we made our way back to our Barracks.
Wednesday 11th 4/17.The Morning was wet & Cold & Snowing so the Morning Parade was cancelled & after Dinner we had an illustration by a Corporal
