Sunday 20th  Weather more invigorating tho' still hot but the nights are cooler.  The "Kursk" with munitions on board which sailed a day later than we did from England appeared on the horizon this morning & will probably pass us if our speed does not alter, the average since Colombo being about 270 per day, much to the chagrin of the lads.  Heavy rain during the early morning & afternoon.

However after 5 readings they were reduced to 2 the following was judged to be the best
