 Lecture in morning, also signalling.  Two days route march commencing to-morrow. 
 Tuesday 17.7.17 Left here at 8 Am &amp; joined Brigade in two days route march to Corbie.  On our arrival at Corbie crossed pontoons placed across canal to test them.  Engineers have been practicing a good deal of that work of late, apparently their services will be required in that direction in the near future.  Placed in billets about 5 pm on the outskirts of the town.  Walked into town for tea &ndash; some of the boys made a wild night of it, it was 1 o'clock in the morning before I managed to get the last of them to bed.  Billeted in an old factory.
