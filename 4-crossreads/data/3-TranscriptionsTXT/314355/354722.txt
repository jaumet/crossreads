 April 11 46. Three times during today's lovely sun &ndash; afternoon &ndash; the Boche planes have been over dropping bombs, now, in the blue of the evening shrapnel flashes over the aerodromes. 
 The sky's of darkening blue, and heaped clouds, every little while a white bright flare rises and slowly falls a mile from us across the valley. 
 Tonight we're sleeping in waterproof bivvys.  I chose Lyttle with everyone. 
 Tomorrow we move:  the Notice Board today carried an order by Gen. Birdwood:  the gist of it was "Lads, take the strain!".  What a splendid man he is:  it is impossible not to involuntarily compare the Tommy stiff orders of this occasion.  There's no doubt with any of us but that we're going to a big and a deciding stunt, before us stands a battling that will decide our conditions of living, or existence after.  God that wounderful after!  Oh, if only those who go home still realise their country and do not stand aside to the places made for themselves by the men who have shirked behind &ndash; who have deliberately and coldly shirked, and who have shirked under the cloaking of an old complaint, long forgotten till war came, but remembered after. 
 What has my work of these two years amounted to!  Not a role of fighting have I lived compleately in:  while I was in the bearers justified my name as Australian, as a direct and active fighter I would have been useless, the field offers no other work I could justify myself in but dressing, and then I feel every agony and anger the man feels. 
 Searchlights, shrapnel and sharp whipping noises, thank God for Rhum &ndash; tonight our first issue for months. 
 April 12 47. Morning:  a clear sky and a warm sun, after a night of rain and frost.  A deal of raiding about, and bombs dropped.  Early, a big column of smoke over Amiens sent the rumour of Amiens being afire. 
 Bivvy a great success:  a whispered telling of several sleeping under wreath glass house of the cemetery.
