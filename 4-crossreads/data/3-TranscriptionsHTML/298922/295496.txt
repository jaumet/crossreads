<p>ABASSAN KEBIR</p>
<p>Reveille 3 A.M. &amp; reached Camp in time to see a good aerial fight, but the HUN got away. We have some new fast planes now. Back in the Dirt &amp; dust &amp; stand to arms etc., still we had a good spell of 10 days at the Sea. RABBITS were issued in lieu of meat tonight &ndash; I suppose trapped, <strike>but</strike> they've given me many a sleepless night, when the beggars would not take the poison, well our men don't like em but we eat to live &amp; after all it's a change from BULLY, provided the weather is not too HOT &ndash; it is WAR. Posted notes yesterday &amp; some snapshots. I hope you get them O.K.</p>
