<p>Tuesday. 22.10.18.<br/>Up at 8.30. Some change for me. Was with Harry Brevett nearly all day. Took him to dinner &amp; Marie to see "As You Were". Then went back to her flat &amp; had supper. Got a big bundle of letters from her. Some from Aussie too.</p>
<p>Wednesday 23.10.18<br/>Knocked around with Harry all day Met some big businessmen from Manchester &amp; went on to see the Soldier Boy with them. Enjoyed the show immensely. After the show went up to the manager's office &amp; met Mr Boor.</p>
<p>Thursday. 24.10.18<br/>Today is Our Day. Usual flag day wrote 4 letters. Bought a writing case for 42/6 (should have been 50/- plus cost of 3 letters. Harry knew the manager &amp; got it cheaper) Took Marie to see 'The Man from Toronto.' It is by far the best comedy I've seen. Gee I enjoyed it. Went back for supper afterwards.</p>
