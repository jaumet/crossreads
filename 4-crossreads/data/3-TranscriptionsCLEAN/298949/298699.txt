  
 Captain of the Military than a Barister at Law, though when seen by Internees to be clothed in Civilian attire.  I might be wrong, but it is my intention, to find out if this Gentlemen wher a genuine Barister, or a imitation, becourse for the services rendered during the enquirey in the Internees interest he seemed to be a Duffer or else hated the German Internees  out of the bottom of his heart.  The Court consisted of a Major & two Captains in Military Uniform.  The former Camp Comandant, against wich actions in regards of our treatement we had complained being also always present in private Clothing.  The whole Court "arrived hier in the same Motor Car from Liverpool", & departed in the same Car always.  The Internees say, that no doubt they also reside in the same Hotel, as hawing their residence in S.A., they have come hier, at the Government expense.  How can a Trial be just, when the Deffendant, The Plaintiffs doubtfull Athorney, & the judges of this sayd Court, ride about in this same Car.  As far as the interest of the U.S.A. Consul are genuine in our favour, leave also much desired as this Gentleman is known in this Camp to be a Men, who hated every German, as Internees have found out during their official Interview with this respective Gentleman.  The following letter wher handet to the Court of Enquiry for dispatch to the U.S.A. Consul.  The former Internees of Torrens S.A. none interned in Holdsworthy N.S.W. have resolved unanimously not to give further evidence in this Court of Enquiry for the following reasones.
