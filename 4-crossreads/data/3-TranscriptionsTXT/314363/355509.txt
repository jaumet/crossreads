 patron of this place. Lady Billairs however  was  is out of Clevedon just now. We had a very nice time, there were three of us. After tea we played cards untill supper time. Wednesday Oct 2.9.18 Clevedon. Raining this morning.  We had to stay in all morning on account of the doctor comming, my left arm had swollen a little &amp; he put it down to the bandage which was first wound round it. This afternoon had a walk through the town, posted a few post cards. Played chess in the evening Oct 8th. Clevedon. Plenty of wind and rain. Went to the pictures this afternoon. Am getting tired of this place, it is too damp. All the Australians are being shifted on Monday to Dartford, it should not be so windy there. The wound is feeling sore lately, the sister has been rubbing it with caustic, this is done so that by keeping the flesh down allowing the skin to grow.
