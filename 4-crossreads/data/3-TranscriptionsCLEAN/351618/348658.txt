  
 The Turkish Artillery were shelling our positions this afternoon but they did not do much damage. Several shells fell round near our 7th Battery and one near my old store which I have now vacated. 
 Tuesday 9th Nov It looks overcast to-day. This afternoon I went along to Y.M.C.A. Canteen to get cakes for Headquarters. Every day I will make this trip now & let the different units of our Brigade take the goods secured.
