<p>The gold inlaid scarabs are all done in Japan and the steel work and most of the antiquities are made in Birmingham, though the last year or two Japan has been capturing that trade also. I looked round one big Egyptian curio store and only found two genuine Egyptian articles in it; a kind of home spun cloth for wall coverings, and carved copper vessels, which you can see being done in the copper bazzar at the Moushi. They are only cheap sort of work though, and not prized anything like the beautiful Egyptian scarabs &quot;Made in Japan&quot; So the true Egyptian people, it seems to me, are only those you can see working in the cotton fields as you go past in the train. but then again I have never been really close to them to know if they are truly genuine or not.</p>
