body take to the boats.  We only had one alarm and that was when we met the "Wolf" about a week later.  She only came to see how things were and they told us she was going to look for coal.  So away she went, we all hoping never to see her again.  Hoping we would meet something and so be recaptured.  But no such luck for us.  Things went along smoothly.  The boys (six in all.  Eric and myself and four niggers all sharing the one room), doing odd jobs, deck work, coaling the galley, peeling potatoes and teasing the cooks.  I had several narrow escapes from a lively time with the Jap cooks.

So the only thing to do was to take the coal the "Hitachi" had and sink her, so we steamed to the "Seychelles Islands" and then we were once more taken on board the "Wolf", the 7th November.  The next day the 8th, the "Hitachi Maru" was taken out with the German Ensign floating over her stern.  Three bombs were placed on board her.  The first explosion made her list.  The second righted her, and the third, we could not see what it did, but shortly afterwards she sunk a few feet and then stopped.  It was
