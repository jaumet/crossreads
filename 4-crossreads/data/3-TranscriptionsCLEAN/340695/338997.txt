Received word of Fred Dowell's death from Feve a couple of days ago it came as an awful shock I feel for his folk at home. 28-6-17. Left Bailleul for Steenwerk by motor lorry are in a splendid billet. 4-7-17. Still in Steenwerk. Have witnessed some good air fights here & Mrs Bosche delights us every night after dark with bombs & machine guns from Aeroplanes. Coog & I have a good bed & a kind lady cooks for Coy of us so we are well set here.
