<p>13 January, 1916<br/>Maadi Camp<br/>I am on piquet to night it is not much of a job. There are 24 of us on for the squadron, just twice as many men as are needed - Johnson &amp; I are on the last shift for our watch, 3.0 am until Stables in the morning. I was in Cairo yesterday &amp; was at the dentist to get some teeth fitted. They costing &amp;pound;4-0-0.  I have to go in tomorrow night to get them.  Trinder came back yesterday; he is taking charge of the troop &amp; Bill is L. Sgt - Beuzeville corporal. The other night I was up at the Y.M.C.A. hut doing some writing &amp; I met Charlie Gee &amp; Mullins of the tramway [Burgess was a tram conductor]; they are at the Remount Depot. This morning the whole regiment was on mounted parade &amp; we had a solid mornings drill. there was a lot of growling amongst the men because they were getting their legs bumped &amp; squeezed in the lines; The horses as very fresh &amp; look real well. I have got Stantons mare &amp; she has gone well &amp; steady so far &ndash; Received eight letters today so have not done so bad</p>
