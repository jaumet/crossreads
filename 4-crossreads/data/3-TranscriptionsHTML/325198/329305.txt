<p>19 May, 1916<br/>Romanai [Romani]<br/>We have been having a quiet time of it since we arrived back from the stunt on Tuesday.  Each day we saddled up in the morning at about eight oclock &amp; came over &amp; tied our horses up in the shade of the palms.  It is a beautiful day to day very different from Tuesday  - In a tent at the Field Amb it was 127&amp;degrees; &amp; in the Brigs tent it was 123 &ndash; I would like to know what it was out in the desert where we were.  The 1st LH arrived here yesterday &amp; I saw Hartnett &amp; Rutherford had a long yarn with them last night</p>
