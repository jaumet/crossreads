But here there is much to do.  Red Cross work must be done &ndash; we must not slacken our efforts or our dear ones will feel the pinch on the other side.  Then there are the homes of our  men  soldier friends &ndash; perhaps they have left a Mother or a sister, a wife or children &amp; surely we can visit &amp; cheer these &amp; thus do our bit.
