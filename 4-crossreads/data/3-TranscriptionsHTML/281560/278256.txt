<p>9/6/16<br/>As all the boys were sober, they were more amiable this morning. Except for my eye, there is nothing to show for the initiation ceremony of last night. I did not expect to find booze in the reserve lines; but a few of we "reinfo" took our Platoon Sergeant; Harry Parker, is his name and bought him lots of beer. Now everything is all right. This company has none of the "spit and polish" of the 14/3; all the fellows in it seem to drink and swear hard and the fact that we are "D" Company; of the "Incomparable Fighting Third," goes to prove that they will fight like 14 devils. This evening we marched up to support in the "Fleurbaix" sector; and made ourselves snug in a billet about 2 miles from the firing line. Marching in the ranks of a fighting Battalion has made this one of the proudest days of my life.</p>
