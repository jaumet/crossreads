<p>Monday 25 March<br/>This morning early we moved up to the front to the N. of Messines &amp; E. of Wyscheate.  The front is very quiet indeed &amp; is a network of tram tracks.  The German fortifications are great, consisting of dozens of concrete pill boxes.<br/>Of course this ground was taken from him in June 1917.  From our post the R.A.P., a great view is to be had of the ground now in German hands &amp; many villages can be distinctly seen with the naked eye.  No news of the German offensive.<br/>Beautiful Spring weather.</p>
<p>Tuesday 26 March<br/>Ye Gods! an officer has just told me that the fighting in the offensive is now taking place in High Wood ! Somme.  It speaks for itself to anyone who knows the country.  However, I believe the Bosche has paid heavily for his great advance, which compared with ours of the last two years has been lightning like.</p>
