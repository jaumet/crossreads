Our dugout last night had to shelter 20 men in a floor space of 8 ft x 20  Literally lying on one another. Anyhow the night was not too bad, warm enough tho' the snow lays thick outside.  All shell holes with water are frozen hard. The shells explode with great noise & with much more effect on the frost bound soil.  Scrape for breakfast. cannot light fire for fear of Fritz observing smoke. we are only 400 yards off his line. A squad of snipers share half this dugout & are changing posts all night. 'Tis interesting to hear them relating their experiences on their return.  They spy on Fritz's lines too & gather valuable information
