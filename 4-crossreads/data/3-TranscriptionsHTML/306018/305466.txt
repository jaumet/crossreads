<p>October 1917<br/>practically empty &amp; although it is always a rough ride I did enjoy having  a bit of room to lie down &amp; have a sleep.  Got to Kantara on Monday morning at 4 am.  Went to the Soldiers Club there had a shower bath &amp; a shave &amp; then went on to Moascar.  Had lunch there &amp; went on to Alexandria by the 2-10 train.  Had to stand a good part of the way as the train was crowded. Went to the Windsor Hotel , had a good dinner &amp; went to bed.  Was feeling very tired as I had very little sleep since Saturday night.  Reported for duty next morning at 9 oclock.  The time soon passes as they knock off at 4 oclock.  Went with Sgt Long to afternoon tea at Mrs Cornishs place.  They have a scotch nurse for the 3 youngsters &amp; they are great kids.</p>
