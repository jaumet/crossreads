<p>Wednesday February 28. 1917<br/>I am a year in the army to day.  During that time I have had a variety of experiences and have travelled some thousands of miles, mostly by sea, but also some hundreds of miles by train, and many a weary mile on the march.  I have been in several different countries: - Cape Colony St Vincent Island, England, Ireland, and am now in France, and worse luck in Hospital  I have been in hospital three times, once at Perham Downs Salisbury Plains, with measles, once at Sternwerck with chilblains, and now at the 10th Field Ambulance Hospital Armentieres with sore feet.  Otherwise I am well.  I have had several narrow escapes from shells, shrapnel and machine gun bullets, and have lived admidst</p>
