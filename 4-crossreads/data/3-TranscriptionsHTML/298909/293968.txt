<p>Tom O'Hagan telling me he was in Abyssia Hospital &amp; had been ailing since December.</p>
<p>I put a very nice day in Ismailia, wrote a lot of letters &amp; sent Eileen some things from (Dayanam Brothers &ndash; Merchants Ismailia). They are very particular about passes, I was stopped about a dozen times &ndash; more especially at the ferry. Got home about 9 pm.  Saw a lot of Turkish prisoners also wounded going through to Cairo from the engagement not far from here 22nd 23rd 24th.</p>
<p>The Tommies are not held in confidence by the Australians here <u>generally</u> &amp; there is not the best of good feeling &ndash; rumour has it that only for the Australians the other day the Tommies would have been cut off &ndash; In Ismailia today an Australian had a few <u>laagers</u> in him &amp; indulged in a bit of horse play. The M-P's ex London Police, Cold footers &ndash; took to them &amp; got a hiding result &ndash; they went back, called out all the whole of MPs in Barracks armed to the teeth. If there had been a few more Australians I'm sure there would have been a battle royal.</p>
