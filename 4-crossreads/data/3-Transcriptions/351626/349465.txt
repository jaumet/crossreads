<p>27.2.1916<br/>Dear Marg<br/>I know you will be interested to hear that I was out all day yesterday with Miss Flo. Hamilton.  Had a strenuous day on Hamstead Heath in about 9in of snow   &amp; borrowed a toboggan on which we slithered down the hills much to Miss H's delight.  She seems to like her place very much but seems to miss you a good deal.  We also went to "Tales of Hoffmung" at the Shaftsbury Theatre last night.  It was in English   &amp; was the last night so had some speeches etc.  I enjoyed the music very much.  am just having a week or two leave in London.  Should have left England last week for Egypt I expect but</p>
