<p>Firing Line (Needle Tr) <br/>26/12/16 covered with papers and books whisky &amp; mugs, cigarette tins &amp; tobacco knives pencils candles electric torches &amp; enough rubbish to drive a good housewife mad. Artillery liason officer reported and as they put a few shells into us I asked for retaliation and our guns sent over beaucoup. On the left our artillery put up a four hours concentrated bombardment &ndash;quite a good shoot. Only normal shelling round us. Yarned during evening in intervals of telephoning and fixing up ration difficulties, with Rodda &amp; McGregor. Talk turned on very few topics as War is our be-all and end all and absence so long from other interests leads all conversation into that of fights, past &amp; present, Gallipoli, trenches, Pozieres, mud, wounds death trench mortars, officers men, shells, our own &amp; Fritzs &amp;c. &amp;c. Toujours la guerre! They all turned in fairly early and I took up the night watch and sat up alone close to signal buzzers. A dark night flares not over frequent.</p>
