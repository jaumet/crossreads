All very dirty and people seemed dirtier too than Cairo the colour of the people varies a great deal ? too many armies have been quartered in Alexandria for its race to be a pure one. To Mohamed Ali square [indecipherable] oriental stores the Bourse fine buildings. Thence down side street where finest buildings are ? a credit to any city prosperous and clean. Great variety of colours in the street. To chemist and then to Eastern Extension to send a cable for Col. Back to ship for lunch. Quiet afternoon the men all very good and hard at work. Memo get bayonets sharpened up
