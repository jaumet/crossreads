thankful that I have been trained by circumstance to of the past to stop my emotions at the border line.
From the point of view of the Artist Historian The Neck is a wonderful setting for the tragedy and I could not wait for the proper time which was just before sunrise but abandoned the "Mission" & did a sketch which is Buckshee Souvenir, about 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  The Sun smiled nicely but a howling wind made it difficult for detail and many miss fires struck my new trench coat and other parts of me.
The fleas have found us out and are co-operating with the Jackals in night disturbing.
I wonder in my resting moments how you are managing with yourself the offspring & the house, but can only at this distance rely on your never failing good management & fairly reliable instinct.
The horses are a Godsend & this evening I am a bit sore in the seat but fresh in the brain.
A demain.
