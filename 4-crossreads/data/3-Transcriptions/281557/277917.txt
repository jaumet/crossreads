<p>very nice nearly 30 being present: Church parade for the mob &amp; the band sounded well after not hearing one for some time: Alf &amp; I walked along the canal towards Croix du bak &amp; the scenery was very nice: I got a "P" of some artillery horses being "watered" &amp; also a canal scene: dinner: we had a "eat up' for tea: I went over &amp; seen F Poole he has hurt his ankle playing football: we had a good talk: while there sitting under a tree a taube was being shelled overhead &amp; a nose cap fell barely five yards away from us: Church at 7.30 pm &amp; was very good: B Coy played C Coy football but C. Coy beat our mob: three hospital cases resulted out of it so I pity the Fritz's if we get to proper "holts" with them: seen some anti-aircraft guns on motor lorries; Taubes were over during the day:</p>
<p>Monday July 3rd <br/>Billets: hot day: reveille 6 am: physical jerks: breakfast: rifle exercises: dinner: parade but sat down &amp; were lectured by "fossil" on saluting etc: he certainly has good ideas &amp; would be a good man training recruits at home : Lecture on gas &amp;  also told us about the N.Z. &amp; the gas, also about the 19th &amp; N.Z. deserters: a few traubes were over during the day &amp; one of ours had a scrap with one: the last we seen of it ours came down in a volplane but we couldn't see whether he was hit or not: heard some tales about the 4th Bgde raid &amp; the artillery: some passed our billet at dusk: I feel pretty stiff today through kicking the football: told that our trip to [plugstreet?] way was off: more anti-aircraft on lorries &amp; it appears they roam round the road here as Taubes come over more often than our own billet: still banging away down La Bassee way <br/> </p>
