 August,1918 Sunday 25 
 Between Vane and Hamel. Spell. Arrived at W.L. early this morning and heard that [indecipherable] and Ped Palmer were missing. Ped had been wounded last night with a bomb. I'm afraid that young Ken has been wounded, if so I'm very sorry indeed, for he is one of the very best pals I have ever had. The weather is very wet at present and I can assure you that our home was fairly moist, never mind. Rained heavily until mid.
