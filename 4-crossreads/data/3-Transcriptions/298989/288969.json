<p>29/1/16<br/>All slept in this morning but the outposts were relieved at 0700. In the morning straightening up tents was carried on with and those companies not in rest did musketry and close order work. The morning was delightfully sunny and the men resting stripped and did a good lousing.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we marked out the line of trenches for our "keep" making them run so as to be always on a reverse slope with a field of fire of 60-100 yards and to avoid enfilade the line was very tortuous and twisting. The first position I've had a hand in laying out against an enemy. Very little water and have only had half a cup of tea today, more expected any moment. This place is at present indefinitely named being called "Canal Zone". A prominent sand hill between us &amp; the 21st is known as Hog's Back. It took us the whole afternoon to site the trenches of the keep.</p>
<p>A short thorny bush about 9 ins. high is sprinkled over the sand and under it are sometimes seen white shells. Snails are sometimes seen. The shells may be snail shells but resemble sea shells very much and occasionally a flat sea shell is seen. From high ground in front Ismailia can be seen 9-10 miles off. Transferring my batman Spendlove to HQ tonight. Owing to being so long without a mail there is a great shortage of bumf. Camel train arrived in darkness and their cargo of water was issued out to thirsty men.</p>
