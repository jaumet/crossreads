Saturday 11 January 1919RafaBrigadier Gen. Cox inspected us today, he played to the gallery as usual, often at the expense of the officers - visits to the "Two Up" School etc.  This is of course outre.Very windy & dusty & last night very cold.Went for a hunt with the Rafa Hounds some English Officers have here.  About 15 went out & we ran 2 Foxes & a Jackal.  We are now getting up a Race Meeting for the men, anything to keep them occupied & happy if possible.No news only waiting.With love to you allYour fond sonF.W.
