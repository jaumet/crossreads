<p>Thursday March 15th<br/>Things are very quiet. Fellows in this unit seem very anxious to transfer to the field, some are even transferring to a fighting unit. Occassionaly you can hear the firing of guns here, mostly they come from the sea.</p>
<p>Friday March 16th<br/>There are a good few permanent Base men employed here, fellows who have been wounded one, two, &amp; three times, &amp; are now unfit for further active service. My half day off. Went down to Boulogne with a cobber here, had quite an enjoyable time.</p>
<p>Saturday March 17th<br/>Rather a very nice day. The weather has been fairly clear this last few days, although this is supposed to be the month for very windy weather, &amp; rain next month, something to look forward to aye! Was put on shack orderly this morning. There are two appointed each morning, &amp; each sweeps half the hut. I swept my half &amp; the other fellow forgot his, so both of us were to go up before the Colonel this evening, but he (the Colonel) was not in, so it was adjourned till 9 am tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sunday March 18th<br/>There are very good shower baths here, it is splendid to be able to get a bath as often as you like. Still keeping very windy &amp; cold. Went up before a Captain re yesterdays business &amp; of course all we got was a bit of a lecture. Scrubbed out the hut this morning, as everyone gave a hand, we soon had it finished.</p>
