I arrived at the Post, which we are attached to, about 8 a.m. on the 16th inst. & things were fairly busy for a while,  a great number of our stretcher cases were gas patients,  Fritz put plenty of gas shells over during the night & the ambulance we relieved had to send quite a number of their bearers to the Hospital.
