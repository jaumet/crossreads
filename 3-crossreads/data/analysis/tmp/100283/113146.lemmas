 So I reckon I did not do too bad The French peopl must have thought us bad , they were all out to see us pass through the villag , it was funni to see the mob roll home dead beat done to the world we were all in the same boat , after I cool down I went and had a cold bath , then after tea there was a lectur on aerial photographi , after this was over I walk down to Merckenghem to see about my watch if they were done or not , here I struck Fatti Gill had a bit of a yarn with him , then I walk home in the moonlight . 21st . Love weather again thing are look beauti . Last night old Fritz plane were over bomb all our light were put out
