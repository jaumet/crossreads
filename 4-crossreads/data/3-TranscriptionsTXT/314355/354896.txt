July 17269.Another sunburning day.  At 5 away towards Hondeghem and there with the S.A.s till 9, swimming in their pool, there all the others while yarning to one of them, a splendidly built lad golden brown in the sun, with eyes the colour of copper sulphate, and a face burned and finely freckled.  Met again those we were with in the earlier evening of June 28 - the dark Dutchman of the S.A.s - he of the slow lazy smile.
Rain again - at 10 p.m.  All day long at slow intervals, the booming of the heavies:  long distance guns on to the Boche's dumps about the Lep Valley?
Today two Frenchmen cycle 40 miles to the Estaminet here, to tell their people of the Boche attacking in Flanders on the 18th.
No Mail!!!

July 18271.A sky of green hazing to blue:  above Cassel one long thin cloud line of deep full blue:  the trees of the camp's field still and of silent loveliness.  An hour ago in the pool, and the water still warm from the day's sun.
Midday brought a wire from the Aisne-Marne front of French successes against the Boche's attack in force, and tonight another of further advances - 4000 prisoners and the Boche artillery retiring.
Today the guns quiet, the guns firing of yesterday all harassing.  No mail.
