<p>Thursday 13 September 1917</p>
<p>Alex<br/>Still no word of a boat. There are hundreds of officers including 4 Generals waiting for a passage. It is very disappointing still, I must not growl. 12 stone 10&frac12; I weigh now so nothing much wrong. <strike>Rumour has it that the 1914 men may get leave to Australia next year. The New Zealanders are getting theirs now.</strike>  Russian news today again bad, I wonder how much is true. It should be nearly the middle of NOVEMBER before I am back in the firing line &amp; much may happen ere then who knows. My Bronchitis is now CHRONIC &amp; I cannot stand the DUST.</p>
