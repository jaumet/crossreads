<p>The weather today is warm at least I should say the atmosphere is. The sky is clouded &amp; the sun bursts out for a second brightening everything up then disappears behind the ruthless scud.</p>
<p>Xmas Day<br/>25-12-16</p>
<p>Plenty of food puddings cakes sweets etc. plenty of champagne plenty of men "stunned' everybody happy and nothing interesting to write about.</p>
<p>Here endeth the last chapter of the old year.<br/>Good luck for the New.</p>
