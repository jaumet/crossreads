<p>27 May, 1916<br/>Kantara<br/>This morning we got our stuff transported &amp; loaded on the small gauge railway which goes near the camp at hill 70. &amp; now are waiting for the engine to come along &amp; take us off.  There is a rumour afloat that we are under orders to go to France &ndash; I hope its true but doubt it very much.</p>
