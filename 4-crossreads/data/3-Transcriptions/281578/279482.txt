<p>mishap, &amp; have the day free in the trench till night once more appears. Had a drink of rum as usual before daylight, after which I slept like a top for a few hours. It turned out a glorious sunny day at last. I took off my boots for a while &amp; wrote up my diary. Haven't had a wash or shave for 4 days, &amp; am yellow mud all over, it is 5 weeks since I had a bath or change, &amp; wouldn't one be a luxury. Gosh civil life will be like heaven again, if I have the luck to come through this awful business. Haven't seen Boo since Monday night, trust he's OK., they are not getting the shells in the front line  we are back here, &amp; if there's no hop over, I think he's pretty right, though one never knows what minute he'll be hit at this game. The skylarks sing up in the air, &amp; that's the only nice thing there is. The day passed very quietly, it was a lovely, sunny day, &amp; aeroplanes were constantly up. I was thrilled to see one for the first time on fire, I heard machine gun fire in the air &amp; looked up, &amp; there was a German machine with flames in the rear, 5 of our planes were up &amp; another German. The chap kept his nerve, brought his machine gracefully down with the flames growing bigger &amp; I expected it to collapse, but it was still descending</p>
