 "Somewhere in France" 17/iv/16 
 You will notice that we have arrived fairly near the scene of big events.  At present we are continuing our training but expect to go forward very shortly. 
 The weather here is still cool and wintry &amp; we feel the change very much after Egypt.  The French people have given us a most enthusiastic welcome &amp; I feel sure that Australia's name will quite safe in the hands of the men we have here.  I am feeling fit &amp; well &amp; think this life agrees with me.  Robby Peake went over to the53rd Batt.  I think he will get his Commission ere long.  Please excuse P/C but time is pressing as mail leaves tomorrow. 
 Kind regards M.C. Moors
