10/6/17 Paris
crowded with people and the trees with interlacing leaves formed an overhead canopy. The terraces and galleries were fine. Made now for the Pantheon pausing to buy some postcards on the way and noticed Rodins "Penseur" on the steps. Going inside the vastness of this heathen temple strikes one. It is domed and laid out in the form of a pure cross. The walls are wonderfully painted with representations of the life of Jean D?Arc (from which all inscriptions derogatory to English have been erased during the War) ? also a good deal of peinture of St Guinevere whose tomb was hereabouts. An old guide full of medals now started bawling "Pour visiter les tombeaux" in a peculiar voice and every one started to laugh at him. He then led us down many stairs to cool vaults like St. Pauls and there we saw Voltaires Victor Hugo's etc. etc. The old guide rolling off his story was very funny. Taxied home and on paying asked fare " 2 fr. Quarter vingt cinq", gave chauffeur 5 fr.
