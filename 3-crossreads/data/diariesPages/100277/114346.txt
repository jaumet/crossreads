About 200 yards from us there are great watering troughs, of an evening it is the sight of a lifetime to see the never ending strings of horses mules going to from the water they reckon there are 12,000 horses or mules in this valley I believe it. I pity the poor horses for they are bogged nearly half their time they are covered with mud from head to foot, in this rotten rainy weather they look very miserable they have to work very hard, toiling struggling all the day long dragging shells, water, tucker etc for the needs of the thousands of men who are engaged in this gigantic battle the guns never stop firing, just at the rear of us there are some enormous guns when they fire they fairly shake the hills. Trains are running everywhere up here they are building the line as they advance.
