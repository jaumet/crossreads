Just before leaving Blighty I saw a letter of Marg Burnetts to Tommy, telling me about things at Denegully & about how sad Una was. I do hope you have all got a peace of mind now, & can review old times in only a happy retrospect. 
 We get the sun here about once a fortnight, but to day is just glorious. Theres always an ice & frost coating to the earth each night tho', & the proverbial mud of this district is generally frozen.
