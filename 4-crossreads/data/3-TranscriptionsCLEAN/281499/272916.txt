I threw myself down in the cold dug out miserable & wet, & soon I was fast asleep, woke up about 10 & I had to make out a list of all those of the platoon who were killed wounded & missing they amounted to a little more than 1/2 my strength.After this I went over to Flers where our Medical Hqrs were to see the Dr about my leg he put the needle into me in case of lockjaw & bandaged it up properly I then went back to the Coy.The same afternoon ours guns opened a terrible bombardment & a couple of brigades of Australians made a most successful attack advancing nearly a 1000 yds & capturing 3 lines of German trenches, so they made up for our bit of bad luck.Our bombers had a very hot time
