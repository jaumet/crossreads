 June deal.  It is the Pilot's duty at all Australian harbours to come out to sea &amp; Pilot the ship through the entrances to her anchorage. 
 We entered the heads of Port Phillip &amp; anchored just inside opposite the Quarrantine Station. 
 June 21st 1919 At 9 o'clock the Quarrantine Authorities came aboard &amp; inspected the ship &amp; examined all the men to see if they had any signs of the "Flue" or any other disease amongst them.  As no sign of any disease was discovered the ship was pronounced clean.  At 10 a.m. we weighed anchor &amp; proceeded up the Bay towards Melbourne, arriving at about 1 p.m.  All the men are going to disembark at Melbourne.  The Queenslanders are going off first, then the New-South Welshmen, &amp; last of all the Victorians.  The quota for Queensland &amp; New-South-Wales are going overland to their destinations.  Two trains will be waiting on the wharf for us when we arrive. 
 At 2 p.m. we disembarked from the steamer straight on to the waiting trains
