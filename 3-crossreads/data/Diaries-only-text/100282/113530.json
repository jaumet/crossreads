While in there today I saw a most interesting sight, that was the "calling up" or beating the young French lads of the 1918 class 19 years old a great crowd were parading the streets all wearing the national colours carrying great Red white blue flags if ever you saw patriotic enthusiastic lads well these were, all singing laughing as if they were going to a picnic but this is the spirit of this wonderful magnificent people, I don't think anything will ever break their hearts I'm certain the Huns never will, I laughed when I saw a great crowd of young boys girls coming down the street hand in hand singing at the top of their voices in English, a little ditty which we often sing a mixture of French English, called( "Parley Voo") you would have thought they never had a care in the world. I felt sorry for these youngsters, little they know what they are so gladly coming to take part in.
