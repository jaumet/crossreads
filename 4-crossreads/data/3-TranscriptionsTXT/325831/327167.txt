 (Australians) we get back from the front; they were very plucky to go &ndash; wharf labourers, small farmers, miners &amp; so on; but they can't stand up to the wear &amp; tear of the front &amp; except that their example probably draws younger men along they ought not to be there; many of them don't last more than a few weeks hard service &amp; it is an economic mistake to send them all the way from Australia for that. 
 I told one wharf labourer from Sydney aged 49 I thought he was very plucky to come &amp; he said he was the means of inducing 50 of his mates to come away with him. However a couple of months in France invalided him back.
