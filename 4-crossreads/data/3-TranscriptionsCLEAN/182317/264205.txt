  
 of the R.A.S.G. including the C.C., M.O., D.O.. Please remember me to them. I don't suppose this letter will be posted till we are some days on shore. If possible I will try & give it to someone coming to Sydney to post there instead of waiting here. E.F.W. has been behaving himself fairly well so far. Much better in fact than I expected. Vick sends his best wishes to all the lads & wishes to be remembered to you. At present he is writing letters. He writes on an average twelve or thereabouts per day. But then of course the poor beggar is in love. It seems to agree with him, as he is looking in the pink. He and Mick Blacket are two love birds. They both write letters together & try to outstrip each other in number and density (if I may use the term) of their communications. I am off now to inspect the sentries. I expect I will end up by having a yarn with the ship's officer on the bridge. It is a treat up there at night but especially if we pass any shipping. Good night. Yours etc. E.C. New.
