[Xmas Day contd]7 pm I went ahead with the dressing.  After a long time we succeeded in doing up & the Show was a great success.  Alf Moss won the ladies prize as a girl & Perryman the gents as a Roman.  My outfit was considered very good also Dicks & reflected much credit on him for his work in making.  Felt like bed after the Show.

At night 8 of us (all old boys except one) they were: Zocchi Wagstaff Lawless Rex Baker Holland Pickering & self had a fine dinner at an adjoining farmhouse and spent an enjoyable evening.
