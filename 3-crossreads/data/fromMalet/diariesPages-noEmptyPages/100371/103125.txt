Receiving any attention are slowly falling to pieces. There is a Tank about  a mile away, abandoned. Saturday fine a few big shells came over, Taubes also, Sunday misty, heavy frost , heaviest yet, it looks pretty on the battered trees. There is a tree observation post outside the dug-out (old one) on night duty tonight, pushing trucks, wounded men on board, which run on light railway lines, from A.D.S. to "Villa" Station about 2 miles, we were lucky in getting pulled nearly the whole distance by the motor which uses the line.
Duty from 7PM to 7AM Monday 12th fine. Tuesday we left Martinpuich at 5.30 AM for A.D.Post, exposed position about 2 miles away, we have to carry during the night, nothing doing to night. Wednesday 14th Feb. still fine, snow is disappearing slowly. The dug out we are in is a good one fair size. Thursday 15 fine still quiet, no call for my squad last night, this last week we have been on shorter rations 1 loaf
