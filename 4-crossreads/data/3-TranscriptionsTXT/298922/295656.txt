Letter from MAY dated 5/11/17 & addressed Captain Weir. I've been a MAJOR for a year now - she asks Charlie TYSON'S rank it is Captain & M.C. Another lot of Parcels arrived tonight viz. Camphor ICE, Shortbread PLUM PUDDING Butterscotch & Cream in one & in the other from Home I found MITS, SOKS, Muffler, Butter Scotch, Cough drops, Sardines Toffee etc:- so I am well supplied & just for Xmas too thank you all so much for the work you do in packing & thinking & buying these things. Went Church.
