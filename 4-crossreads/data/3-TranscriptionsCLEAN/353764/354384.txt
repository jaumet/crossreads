  
 the Proprietor & saw my Photo in same. We also had good cause to complain of a letter put in the Sydney Evening News, referring to the A.S.C. as Alley Slopers Cavalry & that we had not been near the front, & every one here is feeling very indignant that they should print such a fabrication, anyway there is no one here that will buy an Evening News anymore. 
 18/1/16 Nothing of much note.  Still no mail & am beginning to give up hope of any.  Company have gone out on a big march & consequently have not much to do. Aeroplanes are very active but we can only guess why.  Big Battle fought in Mesopotamia ending in a rout of the Turks.  War news generally, very good. 
 19.1.16 to 31/1/16 X Chasing Turks Very dull days & nothing whatever to write about.  To-day I received a few letters & felt a wee bit disappointed that there were not more.
