 which they are written has its story, these upon some pages of a Field Service note book, these upon official French Railway forms gathered from a shell-shattered railway station, these on paper provided by the Australian Comforts Fund or the Y.M.C.A., and others too, traceable by their style to purchase in French villages and cities and the not infrequent arrival of writing paper in parcels from Australia and England.  The writing is sometimes in ink, oftener inpencil and that standby of the soldiers, indelible ink-pencil, all the writing is decipherable but some now with difficulty. 
   
    I have asked myself why the year 1917 is represented by the most letters, the year 1916 next and the years 1918-1919 by the least, the explanation must be that 1916 and 1917 contained most of novelty and that 1918 being a year of furious campaigning provided fewer opportunities, and, by that time, one had almost settled to war as an occupation, while the prospects of return home constantly dimiinished, and the home-ties unconsciously became lighter; 1919 was of course spent in awaiting repatriation, non-military employment in London and in the return home. 
   
    The inspiration to collect these letters and have them typewritten came from Major J.L.Treloar, the Director of the Australian War Memorial, who by letter requested such records and has kindly stated that he has found in them the material for which the institution is searching.
