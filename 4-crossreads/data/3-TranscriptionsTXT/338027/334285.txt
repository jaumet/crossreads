 Sunday, 13th December, 1914 We awoke much refreshed &amp; had the same breakfast watered &amp; fed our horses who had enjoyed rolling in the sand.  The rest of the day we were on fatigue duty.  All as stiff as door posts, trudging about in the sand.  Maadi itself is a lovely place, an oasis in the desert and there are beautiful drives &amp; gardens &amp; villas the property of wealthy English &amp; French &amp; Americans who winter here, but we are on the desert with all the Australians but the Vic Infantry &amp; L.H., they are at the Pyramids &amp; the N.Z. at Heliopolis. 
 We are delighted with the news that five German cruisers have been sunk to date. 
 Harold's birthday Monday, 14th December, 1914 Wish him many happy returns of the day.  The Reveille &amp; calls of the Queenslanders are far superior to Vic trumpeters. 
 Although days are warm nights are cold.  In the morning we took the horses for a four mile trudge in the sand.  The rest of the day was spent in lecturing &amp; fatigue.  We heard to-day that the 2nd Aust Contingent had disbanded &amp; was not coming they being held by payment as reservists.  It does not look as if we will see much.  Some say we will be home in 3 mos.
