<p>The road here is very narrow, &amp; in many places a steep drop into the wadi and 4 horses fell over in the night one of them being killed. Orders were recd to make a personal reconnaissance down the Shunet Nimrin Road, with a view to an attack on the Turkish Position in conjunction with the 5th Mounted Brigade. Instructions were given to advance on foot two miles down the road, leaving the horses behind; after having advanced about 1&frac12; miles a Helio message was recd from the Yeomanry, asking assistance as 100 Turks were advancing on their position in the East of the road. "A" Sqdn under Major Patrick was sent to hold the hill. Later Hqtr [?] recd instructions to return to horses &amp; move up to Amman Rd &amp; take up a line between the 7th LH Regt &amp; the right of 3rd Bgde, as the enemy were apparently concentrating for an attack here. We got into position about 4 oclock commanding the approach to Amman. Several scattered bodies of the enemy, both Infantry &amp; Mounted men, were in positions some 2000 yds to our front, though up to the present nothing more serious than a considerable amount of sniping was going on. About 700 yds in front of centre of our position was a steep ridge which we had orders to hold.</p>
