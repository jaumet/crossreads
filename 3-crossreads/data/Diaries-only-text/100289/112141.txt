Slowed down in vicinity of Marseille about 6 AM took the pilot on board. Entered harbour moored 8 AM. Wonderful harbour for its size; traffic very congested, great activity in around the port; Numbers of German prisoners working on the wharves under guard. Left ship with baggage guard 1.30 pm, entrained 5.30. Country around Marseilles very fine. Miramas first station of importance, quite a treat to travel through such country after what we have experienced for the past 6 months. Days very long sun sets about 9 pm it is daylight till almost 10 pm
