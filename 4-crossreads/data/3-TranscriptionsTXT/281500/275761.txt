 full pack up, we had not far to walk however and soon reached our next village "St Sauveur sur Somme" a fair sized French village and much better than the one we had left, this village is built on both sides of the Somme and a small bridge connects the two, the Somme runs very fast here and they have a fine canal built on one side and on the other the railway runs, the town of Amiens is only 9 kilometres from here you can see her spires quite easily it is a great industrial district and factories are everywhere, there is a big electrical station quite close to us. Before letting us into our billets the Capt gave the boys a small lecture and told them that if they did not behave themselves, they would be marched straight back to Friemont and nobody liked the idea of that.
