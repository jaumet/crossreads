FEBRUARY 1917
24 SATURDAY
Fine & fairly warm & not so misty
as usual. I went up to the
new baths at Erquingham
for a bath in the morning & cleaning
harness ect in afternoon. There
were several inspections by
Capt Campbell during the day
but everything was all right.
I got a mouth organ for Bill
Constable in morning & the bit
of music livens things up
a bit in the hut.
 
If you are "down in the mouth"
cheer up!!! Remmember Jonah
he came up all right.
