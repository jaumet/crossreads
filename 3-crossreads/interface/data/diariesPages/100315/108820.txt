24/4/18 ? Lavieville
a m.g. could hardly have failed to knock a number. Brian Winston son of Right Rev. Bishop was wounded in the scalp and had to be evacuated. Wandered round to the right and out to our listening post where was old Thomas of "A" Coy. His hard old criminal face would scare of any Boche I warrant. A few growls about rations. Really they are good but Billjim always growls on principal. Walked out into No Mans Land and saw where Barker was killed. It was late before we returned back to Bn. H.Q. for a cup of tea then to bed.
