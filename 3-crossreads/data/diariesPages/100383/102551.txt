January & February 1917
after fixing us up with a tent sent a dixie of tea & an issue of rum. Next morning we had breakfast & set off for the battalion. We reached Highwood East & there was a platoon from each company there on fatigue work & my platoon was there out of "A" Coy. Our stay only lasted a short while but during the stay we had to push rations & engineers gear up near the firing line on the small tramway (Last). We received orders to move late in the afternoon of the 31st & the platoon moved up to Cough Drop & our duties here were to carry miners gear from the dump to advance company Headquarters & making saps out to the outposts. On the afternoon of the 4th of February, the platoon moved back to Highwood but I had to report to Coy H Qtrs & stayed the night & next day in a big dug out near supports. That night the 5th I was given six men & went to the firing line & took over No. 23 post. It was the flank post of the company & I had to report to "C" Copy ever second hour. We had it very cold while in the line & we used to get hot stew & tea of a night & hot tea about 4 am including a rum issue at midnight. We only did twenty four hours in the line & next night we were releived & went back to supports at Coy H Qtrs for twenty four hours.
