<p>22/11/15<br/>stunt or fair dinkum hurling of flesh &amp; blood Australians  against barbed wire entanglements before winter starts.</p>
<p>Noticed when on beach today how large and impressive the cruiser &amp; hospital ships appear from that level.  Looking down on them from the trenches they are diminutive.  Elicited information that Abdul's stands to at similar hours to us. Mules are coming down pass again today.  We hope to open on them with machine <br/>gun when good targets arise.  Wastage of war.  Two months ago we put 100 men on a detached job, only 64 are now there the remainder killed wounded or evacuated sick from the peninsular.  Tait &amp; Dexter (6th) looked in.  Remarked on tired out, washed out, strained anxious look in our faces &ndash; the very thing we noted in theirs on taking over.  Deep set tired eyes<br/>Bed 2015  Constantly disturbed during night, messages alarms and excursions &ndash; the signallers seemed to live in my dugout.</p>
<p>23/11/15<br/>Very bleak.  Enemy snipers crept out again.  Will try &amp; trap them if prisoners could be taken without noise.  Cold again.  Will try for Imbros again.  Busy censoring during the morning  very cold and 1200 met my party at Bde HQ and proceeded to beach.  About 150 others waiting there.  In doubt for a long time since whether trip would take place however.  NTO stated trawler had left Imbros at 1400 and we should leave at 1530.  Later warned from [indecipherable] boat filled there.  Long wait.  "Captn Kettle" very active and Wilkins on M.L.O.  Other naval men a fine type.  "Grafton" cruiser in</p>
