<p>returned to him. I don't know why my letters have been messed up like that. I haven't been away from the Batt since last Dec so they should find me. The weather still keeps good here to Fritzes regret. I haven't seen any thing of Harold Arnold so far have been expecting to run across him but dare say I shall find him eventually. Louise said in her last letter Frank had met Jack across here so he has been more fortunate than I have. I haven't had any news of him for some time now. Well father there is absolutely no news to tell you so will have to close will write again shortly Love &amp; best wishes to all<br/>Your sincere son  Clyde</p>
