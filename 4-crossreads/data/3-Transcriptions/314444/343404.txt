<p>[Newspaper cutting from The Sun, 1919]<br/>Daring Aussie Airmen<br/>"Stunts" over London<br/>("The Sun's" Special Representative)<br/>London, April 25.</p>
<p>The "Westminster Gazette" says that Australian airmen during the Anzac Day celebrations carried their aeroplaning to the point of discomfort.</p>
<p>Referring to the Sopwith machine, which it calls "a little red devil," that paper says that it threatened to ram the steeple of St. Mary le Strand, and to cut off the flagstaff on Australia House, but always dodged the risks, and returned mockingly like a cheeky street urchin.</p>
<p>The "Globe" described the antics of the Sopwith as delightful.</p>
<p>The newspapers agreed that the Australian airmen's exhibition of flying was the best seen in London. One machine danced a sort of aerial quadrille, occasionally suggesting imminent collisions.</p>
<p>The pilot of the small high-speed Sopwith thrilled the startled crowds looping and nose-diving above the Mansion House.</p>
