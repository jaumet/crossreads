<p>destination.  Boys almost drank the village dry after the muster parade at 7 pm.</p>
<p>Sunday 17.6.17<br/>No parade, dont take a fancy to the position where we are camping.  Walked to Henencourt &amp; Millencourt at night.  Mail Day.</p>
<p>Monday 18.6.17<br/>Capt Irving left us to take up a position in "Blighty".  All sorry to lose him, has kept the unit together &amp; made it what it is to-day.  Very heavy hail storm.</p>
