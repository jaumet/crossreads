  
 Monday 17 March 1919 Red Sea Boat drill & education classes but as the latter are voluntary, the average soldier thinks he has learnt enough. Fresh Breeze & cooler.  We get up at 0530 & have half an hour physical jerks.  It is a treat to eat good meat again -all N.Z. frozen mutton & Beef as the Ulimaroa was last there.
