  
 So many starts which are of course caused by interruptions, of this I start once more to write at 7,45 on the 3 January 1916 in the morning. 
 Last night we had the most unusual of all thing in Egypt - rain - with result that the desert ground is hard this morning and free from dust. It is cloudy and cold this morning but promises to be sunny by noon. Grey mist broods on the distant edges of the world. Color has vanished for ever in the Aromatic East, if the golden sun be hidden a Glory passed from the land. On looking up from this letter as I sit here, I can see through the tents opening, away to the west, those old pyramids which are Egypt's trade mark. 
 I have pitched my tent purposely in a position which allows me to see them from sunrise to sunset. I have a strong idea that they at last mean fortune and good luck to me. You see how soon my Eastern temperament fits in with the mystery of the East 
 Much love to you dear Mother and to all. my daily duty has to be done and time flys like as elsewhere your loving son Geoff
