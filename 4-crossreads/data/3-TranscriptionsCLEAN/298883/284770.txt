8th Aug.
We rose at 3 a.m. and had a hot meal.  We moved off in the misty morn across a large wheatfield the weeds smelling rank almost to suffocation from the amount of moisture taken in from the dewy night.
We learned to our genuine disappointment last night that we are not to take an active part in this battle as we our brigade has been allotted the position of Reserve Brigade to the division.  Very likely we will see no fighting at all as it looks as if everything is going to run off smoothly.  However time will tell and we are ready anyway.  Our guns began a smart tattoo up around Villers Bretonneux
