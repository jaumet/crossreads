<p>26.3.16<br/>Sun 26th<br/>Route marches were cut out today on account of the Sabbath, &amp; an message was delivered to Major Smith at 2 oclock this afternoon by a messenger from Tukh-El-Khail with the result that A &amp; B troop had orders to be ready at 4 oclock to move out on patrol, &amp; it set us wondering whether the aeroplanes had seen anything or not;  Men were also sent out from Ezbet-Soo-Doun &amp; Tukh-El-Khail</p>
<p>Smithers arrived back from the Sig School &amp; brought back a 1st Class Signallers Certificate with him, &amp; as old Joe Tomlinson also got his, I am inclined to think that the exam is not a very hard one;  Tomlinson got drunk at Cairo &amp; missed the train coming home</p>
