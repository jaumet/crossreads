 After a    quilt  quiet night with only intermittent firing we take    a  stock of the position Our trenches are on the ridge *   &amp;  the Turks are on a ridge opposite about 200 yds away   &amp;  the valley in between is covered with dead bodies of Australians and Turks. At other parts the distance between the Turks   &amp;  us is only from 15 to 30 yds   &amp;  at night both parties throw hand bombs into each others defences * Pope's Hill
