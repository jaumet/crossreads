yards in front of the front rank of their companies, and the King passed within five feet of me, yes, and as he passed he asked Major-General Monash - "Are all these from Victoria?"  Then the March Past in the same formation as that day at Campbellfield.  I called my platoon to "Eyes right" and chucked the King a salute, he chucked it back, then eyes front and away to a position near the road, and as the King passed we gave three hearty cheers; I took a snapshot at that time and managed too to get in my cheers.  The King is just as he is pictured, perhaps a little worn in appear-ance and not by any means a vital personality; I like him, did so at once, for he is quite unaffected and has a fine voice.  I'm hoping for a good photo but am somewhat fearful, for the light was poor, in fact it drizzled nearly all the afternoon and we arrived home very wet.
   A patrolling biplane very obligingly "looped the loop" above the crowd, several times, and earned the approval of our boys.  The biplanes are seen here quite often and also in quantities for one morning I observed sixteen of them rising above the Royal Flying School at Netheravon, they seem to fly away all over the country on their tests and may be seen again flying overhead in the evening, their heads turned like homing birds in the direction of Netheravon.
   Now I'll close with warmest greetings from a cold place.
