<p>100 feet we arrived at an ancient and pretty town on the summit of the hill called "Cassell" here is the army head quarters leaving this we go through another village the I forget.</p>
<p>We eventually arrived at our destination and am again billeted with my unit in a barn with an estaminet next door. The night is very cold.</p>
<p>Friday. Oct 20th<br/>A very heavy frost greeted us this morning and tickled us up properly.</p>
<p>I went to see the church here (about the only place of interest and wood carving in the interior was wonderful and the church dates back to 1260.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I visited a large British Aredrome not far away I believe it is the finest in France and there many of the latest types of largest planes ranging up to 300 hp. It is a busy scene as the machines are arriving and leaving constantly.</p>
<p>There are also 300 German prisoners of war here</p>
