to relate he was not spared to see the action through. &nbsp;He was killed at about 4.30 a.m. on the morning of the 19th May. &nbsp; Death was instantaneous and was caused by a splinter of a shell piercing his head. &nbsp;His body was reverently buried the following morning Chaplain McKenzie of the 4th battalion officiating at the graveside. &nbsp;Needless to say his loss is keenly felt in the regiment. &nbsp;Personally the loss is very severe. &nbsp;We had been closely associated in the same company since the regiment was formed and had become good friends.
(I [ ]&nbsp;details about his personal belongings).
If I am spared through this campaign I will call on &nbsp;you and give &nbsp;you any information I can. &nbsp;Again deploring the loss of a brave soldier.
Yours sincerely
