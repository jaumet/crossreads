Sat 20th JulyIn my spare time I had a read of some of the Intelligence which I kept in my Office, and the news was very interesting. I began to see daylight, as the saying goes. This job will do me for the Duration. I am always to be in the office incase I am wanted, and I have to be polished up like a new pin, but that is not difficult as I am never near any mud etc.
Sat 3rd August.The Draftsman is due back from Blighty today. I don't wish him any harm, only I would [like] to hear that he has gone into the Hospital with some trouble. Stiffitis has set in.
He has returned and I have been told to return to my section. (So this is the end of a perfect job.)
Sun 4th AugustTook a load of Machine Gun ammunition up to Villers Brettoneux, and while unloading Fritz was bursting Coal Boxes over head. The Dirty Dog. Coming home I nearly knocked over a tank or should I say the tank nearly knocked us over.
