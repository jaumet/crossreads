Late in the evening Fritz put a great deal of shrapnel over into the town &amp; wounded a number on the streets.<br/>Voluntarily went down on duty bent, but fortunately found none who required attention, while there had a look around the ruins of the church which was still burning.  Buildings on both sides of the street burning fiercely.</p>
