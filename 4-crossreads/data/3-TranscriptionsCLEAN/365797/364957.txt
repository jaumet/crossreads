with Ethel.
It is such lovely weather just at present & to look out over the tennis court (which Father has just put in order) in the moon-light it is hard to bring oneself to believe that "some where in France" such a terrible war is raging & so many many of our finest boys are being killed. Last week news came through that Alan Blackett had died of wounds & they are very sad over the way.
Bill is expecting to go into lunch with Trannie Lovegrove at Hampton Court where she is staying at present & finds it much more to her liking than quiet Lindfield. She has had the operation for her eyes & is so happy to be able to read & knit again.
Dear Bill is getting a big boy fast & is not so easily managed as he was. Miss Huntly has his music in hand & we hope that before he gets old enough to positively hate her he may have got over the worst drudgery of music & be ready to go on with some one else.
