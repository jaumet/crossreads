<p>am quite satisfied to return. I would have liked to have spent Xmas in England now as it is so close. But there are bigger things ahead than Xmas dinner so we mustent complain. Well we are moving camp again on Friday all the Australians here are to go to Lark Hill. This will be the fifth camp I have been in since leaving Hospital I must say am sick of this moving camp. It doesent appeal to me in the least. The weather is still very cold across here but havint had any rain for some time the ground is dry. Oh what a treat it is to be abel to walk about without slushing through mud. Well Father this is only a scribble shall write your from Lark Hill. I think there is an Australian mail leaving here tonight &amp; want to catch it. Love to all from Your sincere son Clyde</p>
