<p>On board I think we are lucky we are alive at all.<br/>17th Arrived at Fremantle but as there is supposed to be flu aboard we are not allowed to land. The W.A.s were taken off  on small boats during the afternoon and we were left to gaze on the nice water and lovely sharks which circled the ship. I guess no guard will be required while these ugly monsters are about.<br/>26th After a good trip we arrived at S Melbourne and anchored at Portsea<br/>27th All hands were transferred to the quarantine station where we will undergo quarantine for a fortnight</p>
