to supply that.Yesterday afternoon Jock Mackie took up a collection among the Sergts, for our Imperial Instructor Jock Knowles, a jolly fine chap, it appears he has drawn no pay for a couple of months & is still  2..10 in debt, this is a fair slap in the British Army, for he only receives 3/6 a day & he is a C.S.M. old Jock did not like taking it, but he recognised the spirit it was given in & accepted it.., when we get it all in, the total will be about  10. Jock Knowles is a bit different to the other Imperial Instructor we have attached to us, for he is hated by officers NCO.s & men & don't think he will last very long here
