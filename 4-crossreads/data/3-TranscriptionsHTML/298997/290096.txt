<p>June 12<br/>These are the entries in my little Red X diary :-</p>
<p>June 7<br/>At 8 am. left for Borre &amp; the line: didn't report sick; lasted march, but dropped at finish &ndash; dizzy &amp; sick, and unable to eat.</p>
<p>June 8<br/>Doctor says "Debility", &amp; sends me out.  At 3rd Fd Amb. doctor suspects Malaria, but endorses debility.  Arrived No 15 C.C.S. doctor says "shell-shock, and debility".</p>
<p>June 9th<br/>N.Y.D. Pulmonary Tuberculosis"  Oh Hell!</p>
<p>June 11th<br/>Ambulance train to No 2 Canadian Stationary Hospital.</p>
<p>The doctor told me I was to report before the Batt moved out for the line, but naturally I didn't.  Geo Abrams, (the Sergt) said that I could not last the march but I managed, although the whole world seemed staggering for the last few miles; and I was just reminding George that I had told him I <u>could</u> last the march, when I flopped.</p>
<p>I had the upper bunk in the ambulance going back; and the top of the cover had nice holes in it where shrapnel or something had hit it.  It was nice to look at this while we were pulled up near 1st Brigade Headquarters near which Fritz was throwing heavy stuff &amp; shrapnel.  We were pulled up for an hour there.  I got dopey</p>
