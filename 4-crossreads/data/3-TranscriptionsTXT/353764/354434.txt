elements we saw some lights ahead & on reaching them found we were at Pont-de-Koubbeh.  We then had to ride about 3 miles out towards the Nile so as to skirt the Camel Encampment & head for Helmieh Siding.  On reaching here we dismounted & handed our horses to an Arab to mind & had a Cup of Tea & Cakes.  We then struck out through the Desert & after a further hours stumbling ride, reached Camp, very tired & our horses completely blown out.
30.3.16 ThursdayThis is now our second week on Bully Beef & we are beginning to get a little tired of same.  The only Vegetables we can get are Onions & if I am spared to get back again I don't think I will ever look at them again, I am so tired of them.  Some of the men are breaking out in Pimples & Boils, through the constant supply of "Bully" so I am going to cut it out for a few days & live on Bread & Golden Syrup, which is a kind of universal food to us.  The "Tea" which which we all call Soapy water has now come to an end & thank goodness we are getting decent stuff.
