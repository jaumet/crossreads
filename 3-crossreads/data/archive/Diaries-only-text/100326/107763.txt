19/9/15 Sunday morning.Parsons unable to get congregations, all on duty but RC's turned out somehow. Went up trenches with Stewart lovely sunny but cool morning only an occasional shot or shell. Went into secret observation post ? very cunningly placed overlooking German Officers position of enemy. This post quite concealed from their view but a good telescope mounted there. They are only about 200 yards away. Seem to be short of sandbags as they use black kitbags full of earth and blankets sewn up at the corners. Entanglements overhead cover together with the nature of the ground make their position impregnable. All the way up and over the hill are layers of earthworks. Work going on at top could see shovels going and two Turks in turbans and robes engaged tramping the earth down as it was thrown up. Too far to bother having a shot at them. Walked along and inspected the crater with periscope. They are close enough there but nothing would be gained by our getting to them ? bombs do our work. 
Yarning to Thomsen and some of the men. They said in one post they could not get enough cover as a piece of earth was projecting. Ordered it to be taken away. The sea very tranquil ? looking down into the depths shrapnel valley the men look like ants moving about and the extreme neatness of the whole place from here to the beach show what organization does. All rubbish is burned in incinerators. If as many thousands of ordinary civilians were camped here one shudders to think the condition the place would be in now with tins and papers to say nothing of sanitary arrangements. Memo. descend to shafts by ropes.
