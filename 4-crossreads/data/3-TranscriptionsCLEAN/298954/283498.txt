  
 Sun. 15th July (cont.) After the crew were aboard a couple of bombs were placed fore and aft, kerosene was poured everywhere, & the ropes holding the deck cargo (lumber) in position were cut. 
 The bombs blew the poop & foc'sl up, the flames quickly spread all over the vessel.   The raider steamed away when the sails & cordage were in flames. 
 Sat. 28th July The cruise on the Suva-Sydney track was finally abandoned some 6 days ago, the "Wolf" steamed up West of the Fiji Group and we sighted what is believed to be one of the Solomons this morning.   Hove to cleaning the hull from the ship's boats in afternoon. 
 Life on board has become much more endurable for we prisoners lately.   The period of punishment came to an end one night when the doctor visited us and found us gasping from the heat & with the floor of the hold wet with sweat.
