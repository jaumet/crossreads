Bailleul is one of those which he captured from the Russians when he made his smashing offensive against them.
Rumours of a British reverse at the Somme
A.F.A. on the move. Capt W  & D have gone on operating team duty to Rouen
Major Mc. made a Lt Col and transferred to No 2 A.G.H.in Boulogne.
D.I. on leave to Paris. Rumour that all leave is now stopped  Major B. has taken over the duties of Surgeon Specialist. March 28th.While walking along the road from the C.C.S. to Metaren, the thought struck me, was it possible that this road and the neighbouring fields might very soon be a battle field. If rumour be true, and the signs of the times portend anything, I have a strange premonition that a retirement is going to take place. This will mean that this place will be fought over. To-night while on duty in the O.T. I got orders to pack up the O.T. gear for transport the next day. The Sgt who gave me the order told me that Fritz had broken through to Amiens
It was hard, after all our labour in getting to-gether such a good C.C.S. as this, then to have to break it up. Walking along the road the other day, I could not help but admire the way it was laid out  The uncle of M who had a farm near the Bailleul Station was killed
