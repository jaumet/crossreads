Monday, 7 June, 1915During the day the three men that bolted and went ashore at Gaba Tepe were brought back, they had been stretchers bearing from the firing line to the beach and doing great work yet the Col gave them 28 days detention.  They told us all the latest news including the rumour that on Sunday night Sed el Bahr & Achi Baba were taken by the British and lost again with heavy casualties through the French retreating when hardly pressed.  A party of us rowed back to the Galeka to get stores and there we saw the remnants of A section the other half going on the Canada [?] under Major Helsham.  The coy is now split into 4 sects A,B,C,D  transports it is disgusting the whole brigade is singing out about the way the Col treats us, but we have to grin and bear it and warm his cold feet.
Tuesday, 8 June.Had  fine concert on promenade deck at night promed [performed?] by the officers  I got a [indecipherable].  I frankly liked the Englishmen as an [indecipherable]. Left the boat to go ashore at last minute a bag full of old mail came for us it was a Godsend  I got several letters & a paper some fellows got none.  I always feel sorry for them.  letters from home are the greatest blessing on active service.  After drifting around the harbour in a lighter we finally landed and found tents already pitched on the top of a hill with No 2 Stat.[ionary] Hosp.  We had to unload etc and by this time it was tea, after tea we were paid a small advance and allowed down into the village, more about this later.  we are right on the sea and will be able to have any amount of swimming.  Three lines of Trenches have been taken on the road to Achi Baba.
