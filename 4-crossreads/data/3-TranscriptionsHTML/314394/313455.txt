<p>1st Jan. 1916  New Years Day was spent at Mudros which is the port of Lemnos Island. It rained heavily and nearly all tents were flooded. At midnight flares saved from Gallipoli were fired up into the air. The 5th,6th and 7th Brigades were camped near the harbour, the ground was undulating, exposed and stony. Fresh water was difficult to obtain. I was in B Company at the time and in charge of No 6 Platoon. Visited the small village of Condia. Population appears to be about two thousand. People of two distinct classes. The peasant class dress in sheepskins, baggy pantaloons, black hair, sallow complexion, slow deliberate, swinging walk and older men always carry sticks.<br/>The better class have intellectual faces, and a quick brisk walk.
