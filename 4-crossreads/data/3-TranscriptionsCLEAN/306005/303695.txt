11-1-17parcel & left Ismailia at 2 oclock arriving at Kantara at 3 PM, crossed the Canal & took my time walking to the station to catch the train to El Arish & when I got there found I had to wait till 6 PM to catch a train; while waiting a Hospital train came in from El Arish loaded with wounded soldiers (mostly leg & arm wounds) from one of the lads I heard Major Irwin & Lieut Tony Hordern* were both wounded & a good many other ranks also, but they managed to take Rafa & captured all in it. The train to El Arish left at 6 oclock & had to change trains at Romani & again at Mazar & riding all night on a load of sleepers.
*Tony Hordern is at present in the officers ward. Major Lewis was hit the same day, some are returning to Australia tomorrow. J.M.T.
