<p>Dear Mrs. Read,<br/>Many thanks for your letter &amp; card.  It was good of you to remember me &amp; I must apologise for not having written before.  When I got back from the Peninsular there was a pile of letters for me &amp; I have been working them off by degrees.  I have been back at work for a fortnight now &amp; we are so hard at it that I don't get very much time to write especially as I spend most of my spare time with mother &amp; the girls.  It is great having them here.  It was almost like coming home to</p>
