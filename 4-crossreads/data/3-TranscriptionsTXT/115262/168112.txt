Tuesday 11 December 1917.
In a standing camp as it is termed. A few parades which bore everyone but most Corporals & officers that always glory in same, after some weeks in the firing line.
On a fatigue that will last a day or so. All our sick camels have been taken to Beelah.
["Camel itch" is being fought against now]
