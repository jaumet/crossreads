 you have my address M.Gun Sect 
 Needless to say nearly all we had were the kind likely to go off so on they went &amp; we all felt very thankful to be rid of them I may have more luck later on the war isent over yet nor an I. I am having a book sent you father to the office called the Anxac book dealing with the war there. I haven't seen it myself   our officers have the military are taking orders for it so it should be good. Or I should say we give this order through our officer. Well father I am afraid there isent much in this but I want to write Miss Smith so have to try &amp; think of something to tell her. Will write you again shortly when we get back a bit when the shells don't trouble us. I believe when I get back to Sydney if I hear the old one oclock gun go off I will be listening to catch the direction of the shell All love from  your sincere son Clyde
