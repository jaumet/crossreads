<p>Sydney beat the Emden.  Some cases of <u>Crabs</u> on board.  There must be some charm about Nap. judging by the number who play it on board.</p>
<p>21.3.16<br/>Lost my wristlet watch today but found it again unluckily the glass was broken.  Inoculated again today. God only knows when they will stop this nonsense.  With the restrictions they are now putting on letters I wonder at any of them going through.  We were told to advise the O.C. about the amount of Egyptian money we would require.</p>
<p>22.3.16<br/>Passed a dead whale this morning.  We both smelt &amp; seen him.  Last mail for Sydney tonight to be sent from Colombo.  Hot as blazes &amp; sea like glass.  Beautiful sun sets now every night the best part of the day is the hour 5.30 to 6.30 P.M.</p>
