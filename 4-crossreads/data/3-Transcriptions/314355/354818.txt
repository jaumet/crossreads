<p>May 27, 28<br/>168.<br/>A long day of broken working:  maps rolled for distributing to unit H.Q.s, minor clerking, printing notes for adding to Sheet 36 A.N.E. &ndash; the map of our area corrected to May 22, printing from map press and pasting to map headings:  still about 50 to do, and a folio made for Patrol Maps.</p>
<p>Mail up by Blue D. from La Kreule from T.B.C., J.C. Squire's "The Gold Tree", a beautiful edition with title page by Spare, and type of the style of The Riccardo Press.</p>
<p>A day of full sun loveliness:  a crime to deny by working.</p>
