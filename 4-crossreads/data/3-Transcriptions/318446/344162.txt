<p>length of front we have to hold.<br/>The complete absence of enemy aircraft has got everyone wondering.  We have not seen a Turkish plane for nearly three weeks now.<br/>Heavy explosions were heard not long ago &amp; it is conjectured that the Turks are blowing up their ammunition dumps.

<p>Bir Arnusi<br/>Dec. 1st  1916<br/>We have not gone yet, having been delayed, for some reason or other.
