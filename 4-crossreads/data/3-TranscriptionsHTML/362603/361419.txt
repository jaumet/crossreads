<p>Red Cross letterhead.<br/>5.  The Harbert Girls were the first on the Terrace this year.  The Youngest &amp; Eldest are fat like Dot Nelson &amp; would make the Toboggan fly.  They are all great sports &amp; the two stout girls swim in a mill stream with the water like Ice during the summer months.  In the afternoon, I sat on the mat &amp; talked till 4 pm &amp; then had to run like Billy-Oh for my Train.  I just caught it &amp; having an Hour to spare, I got the Tube to the Strand &amp; had a walk around.<br/>As my watch was slow</p>
