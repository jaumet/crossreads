<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>Just a few lines before I leave for the front It is now 12 midday &amp; we will be at them by midnight so we are only a few hours off Well I hope I have good luck. Don't feel frightened I will be alright There are hundreds of us going and we are all in great spirits. Remember me to all my friends &amp; tell the single chaps they are all wanted.<br/>The boys from our way have made a wonderful name here &amp; we are going to keep it up. The Turks have a great fear of them. We are all in great condition &amp; very anxious to get over &amp; at them. We will be hard at them to take Archi Baba The Hill that will make all the difference if we take it.<br/>Good by my dear Father &amp; Mother and Dear Dorothy<br/>With all my love &amp; kisses I am ready for the worst. From your loving Son off to do his duty<br/>Tom.</p>
