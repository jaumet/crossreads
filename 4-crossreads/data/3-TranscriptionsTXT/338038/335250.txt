 Belgium 4.9.1916 My dear Father 
 Very many thanks for yours of 10th July just received. It is awfully rotten hearing that my letters have not been reaching you as I keep them going as regularly as circumstances will permit, and you should never have a gap of more than a fortnight without hearing. Sis has also not been hearing regularly, and they only found out 3 weeks ago from my letters that I was in France. She is wildly excited at the prospect of my getting a trip over to them, and I hope it will come off. I would give anything to see them all. Perhaps when things settle down for the winter I may get across. There is too much doing just now to hope for it.
