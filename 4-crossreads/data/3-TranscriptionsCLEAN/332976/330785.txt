It is a fairly large hospital & filled with Australians & Tommies with "trench feet," influenza, "septic feet," slight wounds, Larringiters, Bronchitas, & pneumonia & a few other minor complaints in the order mentioned.  Last night was very cold & there is about 4" of ice on the water. 26th   I am still in the same ward & progressing very favourably.  Last night & the night before have been bitterly cold & everything is frozen even the medicines in the bottles.  There is over 6" of ice on
