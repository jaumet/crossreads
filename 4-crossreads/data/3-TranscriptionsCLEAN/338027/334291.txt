  
 Friday, 25th December, 1914 Yes, Xmas Day in Egypt far from dear old Australia, I wish all my dear friends & relations the happiest of Xmas in such awful circumstances.  Xmas morning all the men went out for a ride around Maadi, I stopped home & with a few others went to morning service & heard a fine sermon the text of which was "Behold, I bring you good tidings" & my earnest wish is that the long expected Xmas mail from Aust will do so.  We sat down to Xmas dinner for the first time in our new mess room.  Our dinner was composed of boiled meat & potatoes & some tinned fruit.  In the p.m. I went for a long walk with some mates around an ancient village. 
 Saturday, 26th December, 1914 I went on all day leave to Cairo I visited the museum and its antiques & mummies of ancient Egyptian Kings, then went to Ghezira to the Territorial sports.  I picked up with an English family and they entertained me for the day.  It was an English officers wife & her two sons & daughter and they did every thing possible to make my Xmas happy.  The mother was like my dear little mother in her actions treating her grown up sons as if they were babies it was a heart link to Aust for me.  In night I went to Salle Kleber Anima and saw on the screen the records of the Aust Troops through lines I saw myself distinctly.
