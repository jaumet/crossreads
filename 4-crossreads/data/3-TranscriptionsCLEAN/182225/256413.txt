 OCTOBER   SATURDAY 21   1916 
 Fine, but not too warm. They spent the morning trying to pick out teams from our black horses, but neither Campbell or Raymond know anything about a horse so it was not much of a success. Bill Hunter & Self went down & saw Eric Pope in afternoon & then over to the Hospital & saw Armstrong & Burgess. I was on Stable picket at night. Posted some newspapers to Poss.
