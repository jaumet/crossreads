of ammunition.
The tanks were kept in a field near the back of the village & rushed up at the last moment at a great speed. It was possible for me to trace their tracks up along the railway until they struck across the open country at the end of the village.
A dozen supply tanks, containing benzine etc for the replenishing of the tanks' stocks were arranged in an orchard just in our support line on the edge of the village. A small shell struck one; blew it up & then the whole of the others one by on blew up. The shattered & torn carcases are lying there still surrounded by blackened & torn petrol tins, Lewis gun cartridge cases, Mills' bombs & plenty of small arms ammunition.
