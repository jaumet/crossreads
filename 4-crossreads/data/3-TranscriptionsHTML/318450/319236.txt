<p>On the night of the 22nd July 1916 we went down and dug a trench a few yard's behind the front line so as we would be able to get into it while our artillery bombarded poor old fritz, well every thing was all right for the 23rd July the following night the night the Australian's took the village of Poziers.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 23 July we were marched down to the front trench and at something like 10.30 pm or there abouts we were to go over the top, every thing was ready and all at once our artillery opened on fritz, meanwhile the 1st Batt who were a few yards in front of us, got over the top of the trench and was laying out in No Man's Land.</p>
