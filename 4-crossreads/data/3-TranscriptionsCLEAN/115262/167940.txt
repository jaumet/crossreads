  
 Friday 22 June 1917. 
 Same routine as yesterday morning. Heard news of latest push at Gaza. 14000 casualties altogether & over 4000 killed. Remains of 3 aeroplanes (accidents) brought down, were seen on the trucks on Wednesday. Train load of camels went through to Cairo. Camel corps in desert have been cut up lately at 2nd Gaza stunt. 
 An issue of bread yesterday & today. A mail expected up today. The main Moascar camp is practically all "Tommies" at present who came from Salonika 5 days ago & are soon to go on to the firing line at Gaza. 1 batch left yesterday. [The following sentence crossed out:] Returned men that have been at Gallipoli and Gaza say that Gaza is worse than the Gallipoli problems. 
 Canteen opens, both  wet  &  dry .  
 "Tommies" from Salonika arrive at main  Moskar  Moascar camp (n), Ismalia.
