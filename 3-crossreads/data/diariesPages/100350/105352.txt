(22) Stand to arms about 4 o,clock this morning, thought "Fritz" was going to counter attack, but he would have had a lively reception had he done so. His Artillery got furious about 11 o,clock this morning and peppered our trench and round about to some time. B. Coy on our right had some casualties. A great number of our boys were sent back to the "Chalk Pits" to day suffering with trench feet and other sickness. The mud in some parts of the trench is almost waist deep, men get bogged and take some getting out. The conditions are exceedingly bad.
(23) Shortly after midnight a raiding party from the 45th 48th Bn rushed "Fritz" trench, and after a short scramble captured a portion, also about 20 Prisoners. They belonged to the 139th Grenadiers. Enemy Artillery again busy this morning. Our Coy pretty weak in numbers, just 40 men left in our sector of the trench, and a worn out lot they are. This makes our 7th day straight off in the front line and the boys are feeling the strain badly. Their artillery got real furious again this afternoon and Shelled our position for a couple of hours, one shell burst right among one post and killed 4 and wounded 4 of our Coy. We also had a gun position blown out.
(24) Everything pretty quiet this morning, Thank God. We have only 31 men in my Coy out of 120 we brought in, this is the 8th day we have been ploughing about in the mud. Our hearts were gladdened when we heard that we were to be releived to night. Thank the Almighty.
"Fritz" Artillery opened up just about dusk, our own guns were fireing short also, but luckily for us none burst. After reaching Brigade Headquarters we were sent on to "Burnafay Wood" and then on to Mametz camp reaching our huts about 2.30 in the morning, properly done up.
