  
 30th Septr Sunday. Wilkins & I pottered around various ruins in the vicinity of the Church ruins (Albert) to fossik out unique standpoints from which to take photographs. We found no scarcity of vantage points, as the entire surroundings dominated by the fine spire & famous leaning Madonna, compose one vast picture from any outlook. I took half a dozen from various ruins, & vistas, through shell holed walls. As the Church is out of bounds to troops, we had some difficulty forcing a way through a meshing of barbed wire & of finally entering the building.  This latter we accomplished through a shell hole. The interior is a very pitiable sight. The roof in most places has been shot away & many of the great supporting columns. The rest are so torn & mutilated by shell
