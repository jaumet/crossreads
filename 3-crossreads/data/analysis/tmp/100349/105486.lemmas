 31/12/17 . Some of the Kensington peopl came to see me yesterday . They promis me a good time when I get my sick furlough . This is the quietest New Year Eve I have ever known , but I have never known a better one . 8th Januari .1918 . Was to have left here today , but the Sister-in Charg , reckon I was not fit to travel the distanc to Harefield in Middlesex . So I was not move . I am utter mystifi with my condit , I seem onli a shadow of my old self ; and I 'm just like a broken down hors . Anyhow this rest treatment , if it doe me no good , it can do no harm . 30/1/18 . Have been out of bed two day , feel a heap better though veri wobbl on my leg . Am to be transfer to Harefield tomorrow .
