<p>Fritz was still shelling heavily and we went for our lives At one place along the road was a limber and two horses with the Driver still on his horse riddled with pieces of schrapnel and lying just as they went down. Just as we were getting out of town a couple of shells landed right in a house we were passing and we just missed being crushed by a falling wall</p>
<p>It was about 1 pm when we landed</p>
