<p>hospital today.  He was lifted out of the trench &amp; blown up about 15 ft. in the air &amp; fell outside our front line in no mans land.</p>
<p>Monday<br/>Yesterday &amp; today the weather has been quite mild almost warm sometimes &amp; rain set in &amp; fell heavily during the night.  I went up to Town from here today &amp; visited the hospital.<br/>The British have entered Bagdad so the news runs.  It will be a fine stroke.  Got back almost dark.  Things are very quiet as I write tonight.</p>
<p>Tuesday 13th<br/>Today has been fairly quiet.  Intermittent shelling all day.  I went down to Batt. HQ this morning.  This afternoon I did not do much.  Now it is nearly 11 p.m. &amp; we are waiting for a big raid on our Front at a quarter to 12.  We have made provision for a good many wounded.  There's nothing I know of quite like this</p>
