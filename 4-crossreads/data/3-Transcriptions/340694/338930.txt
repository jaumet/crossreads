<p>45<br/>We arrived at Rubempre safely on the 5th &amp; left again on the 8th.</p>
<p>The night before leaving three of us arranged an impromptu moonlight excursion into the country. All the heads were well out of the way so we commandeered the Napier Car &amp; set-off. The party consisted of Jim Lean (Driver) Art Mitchell (Cook) &amp; myself, a merry party &amp; ready for anything. We soon boarded all untensils &amp; eatables, also a box broken up into portable peices, as firewood is very scarce in these parts. When a tree is felled every chip is picked up.</p>
<p>Well we were soon whizzing out into the country &amp; drove across a field (wheat)</p>
