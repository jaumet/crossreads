 Cannibalism originated? 26.12.14 Well: Christmas is over &amp; gone &amp; I&acute;m glad, for excepting Sunday it&acute;s the worst day in the week unless spent in the right place. On the morning of the 24th a couple of us went off after duck, had quite an interesting exhibition of New Guinea possibilities. The lagoon is only 1/2 mile or so from the river and in this case without any creek as entrance. We landed through long reeds or short bamboos -- about 12 feet high &amp; covered with wee spines like short hair, that come off as you touch them &amp; are very irritating &#151; like a very mild form of prickly pear thorn. They are also alive with mosquitoes &amp; little black ants &amp; the combination is both effective &amp; unpleasant. We got out of those after a hundred yards or so &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; a very long hundred too &#151; &amp; came onto a level piece of ground covered with green grass &amp; this was worse still, for it v/as only rank (?) grass, six feet high &amp; matted, on muddy and smelly water. How deep the water was I don&acute;t know, but we broke through several times up to the waist &amp; didn&acute;t touch bottom. As we walked the whole &acute;&acute;ground" rolled &amp; heaved for yards round. When we did reach the lagoon wet &amp; muddy and seaboots full of mud &amp; water with centipedes (one) and ants (many) we stood in grass up to the shoulders &amp; water up to the knees &amp; shot the duck as they flew overhead. We got half a dozen or shot them, but as we were thinking of swimming out to get them an Alligator appeared on the same excursion so we retired, not having a boat of any sort. Last night was our last in the upper reaches of the river &amp; I think the skeets must have known for all big &amp; small black white &amp; brindle, did, like the heathen "rage so furiously together" while we", the people "did imagine a vain thing" &#151; sleep to wit. And now to look at us one would think we&acute;d fallen in a patch of nettles. Single nets appear to attract them as a game of skill &#151; &amp; I haven&acute;t even that. But I don&acute;t seem much worse off than those that have &amp; and so am able to jeer at them for their trouble. Well, this is a fruitful topic but suppose it is rather uninteresting to you, not being here yourself. I hope to get a mail or two when we get into port, we&acute;ve had no news since we left Sydney so have a whole month to make up. We should be in the day after to-morrow. So long: Happy New Year to all Yr s Alec B.Doyle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&acute;&acute;
