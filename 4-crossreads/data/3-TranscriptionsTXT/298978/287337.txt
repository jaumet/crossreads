 to Cairo to make studies. 
 Mar: 7 Sakhara.  Leave Cairo 10.30 a.m. with forty others on an antediluvian junk of wood that is masquerading as a steamer &ndash; one daren't lean too much on one side, otherwise she will capsize &ndash; cranking old engines are pumping away; I think the boat will fall to pieces before we have got very far. 
 11.30 a.m. engines break down; we commence to drift down the Nile &ndash; come in contact with a Nile barge for which our old ship forms a great attachment &ndash; the natives evidently think it will greatly help matters by heaving lumps of coal at each other. 12.45 p.m. off mudbank; arrive at Memphis 3.30 p.m. I have my first donkey ride; I think my particular animal must have had relatives in a circus. By the time the last one has arrived the first of us are returning, but, as I understand this is a habit with donkeys, enough said. 
 Visit the Tombs, Step Pyramid, Apis Mausoleum, two Colossi, Ramese the Second, Tombs of the Sacred Bulls, Thi, Ptah-Hetep, Mera, Sarapeum.  Get bushed; fall off my donkey; reach the ship (?) afternoon tea 8.15 p.m. Wonder which is the oldest the boat or the piano on it.  Arrive Cairo 11.15 p.m. 
 Mar: 8 Flag Drill.  The first sand storn &ndash; simply terrible, sand everywhere. 
 Mar: 9 Flag wagging. Studies at the Caf&eacute;s.
