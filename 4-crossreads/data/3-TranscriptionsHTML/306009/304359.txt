<p>1915<br/>June 22 Tue.<br/>Up at 5.30 a.m. &ndash; shower &amp; 3&frac12; mile walk round the Island before breakfast. Best time of the day as it gets so hot later&ndash; the Nile is very pretty &ndash; Yeomanry look well exercising their horses.<br/>My correspondence has become somewhat extensive lately &amp; as I acknowledge all letters received, have been rather busy getting off replies. We can now send letters &amp; parcels to Australia free provided they are initialled by a responsible Officer. This will save me quite a small fortune &ndash; I guess.</p>
