<p>Someday perhaps, our Head Quarters Staff will learn to handle the men and avoid friction.   at  present they seem to do all that is possible to rouse the men up.   they do not seem to realise yet that the men are not going to stand being imposed on or bullied.   their Idea of Discipline will never work. nor their Idea of Justice.   We can read of "<u>British Justice"</u> anytime but army Justice here. is "Rotten" in many ways. and amongst the civilians, Justice seems to be made to suit one set only "the Rich".   it was planned purposely to cripple the poor man.   or in other words British Justice as practised here in Britain is a farce.   We have far more of it in Australia, and many of our laws are years ahead of this Islands laws.   But I did not sit down here to tell you about The way things are done here.<br/>I had a very nice letter from Mrs. Horton last night when I came here from Wareham   I was in hopes that I would get leave before I left for France so that I could go and see them again, but it is out of the question.  I met one of my old mates here, also my Platoon Sgt. Simmons was still going strong in December and may still be allright I hope so anyway.   he was very lucky.</p>
