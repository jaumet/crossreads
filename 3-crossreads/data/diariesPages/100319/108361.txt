8/9/18 Cappy
Sunday. Church parade with a painfully small Bde. there and a ridiculous sermon by a fool of a parson. Rain coming on we moved off without a march past. Later in the afternoon came a heavy downpour which washed the air and made visibility good. Wandered round the Transport and had a look how they were getting on with cleaning it up. Put in the afternoon writing and reading and making preparations for tomorrow's work. Brigade have allotted us 300 bath vacancies which rather cuts into the day. At mess spoke rather strongly to the officers on the matter of saluting of their relations with the men. This seemed have a good effect as several took the remarks directly to themselves. Read and wrote all the evening.
