 28/1/18 London Found that beyond a few question there was noth interest be done in the Hous and a debat commenc on Nation Registr which soon empti the hous and galleri . Dine at a littl caf near Victoria Station and then back to Hotel . About 9 p.m. an air raid commenc and the gun open up brisk . The peopl in the hotel congreg on the stair . No wonder they get the wind up ? I look out of my top window and a dud descend too close to be comfort so I went down to the ground floor . Could hear the aeroplan engin quit plain and also the sound of fall bomb . Turn in at about 10 p.m.
