<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>Here is Sunday once again &amp; I've just finished all my work.  I generally let all the boys off on Sunday &amp; then I can write letters in my office in comfort.  There have been lots &amp; lots of changes lately &amp; my staff consists of 3 only instead of over 60.  There is a Sergeant or N.C.O. responsible</p>
