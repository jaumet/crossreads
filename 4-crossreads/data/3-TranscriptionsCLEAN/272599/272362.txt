 "Camp" in a ferment this morning  Bugle blew reveille at 5.30 a.m. parade quarter-hour later. Orders out to strike camp & remove it to Aveluy other side of Albert 6 miles distant.  Such a removal means a prodigeous amount of work. All patients (scabies) had to be shifted, tents & marquees pulled down & much heavy loading. Work hard till tea time. Turn in early.
