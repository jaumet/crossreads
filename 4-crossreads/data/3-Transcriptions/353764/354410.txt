<p>it was the funniest trip on record.<br/>You should have seen Jack going for the nick of his life on a Donkey all day.  Such expressions as "If they could only see us at home now" &amp; many others alluding to Home people were very frequent &amp; tended to make the day enjoyable.<br/>We caught the 4.30 pm train home, had Tea in Heliopolis &amp; arrived back very tired.</p>
<p>21.2.16 Monday &amp; 22.2.16 Tuesday<br/>Two days of ordinary routine work.  Our O.C. went down to Head Quarters at Ishmalia to see what is to become of our Company &amp; rumour has it that we are to stay in Heliopolis for another 3 months.  I would sooner be here, than down there as the whole place is alive with Lice &amp; there is very little water to have a decent wash.<br/>I went into Cairo with Jack &amp; his friends &amp; drove through the various Bazaars.  Jack purchased a Fez &amp; of course is mad to wear the thing.  I bought a couple of hand bags which I will send to-day.</p>
<p>23.2.16 Wednesday &amp; 24.2.16 Thursday</p>
