 Dear Mr. Horsefield &ndash; I am sending Mrs. O'Brien of whome I spoke to you the other day &ndash; 
 You may remember she is asking for her fare to Bendigo for a change under the Dr's orders. She is anxious to take advantage of the excursion train on Thursday next. I hope you will be able to help &ndash; 
 Yours truly B. Booth.
