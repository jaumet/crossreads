<p>some of them need refreshing.<br/>I had a pleasant surprise yesterday when half-a-dozen parcels arrived for me from Lismore packed with goodies. One from yourself, one from Aunt Kate, Annie McDermott, Katie Chisholm, Rita Bentley. Although they did not reach here for Xmas they arrived at a very opportune time and we will have a right royal week in billets. The sweets &amp;c. are most welcome in this cold weather and must be very beneficial in supplying heat to the body.<br/>I was for a long time most anxious to see snow and revel in snowball fights, &amp;c. Pictures of such things in Xmas Annuals always made me envious.</p>
