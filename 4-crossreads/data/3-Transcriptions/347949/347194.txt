<p>18th Jan 1918<br/>From the 11th to 18th January was in front line in reserves. Was in a pill box when in the line on company headquarters. Had trench fever very badly.</p>
<p>18th Jan 1918<br/>Was warned for Divisional School again at Scherpenburg and for the first fortnight was still very bad with fever but picked up again.</p>
<p>28th Jan 1918<br/>Walked into Bailleul to get something for Leonie's 21st birthday but only managed to get a lace collar hand made. It was certainly very dainty.</p>
<p>23rd Feb 1918<br/>Rejoined battalion at Parralt Camp after finishing  the 4 weeks course at the school and passing fairly well visited La Clytte  &amp; Looe etc.</p>
<p>6th March 1918<br/>From 23rd Feb to 6th March was doing fatique right up to the front line at spoil bank &amp; left on this day for Bailleul. Billeted in a very clean barn on a respectable sort of farm as farms go over here. People very kind and always willing to give one hot  water to wash in as it was very cold first thing. <br/>  Paid one or two visits to Bailleul while here, we were a mile or so out of the town and also saw the smart set.</p>
<p>25th March 1918<br/>Ordered to the front again to assist on the Somme. During the last three weeks Bailleul was being  shelled  heavily  and bombed at night. People forced to evacuate. It was a very sad sight  to see them leaving their  homes. While here I was  on the telephone in the orderly room and on the Sunday before leaving was warned for a school but owing to the German offensive  starting again all schools were broken up.  Motored to Arras stayed at Bailleulmont with Scots Guards.</p>
<p>26th March 1918<br/>Left Bailleulmont  for Albert sector 9.30pm marched all night distance (33 kilos 22 miles) fighting order arrived at Senlis  7am. Very weary tired footsore shoulders aching. Rested for two hours &amp; then went up to Mellencourt.</p>
