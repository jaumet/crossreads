<p>Thursday 7 June 1917</p>
<p>From 27 May to 7 June missing.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  Our H.Q's were bombed yesterday &amp; NOWELL FORTH's horse died from wounds on previous day &ndash; demoralizing damn thing but a fog last night hid the moon. Still anxiously waiting our turn on the Beach.</p>
<p>Scorpions are very plentiful also snakes &amp; the boys going on leave take them to Cairo to amuse!!! the CASINO girls. The Scorpions bite is no worse than a Bull dog ant except when the female is mating &ndash; then she eats the male if she gets a chance &amp; will fight anything.</p>
<p>Last night I got a Centipede 8" long &ndash; Cairo is full of snake charmers &amp; jugglers &amp; our boys try to follow suit with sometimes disastrous results.</p>
