5/5/17   L?Homme Mort
The operation by the Devons against Bullecourt was another addition to the list of failures. The 8th Devons relieved the R.W. Fusiliers on the left of the village and established a line of strong posts from there on to the road entering the village about midway. They found that the Hun was again in his front line trench and there was much trouble from the right hand corner of the village. All other troops of this Bde now appear to be back behind the railway bank. Rang up the left Anzacs and find that they have been pushed out of about 500? of the Hindenburg supports but are holding on in the front line still and doing good work. Over Ecoust this morning the enemy was putting much shrapnel which like all of his bursts very high and harmlessly. Over at 186th Bde there is no fresh news. My runners are all filthy dirty looking and ragged people but are good willing smiling chaps. They come back with yarns of our battalion being all wiped out and other tall stories but all these have to be well discounted.
