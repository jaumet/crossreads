After washing I walked 25 yards without my cap the result was combed fine ice out of my hair had a job to pull the comb through it. Dinkum. I leave to-night for Blighty so all is bustle. 19-2-17. Have been back about 4 or 5 days. Spent a glorious time in London it is the spot alright everyone seemed happy an ideal place for a spell. All the ponds in the parks were frozen & ice sliding was the order of the day what a time we had.
