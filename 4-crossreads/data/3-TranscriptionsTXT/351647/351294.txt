I've written to Mac & put it in your envelope, how you'll froth when you discover all that fat lot is not for you.  But you don't mind do you 'cos green envelopes are so scarce & anyhow I know Mac, he'll tell you all in it (thats fit for you to hear).  Did I tell you I loved the Calender & have it here right now.  Also did I tell you old Mat Tansey was a Lootenant.  I wish I were more ordinary & practical & common sensible but I would never be military enough.
Wish I could send you some 'curios' or souvenirs & yet I don't know.  They'll be so dead common after the war & it will be hard to distinguish between the real & the counterfeit.
Do you still shark bait or did you & was the "Pacific" very fresh.
My love to Mrs. Ellis.  I hope she is well also Tom.  Stuart wrote the other day, said Jock was on leave.  Mrs. Johnson sent me a great pair of gloves & some delicious eats.  She is a brick.
Au RevoirLove to all,Jim Wilkie
