 Only 2 hours ago I rec'd your usually kind letter. This only a "Whiz-Bang" (The term was originally used to describe the shell of a high velocity field gun) to say, "All's Well and to give you a sample of the work of a French, Oliver Godfrey, I happened to meet once!  It was 2 months before I could get to him again. The horse I am riding was brought from Sydney in 1914 by my late Colonel & its main value consists, after 21/2 years service, in being an old friend. It was really for the remembrance of my old nag that I faced the camera. Will write to you, more fully later on. 
 Best of Wishes Clem
