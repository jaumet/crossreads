<p>Getting killed every day.  I saw a few hundred being marched down to do fatigue work at Sulby River but they do not work so the Boys tell me.  We are not to have any more Holidays for about 6 months &amp; it is hard luck we have such a lot of work here &amp; very few will be spared I am sorry to say till after Xmas.  We are in a lovely Camp now &amp; everything is better than any Camp we have ever been in.  We have work to do but our new C.O. is good &amp; everything will soon be as settled &amp; smooth running as a machine.  Well Dad I think I have told you all the news.  I will remember</p>
