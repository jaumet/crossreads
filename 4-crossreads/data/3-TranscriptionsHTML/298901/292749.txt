<p>easiest, about 200 cases through.  It was an Australian Corps stunt &amp; so far prisoners number 1060, 27 officers 100 machine guns besides trench mortars &amp; a field gun.  Had a sponge down during afternoon &amp; clean change, feeling rotten as had another bad night.</p>
<p>Friday 5th July<br/>Great celebrations in England &amp; Paris to kid the Yanks somewhat.  The King, Queen etc went to see a baseball match.  The Huns heavily counterattacked last night commencing early in the evening.  The bombardment was one of the heaviest I have witnessed &amp; continued for several hours.  He was repulsed everywhere but our proportion of dead was heavy to total casualties  Great aerial activity &amp; 3 of Fritz's balloons were brought down in flames together.  Lord Rhonda the food controller, a great Englishman, dead, one of the most successful of the war leaders.</p>
<p>Saturday 6th July<br/>Applied for leave to NICE but do not expect it for some time.  The front quiet again.  Prisoners in last stunt totalled 1500 &amp; we captured Hamel Village &amp; a couple of woods.<br/>Did my washing &amp; started on the weekly requisition.</p>
