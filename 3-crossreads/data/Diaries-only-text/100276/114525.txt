little Belgian town waiting for deliverance from the German yoke
2nd. 8 hour day in Australia I can picture the crowds going to the races etc in our "Sunny land of the South while here we are cooped up in our muddy cold trenches rain is falling falling as if it means to flood us out, but never mind its not going to last for ever theres a "silver lining to every cloud"
We got 32 reinforcements for the Coy. last night, 3 of them were hit on the way to the trenches, for they were unlucky for a machine gun fight was in progress as they were coming up its a wonder more of them were not killed for they rake the tracks they have to come up
