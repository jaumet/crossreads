<p>on the completion of those never to be forgotten delightful days of furlough in order to leave by train bound for Salisbury Plains, to report back to Camp at Perham Downs</p>
<p>At this particular time the Camp had become simply a "sea" of mud which made it very difficult walking at any time but particularly so at night. The Camp, Perham Downs, with its surroundings, the worst yet experienced either in Egypt or England, had at this time acquired a very sinister reputation.</p>
<p>More than one man had been assaulted &amp; robbed of his furlough money, the night before his leave became due &amp; at last it was very risky and dangerous to go about any part of the Camp after dark unless in parties of three or more.</p>
<p>It was openly reported that one man, a sergeant, had been knocked about so very severely that he eventually died, and one of the men from the Sentry's "own" hut, dashed in one night, showing signs of suffering from a blow on the side of the face, evidently from a "sand bag" which had not been quite truly aimed, and as this man was by no means what might be deemed a "Young Mens Christian Association man" his experience made the more quiet men even more cautious when moving about at night.</p>
<p>The nights were so dark that if alone, one had to keep watching all points so as not to be taken unawares. One man who only had 2s/6d upon him was knocked down &amp; robbed of his uniform which happened to be an extra good one (paid for privately)</p>
<p>For about a week it seemed that almost a reign of terror had started in spite of the appointment of special pickets to prevent it. However after a few weeks a large body of men were moved away to a new Camp at Wareham in Dorsetshire. This proved to be the very finest Camp, outside a regular barracks, that the Sentry had been in anywhere.</p>
