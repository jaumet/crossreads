 Thursday 30th. Still cold. At the rifle range all day Nothing else out of the ordinary occurred. 
 Friday  3 1st December Cold again. Another very heavy frost last night &ndash; 
 Had a tooth pulled out &amp; so stayed off parade to write some letters as it was the only chance I have had for a fortnight of doing so. 
 Nothing else happened today. 
 Saturday  1st  2nd December. Expected to be shifting camp today but again put off. 
 At rifle range in the afternoon. Had to fire 10 rounds each with gas helmets on. One lot scored 8 hits on the targets out of 640 shots; six however is the record. Had to knock off early as it is now quite dark by 5 oclock.
