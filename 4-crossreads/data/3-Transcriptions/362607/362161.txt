<p>Dear George<br/>This is part of our promenade, which is 2 miles long or more. It has altered a lot since your Father went away from home. The clock you see is called the Jubilee Clock, it being built in remembrance of the old Queen's Jubilee year. It stands at the bottom of Victoria Street, and is the beginning of the pier where all the boats land, which are many. You see the church and next to it is Windermere House where we used to live, and which Mother married. Love from all, Your loving Aunt Hannah</p>
