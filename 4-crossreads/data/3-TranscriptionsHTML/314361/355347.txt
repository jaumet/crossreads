Think we shall be on Sunday<br/>Have had some very hot weather, but it does not keep up for long, to day has been warm, but delightful, &amp; the nights are cool especially in the early mornings. We rise at 5 Am. breakfast 5.30, first parade 6.15 to 10 second parade [11?] to 5 Pm.<br/>We get a first rate hunger here, breakfast generally is one slice of bread &amp; jam sometimes there is bacon &amp; occasionally rice, which is really rice &amp; sand, then [indecipherable] we get another piece of bread &amp; marmalade, about twice a week there is some soup &amp; occasionally again we get prunes or dates. For tea which is the only decent meal we have stew &amp; sometimes rice. Still I feel first rate, &amp; have now some money to spend at the canteen.<br/>Thursday 15th 16.<br/>Ferry Post<br/>Heat Terrific. Believe that we are leaving tomorrow for Moascar, hope so for</p>
