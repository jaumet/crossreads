<p>1918<br/>Wed 24th (cont.)<br/>Lessons are now in full swing at the lager, thanks to the exertions of Colonel C.H. Bury, whom I met first in Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>(In return for years about Tian Shan I tell him all about Papeete etc in the Beatrice Grimshaw style.)   Suddenly remembered with a gasp where I had seen our mathematics teacher (H.E. Balfour, a long grave, Canadian B.A.).   He was in last night's concert as a black-garbed pierr<u>ette</u> with a scarlet garter encircling a silk-stockinged leg!</p>
<p>His garb did <u>not</u> give him poise;   his staring eyes betrayed a lack of aplomb.   The French teacher is Ward, an awfully decent young French-Englishman;   our German Master is the Censor (the village schoolmaster); while Collier, ex. "Hobart Mercury", presides at shorthand.</p>
