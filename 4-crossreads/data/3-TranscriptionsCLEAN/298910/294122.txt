Put our time on one hour, to be in keeping with French time. All the Boys growling because of no Mail - I haven't had any decent mail since December 18th.
Sunday  25/3/17
Very frosty & bitterly cold, Heavy fighting roundabout Cambrai & St Quentin, we are quite at Home again to hear some of Fritzs shells whistling again & the boom of our own guns. Get daily news of Huns outrages & destruction. We have records & proof of Arsenic & other poisons in all drinking water - to say nothing of the filth & corruption he has thrown into springs & wells - all looking forward to a relief at an early date.
Very few casualtys through - Sent on a few Souvernirs - Receipts etc to Frank. Saw four of our planes brought down after sharp duels.
Monday  26/3/17
Dull day - Very cold. Much patrol fighting going on - Good few casualtys. Town Hall in Bapaume which was in fairly good order, excepting for the windows & the Tower, being shot down. Blew up at midnight last night, evidently by a mine set to a clock bomb
