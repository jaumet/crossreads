 Tue 5th March. It has been snowing, the papier-mache walls of the huts are thin, the fire often goes out at night &amp; many of them now have chest trouble. 
 Wed. 6th Operation today. At about 9.30 am a couple of orderlies attached a set of wheels to my bed &amp; we started off for the operating room via numerous underground tunnels. 
 The operating hall is magnificent &ndash; three rooms arch into each other;  thick glass roofs;  the walls are white-tiled half way to the ceiling. 
 Three sisters helped me on to the table, two doctors and a masked and sterilised female rushed in &amp; after a hasty "Morgen" commenced sterilising their hands:  then Schw. Gertrude told me to "breathe heavily".   Ugh!  Nuff sed!
