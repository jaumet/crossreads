<p>A little party of us managed to get a few articles to take home, it happened this way I got into conversation with an Indian official who came aboard about our coaling &amp; I asked him if it was possible for him to get us some stuff to take home, yes he said I'll bring you some samples back this evening &amp; you can take your pick &amp; I'll get them for you, time enough he brought them on &amp; we selected our articles, that was at 11 o'clock he then went away &amp; we waited &amp; waited until 2 o'clock I had just began to think we had seen the last of him &amp; we were kicking ourselves for missing our sleep when we spots a little boat making for us  his proved to be him &amp; he had all our articles sure enough, I got 1 box of cigars, 2 ebony elephants</p>
