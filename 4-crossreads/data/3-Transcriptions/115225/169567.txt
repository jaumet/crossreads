<p>May 25<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to Ailly-S.S. for petrol &amp; oil &amp; then did a trip to Hangest for water with the trailer,&nbsp;<s>du</s>&nbsp;we did&#39;nt do any job for the froggies to-day - We had a swim in the evening &amp; rigged up a spring-board at the pool - it is very good -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 26<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We slept in till 7.A.M. &amp; took Ren &amp; an escort to Bertangles for court martial for refusing to go on guard whilst we were at Allonville (he &amp; two other men joined us there) &nbsp;We got back at noon &amp; greased &amp; oiled up in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 27<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We had to load up our echylon of amunition (the &eacute;chelon is a reserve of ammo a full load for every lorry to be ready in case of emergency, a very fine idea but incidently the cause of a lot of trouble etc) &amp; delivered it to a dump at Querrieu. &amp; went to Flesselles for another load which we had to keep on the lorry all night. We are supposed to have a load of ammo always on the lorry but we would so often have to unload &amp; load it as ocasion required, that we did&#39;nt keep to the letter of the law &amp; we put it off at the side of the lorry &amp; covered it against the weather -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 28<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We delivered our load of ammo.</p>
