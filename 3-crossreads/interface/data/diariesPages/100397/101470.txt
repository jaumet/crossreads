No. 2 Depot Company Bovington,. Wareham Dorset. 13.11.16
Dear Mother Some more of your letters have reached me about 4 this week, the latest dated, I think Sep 4th I have not got it here just at this minute, I also received on from Bea dated August 1st I also received the second pair of Sox with my Battln Colors worked into them and the Pair Sent by Mrs. J.H. I think that makes three pairs since I came out of Hospital I have never heard anything of the Parcel of Tabac but I do not wonder at that for they must be handling millions of parcels at the Depots, and there are thousands waiting to be delivered, no doubt many of them will never reach the men for whom they are intended, as they get badly battered in transit even in our small office here there is enough work for half a dozen men, and there are scores of letters that have travelled far, and will go on again from here before they reach the men they are addressed to. Some of the boys returned to France on Saturday night, "that is they left here for France, and about 1600 arrived here. I really do not know what is in the wind, there were Rumours abroad that we might move at any time but this last crowd of Reo's are attached to us now so it does not look as if we are likely to move for awhile. Well it will suit me to stay here. I am not anxious to go and train in France.
