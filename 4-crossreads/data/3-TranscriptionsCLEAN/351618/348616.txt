Saturday 11th SeptVery keen & cool - windy. A number of our men due to go away for a spell for a few weeks.
Sunday 12th SeptVery like rain. Men to leave late to night. Mouse bit finger while laying half dozing. They run in & out of bags of which my store wall is built etc.
Fixed up a stretcher in store to make myself a little more comfortable. It was fine - you can bet I slept finely this evening.
Monday 13thOur men did not leave as anticipated but came back early in the evening very disappointed. I had a lot of trouble to fix up extra
