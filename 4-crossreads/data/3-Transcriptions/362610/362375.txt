<p>Thursday 8 June 1916<br/>A lovely day. Bayonet fighting before breakfast &amp; use of bombs at the morning &amp; afternoon parades. In between times got 2 or 3 letters off. School visited by the Premier of Q'nsland, General Birdwood &amp; others. We did not see them but heard afterwards that during an exhibition with trench mortars there was very nearly an accident with serious results.</p>
