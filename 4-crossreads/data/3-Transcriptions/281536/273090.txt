<p>5/7/19 "Chemnitz" North Sea<br/>At 9.30 we cast off from Alexandra Docks Hull and a pilot took us into a lock after some very skilful handling. The wives of some of the stokers were down to see their husbands off as it will probably be nearly six months before the crews are back here again. Wives babies and mother in laws respectable clean people. Out in the Humber we passed several wicked looking monitors and a couple of cruisers &ndash; one was dazzle painted. Afterwards a cold wind made us keep in and the ship though rolling a bit was remarkably steady and there was no vibration. One hardly knew that she was moving at all. Our pilot for the Down was playing cards all the evening with Miles &amp;  Co. I talked to Pederick.</p>
