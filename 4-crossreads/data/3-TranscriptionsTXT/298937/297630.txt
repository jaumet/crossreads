 Monday 31st July 
 Saw A.D.M.S. yesterday.  Still expecting to leave tomorrow, but no news has arrived yet. Harold Clarence came up last night with news that they leave for Salisbury Plain tonight. Developed some photographs for Nunan last night, including one of two in which I figure.  We are going to print some today. 
 Marching orders for Tuesday night arrived at 6 p.m.  General excitement.
