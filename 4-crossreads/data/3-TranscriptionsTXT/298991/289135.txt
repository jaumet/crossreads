Thursday January 18thSnowed again this morning. The snow is about ten inches deep now. Everything is very quiet this morning, a fellow can hardly realise he is within range of enemy shells, & that there is a war on. Things are pretty easy in the cook house now, as some of the men have gone back to Mametz Wood.
Friday January 19thStopped snowing. The snow is still on the ground yet & everything is frozen. There hasn't been a mail in from N.S.W. or Queensland for about three weeks now. I am waiting anxiously for some parcels & letters. [indecipherable] exceedingly cold night.
Saturday January 20thIt is very hazy & very very cold this morning, I can hardly hold my pen to write. As we are to go up in the trenches tomorrow, I have been packing my pack, which will be left behind until we come out again. As things have now changed we are not to go up to the trenches, but back to Becordel [-Becourt] (Anzac Rest Camp). We are in favour of the latter.
Sunday January 21stWorked all night & until 8 am this morning. Very busy packing up until 9.30. Fell in 10 am & marched to Becordel, a distance of about 7 miles. We are camped in marquee tents here. The whole Rest Camp is all tents. Snow is still laying on the ground. All the mud & pools are frozen as hard as rocks, just as well too as it will be terrible muddy when it thaws. There are duck boards everywhere. Went down through the cemetary here. There are a couple of fellows I know buried there. My word there are a lot of graves there, Lines & Lines of wooden crosses.
