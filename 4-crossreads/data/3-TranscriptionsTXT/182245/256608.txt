 APRIL 1917 
 3 TUESDAY 
 It was blowing a blizzard 
 in the morning &amp; the ground 
 was white with snow. It 
 even came up through 
 cracks in the weather boards 
 of the hut. The worst morning 
 I have ever seen. Cleaning up 
 round stables ect all day. 
 Some of the gunners came 
 down from the guns, only 
 leaving three to a gun 
 up there.
