 Dear Judge Ferguson, I want to say how deeply sorry we are here at the death in action of your son - Captain of the 20th Battalion.  I had heard in Egypt and here also most excellent accounts of him, not only of his gallantry which one could take for granted in his position, but of his unselfishness and his instinct of command.  I am not exaggerating when I say that nobody had a better chance for the future than he.  Probably it was those very traits that led to his death, and although any words of mine are quite inadequate in the loss that you and his mother have sustained, I may fairly ask you "How can man die better?" 
 You and his mother would have been gratified and a little surprised had you known the general regret evidenced throughout the place when news of your son's death reached us, for remember, it is no uncommon thing here, we get a list of names every day, and alas! They are growing to considerable proportions. 
 With an especial measure of sympathy to your wife in her sorrow. I am, Very truly yours, [signature indecipherable]
