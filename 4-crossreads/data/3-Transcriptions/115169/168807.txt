<p>Pelie [Pelee] a great high barren peak bearing signs of past activity, - from top to bottom were many deep passages which had been made undoubtedly by burning lava, - in places were a few trees and grass growing, but great boulders were strewn everywhere, - at the base of this centre of activity could be plainly seen, signs of past habitation, - the town that posessed many thousands of people and the whole of which were burnt out by the last eruption during which 30,000 lives were lost, - the tops of houses and the steeple of the church that once existed can still be seen.</p>
<p>We were given leave for a few hours each evening during which period we had the opportunity of visiting the adjoining districts, - I journeyed upwards over the high hills at the back of the town, and in the direction of the scene of destruction, and I was soon above the sea level, and the whole way up, and strewn all around, could be seen these same great boulders that had been cast hence by the terrific force of the eruption - I cannot say I admired the town of Martinique</p>
<p>[The 1902 eruption destroyed the town of St Pierre]</p>
