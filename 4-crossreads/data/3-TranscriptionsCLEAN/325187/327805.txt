 I had to go to  Samalut  & see the local Magistrate (Egyptian) re some shots fired from a Bedouin Village. I found him in the CLUB!!! & was soon surrounded by all the colored Notables & swallowed 2 Whiskies & sodas with great skill- Thro' an Interpreter (after much Salaaming etc) I tried to put them right about a few natives ie Maoris do not come from Australia- not any Blackfellows are in our Parliament- etc.  All Classes  here are much affected by Sedition papers now being circulated, they want to govern themselves they say - Tried to buy English Paper but only got an Arabic & French one which I send you
