 Bussy -la-Daours At 3 am Fritz came across in full swing and unloaded some tens into the district. Weather very warm but a little cooler than yesterday. Mounted parade at 9.30 am. Chestnut getting better very rapidly - will soon be fit to ride. Rode across to La Neville at 10.30 pm. Have received no mail for quite a considerable time. Fritz shelled Daours.
