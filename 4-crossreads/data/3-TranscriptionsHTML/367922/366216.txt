<p>Mr. Arthur Fry,<br/>Lindfield</p>
<p>Dear Sir<br/>It is with the deepest sorrow and regret that I have heard of the death of your dear son &ndash; Dene &ndash; killed in action at the Front.</p>
<p>It is some years now since I first became acquainted with Dene &ndash; at the Sydney Technical College and later at the University where he was a member of my Zoology Classes &ndash; and where I was able to form a very high appreciation of him both as a student, as an investigator and as a friend. We have lost one who, had he been spared to return and follow up his work at the University, would have become one of our most brilliant Zoologists. His work was full of great promise, and his enthusiasm was unbounded.</p>
