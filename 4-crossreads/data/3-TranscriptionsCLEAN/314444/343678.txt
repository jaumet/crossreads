Dearest Mother Father & Dear Dolly,
Still no mail, but there is a rumor that there is one down on the beach, so expect letters etc from you tomorrow. Will be glad to get it as we have not had any mail for a long time.Well I am getting on tip top and can manage without the stick. The wound has almost closed up and I am feeling splendid. I hope I do not get in the road of any more. No good to "Gundy". [Slang for "no good to me".]Well we have had good weather since the snow thank Heavens. We don't want too much of the snow. One thing they are giving us a rum every night now instead of once a week. The tucker is getting better too, although I could do one of the good old home dinners still. The comforts fund has not arrived yet you can bet I am watching for it & will be mighty glad when it comes. I am thinking of the Asparagus & I hope there is some chocolate. It is great stuff the plain chocolate.How are all my friends give them my kind regards and tell them paper is too scarce to write. I would like to write but the paper & time is too scarce, so you explain to them. Tell them I am well & hope to soon be back with them all especially my dear parents. Tell John & Marguerette I will write the first opportunity, as I must keep some paper & envelopes to write you all at home
