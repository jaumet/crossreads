There was now some speculation as to whether we would go to the Rhine as part of hte Army of occupation. Australian troops were to be represented in Germany & two divisions one of which would be the first actually started to march in that direction but after a week or more the order was altered for various reasons and the division went to Charleroi in Belgium. On the way there I was evacuated to hospital with sore feet. Taking the ambulance train at Bohain I reached Rouen after a week of slow journeyying From there, after a few days I was sent to Buschy Convalescent Depot, where I remained for two months. This was a good Camp for convalesing in as there were many recreation huts & comfortable quarters. Boxing, wrestling, foot-ball, and cross country runs formed the principal rou ne of exercises.

Christmas went off well with the usual festivities. The decorations were very elaborate all buildings being hung with holly and mistletoe.
