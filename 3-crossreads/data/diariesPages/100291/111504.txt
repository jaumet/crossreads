Feb. Sunday 18 1917
A quiet night last night, only one case mumps through, kept him till morning. 
'Twas one of the darkest nights I've ever experienced - a thick fog with rain added to the blackness. 
With 2 others I go back to the R A. P. Factory corner in the morning. 
Several get sick here, the damp; smelly dugout is responsible I think. There's about 6 inches of mud on the floor from the dripping roof.
