Paris
7/3/17
Left about 10 am via Rue Rivoli to the Louvre passing a fine gilt statue of Jean D?Arc, and the Palais Royale about which in a cursory glance there appears nothing extraordinary. Some fine shops down this way. Continued along the Rue de Rivoli and then turned up through Les Halles which were very busy tons and tons of meat much of it still in the whole was being transported by wagons and on men's backs. A large semi circular building across the way was the Church of St Eustache and going inside the interior was found to be handsome. There are many little side chapels and a roll of honour of butchers "tombe sur Champ d?honneur". 
From here walked through the Louvre grounds and by the Pont Neuf across the Seine. A few ferry boats with women fare collectors plying the river. The embankment walls are fitted on top with many cases of second hand books and stretch for hundreds of yards. Noticed a Baedeker London for which the women wanted 6 fcs. Beat her down to 4, but only offered 3 and must come back tomorrow to get it. Led up to the Palais
