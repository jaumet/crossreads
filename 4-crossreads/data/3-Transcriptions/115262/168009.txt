<p>Thursday 30 August 1917.</p>
<p>Nothing out of the ordinary today except that bombardment on Gaza is still continuing with the same energy. This started at 1 a.m. this morning. This evening at 9.30 the shrapnel shells could be seen bursting over the trenches. &quot;Very&quot; lights were also plainly seen</p>
<p>Expect relief tomorrow.</p>
