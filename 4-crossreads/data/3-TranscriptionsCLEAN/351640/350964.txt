During the week a characteristic letter came from Hyman.   He appears to be as busy as ever, with his various societies, and the war, he has obtained commissions for a large number of men and women.  He obtained for Nurse Blanch Sutton her position at the Belgian Hospital, where she has been since the war began, a post card reached me to day from her, sent on account of the postage stamp upon it, I shall send it on to you.   I am sure that I should enjoy a chat with the little man.   He was asking about you.  In my reply I shall tell him about you.
What did you think of the French people placing the body of Rouget de Lisel alongside that of Napoleon the first?  [Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle (1760-1836)] To my mind the soul of the great emperor will turn in its grave when it recognises that a man who strung to gether a few verses of words has been judged as worthy as the great soldier and law giver.   The comparison is somewhat odipus [odious].   The whole proceeding has been ridiculous.  Fancy the names Napoleon and de Lisle under the same dome for the admiration of the future generations of French men and women?   Let us pray that their resting place may not be under the domination of the German Kaiser.  The Crown Prince rather let the cat out of the bag a few days ago when he said that the Kaiser was soon to launch irressistible forces against those opposing him on the Western front.  This idea was amplified recently by the congratulations which the Emperor himself sent to the Generals in position, thanking them for being able to keep the enemy in cheque while he was fighting his way into Russia further than he expected.  Bill may be a savage, if so he is a great savage, and history will set him down as mongst the greatest of his class that has been in the world, a great member of a great house, a Hohenzolleron amongst the Hohenzollerons.  He is reaping the reward of the years of unfailing industry that has been put into the training of all Germans to the art and science of war.

30.8.15.   Last evening I took Sister Draper and two officers to Matarieh X showed to them the various subjects of interests in the several spots.   It is still to me the most interesting spot in Egypt.  Architects of do day could easily construct the pyramids, or build the various mosques, but the exist
