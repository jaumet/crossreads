 grenades &amp; machine guns was terrific. No one can realise what the noise is like unless they are close by. The beginning of the Trenches is called the Sap, this was about &frac12; a mile from the dressing station. One being informed that there were hundreds of wounded men in the trenches a great number of us proceeded down the Sap. I went down with a chap who knew the run of the trenches.  He gave me a warning when we were approaching any dangerous spot,   Here we had to crouch down &amp; run like blazes, the bullets from machine guns were whistling over our heads. About half way down the Sap, we passed a dead chap who was hanging half way over the parapet. A number of dangerous points were passed before we reached the firing Line. The sight that I looked upon here I shall never forget.  Good God it was terrible. Dead Australians lying about,  had to pick our way over them, to reach our wounded men who signalled to us.  In some placed the dead were piled up four &amp; five deep. The trench was almost battered down by shrapnel. The trip back to Dressing Station was very severe, the saps were much narrower than I expected them to be, in some places there was scarcely room for a stretcher to pass. The ground was also uneven. It took us fully two hours to carry the poor chap to the Air Post. It was a terrible experience, in one part of this terrible journey I tripped &amp; fell over the stretcher, I was very nervous in case I should hurt the poor fellow gain who had a very serious wound. My whole body was trembling, was forced to sit down &amp; rest for about 15 minutes. I could not possibly go on, I must have kept about 20 stretcher cases behind me waiting, but they all knew what was wrong. Of course on going down the 2nd time I was much more at ease, although very tired. Three times to the firing Line &amp; rest of the time I carried wounded from the dressing station to the motors. Towards evening my legs were all trembling, the strain had been very severe. Every one of our men looked worn out. It must have been Hell in the trenches
