I spent the best Holiday of my life, & the weather then & now is perfect.  The whole country is more wonderful to the view than anyone unacquainted with England could conceive, & it defies anyone, however great, to give a description.
I have nothing to do in this camp & I fill in the time as pleasantly as possible.  Yesterday, Sunday, I walked to Salisbury, about 10 miles.  It was very hot but the avenues of massive beach trees made walking a treat, & I covered the distance in 21/2 hours.  I left Mr Edmond's house at 9.30 & got Home safely without a pass; I know how to dodge the "Jacks" easily enough.  Well, I must get ready for tea now & there is no news to give you at all.  Billy & I are going the village after tea for a walk & then back to the Pictures.
Best Love to you all Harry
