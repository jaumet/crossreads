<p>III<br/>about a fortnight and is O.K.<br/>This letter I am afraid will appear awfully disjointed. I seem to be writing it in stages. Since I started it this morning we have been in action about five times, and each time the letter has to be put away till all is quiet again.<br/>Life is fairly monotonous here now. I was in an observation station for a few days after coming to this Battery and could see everything going on. Had a splendid view of the country from Achi Baba on the South, past Kilid Bahr heights on the East, to Hill 971 on the North, a scope of about 20 sq miles, but am now on a detached gun on my own, and as it it is all indirect firing, we are stuck down behind a hill and scarcely ever see anything of our targets. I go on duty at 4 am and come off at 8 pm. The hours are fairly long but as there is nothing to do but sleep during the time we are not in action, it is not such a great hardship.<br/>I hear poor old Burley has gone. He was only ashore about a fortnight and was shot in the stomach during a night attack<br/>III</p>
