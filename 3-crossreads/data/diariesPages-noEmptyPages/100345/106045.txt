V. C. (by a modest Private)
 drowned those who fell in their sleep
We fought we charged we battled
Till the eighth line of trenches we took
For every man there was a hero
From me to the poor old cook
 there was the knoll just before us
Some two hundred paces or more
With barbed wire entanglements glistening
 the parapets slippery with gore
 the Howitzers roared like perdition
 vomited fire death
Till we saw it was madness to charge them
so halted a moment for breath.
Then up came our gallant major
His face lit with hopes cheering bliss
Pass the word for pte juggins
He'll find us a way out of this.
If there's on thing I hate it is skiting
when I hear it I always feel sore
So you won't think Im boasting when I tell you
He ought to have sent for me before
A great cheer arose as I faced him
 said Sir I'll see you through.
I've a scheme in my head that will beat them
 we'll wallop them black blue.
Then I shook hands with all the battalion
(There was only 13 of us left)
 they cheered me again till the foemen
must have thought us of senses bereft
So I gathered my arms my rations
 girded myself for the fray.
If I live to be ninety or over
I'll always remember that day.
