<p>are not the best of sea-boats. I will close the second chapter of the trip now, I have made it as brief and interesting as possible. Some things I have omitted that would not interest anyone. I have omitted the dull daily routine, not told of how we got sick of the slow speed (five or six knots) how as the days lengthened into weeks all hands got sick and tired of the monotony, until we were snapping and snarling at one another like caged tigers, how we became sick of always seeing the same ships on each side, or how we tired of the constant calmness of the Indian Ocean with its deep blue, which we all admired at first, but afterwards wished it would change to pink, red, yellow, or any old colour for a change. Or how at times we imagined hell as being full of N.C.O's giving physical drill to poor damned souls. Such things as those are only worries of the moment, and are at once forgotten when land is again sighted, and there id the prospect of stretching our legs for a few hours ashore. The healthy of the troops has been very good. We have two or three mumps and measles cases aboard, and several injuries. The infectious cases will go ashore tomorrow, also a couple who will go to the local Milson Island. In xxxxxx the whole convoy there has been only two deaths (one heart disease and one accident) a very good record when you consider that our ship alone has nearly 1800 men aboard.<br/>Trusting you are all xx O.K, and wishing to be remembered to everyone, with love and best wishes I remain Yours to a cinder Bill.</p>
