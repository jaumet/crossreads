<p>In the afternoon the Australia went out  -  She was unattended save by a fast collier  -  The Yarra came in &amp; anchored  -  I did nothing all day  -  I wanted a spell &amp; in addition there was nowhere to go to on the beach  -</p>
<p>The wildest buz is afloat  -  Everyone is going to Sydney  -  We are all to go to Valparaiso "The Falklands" The Australia is to go alone to Valparaiso &amp; the rest to sit hard  -  We are to go to Noumea &amp; be joined up by AE2 &amp; the Destroyers  -  As an actual fact no one knows anything  -</p>
<p>Monday Nov 9  Steam ordered for 5.30 am  -  At 6 we were alongside the wharf &amp; began taking in fresh water  -  No further news  -  We are to report to the Encounter when our tanks are full  -  I went ashore at 9  -  Got my hair cut &amp; bought some P. Cards for R &amp; Mab  -  I also invested in 3 stone axes for R's benefit  -  Nothing like seeing &amp; handling these old instruments of Neolithic man  -  At the shops they told me the polished axes were the more valuable which is just the reverse of correct  -  The older unpolished axe is far the more valuable &ndash; the unpolished represents man in the Paleolithic or <u>old</u> stone age  -</p>
