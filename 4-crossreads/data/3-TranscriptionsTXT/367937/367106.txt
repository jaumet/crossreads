 etc of by the train to Wellington and I met Madoline Wright. Her brother is managing Camden park and the family is living at the homestead and it is two miles from the camp and so she has asked me to spend the some evenings there and is going to send her brother over to call on me and drive me back with him. The funny thing is that Captain Capt. Downes ownes Camden park and is often there and they call him "Gus." So the plot thickens does it not. Also saw Miss Bushby and am to let her know when I can get leave and then go there to feed. Got two khaki collars at David Jones this morning.  This morning us kids &amp; Dudley went for a swim &amp; the Telarahites wanted us to go boating this afternoon but I dont like rowing and rowing together so we did not go.
