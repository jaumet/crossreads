 Dear George, Mum & Dad, 
 Just a few lines on the Eve of X'Mas. It has been a lovely Time. Ellis & I went for a walk to Dorrington to-day. He is a rotten walker. We had Tea out. I've  been trying to write a few letters tonight. I went to Salisbury yesterday & just visited my Friends as usual. I hope to go to a Dance next Saturday night. I may go to Salisbury on Boxing Day too.  The temp is still below freezing point, It has never been above since last Sunday. I have had no mail for a good while now. We know that one has arrived in England so we ought to get it any day now. We have lots of good things promised for X'mas so we anticipate a right Royal Time. I had some Hankey's &  a lovely pocket wallet presented to me so even over here I get X'mas presents. Well, Dad, Mum &  George I have only had the old Camp Routine this week so I will conclude by assuring you that we are both well &  happy. Our Salisbury friends are to Both.   Lots of Love  Harry
