Clean as a new pin, seemed to be cultivated.  Bapaume is absolutely in ruins, not a sound house there.  All trees including fruit trees cut down.  Everything destroyed.  The Huns were living in the cellars because, as we went through the town, one could see written up Keller, 40, Man, and so on.  Huns shelling the town this evening.  10 or 11 tanks on the road disabled.  All water</p>
