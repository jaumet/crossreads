<p>XV Corps. No. 128/28.G.</p>
<p>Major-General T.W. Glasgow, CB. CMG. DSO.<br/>Commanding 1st Australian Division,</p>
<p>Before your magnificient Division leaves my Corps, I wish to thank you and all ranks under your command for the exceptional services rendered during the past four months.</p>
<p>Joining this Corps on April 12th during the Battle of the Lys, the Division selected and prepared a position to defend the Hazebrouck Front, and a few days later repulsed two heavy attacks with severe losses to the enemy.  This action brought the enemys advance to a standstill.</p>
<p>Since then, the Division has held the most important sector of this front continuously, and by skilful raiding and minor operations has advanced the line over a mile on a front of 5,000 yards, capturing just short of 1,000 prisoners, and causing such damage to the troops of the enemy that nine Divisions have been replaced.</p>
<p>The complete success of all minor operations;  the skill displayed by the patrols by day as well as by night;  the gallantry and determination of the troops;  and their high state of training and discipline have excited the admiration and emulation of all, and I desire that you will convey to all ranks my high appreciation of their fine work and my regret that the Division is leaving my Command.</p>
<p>(sgd) Beauvoir de Lisle.<br/>Lieutenant-General,<br/>Commanding XV Corps.</p>
<p>XV Corps Headquarters,<br/>4th. August, 1918.</p>
