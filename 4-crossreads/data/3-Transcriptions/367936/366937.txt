<p>Tuesday 22 February 1916<br/>Train very crowded but Mother and I had a fair trip up and were met by Father at Warrobil.  I rode Zaida home, nice to be on a horse again.  Place looks terribly dry.  Thunder storm in evening.  Started to rain.</p>
<p>Wednesday 23 February 1916<br/>Good storm at night and rain during day;  had 70 pts.<br/>Father &amp; Mother drove to Wonga in evening;  I went shooting rabbits in back paddock and burning hollow logs.<br/>Rabbits are fairly thick but very wild.</p>
