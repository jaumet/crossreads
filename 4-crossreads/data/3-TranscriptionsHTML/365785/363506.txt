<p>On Friday afternoon I was invited by Miss Bagen &ndash; one of the Vol. workers &ndash; to Afternoon Tea at her Sister's &ndash; Mrs. Major Blunt, they were having some British Tommys from the Red Cross Hospital and I quite enjoyed it.  They were happy-go lucky sort of men and appeared to be enjoying life in spite of wounds.  Yesterday Mrs. Blunt, Miss Bagen, one of the Sisters &amp; myself had a lovely sail round the island, Miss Bagen being hostess, it was so beautifully cool on the water.  The "Comforts Fund" as far as the Hospitals are concerned is at an end.  The money was drawn from the War Fund &amp; as that was intended for men at the Front &amp; in the Camps the Executive has decided that no more money may be spent on Hospitals.  Mr. Budden</p>
