Wounds are healing up nicely, no sight of septic whatever. I will be going gay round London in a week or so & then back to the battalion.I suppose the casuality lists caused quite a stir in Australia, we were all mixed up in this last business & suffered heavily also, it is a cruel thing this war I lost some very fine friends & had a good platoon of men & needless to say it was cut
