My dearest Father,As you will see by the address, we are still when we landed.  Although no word has reached us yet as to our future movements, we might move off any day at an hours notice.  With 4 or 5 others I went out to the Pyramids the other day.  We went out by tram & they are about 8 miles out of Cairo.  The tram takes you to within a quarter of a mile of them & then we went up from the tram on camels.  Great awkward brutes they are, & they always object to getting down on their haunches.  We went direct to the sphinx, & it is well worth looking at.  Part of the nose is gone, & is said to have been shot off with a cannon ball by Napoleon when he invaded Egypt.  Then we went to the biggest of the Pyramids & it is truly a marvellous bit of work.  As I stood there, I did what thousands before me have done, asked "However did they get those huge stones into their position."  A good number went right to the apex of the pyramid but I felt safer below.  We didn't bother about going inside either as they make all visitors take their boots & socks off & it was too much like work with our leggings & spurs on.  I am keeping well but for a slight cold in the head.  We have a heavy fog every morning here lately.  Trust you are all well.  No letters rec'd yet, but expect one any day.  Love to all at homeYour loving son,Leo.
