 17:  After spending an awful night, we left Beitin at 9 a.m., losing no less than four of our twenty horses en route, owing to the cold.  Men were leading horses which had gone lame & I had to walk & lead two horses - owing to them knocking up - a distance of 9 miles to Bethlehem, reaching here at 6 p.m.  Rain ceased during the night, so we lit a fire & sat around drying our clothes & nap

 20:  Left Bethlehem at 6 p.m. in fine weather, carrying 48 hours rations for men & horses & a days food on camels.  Reached Tel-at-ed Dumm  at 2 a.m. next morning, staying here till 6 p.m., when we moved on to the wadi Kelt, camping here till 4 a.m. on the 23rd.
