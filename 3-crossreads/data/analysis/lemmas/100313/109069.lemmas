 23/1/18 Crieff A rather finer day but still veri Scotch misti . Walk with the two girl up to the Knock ? a high peak just behind the town . Ordinarili from here there is a veri fine view but just now it is all obscur by the fog cloud and such littl glimps as could be got disclos patch of vanish snow among the littl wood of fir and other tree . We were yarn after our lunch and did not move out until 4 when we went down to tea with the Hunter Smith at the Mans . There seem a varieti of church here . ( U.P. U.F Establish c ) Spent the even with the famili round the fire . Later Dr Mrs. Burnet came and we had some music . After they had left we stay up talk until close on midnight and then turn in . Honest direct and straight out peopl are the Scotch . There is an absenc of affect and artifici that is common to the English .
