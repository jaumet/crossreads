<p>Aug 1st Beautiful day. Everything fairly quiet except for an occasional shell one of which smashed up a convoy near the Cathedral. Our guns open out about 5 pm.<br/>Aug 2nd Warm. Quiet all day. The 2nd Aus Div. will go over the parapet for the third time to-night. General Birdwood will take command of both Artillery &amp; Infantry. He stated that we <u>must</u> gain our objective to-night at all costs. <br/>About 7.30 pm the Huns sent some shells into the town. Bricks &amp; sand were flying all over the place. Many of his shells were defective &amp; did not burst &ndash; luckily for us. <br/>8.10 pm our artillery has opened out &amp; is sending a hail of shells into the German lines. There promises to be a big bombardment tonight.<br/>Aug 3rd There certainly was some bombardment last night. Star shells &amp; shrapnel lit up the sky &amp; Howitzers screamed through the air. Some place France! Our boys did not go over the parapet last night.<br/>Very quiet all day except for the heavy batteries alongside us. About 7 pm our artillery opened out a terrific bombardment which lasted till about 6 am 4th inst.</p>
