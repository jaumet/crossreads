 comes to light &amp; is much appreciated, last night a Ventriloquist, actualled  amused us &ndash; One of the Sisters plays the Flute well &amp; a few Violins find some very fair handlers. 
 We passed the  Line  about 11 a.m. but we are sadly pressed for Deck Space, we were unable to indulge in any Neptunic pranks etc needless to add we were all keenly disappointed. 
 Saturday 19/2/16 
 Very nice day. Impossible for sea to be any calmer, hardly a wave. A large P &amp; O Liner passed us for Australia 1.30 am, looked very pretty in the distance, all lit up. Another Boat passed about 10.30 am &ndash; although only passing, incidents in Civil life, it was quite an important topic today &ndash; for a change. Had some Sports on Deck this evening, 1 mile Race &ndash; Tug of War, etc.
