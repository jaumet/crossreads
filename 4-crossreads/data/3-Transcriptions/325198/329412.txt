<p>13 Dec, 1916<br/>Bayoud<br/>Yesterday I was on gaurd up at the Regimental store,  The gift stuff was given out, it did not amount to much.  A peice of cake, half a dozen lollies each &amp; two bottles of sauce &amp; a tin of fruit for the section was our whack.  We got the second dose of Cholera innoculation stuck into us yesterday &amp; to day my arm is a bit sore  This morning I went down to the wells, did a bit of washing &amp; had a bath, thats a good morning's work to my credit</p>
