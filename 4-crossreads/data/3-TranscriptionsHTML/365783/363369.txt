I have been very busy since our arrival here &amp; have hardly had a moment to myself but I feel all the better for having plenty to do.   Our camp is on the sandy desert, not a blade of grass, &amp; when it is at all windy, things are any thing but pleasant.   We are pretty near ship shape now &amp; I am looking forward to being able to take things a bit easier.   We have 38 large hospital marquees pitched, each capable of holding 14 patients &amp; each splendidly equipped with everything that the most exacting patient could ask for &ndash; all our tents are not yet full &ndash; we have about 450 patients, most of them convalescents.   You will be pleased to hear that I received much commendation from our O.C. for the manner in which I laid out the camp &amp; this was published in orders.  In addition to the hospital marquees we have six big store tents in which all our general stores are housed &ndash; a large store tent for hospital stores, 20 bell tents for the personnel &amp; tents for officers &amp; nurses   All our officers mess up at Mena House &amp; we live on the fat of the land &ndash; the officers whose patients are at Mena House live there but most of us are in tents down here on the flat</p>
