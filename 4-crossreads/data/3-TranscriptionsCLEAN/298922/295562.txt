CairoWaiting & Hoping. The Turkshave a proverb viz, "Power over the Water hath ALLAH given to the intercessor but over the land to the faithful" - strange people. I lost my book altho' I turned the Hotel servants upside down for it - "They only said it was the "Will of ALLAH". Went to Church with Nowell. Later on to a Carnival of Flowers & Confetti in some Gardens here a Fete for the French.
We also had our "caricatures" done for 40 P.T. I am posting you mine in a TIN TUBE & hope it arrives safely.
