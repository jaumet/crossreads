<p>Saturday, 11 September, 1915<br/>The 7th Bde of Inf landed to-day and the 2nd have gone off when the 4th go we hear we are the next.  To-day was a real red letter day as I received no less than 13 letters and papers in the big mail that came in.  when mail arrives there is one huge smile of satisfaction over everyones face.  We hear that this regiment is to be in another attack to-morrow night at a place called Snipers nest.  There is great recruiting going on by Aust and it is badly wanted before Achi Baba &amp; 971 &amp; Popes Hill will fall.  The Turks shelled nearly all day but have a poor idea of range.</p>
<p>Sunday, 12 September, 1915<br/>I have got into the full swing of my work now and find I have a splendid job, the kind that I always wanted, my own boss and no S.M's to harrass you.  Church service by Col. Merrington the Bde Chaplain in the p m the first service I have seen for four months, Sunday has been no different from any other day on active service in fact my diary is the only thing that makes me remember dates.  The General &amp; Staff, Birdwood &amp; Chauvel were up to-day and looked at Sniper's Rest and condemned the attack, the position is on top of a precipice and a Brigade scaling it would lose heavily for no gains.  Rained a little during the night one man brought in slightly wounded.</p>
