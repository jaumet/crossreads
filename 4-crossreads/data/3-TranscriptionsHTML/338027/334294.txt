I will not be allowed to take part in Review to-morrow.  Many of the men celebrate N. Year by [indecipherable] the officers &amp; S.M. with [indecipherable][indecipherable].</p>
<p>New Years Day<br/>Happy New Year to all in Aust.  at 8.30 all 1st Bde of Aust Light Horse moved off with the D.S.C.  They looked splendid as they marched past the saluting point at Ma'adi station where Sir George Reid took the salute looking fatter &amp; happier than ever when they all returned &amp; unharnessed they were marched to head quarters where Sir George addressed them in a short cheery speech congratulating the Australians on their fine appearance and telling them that Lord Kitchener had promised him that we would all go to the front as soon as we were ready.  Three ringing cheers were then given by the troops for the King Sir John Maxwell &amp; the High Commissioner.</p>
