<p>On the road to El Arish you get bully in your dish<br/>And you'll eat it if you want a ponzer thirst<br/>And the flies they make you cry, but you kid your self its Pie,<br/>Though you own you'd even rather eat some German Wurst.<br/>And you have to guess a range for yer peepers need change,<br/>And you wonder if Jock Burk is one or two<br/>Its "Shove it up from four to six'  Raise your head &amp; see his "[indecipherable]"<br/>And yer cobber says "You've got him in the shoe"</p>
<p>On the road to El Arish where the water stinks like fish<br/>The Padre says three Joes have been before,<br/>There was Joseph &amp; his brother &amp; later on two others<br/>But those Joes were out for peace &amp; not for war<br/>Joe Burk's a different brand, he don't feed out yer 'and<br/>And he lurks behind a sand hill for a "pot"<br/>If you get him in a Hod you may send him home to God<br/>That supposing you've the luck to get him first shot</p>
<p>On the road to El Arish, wear Joe's bullets going "Swich"<br/>Through the date palms on the hod where your'e at rest<br/>But we've taught him what he's learnt &amp; he got his fingers burnt<br/>Apullin German Chestnuts comin West<br/>And he's calling out "Ma leish" on the road to El Arish<br/>And the White flags always ready in his hand<br/>Oh he's crossing the Canal but he isnt going to yell<br/>For the Boob is very quiet compared with sound</p>
<p>[Maleesh = Arabic, never mind]<br/>We were the Honey Honey Suckle<br/>Joe Burk was the bee.<br/>He tried to sip the honey<br/>From our Camp at Romani<br/>We've got him "beaten and retreaten"<br/>To his base of course<br/>We gained a victory for the good<br/>Australian Light Horse</p>
