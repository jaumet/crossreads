<p>Saturday 9th Dec.<br/>Visited Hospital this morning, no casualties from our Batt.<br/>Made arrangements for services tomorrow.  The Chaplains of 9th Bgde. met the Brigadier at 3 oclock.  Instructions were that Battln. parades were to be held not denominational.</p>
<p>Sunday 10th<br/>I had a church parade this morning for the small units of the Bgde. but they were all working so I gathered about 30 men together in the Gas School Ecole Professionale &amp; we had a very nice little service.  Subject "Ye are the Body of Xt".<br/>This afternoon the enemy shelled the town again.  The big shells can be heard whistling before they break &amp; it gives one a few moments anxiety as to whether they will fall on <strike>you</strike> one or not.  Three shells fell near our billets within 150 yards.  Killed one man &amp; wounded another.  The people take refuge in the Cellars but we did not.</p>
