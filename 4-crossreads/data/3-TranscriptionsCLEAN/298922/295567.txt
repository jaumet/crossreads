Friday 14 September 1917
AlexThe old ship Aragon our G.H.Q. ship at Gallipoli was recently here - it would be a coincidence if I sailed in her.
Today I & 2 other officers went to Stanley Bay for a swim & in the afternoon to the Yatch Club for tea.
Still no word as to embarking & altho' I am enjoying the spell I am naturally impatient to be off. This town is of course darkened at night & I had to sign a certificate that I alone would be responsible if a light were shown from my window in Hotel.
