<p>on to the Bn at 4 this evening dont like the idea nor do any of the others But by Jove I had a fine time in London, Theatres Music Luncheons nice beds etc oh dont wake it up, absolute paradise and then back in the mud again no wonder nearly all the crowd are quite and sitting down smoking and looking into the rain with a far away look in their peepers. I hope I get a decent knock that will send me home again to Blighty but I wish I could have got home instead</p>
