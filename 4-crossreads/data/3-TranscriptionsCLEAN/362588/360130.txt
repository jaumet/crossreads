  
 parade at half past.  From half past six till seven we do whatever physical exercises the weather & atmospheric conditions permit.  At a quarter past seven we go down to the troop decks to see our men fed, & at eight o'clock we feed ourselves.  Between breakfast & ten o'clock we rack our brains to find something to do on the next parade, & at ten o'clock we carry out the suggestion of our fertile brains, that is, of course, unless we again change our minds after falling in, which is not infrequently the case.  If, for instance, you had decided to give a lecture, & after falling in you find that the platoon next door has chosen the delightfully noise occupation, known as rapid loading & unloading with dummy cartridges, you would make a dismal mess of things in general, if you carried out your first intentions, & so you decide to contribute as much as possible, to the already very successful pandemonium.  This parade, however, for my platoon, generally consists of a little semaphore signalling, a little musketry, & a small talk on general subjects which contain information likely to prove useful at any time.  This parade, until quite lately, lasted till eleven forty five.  At twelve fifteen we again enjoy the pleasure of seeing our commands fed & at one o'clock we enjoy the far greater pleasure of feeding our noble selves.  After this meal, we are again confronted with the difficulty of providing work for the "two-to-four"
