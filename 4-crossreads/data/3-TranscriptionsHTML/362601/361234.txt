<p>2nd M.S.</p>
<p>F.<br/>I go on Deck &amp; read for sometime. Go to bed after dinner but too cold to sleep. I listen to lecture on [indecipherable] &amp; pests of fruit while in my hammock. We are again warned about a storm. A debate on Japan &amp; Australia. I go to hospital &amp; write until after lights out.</p>
