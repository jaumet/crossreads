<p>Saturday 7 July 1917</p>
<p>You remember BANJO's Preludes, <u>I am plagarizing - but</u> I have gathered these notes, afar in the wind &amp; the rain in the land where the Bedouin Camps are on the edge of the plains. They are just the rude stories one hears in sadness &amp; mirth. The records of wandering years and scant is their worth. Though their merits indeed are but slight I shall not repine. If they give you one moments delight Old Mother of mine.</p>
