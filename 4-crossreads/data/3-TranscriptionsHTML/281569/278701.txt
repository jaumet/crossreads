<p>13 July, 1916 Thursday</p>
<p>Stunt</p>
<p>The troops moved out at dawn &amp; first of all started on Mehagnia thence to Khaiba where a nigger or two was struck but one got away, we then went straight on &amp; finally reached Debabis traces of the enemy were found but only in small numbers &amp; in many of the Hods they were only down to prune the dates for the next season. The troops burnt all the compounds &amp; raked in any niggers but they can beat our fellows hollow the horses can't get a wriggle on, several of the officers of the 2nd got plenty of curios, one a beautiful inlaid pistol of ivory &amp; silver, one which had been used 100 years ago &amp; the flint was still in great order we assembled at Oghratina &amp; withdrew at dusk, leaving for camp shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>14 July, 1916 Friday</p>
<p>Had a holiday today, nothing much doing, put in for our leave &amp; should get it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Work pretty brisk during the day in the office &amp; more lines are proposed for tomorrow as if we havn't got enough to do now.</p>
<p>McCoil has transferred his HQ from Hill 40 to here permanently now so should prove troublesome at times although he's perfectly harmless. Braithwaite &amp; Co are also up.</p>
