<p>If kind letters from all sort of men and women &ndash; friends &ndash; Officials, Tommies, officers and nurses could find comfort, I report to be a <strike>healed</strike> comforted man &ndash; They tell me of <strike>his</strike> Archies abilities and usefulness and courage are all the good qualities of mind and heart that make for useful [indecipherable] and fine pride to my mind &amp; his father &ndash; Tommies write or tell their nurses that Archie was the ablest officer they had &ndash; and his brother officers write that he actually was not forced to fight &ndash; and that he rushed to his death cheering and urging his company over an open valley &ndash; he was hit 2'ce before the 3rd shot in his abdomen laid him out. He was found with a neat piece of paper pinned on his coat with these words &ndash; "Ive taken morphine, don't shift me about for 24 hrs &ndash; Don't find me food" &ndash; after a night on the beach I believe, he was taken on board a hospital ship the "Valdinis" &ndash; I believe the officer in command was called Lieut Higgins RAMC &ndash; (the name and letters do not suggest high surgical talent) Nothing was done. Some people console me by saying nothing could be done &ndash; but he died of quiet haemorrhage I believe not directly of peritonitis &ndash; The only spoken <strike>world</strike> words he seems to have uttered which have come back to us during these last 24 distressful hours were his reiterated question &ndash; "For Gods sake why don't you operate upon me?"</p>
