<p>wasteful fences separating adjourning properties were conspicuously absent. A narrow open drain frequently performed this office besides carrying off drainage, but more often one cultivation area seemed to have no permanent line of demarcation from the one next to it, a field of clover extending right up to a vineyard or fallow and so on.<br/>The banks of the river and streams were planted up with osiers which were well &ndash;pollarded, here and there giving place to shaggy poplars containing numerous large birds nests on to silver poplars which later in the season with every breath of wind gave a peculiar scintillating effect due to the dark upper and silver under surfaces of the leaves alternately showing up. The horse chestnut trees were more backward than those seen outside Marseilles showing the later spring of the more northern latitudes.<br/>The cultivation areas were here and there interrupted with delightful patches of woodland in which the trees stood stripped of their leaves. Shy little groups of primroses, cowslips and crocuses were to be seen hiding along the edges of these woods and forests. But cultivated land was general. In one winter fallowed field an aged couple were hard at work ploughing, the white bearded man wearing baggy velvet trousers and looking typical French peasant; his wife wore short skirts and had a shawl thrown over her head and shoulders. The plough was an old digger type; a single furrow mouldboard fitted with two large guide wheels and was drawn by two bullocks and a fine looking horse, a rather queer combination that recalled at once similar sights in Egypt.<br/>The habitations were mainly scattered farm cottages of red brick with high pitched tile roofs and large chimney places at the end. Sometimes the houses were grouped in hamlets and villages. Everywhere the troops got the same hearty welcome, old and young lustily waving and even throwing kisses in return for those dispatched by the men on the train.<br/>Now we rushed past a viaduct where on sentry duty was an old veteran dressed in red trousers with short leggings, blue long coat with corners turned back and a battered peaked cap. In addition to his rifle he had an umbrella to guard against the frequent showers! He had a cosy shelter close by in the form of a sort of sentry box, and as the journey proceeded we found that at every bridge, overhead-way or other venerable point along the railway a sentry was posted and invariably was an old man unfit for more active duty closer to the firing line.<br/>Then passing through Villefranche we traversed further stretches of river flats to Macon where we stopped for breakfast. This is a large town on the Saone and an important railway junction. We saw only the extensive trucking yards and station. There were the usual boilers of hot coffee and rum for the men of whom members went with us to the Buffet for a breakfast of ham and eggs etc.</p>
