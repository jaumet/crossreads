<p>Some English residents the other night awoke to find a native in the house &ndash; apparently with intent to stick a knife into one of them. He got away unfortunately but nothing was taken and it was only his stumbling against the bedpost that awoke the man whose room he was in.</p>
<p>Strangely enough some minutes before the mans sister in law thought she heard something and went to look &ndash; even going into the brother in laws room. He was sleeping so she went back thinking she had made a mistake. She had barely got back to her room when she heard the man calling her to bring her revolver. Evidently the native had been behind the door when she entered her brother's room.</p>
<p>Then again two nights ago a row occurred in the street &amp; a man was killed by some students. The city is apparently normal &ndash; there have been no daytime demonstrations for some time now.</p>
<p>Some more of the AIF got away yesterday &ndash; the remainder of the 1st L H Brigade &ndash; the Hdqrs, 3rd Regt MGS Signal troop &amp; remainder of ambulance.  The present rate of demobilisation allowed is 1000 per month &ndash; at which rate the last will get away about next May.</p>
<p>As the release of MO's for England is at the same rate I can see no prospect of setting off for a couple of months &ndash; unless the thing is hurried up &ndash; which they are trying to effect.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Dorothy a week or so ago &ndash; written</p>
