<p>thought so much of by others outside his own family circle and I can assure you it will be a great grief to Eldon if he survives to hear it.</p>
<p>Killed in the noble cause of right &amp; justice, (which must prevail) in defence of his King &amp; Country, he has passed the bar to his reward &ndash; my heart is too full to write &amp; I break down at each attempt to continue &ndash;</p>
<p>We all truly &amp; deeply sympathise with you and may the great, good and everlasting God comfort you all in your sorrow,</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>James Moran</p>
