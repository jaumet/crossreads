 the coast , Just a farm Commun , the littl villag is hidden away down in a valley and would in Summer be a picturescu littl place . the Church is in the centr , and each morn about 7 A.M , we hear the bell ring on Sunday the villag come from a littl villag about two Kilometr away , all dress in their best Sunday Cloth . The farm land lie all round the villag , and I believ it near all belong to one man , who live in a big Chateau just near the villag . The princip crop , seem to be wheat , Mangold , for winter feed for stock , Turnip , and Sugar Beet , The latter crop is just be harvest and sent away to the Refineri . . farmer are also busi plow and sow wheat , which the Rook prompt search for , there are thousand of Rook here , They are everywher one look , across the field and natur look after them well , in the part of the world , there are no berri , but there are enough earth worm to feed all the Rook in Franc round here , The earth just seem to be Teem with them .
