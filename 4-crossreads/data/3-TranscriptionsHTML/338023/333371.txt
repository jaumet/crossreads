<p>[Page 2 of the letter is part 2 of page 178]<br/>a despatch. My rolled g.coat &amp;   <strike>oil sheet</strike> w.p. cape actually  saved me from joining the great majority and when they were disentangling me from my gear somebody went to a lot of trouble to wake me up &amp; tell me I'd topped the list of the Lucky.</p>
<p>Anyhow it was a great kick and what worries me most is that it blew my souvenirs to glory &ndash; they were good ones too, including buttons, a watch &amp; pr glasses which had only been in my possession 20 minutes!</p>
<p>It took me 8 days to get this far &amp; I'm expecting to be hopping round to-morrow or next day. After that I may</p>

<p>Yesterday Austn RedX visitors called and left me papers, writing material etc, for this letter &amp; bless them, a complete toilet outfit including a tip-top razor.</p>
<p>Ypres is a good place to be away from &ndash; war there has got down to about the lowest possible hell of filth and black ruin. Theres not a yard of ground that has not been torn up by HE.

Awful.</p>
