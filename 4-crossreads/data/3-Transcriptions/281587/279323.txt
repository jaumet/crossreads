<p>ruins of Qulast ed Doumm, or Castle of Blood.  These ruins are <strike>very</strike> extremely ancient, and built of a very red stone, from which it is generally supposed it takes its name.  The present ruins were built by the Crusaders, and were spoken of by very early writers, but according to Authorities, they only replaced a much older construction.  From the summit of these ruins a magnificent view can be obtained, taking in the Valley of the Jordan, and the Mount of Temptation, with the Monastry on its heights.</p>
<p>We were to go on to Jericho from here, but it was decided at night that only a portion of the Ambulance was going; and to my disappointment our limber was not included.</p>

The same morning, at about 8.30 we were on the way again, once more through Jerusalem, and arrived at El Khudr, frozen through and through, <strike>about</strike> a little after midday.  All the rest of that day it rained, sleeted, and froze.</p>
<p>The 23rd dawned in a similar state of icy misery.  I stayed under the blankets all the time not occupied in attending to the horses.</p>
<p>At about 4.30 P.M. we received orders to yoke up <strike>again</strike> and proceed again to the Mt. of Olives.  These endless fruitless</p>
