c/o The Australian Commonwealth Office Horseferry Road London 8.12.1915Dear Marg,Got your letter dated 1st Aug. on the 5th Decr   & was sorry to hear that a blacklist cow in the paddock had got you bluffed by staring at you.  I had a great time on Furlough   & saw Killarney lakes   & Giants Causeway.  Was also staying with our Aunts in Londonderry   & have been to Dublin  & Brighton, also stayed some time in London.  There is an advertisement in one of the tube railways under London which amused me - it was a lot of rabbits diving into a burrow   & had "we all go the same way home" under it - they are very handy for getting about though.  I used to think if I went to London I would get lost, but got on alright by asking the way occasionally.  I suppose you know it is very dark at night all over the London
