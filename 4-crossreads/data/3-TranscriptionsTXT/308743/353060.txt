Revielle at 5.A heavy thunderstorm came over last night & nearly drove the horses frantic with the peals, & a hatch fell from above to make matters worse. Great preparations have been taking place all day for Father Neptune's visit a large canvas tent has been made to receive all visitors & policemen have been told off to assist. We got word today that we would probably arrive in Colombo on Sunday morning & stay there three days. The Boxing Comp started tonight & our chaps Monty won his bout easily & Trumpeter Longwill his & they are to fight off in a couple of nights time. I have drawn against Fred Jenkins in chess & hope to win. Horses are in grand fettle & very [indecipherable] & they are also picking up condition.
