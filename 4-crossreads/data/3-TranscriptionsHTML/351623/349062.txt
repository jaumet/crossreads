Just before we got to the main gates they called a halt to wait &amp; collect our kits. While we were waiting there Captain Carmichael came along &amp; addressed us, &amp; wanted the trouble stated to him. He spoke fair enough because he knew that the men were in the right. Anyhow he got the majority of the men to wait &amp; not go any further till he went back to camp &amp; inspected the conditions</p>
