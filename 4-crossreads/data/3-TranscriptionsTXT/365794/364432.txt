 Thursday 1 February 1917 [31 January 1918] Big day, went across to Vally of the Kings by boat, party of 9 &amp; about 11 attendants all told, with the donkey boys rode through Valley of death (so I rechristen it) &amp; went into tomb of &hellip;. where he lies in state as he has been lying these hundreds of years.  When found he had a wreath of mimosa flowers on his head &amp; in one hand lotus flowers, in the other papyrus.  How stern &amp; set looks the face &amp; yet how very little changed from the other faces I have seen where Death has laid his hand.  Visited more tombs then lunch &amp; a peep at &hellip; &amp; so rode again home past the Collossi standing now in green fields.  Luxor Hotel at 9 p.m. &amp; dance &amp; song "A perfect day" sung with feeling, supper in "Savoy" garden &amp; then ends Jan. '18.  Bed 12.30 a.m.
