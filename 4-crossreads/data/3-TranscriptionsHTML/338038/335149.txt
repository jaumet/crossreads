<p>2<br/>appears to be improving.<br/>I have not had such a treat for months as I had in reading all the home news contained in your various letters, and am pleased to see by Mum's that Father's rheumatism is slightly better, and I do hope the next mail will tell me it has disappeared completely.<br/>I have little or no news of any of our Friends who are in the scrap over here. Our Major of this Battery (8th), Bevell-Browne, has been promoted to Lieut-Col and given a Brigade. His place has been filled here by a Captain Spurge another West Australian and a good sort. A few more D.A.C. officers have arrived here including Tommy Swallow who is for the present attached to our Battery, but I am not sure what his ultimate job is to be &ndash; wish he could stay with us as he is a fine chap, and a very good gunner.<br/>Major Lucas is still in Egypt &ndash; I forget whether I mentioned Eric Lenehan in my last letter. He should be nearly home by this. He has my sympathy, poor beggar, having had such rotten luck, but I trust the trip will fix him up, and he may yet be back in time to "deal" out some "hate" to "John" Turk.<br/>II</p>
