I finished & went to see Dr. Ireland but he was out  -  I desired tea then but found I hadn't a bean on me  -  All the same I blew in at the tea room & told them how badly I needed refreshment but they'd have to give me the necessary credit which they promptly did - 9d for aft t here  -  Refreshed I then went for a walk - on my own - right round the harbor for a mile or more  -  I spotted a brilliant Kingfisher & a slate colored crane & lots of Indian starlings - the mongoose is wiping out bird life in Fiji I am told  -The plant life - trees, shrubs - herbs all interested me - Clerodendrons - Mangrove of the shiny laurel leaf kind - A very prickly shrub with lots of white flowers - a Solanum - Lantana  -  Palms here are dying - some disease apart from insects affects them  -  I told you Albyzias do splendidly here  -  I walked & observed & listened to the boom of the surf on the reef  -
