[Transcriber's notes: This diary starts off with Munro being a temporary draftsman in Divisional HQ, a job which he loved but that did not last and his activities then reverted to the more normal role of a soldier or a driver. He describes it well, including his wounding and recuperation in England.  This diary also covers the Armistice and his return to Australia.]
Thur. 18th July 1918Ordered to report at D.A.H.Q at Glisy for the position of the relieving Draftsman, as the other chap was going on "Blighty" leave.
Drawing office and my sleeping quarters were in a "Dug out" about 50 feet under the surface. Dozens of rooms in this dugout and all lit up with Electricity. The room I slept in had eight beds, and they were very comfortable, only a bit damp.
Fri 19th July 1918Out of bed 7-30am. Breakfast 8am and into the office at 9am.
Not much doing in the morning except marking up the maps in the Staff Captains office. Dinner 12-30pm Tea 4-30pm. Then my troubles started to come in re. the days shelling, etc. and I had to peg in, and make out charts of "Hostile shelling" and "Harassing Fire" for General Phillips. My work had to be checked first of all by Lieut Murray. Kept going till 11-30pm.
