Sun May 26th (cont)
After dinner a number of us went into Weymouth. It is about a mile from the Camp and quite a pleasant walk.
Weymouth is a very nice town and has a good promenade. The weather is glorious and the town is thronged with visitors. The prom presents a gay sight at night, when the soldiers get away from their Camps, then the sombre hued khaki mixed with the gay summer dresses of the Fair Sex, with the sea for a background makes quite a good picture.
I met Joe Bolger. He was looking in the park. Is up at Monte Video Camp, where he tells me Shag Shearer and Wally Clarke are also. Had Tea at Y.M. and returned home to Camp about 9. 
Mon May 27
Yesterday they moved us out of the Huts into Tents. It is much more pleasant but we have to walk a deuce of a way for a wash and for meals. The food is pretty light, but what we do get is good. I was put on a Fatigue Party pitching Tents, and it quite knocked me out. 
After Tea went into Weymouth again and met some of the crowd. That money old B.E. sent me could not have arrived at a better time. It is better down here than it would be in London. Went back to Camp about 8 and com. Left No 23.
