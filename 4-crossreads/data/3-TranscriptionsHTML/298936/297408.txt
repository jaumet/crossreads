<p>Good bye to the doctors &amp; and such nurses as I know &amp; away by car to Cairo station catching the midday train for Alexandria. The line runs through the very fertile land in the basin of the Nile delta.</p>
<p>Corn &amp; other crops as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>Arrived at Alexandria &amp; drafted to Mustapha barracks. Leave in Alex. for evening.</p>
<p>Went in with Kennet &amp; Hunter</p>
