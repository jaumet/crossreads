My dearest Father,I was glad to receive yours of 7th April yesterday.  Altho' this letter only reached me yesterday, one from you dated a fortnight week later arrived nearly 3 weeks ago.  The mails are very irregular here both outgoing & incoming.  It was in your letter of the 14th April that I learned that Rid had reached home safely.  I was very glad to hear this both for his own & also Ol's sake.  I often wish I could drop in & see you all again if it was only a 24 hour visit.Never mind, Dad, wait till the Imperial Air Service between England & Australia is established with a 6 days trip.  It will be worth while coming home then, when I am in command of one of those international machines & have 3 months leave of absence granted.In my last letter from Oxford I acknowledged the receipt of the remittance for 10 that I cabled for & also the parcel sent from A. H & Sons.  So far, I have received 2 parcels from through A.H. & Sons, from Auntie and Uncle & have acknowledged them.  From your letter there is evidently another parcel on its way.I got through all my Exams at Oxford alright.  My average for the whole of the subjects was 91% .  Out of the 26 Australian Cadets only 2 failed, so that is fairly satisfactory.  After finishing our course at Oxford we were granted 6 days leave.  I need hardly say that I spent them at Elsie's home, & had a quiet but enjoyable time.I am greatly relieved that I have passed through Oxford satisfactorily, for you know I have for some time past been very keen on this branch of the service, & only hope I get through my practical flying alright.  I am looking forward to the day when I arrive home with my wings up, & perhaps a little bit of ribbon tucked away underneath them.
