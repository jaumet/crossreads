 January, 1915 Tuesday 26 It is amusing how keen the Skippers are to pass the boat ahead if possible &amp; now we are next the flagship, as the "Ajana" has fallen out. Weather warmer again, we expect to disembark at Alexandria on Saturday next after 6 weeks at sea. Foundation day &amp; the Skippers gave half a bottle Beer to every trooper, &amp; whiskey to the Mess. I will send you the name of where I leave my "mufti" Kit-bags etc: as you know I have dress clothes &amp; good suits with me. Gold links Sovereign C/- etc presented by Mulberry gong men which I would not care to be lost.
