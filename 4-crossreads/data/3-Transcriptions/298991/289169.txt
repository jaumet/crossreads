<p>Friday May 18th<br/>Arrived in Edinburgh at 4.45 am. Had some breakfast at the red cross room on the station. Went for a walk round the city. It is a very well laid out place with very wide streets, but the trams are the doers. They are cable trams &amp; very small. Raining this morning. Went out in a motor bus to the Fort Bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth. It is a marvellous piece of engineering work, &amp; is a mile &amp; three quarters long, two spans is 1,710 feet high, &amp; the highest part is 361 ft above high water. It cost over &pound;3,000,000 &amp; took 5,000 men 7 years to construct.</p>
<p>After we had dinner we (a N.Zr. &amp; myself) went up to the old Edinburgh castle, parts of which date back to 1349, &amp; is a very historic place, commanding a great view all over the city. We later went through the Edinburgh Academy, where there are some splendid paintings, some worth hundreds of pounds. I put up at the Victoria League club for the night, it is a very comfortable place established only for overseas troops. My feet were aching very much when I arrived at the club. I like the ways of &amp; the scotch people very much. Things are much cheaper here than in London. Went for a walk through the gardens.</p>
<p>Saturday May 19th<br/>Did not get out until about 9.30 am. Caught the 1 pm train for Glasgow, arriving there about 2.15 pm. There was a "Scotch mist" at Edinburgh when we left, but it is bright enough upon arrival at Glasgow. Booked bed at Y.M.C.A., they only charge sixpence there &amp; not bad beds either.<br/>over</p>
