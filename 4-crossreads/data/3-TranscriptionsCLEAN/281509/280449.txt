14 August 1916Monday
Rain, Drill in morning.  Move off at 6 p.m. for Albert. Arrive about 10.30 p.m. after a hard & tiring march of 14 miles.  Bivouac on stubble field. Not long settled down when enemy shells begin to shriek overhead & land about 100 yards further on from 8 mile range. Shift our possie a few yards. Not much sleep. cold & uncomfortable. war conditions.
