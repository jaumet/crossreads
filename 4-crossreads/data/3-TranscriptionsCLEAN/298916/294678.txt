  
 welcome cry "Land oh".  It was the island of Sokotra off the North east corner of Africa, near the Gulf of Aden.  The island is inhabited by several thousand Arabs who are cannibals & live in caves.  It is 70 miles long & 20 miles wide - like a huge lozenge.  The surface is very rough & the mountains reach far above the clouds.  The coast is extremely rough & precipitous & on account of there being no lighthouses it is necessary to keep a sharp look out for Sokotra, especially during the monsoons.  It took all the afternoon to pass the island & in the water could be seen numerous sharks that had evidently been brought by the horses. Long pieces of red seaweed like sausage skins were floating about too. This seaweed is luminous at night & looks like large pieces of rhubarb. 
 24th November Being in the Gulf of Aden & also near that port, HMS Hampshire & the Orvieto left us & proceeded to Aden. The distress signal was to be used in case of being attacked & the cruiser would return. The soldiers by this time were beginning to get hungry so they were presented with a box of eggs.  Snakes: when their hats were knocked off they all began to whistle. They were beauties & did not add to ones appetite.
