We had some more shooting today, with very good results. Had letters from Lou and Miss Montague. Charley has rejoined his Unit in France My black Kit bag which has been at the base in Cairo seems to have gone astray as it has been sent for and reported as missing. I am making up another one gradually.

Had letter from home enclosing photo of Mater Lou and Helen. They look awfully well and Helen seems a fine Kiddy. The weather is keeping passably cool and if it continues we should soon be out of it. Another Egyptian restaurant started here this morning and I spent my last 10 piastres on a feed this afternoon. We have been too busy lately to get down for a swim.

We are leaving here for Moaskar before Sunday. It was mentioned on parade by Mr. Prior yesterday so it is the fair dinkum oil this time. I don’t suppose it will be long before we are on the water now. A big inspection of the Division again this afternoon by General Murray.

We had another shoot this morning and tomorrow I suppose we will be packing up as we move to Moascar on Sunday pending entrainment for Alexandria. We have to get rid of all cameras in some way. I am trying to sell mine as I am sorely in need of cash but so far have been unsuccessful. They don’t like buying as it will probably be confiscated in France.
