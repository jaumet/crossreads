I can tell you some of their trains are not too slow. & as the road was clear & the line is a very level one we rocked along at a fairly good speed for awhile  it took us 7 hours to go to Cairo its a fine sight along the track as the country is very thickly populated with villages built of mud every few hundred yards & they are full of Egyptians & they are as thick as bee's when we arrived at Cairo we had hot tea & bread & cheese provided for us. & set to work to unload our train & load it into tram cars it was raining all the time, after about an hours work we finished loading them & got into another lot of cars that were ready for us. they are all Electric trams after about an hours ride we reached "Mena Camp" where we had to set to work & unload all the trams   after this was done we marched over into the camp & dossed down on the sand about 11 pm for the night
