<p><u>3rd April</u>  Instructions received from the Defence Department to the effect that we are to go to Fremantle where we will discharge all Western Australian troops &amp; coal.</p>
<p><u>5th</u>  Later instructions from Defence Dept. cancel our proceeding to Fremantle &amp; order us to proceed to Albany.  The Western Australian people on board are very much annoyed about it.</p>
<p><u>7th</u>  The first bit of Australia was seen this morning about 6 o'clock.  I saw it about 7 o'clock.  We passed Cape Leeuwin about 11 o'clock.</p>
