<p>Jeudi 30th Mai<br/>A very quiet day &amp; bright sunshine, very little news though of the offensive, the nearest we can get is that he has advanced about 12 miles but it is not authentic.

<p>Vendredi 31st Mai<br/>Fine warm day. Very little doing.  Went over to Querrieu &amp; saw the 13th which Amb we are relieving tomorrow.

They are leaving a lot so will not have much packing up</p>
