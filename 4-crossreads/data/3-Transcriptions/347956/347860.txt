<p>Sun 17th<br/>Church service in the recreation tent.  Nelson went out after dinner.  Stan had a pass but did not use it as he wanted to write.  I put the afternoon &amp; evening in writing &amp; did not attend the sing-song after tea as I had to feed us at 8.45 PM.  we received a dozen photos each (Stan &amp; I) taken by a Sergeant signaller from the 2nd L.H.
