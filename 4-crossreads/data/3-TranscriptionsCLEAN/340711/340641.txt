We are, too, beyond sound of the guns. Our billet is an old factory. Impossible to get eggs or anything except a few biscuits.
Friday, 14.The 106th arrived. Their horse-lines are with 18th---the men sleep here. B. turned up and we went out together. After a great struggle I managed to get three eggs. Could not buy bread, butter, beer. With great difficulty I got the eggs cooked and persuaded an old lady to let us have some coffee---a small cup of black coffee was all we could get. I begged some bread from the chateau, but had to spin a long yarn.
Saturday, 15.Full marching order parade ordered for Colonel's inspection---then cancelled. General Brigade Parade instead at 7.30 p.m. The Colonel spoke. Our fellows marched perfectly, and were the best groomed battery out. News of good work by British cavalry on the Somme.
Sunday, 16.Marching Order Parade afternoon---battery only. O.C. complimented us. C Sub. the best sub. Concert in evening. Good.
Monday, 17.Last night a big mail arrived. Come fellows received 10, 15, and one, 25 letters, besides hosts of papers. I received two---one from W. and the other from J.B. I was hoping for a big mail, too. B's inordinate military ambition curbed. He is content to remain corporal---at least he says so. Wrote up whole of sketches tonight, finished about 10.30 p.m. W's letter very beautiful. We are all counting on the war being over within three months from now.
Tuesday, 18.A little more mail today. Two letters from W. but nothing from home. Went to concert in 5th Brigade area---out of bounds to us. It was held in the village school-yard. There was a piano, violin, and an improvised kettle drum of dixie lids, wash basins etc. The music was decent.
