 Sept 16th  Left Durban 5 p.m. today bound for Melbourne. It is rather a nice place Durban &amp; one could easily spend a couple of weeks pleasantly there.  I went to the Empire Theatre, "Vaudeville" &amp; to the Royal "The Marriage Market" produced by a J.C. Williamson Company with W. Tallicur Andrews &amp; Margaret Kemp in the leading roles.  Enjoyed this latter very much.  Also had dinner at the Royal Hotel &amp; twice at the Edward Hotel which is a very fine place facing the beach &amp; where a lot of visitors from inland (Johannesburg etc) stay during their visits to Durban for the spring weather by the seaside in June &amp; July &amp; sometimes August.  They have a fine beach here too with good breakers coming in &amp; there's a lot of mixed bathing there in the summer.  The Ricksha boys with horns &amp; feathers etc as a headgear look comical.  They are mostly Zulu's &amp; Kaffirs.  There is an English population of about 40,000, Electric Tramway service, good clean streets &amp; mostly native &amp; half caste policemen, &amp; some very fine buildings.  Went &amp; saw a huge whale being sliced up to obtain the oil &amp; the numerous other products of it, at a big factory on the beach. One can hardly realise the size of them until you see them ashore.  We saw a lot in the Atlantic too, on the way here. 
 Sept 17th  Having very heavy weather at present, but not as bad as last night.  We shipped some big seas &amp; lot of fittings were stove in &amp; carried away
