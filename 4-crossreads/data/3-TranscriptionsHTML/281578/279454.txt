<p>course, over stones amp; holes  in the road, on &amp; on, till the chaps began to roar &amp; call the guide nasty names. I think he got lost, &amp; at last several dropped out &amp; lay down to sleep by the roadside. The pack was an awful load &amp; it wasn't till 5 am. that we hit a village called Coineux, all tired &amp; footsore. The 4th brigade was resting in this village,  &amp; we immediately joined our battalions. Wedn. 17 April We were given a drink of tea on arriving, &amp; I joined the 13th Battalion don't like it as Id rather be with the old 3rd, &amp; I suppose I'll have to take down the good old chocolate &amp; green colours now. The brigade is just out for a short spell from the line, so we are right in it now, &amp; shall soon be in the thick of it. The trenches are 4 or 5 miles from here, &amp; I saw one of our 'planes up &amp; shrapnel bursts around it. I went to the battalion post office &amp; found some letters waiting for me from Bon, Miss Tofft &amp; Elsie; there were shoals for Boo, including 2 from Will but strange to say none for either of us from home. Could hardly keep my eyes open today after our night march, &amp; had a snooze after dinner. I am attached to D Coy. 13th Bn. &amp; took off the chocolate &amp; green colors</p>
