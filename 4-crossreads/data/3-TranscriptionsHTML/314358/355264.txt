<p>3<br/>Place, that the last few days have been cheerless with grey and comfortless with main anchor myself with concerns of the vital present, while memory is restlessly burdened with those vivid scenes of intense movements and supreme occasions experienced as it were but yesterday.</p>
<p>I might put them aside for a time and perhaps forget them?</p>
<p>Forget them? Well perhaps?</p>
<p>It would indeed be a poor mind which could so soon erase those fire lined scenes and delete those scarlet written emotions. They are fixed and printed in the volume of memory as with the glowing of embers and the indelibility of night</p>
<p>Pictures of the minds camera; to be reviewed time after time; but only in secret darkness and in ruby blood like beams.</p>
<p>Pictures which, in their completeness, can never be revealed to other minds but must in part, and for ever in camera remain.</p>
