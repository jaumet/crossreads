if they really swallow the "imbecile innocence" gag, or whether it is that they cant see a way to get past it. Anyhow my military character remains spotless, so I still have a chance for the V.C. - don't think!
The photos are very good - I will send them to Mrs Horton to look after for me, with the rest of my things. Did I tell you before that I got two from the Pantons' - Annie & Joan. Also both write very frequent & amusing letters about Melbourne matters.
Our exam is in progress - stiff, but think it will be all OK as far as I am concerned - though the electric business is pretty complicated. Our work is mostly with the Devil-in-the-Box, and he is a particular friend of mine, practically speaking.
Please thank Bet. for letters. I will write to her soon as I get something to write about.
In the meantime don't worry about me - the climate (winter) didn't fix me and its worse than Hindenburg. So, as the job is a "cushy" one, you can just consider that my luck is still in. With love to all from Harry.
