I saw our old home quite plainly, the sight of that little old house where I was born woke a lot of memoires. We dropped the pilot onside the "Rip" just as the sun went down, rather a thrilling spectacle for there was rather a heavy swell on. 20/1/16 Mal-de-Mer has claimed many victims today.  There is a heavy sea running. I have had no indication of sickness as yet but I am thoroughly enjoying this trip.
