<p>Friday 23rd<br/>Now for last night it was simply beautiful up on deck gliding along in a smooth sea in the bright moonlight was charming, the boys were singing as usual- we Sisters gathered together &amp; sang "Australia we'll be there" to them &amp; Major Kent Hughes waved our flag.  Every one on the boat appeared happy &amp; why shouldn't we- on the way to work.  When 9.30 came we were settled to our quarters &amp; there was an unusually anxious air about, but being somewhat accustomed to fancy alarms we prepared for the reality <u>if it came</u> &amp; went trustingly to sleep.  At 12.30 Alas what had happened- The boat stopped, the bell rang &amp; the foghorn gave one tremendous blow.  I wonder if you can imagine the rest.  The experiences that were told this morning was very amusing- but at the time the majority thought their last hour had come.  I confess I did- so did Sister Daw.  We were up like lightening but she called out to the man on duty- what is it-&amp; he said "its all right Miss it's only the fog.  We went back to bed- but no one had any more sleep.  The fog horn blew incessently the rest of the night &amp; we were disappointed in the morning to find ourselves in Meditteranean Waters &amp; had passed through Gibralta without seeing it.  One of the Officers was telling us what an anxious night they had- the Captain just everted a catastrophe, as we were on the point of colliding with a sailing vessel<strike>l</strike> &amp; immediately after a large boat passed within 20 yards on the Port side so no wonder there was a stir.</p>
