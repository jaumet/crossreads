<p>the beach. This afternoon we had a detachment of men from the Am Column to instruct and the Sergt Major &amp; I took the instructing of them. It seems strange to be instructing gunners right on the firing line. A big bombardment took place this afternoon on to the Gaba Tepe look out. All day long there was a big bombardment over Achi bar near where the Imperial Division &amp; French were operating &amp; the guns beyond &amp; boomed all day. I hoped while in Alexandria no mention was made of our artillery in the operations at Gaba Tepe. The absence of reading matter is greatly felt by us now we have not so much to do while in the gun post. The object of our gun is now await special developments &amp; guard the infantry in case of a night attack.</p>
