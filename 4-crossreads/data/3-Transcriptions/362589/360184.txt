<p>winter but of course anything you send along will be duly appreciated. If I do not need it myself I can give it to someone who does. Sox of course are always welcome.<br/>A couple of days ago as one of the incidents of my new &amp; dignified rank I was detailed as President of a Court <u>of enquiry</u> re an accidental shooting. Soon after I opened the court the wounded man died and rather complicated things. However I carried on &amp; spent about 4 hours on the inquiry &amp; took a tremendous lot of evidence.<br/>Fortunately a court of enquiry is merely an instrument for collecting evidence and the "Court" does not make any finding or express any opinion. I say fortunately because none of the members of the court were any the wiser as to how the wounding took place at the end of the enquiry than at the beginning. On the evidence someone else has to give an opinion as to how it all happened. How would you like to be the someone else.<br/>We have Church parade every Sunday.
