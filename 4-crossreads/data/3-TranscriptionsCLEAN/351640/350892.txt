We have had a tragedy here in the form of a fire.   The Royal Pavilion had just been completed, furnished and was filling up, when the fire occurred on a Sunday night.  Everything terrible happens here on Sundays.
The nurses promptly dragged all the beds [with] patient (all intact) onto the beach.The bugle sounded and quite 12,000 soldiers came tearing down the Street and all roaring loudly as they came,
