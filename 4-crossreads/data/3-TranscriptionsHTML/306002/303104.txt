<p>9.4.15<br/>Fri. 9th.  Another parade amongst the cultivated fields, &amp; had a very enjoyable day, came back to Camp through Heliopolis.  McFarland's horse threw him &amp; put a couple of cut in his head.  Nelson got malaria yesterday &amp; is still "crook" on it.  To-day we got tied up in the irrigation canals, &amp; had a job to find a track out.  Edmonds horse fell with him jumping a drain.  The Abbassieh men from here returned last night;  played billiards &amp; finished off a letter to Jessie.</p>
