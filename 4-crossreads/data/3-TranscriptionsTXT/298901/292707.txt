Sundi Avril 29thAgain very quiet with wounded.  Apart from routine work I was engaged preparing indents for issue to Battalions, of Panniers, Haversacks, Watertester etc.  I am issuing our own where possible & will keep the new ones for ourselves as we look after them better than the Battalions.  It is very difficult to obtain them or any such equipment as so much was lost in the retreat that all supplies were exhausted & fresh, in sufficient quantity have to yet arrived from England.Rather bad news from up north Dranoutre, Kemmel mont & Locre being lost but Locre has since been recaptured.  French troops were mostly concerned.  Strange to read of heavy fighting in the Hospice at Locre where we spent a very enjoyable month about November last.
Mardi Avril 30thA busy day.  Started off by adding more instruments to the operating theatre.  Then prepared a requisition for equipment wanted by Battalions & went along with Q.M. to get it.
