 The Day By Henri Chappel ( The author of this magnific poem is Mr. Henri Chappel , a railway porter at Bath . Mr. Chappel is known to his comrad as the " Bath Railway Poet " . A poem such as this lift him to the rank of a nation poet . ) You boast the Day , and you toast the Day , And now the Day has come . Blasphem , braggart and coward all , Littl you reck of the numb ball , The blast shell , or the " white arm 's " fall , As they speed poor human home . You spi for the Day , you lie for the Day , And woke the Day 's red spleen . Monster , who ask God 's aid Divin , Then strew His sea with the ghast mine ; Not all the water of all the Rhine Can wash thi foul hand clean . You dream for the Day , you scheme for the Day ; Watch how the Day will go . Slayer of age and youth and prime ( Defenceless slain for never a crime ) Thou art steep in blood as a hog in slime , Fals friend and coward foe . You have sown for the Day , you have grown for the Day ; Your is the harvest red . Can you hear the groan and the aw cri ? Can you see the heap of slain that lie , And sightless turn to the flame-split sky The glassi eye of the dead ? You have wrong for the Day , you have long for the Day ; That lit the aw flame . ?Tis noth to you that hill and plain Yield sheav of dead men amid the grain ; That widow mourn for their love one slain , And mother curs thi name . But after the Day there 's a price to pay For the sleeper under the sod , And Him you have mock for mani a day ? Listen , and hear what He has to say : " Vengeanc is mine , I will repay , " What can you say to God ? Reprint from the London " Daili Express " ( Copyright ) . Open Letter to the World Reveill 1.10.39 Pleas be kind to England , She is n't veri strong , Her Navi 's ineffici , Her Armi 's all gone wrong ; Her A.R.P. is useless , Her Air Forc far too small , Her peopl so degener , She 's no moral at all . She doe n't want to fight you , She 's so convinc you ll win ; She ll let you take her Empire If it will save her skin . She 's old , decay and senil , And you have strength and youth . So pleas be kind to England , Do n't keep abus England , Be nice to poor old England ? Or you may learn the truth . T.W. , in the " Canadian Legionari . "
