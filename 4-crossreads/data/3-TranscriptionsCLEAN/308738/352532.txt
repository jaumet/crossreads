He generally rides about in a motor & right ahead are first to be seen native police on motor bikes clearing the way. All traffic has to pull aside & the people stand on the side walks with raised hats whilst the Sultan passes. Behind the motor are a number of police on bikes guarding the rear & the same in front. He is a very thin faced individual & stares straight ahead. The procession passes so rapidly that one can hardly get a chance of getting a look.
