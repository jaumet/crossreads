Arrived Alexandria. The sands of the desert once more.  How they call one!  Had a great dinner, plenty of champaigne etc. a most excellent evening.
Feb 16On baggage guard until we entrain at 7pm for Suez.
Feb 17Arrived Suez and strange to say embark on the old 'Nile".  Is this a good omen for she saved the good old 24th on the trip to Gallipoli when the "Southland" was hit.  Its good to see her, may she prove to be as lucky
