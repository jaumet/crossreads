are situated in the basement and cover several rooms. The ancient weapons are most dangerous looking, particularly the pikes and bills and glaves which are of every imaginable shape and size. The lances too are very awe inspiring in size. One was as thick round the butt as a telegraph pole and at least 20 feet long. Some of the weapons too are most artistically carved - particularly the battle-axes.The best play I saw during my stay was "Chu Chin Chow of China" Oscar Ashe and Lilly Brayton. There was a true Eastern atmosphere about the play. The market-place scenes in particular were very picturesque. The theme of the play is identical with "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves".  Chu Chin Chow who poses as a wealthy chinese merchant turns out to be none other than  Abu Hassan the chief of the Forty Thieves and thenceforward the plan is the same as the fairy tale.A close second was a very entertaining and amusing Revue entitled "Flying Colours". One scene is taken from Bainsfather's drawings of "Tommy in the Trenches" and is a splendid representation. I also saw "The Best of Luck" featuring Madge Litherage a hair-raising drama and "Theodore & Co" very mediocre musical play.
November 2. The A.D.M.S. Colonel White - who is medical head of the Division - sent down to-day for one of our Detail to attend lectures on Chiropody. To my surprise Captn. Rosenthal appointed me and I went to the first lecture this afternoon.
