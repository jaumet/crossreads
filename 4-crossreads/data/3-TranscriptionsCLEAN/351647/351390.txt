  
 The stunt was good but the weather was vile.  Things are very lively here & the noise at times  was  is fierce. 
 I had to go up the front two or three times quite my worst ordeal so far.  Very trying.  How I'd be if I had to live there I don't know.  Go stark staring mad if I were on the guns, I know.  The noise & racket drive me fair dilly & really I can't think. 
 The liveliness goes on all the time. 
 I have been too busy & the weather has been too rough to get about much.  I like to have a run away now & then although there's not much to see or do.  The town & villages within reach are simply packed with soldiers & I hate the sight of them. 
 This is the weirdest land especially a twilight, its like a toy box come to life, the trees & houses &c.  Haven't got to Paris yet but hope I will next month. 
 Have been keeping my eye open for the Cooklet but haven't struck him yet.  Struck his Co. but he was on leave. 
 I met Duncan Macfarlane & the Morrice lads
