 such thing as a man run to catch up , and as each accid like that occur , the littl column halt . Men left for a few second stand by themselv in this countri , have been known to break down , give up , and die if exposur . So we all wait for the " all correct " befor we move on . At last , just as day is break , at 7 am we arriv back at Fler . Contain are return to the cook , we move independ back to Head quarter . Here the sergeant issu a tot of rum , and we stumbl along the tunnel , amid the groan howl of the crowd lad site huddl in this letharg atmospher snatch a few wink of shutey , befor they themselv move of on a like errand . Thus , a trip of about 4 mile take us near 8 hour . Eight hour of the most strenuous and nerv rack duti a man can be call on to do . It call for determin which lead one near to despair . No one dare give up , dare for one second doubt his power to stay . Give it best for a moment , and your will power is broken , and despair will lead you to hysteria , and then , death from exposur . Mud from the top of our head to the bottom of our boot , drench to the veri skin , your thought must be alon for the men perish in the front line , and for the inevit fate that await you should you for one moment acknowledg defeat . I have written this at some length . Not that it can ever die from my memori , but I doubt if ani part of the winter campaign could call for more sheer dog plod than this work . No song are sung no poetri written about fatigu parti . Three time I was on this fatigu , and each occas will remain imprint in my memori for ever . On Christma Eve it becam D. Coy 's turn in the line . Just after dark we all file out , and , in singl file , set out for the line of outpost we had caus to know so well .
