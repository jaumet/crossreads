 on the matter. anyway it is a very big shell. 
   
 Mar 22  nd    The first drivers all went to Caestre where we took over Peerless lorries from 49  th   Tommy Division - we picked numbers out of a hat to see which lorry each man would have - I picked 8133 not a bad lorry but in bad condition & out of adjustment  We drove them back to our own Park & fixed up the lockers & beds etc like in the old lorries & made it comfortable. lovely day - The 3  rd   & 12  th   brigades also changed their lorries for Peerless at the same time. 
   
 Mar 23  rd    We did'nt go out to-day - we fixed up the lorry & made several adjustments to engine etc. Joe is not sleeping on the lorry now, it is a great relief - two men are plenty on a lorry. Some of the lorries were in Bailleul to-day  Fip - shifted the French post office & nearly all Civilians have left- Fritz has done a lot of damage this week with his big gun & to-day he got the clock tower of the Maire. The gun is supposed to be a 14.2 inch - We hear rumours that Fritz is making an advance on the Somme & wiping us up -
