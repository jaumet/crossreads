<p>Abide with Me.</p>
<p>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;<br/>The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide;<br/>When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,<br/>Help of the helpless, O abide with me.</p>
<p>Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;<br/>Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;<br/>Change and decay in all around I see:<br/>O Thou, Who changest not, abide with me.</p>
<p>I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;<br/>Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;<br/>Where is death's sting?  Where, Grave, thy victory?<br/>I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.</p>
<p>Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes;<br/>Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;<br/>Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;<br/>In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
