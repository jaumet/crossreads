<p>mist veil of a level floating cloud.</p>
<p>Our anti-air-craft guns hush themselves once more in watchful hiding, behind the hawthorn hedge down there in the gully where they stand like gigantic [indecipherable] in a bed of marigolds.</p>
<p>The snowflakes and sutty spots grow into fleeces, then spread into veils and whiffs; and finally vanish from the blue, passing as things of magic should.</p>
<p>We lower or eyes once more level to the labour and the duty of the hour for it is time to do our share and take what comes through the tradegy of another day.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x<br/>I have not written lately on account of my hand being rather bad with a slight wound refusing to heal quickly.</p>
<p>It is now quite healed and well and I am completely myself once more, out of the doctors hands and fit to be sent back to my company.</p>
<p>When this will happens I may be able to find some of your letters at our base.</p>
<p>How I will be delighted to get them</p>
<p>Those three dated last January, March and April are the last received.  I know you do write dear but it seems I am lost to the postal people.</p>
<p>It is with great hope that I look forward to the time when I will be back with you and the children again.  My dearest thoughts are with you all, and those many things which I don't put in words are expressed and sent to you all and to dear Mother as we each understand them.  I am longing to see the children.</p>
<p>I have come across none like them. Tell them I am saving up stories first for them only. Tell Mother all will continue to be well with me for I never forget her. Mother knows me</p>
