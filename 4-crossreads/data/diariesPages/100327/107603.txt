In my little home in a Trench
(Tune Little grey home in the West)
I
I've a little wet home in a trench
Which the rainstorms continually drench
There are dead Turks all round
All polluting the ground
Oh they give us a beautiful stench
Underneath in the place of a floor
There's a mass of wet mud some gore
And the "Jess Willards" bear
Through the rain sodden air
O?er my little wet home in the trench
II
There are snipers who keep on the go
So you must keep your old napper down low
And their star shells at night
Make a deuce of a light
Which causes the language to flow
Then biscuits bully we chew
For its weeks since we tasted a stew
But with shells bursting there
There's no place can compare
With my little wet home in the trench
