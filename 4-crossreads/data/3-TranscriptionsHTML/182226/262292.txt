<p>Monday 27 September, 1915</p>
<p>On guard for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Very good war news is coming through from the European theatre, also things are pointing to a big move here shortly which will be eagerly welcomed even if it does mean some hard fighting as we are all fed up with doing nothing.</p>
<p>The weather continues warm much to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>A very ingeneous musical instrument has been constructed by one of the stretcher bearers. It consists of about a dozen empty condensed milk tins which he has tuned up. He uses a couple of little sticks to play them with. So far I have heard him play Home Sweet Home, The Swanee River, On the Mississippi &amp; God Save The King so they are not too bad.</p>
<p>I was given a few lollies &amp; a couple of books today. Freely a glorious haul.</p>
