November 1918

November the 1st
The events of the last two or three days are very satisfactory.

It is reported that Turkey has been granted an armistice.

The terms provide for the Allies to occupy her territory and her Army has to be demobilised immediately. It is further reported that Austria-Hungary is in a state of revolution and that her troops are not fighting. It is believed here that within the next week Austria-Hungary will be forced to surrender to the allies.

Here in Germany there is a lot of unrest, The people are beginning to see that they have been mislead and deceived by their Military rulers.

It is my belief that Kaiser Wilhelm will make himself scarce very soon, and by doing so give the signal for general upheaval and revolution.
