 But the best fun of all was the footbal match between the platoon I had a game the first time sinc leav Tasmania for you know they play all Rugbi in N.S.W I know noth about it , but I thought I would have a shot this morn , I was offsid near the whole time otherwis I held my own with them , she was a rough go , offic all take part in it , when she was in full swing the Major came along when he left the Capt stop the game , we all wonder whi , but it appear that Capt Edgeley complain to the Major that C Coy who were play footbal in the drill hour
