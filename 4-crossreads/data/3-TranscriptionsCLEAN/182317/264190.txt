I wish you were with us and there would be one more congenial spirit. Arthur Evans and I knock around together a good deal. We are all in good knick and have not felt the heat so much as the other people who have taken no exercise. It has become very hot in the last few days, and our parades have been cut short in consequence. Ice cream is now served to us about 11.30 it goes well on a hot morning. We had a great misfortune a few days ago; our regimental pet the wallaby whilst taking his constitutional walk around the deck evaded his keepers and leapt overboard. They tried in vain. The incident cast a gloom over the whole battalion.
