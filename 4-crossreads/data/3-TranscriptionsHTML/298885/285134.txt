<p>Apr 12th &ndash; 17<br/>As Spring is fast advancing today is perfect and a few of us taking advantage decided to have a look at what was once Bapaume</p>
<p>Well to put in a few words of description of the shattered town, is, it is one huge heap of debris with just the faintest trace to show what a grand and pretty place had been brought to ruin. It is almost heart-breaking to see some of the places. It is just a case of pulling down what remains standing and building up a new town</p>
