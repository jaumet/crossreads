<p>H.G.<br/>3rd Australian Division<br/>13.X1.16<br/>Dear Judge,</p>
<p>[note in margin]<br/>You are not very complimentary when you say that you hoped that I wd be taken away from the job of handling men &amp; put to something else.  And I thought that I was not doing too badly!  Luckily I had'nt enough time to damage the efficiency of the cyclists.</p>
<p>Dear Judge,</p>
<p>Your welcome letter arrived this morning, and by a coincidence J.P. Sheridan was kind enough to come all the way from London to spend three hours with me, so the atmosphere was quite homelike.</p>
<p>I quite understand your feelings about the military decorations which Captain Ferguson would have received if he had lived.  The rule with regard to these is altered</p>
