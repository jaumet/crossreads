<p>At 5.15 a.m. Daylight we set course again for the mine field off Alexandria &amp; put up our speed to 15 knots zig zagging all the way.  We were then about 100 miles off Alexandria as submarines had been reported off the mine entrance.  At 10 a.m. we passed a large wooden mast just missed hitting same &amp; (During the night at 11 p.m. we just missed running down a Schooner he like ourselves having no lights exhibited) at 11 a.m. some where off the mine entrance &amp; tried to pick up the farway bouy this bouy being small.  It was hard to pick up.  So steamed around for an hour.  The 3 destroyers doing the same.  A Hydroplane on Monotor should have been sent out to meet us.  But so far none in sight.  So now steaming around awaiting a Guide ship to come out noon 9.11.18.  The land &amp; objects at Alexandria being so low is hardly visible 13 miles off where the farway bouy is situated also.  It being thick &amp; heavy rain &amp; cloudy no observation can be had.  No guide ship seen so we shaped a course for the bouy.  The Jap Guide escort hoisted signal follow me so we made for the harbor took a pilot aboard inside the nets &amp; mine field &amp; anchored inside the harbor.  We heard on arrival of one of the Transports Blue funnel Holt's line that arrived yesterday 12 miles off a Enemy submarine fired a torpedoe at her, it missed by 13 feet so she got in Safely.  We heard of the sinking on one cargo steamer off Port Said &amp; 2 others torpedoed together but as luck</p>
