  
 On Mch 1st the Mercantile S.S. Co's "Jumna" was captured.  She did not stop at the raider's first two shots - the third, which was intended for her engine-room, exploded on the after-deck of the "Wolf" before the gun could be swung out.  5 Germans were killed & over 20 injured.  The "Jumna" was stripped of her coal & sunk next day, her complement of 30 coming on board the "Wolf". 
 On the 11th Mch Glover Bros "Wordsworth" was captured en route from Colombo to Delagoa Bay. - cargo 5000 tons rice.  She was sunk 7 days later. 
 Complement 31 men. 
 The "Wolf"  was  then continued her way to the south (sinking en route the barque "Dee" bound from Mauritius to Bunbury in ballast. 
 An amusing incident here was that the "Dee" on sighting the "Wolf" hoisted a signal "Report me all well".  She was bombed and went down with that signal flying.)
