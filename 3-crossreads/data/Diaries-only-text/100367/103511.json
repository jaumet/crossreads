"En Route" ? Abroad
H.M.A.T. "Boonah" A. 36
(1) We left old "Broady" one bright morn, - Broady ? Broadmeadows, Vic.
"En route" for scenes abroad;
Where Kaiser Bill and Hindenberg,
And other Boches horde.
(2) Our dear ones on the Station stood,
And waved us fond "goodbyes";
We feel felt the parting, but withheld,
The tears that flood our eyes.
(3) The "Farewells" o?er, we rush along,
We're bound for Adelaide;
To board our ship, and there join up,
With the "S" U.K. Brigade. "S" U.K. means South Australia ? United Kingdom
(4) Then on that bright but dusty morn,
We marched aboard the "Boonah"
Some looked askance at her, and said
They?d sooner board a schooner.
(5) The wharf is crowded, dear ones stand,
Our last "goodbyes" are spoken;
The steamer moves, "we're off" they say,
And "farewell" ribbons broken. Ribbons or "streamers" of which there were many.
(6) The night was bright and starry,
As the "Boonah" plowed the deep;
The boys aboard were feeling crook,
The Guard had gone to sleep.
(7) The "Bight" was gently moving,
In its gentle dreamy way;
It touched the reinforcements up,
As on the deck they lay.
(8) The bouncing, bounder, "Boonah" rolls,
On every billowy swell;
And makes us sick and saddened souls,
Wish the Kaiser were in hell.
(9) At length we reach a western port - Fremantle
And forward look for leave, Sir:
But we are stiff, as stiff can be,
For all have come a "buster". * - (No leave)
(10) But we will not downhearted be,
Because we're kept aboard, Sir,
We're out to finish up the Hun,
So send the ship along, Sir.
(11) We're doing now some thirteen knots,
Across the Indian Ocean;
And soon we'll touch old Afric's shores,
And then, we have a notion ---
(12) We'll surely have a better time,
When Durban heaves in sight, Sir;
For don't you see we've left behind,
The Great Australian Bight, Sir.
"Bill" Bailey.

* "Gutzer" is the original digger word ? meaning the abdominal crash and much used on board.
