<p>itself a picture. This morning I examined several very interesting spots including an old water mill, one of those rustic mills you see so many pictures of. There are not so many shops, there is a large cooperative store. This afternoon we had some practice at signalling, for this we went outside the town, my party went on to a hill, which gave us a fine view of beautiful country. From the hill it reminds me of the Blue Mountains NSW, but here we have in the distance cultivated fields, with hay stacks &amp; the town in the distance. Our billet this time is not in a loft, on the ground floor it would be very nice if not so cramped. there is plenty of good straw on the floor.<br/>The people are different to those of Flanders, in fact it is a different country all together. The well water is good. It has been a very interesting &amp; enjoyable day. We must be some distance from the fighting, for we cannot see or hear anything of it, which is in is self a treat, for now there is exceptionally heavy fighting going on "on the Somme"<br/>Oct 19th Pont Remy<br/>Ballot was taken this morning for conscription.<br/>Took a walk after</p>
