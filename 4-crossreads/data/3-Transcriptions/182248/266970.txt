<p>only an occasional shot rings out. But the big guns and howitzers are booming out. The shots are all flying over our heads. Early in the day however we had it very hot in our little corner, several shells bursting over us and around about us.</p>
<p>The guns are still blazing away, each anxious to have the last word; generally our gunners win. From present indications the Turks can&#39;t stand much more and I expect they will soon be retreating pell-mell to Constantinople. It&#39;ll be just lovely to have a hot bath again and a shave and a shampoo and some fruit and other little luxuries. I had 2 tins of fruit a week ago off one of the boats. Cost 4/- and lasted 3 meals for 6 hungry officers. Finish. And just imagine the joy of lying in a <u>bed</u> again. If this lasts I&#39;ll have some corns on my shoulder<s>s</s> blades and my hips ...</p>
<p>You will know by now that war is not a nice thing. In a fight the only thing we think of is to kill as many of the enemy as possible. One wants to cheer when our shrapnel bursts all over crowds of Turks, But when its all over and the dead and wounded come in its quite another story. Its hard luck seeing men that you&#39;ve known intimately for months and months all smashed about or lying dead waiting to be buried...</p>
<p>I used to rather think that the stretcher bearers had an easy time. But now I take off my hat to them. They have done wonderful work here. And a great number of them have been killed and wounded. Did I tell you Ian Hamilton visited our trenches recently.</p>
<p>Lots of love to all at home and all friends.</p>
