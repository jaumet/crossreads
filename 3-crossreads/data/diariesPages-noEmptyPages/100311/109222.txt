11/10/17 Broodseinde Canal Ypres
Cleaning up. All bivouacked in little shelters dug into the canal bank. About noon rode down to the Transport lines and there saw Miles and others. Then rode down to Reninghelst for a bath. Near some camps I saw General Birdwoods car and later himself and General Brand. He called me over and we chatted for a while about recent operations. He was taking a march past from the 4th. Brigade which was again coming up to the line. The men were looking very fit and fresh. In Reninghelst had a most luxurious hot bath and a clean change of clothing and returned to camp about 4. Dealt with some routine stuff read papers etc.and rested all the evening. Tried a new batman named Mouldy ? I hope he is different to his name. A fine clear evening many observation balloons up. The mud is drying up and tomorrow morning the 4th. 5th Divisions will hop over the top.
