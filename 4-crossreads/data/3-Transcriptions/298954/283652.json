<p>1918<br/>Thu. 23 May<br/>Spent the night hunting fleas, scratching, accustoming myself to Attar of Russki and listening to tales of horror from the returning workers.</p>
<p>(Poor devils! they slave in mines, farms, everywhere, for 30 phennigs (3d) a day till they can work no more and then return to this choice convalescent home to recuperate!)    Mosquitoes lent a pleasing variety to the night's programme.</p>
<p>And the stinks!</p>
<p>The lager consists of two portions;  the old brickworks themselves, now used as the offices and dwelling of the lager staff, &amp; the prisoners quarters, long barracks surrounding the slime covered clay pit.</p>
<p>Wire everywhere enables each barrack to be divided off into a compound.   This morning was questioned at the Bureau, inspected for lice, bathed a la sleep-dip in the company of my Russian friends of last night, &amp; was then free to go to Barrack 10.</p>
