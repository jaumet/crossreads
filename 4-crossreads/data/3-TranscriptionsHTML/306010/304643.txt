<p>The same afternoon I had quite an interesting yarn with one of our chaps, who was in several towns in Belgium, including Antwerp &amp; Ostend, when bombarded by the Germans two years ago; he was then in the Belgian Army Med. Corps and was sent out to Australia for a sea voyage &amp; rest cure. He however, enlisted in the A.I.F. and was sent to us with reinforcements. He has several brothers in the Belgian Army. Told me quite a lot about  Belgium &amp; the north of France.<br/>The French authorities are releasing a large number of their Troops for the harvesting season until the end of August to get in the crops. France is essentially  an agricultural country &amp; it is vitally important that the food supply for the next twelve months be assured &ndash; armies can't fight on empty stomachs. It is quite a usual thing to see labourers working in the fields</p>
