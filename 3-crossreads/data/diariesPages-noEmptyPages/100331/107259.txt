with the noise of the Big Guns all over the place. All the Balloons which were around our Depot in a circumference of a mile prior to the first push of July 31st last are all now around St Jean Station, the distance I think is about 8 miles from here as Fritz is about 2000 yds further on, so we have made good progress up to date. The Leading Eng of my Train had to shunt Cracker Doom a big 12 inch howitzer out go about 150 yds up further put the Gun into H2 Gun Spur, I had to come back into Zouave Siding about 100 yds back to pick up a load of Empties, as soon as this was done I came back after a few delays reach our Depot at 9 Pm did no more work signing off at 11 Pm.
