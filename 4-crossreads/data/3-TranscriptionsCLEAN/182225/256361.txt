 AUGUST   WEDNESDAY 30   1916 
 It was a bit better day than yesterday, but it was a cold miserable day all the same. We were out signalling all day again. I got promoted from the 3 rd  class to the 2 nd  class of signallers. Warren & the rest of the N.C.Os came back from the Larkhill school. Bill Nesbitt & self went up to Lark Hill picture show at night. It is a better class than the other two but not up to much. I got a "Mail" from Linda.
