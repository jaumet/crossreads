<p>Tuesday 11 September 1917</p>
<p>Alexandria<br/>Arrived 7.30 p.m. Spent the morning with Nowell at the ZOO <strike>and posted you my notes and some snap-shots.</strike> I hear the Mediteranean is alive with PORPOISES of the TIN FISH variety but am sure my luck will take me over alright.</p>
<p>[The remainder of the page crossed through.]<br/>I'm a bit scared at the idea of Dolly travelling &amp; would take a job at home if I got the offer.</p>
<p>Anyway I'm having a good holiday now &amp; my only worry is the waste of good L.S.D. Regina Hotel is my new place of abode. It is quite cool here.</p>
