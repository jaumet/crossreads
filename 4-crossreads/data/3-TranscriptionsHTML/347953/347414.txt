<p>Our Land Batteries</p>
<p>Many guns and howitzers were of a fine quality and were manned by men worthy of the highest praise.  But the shortage of shells was horribly deplorable and so we did not get the full benefit of their capabilities as they were only allowed to fire four rounds per day.</p>
<p>The artillerymen naturally had the best of quarters &amp; food available under such trying conditions as they are a smaller body of men than the infantry.  But they had trying times,&amp; suffered rather heavy casualties.  Their guns were skilfully located</p>
