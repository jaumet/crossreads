<p>horses tethered to the poplar trees on the outskirts &amp; 2 miles South a long valley branches off to the right &amp; apparantly joined the main one North of this village.</p>
<p>So I sent Nicol with Place &amp; Nimmo with 12 Christians &amp; a Lewis Gun to hold this valley in case the enemy were there or if we drove those out of the village to prevent them from doubling round on our rear.  I then took Scott Olsen the other 4 Sgts 12 Christian &amp; two guns forward to the Scrap.  Sgt Murphy &amp; a Russian officer with this party rode on as a sort of advance guard &amp; when within 600 yds of the village were fired on.  We moved up under cover of the dead ground &amp; got our Lewis Guns into action, which had the effect of clearing the enemy from the village about 20 of them galloped</p>
