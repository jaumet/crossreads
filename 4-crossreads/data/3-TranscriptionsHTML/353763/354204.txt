<p>All here has been done in the thorough manner characteristic of German science  -  The name plates are porcelain &amp; burnt in &amp; polished <strike>are the names</strike>   -  black letters on a white ground  -  very effective  -  I brought one off to show my friend Jack Bailey &amp; get him to adopt it in the Brisbane gardens  -  Pots are not used but bamboo cylinders &ndash; full of earth &amp; young plants in them  -  We wandered on up a gorge like the Launceston gorge but minus the S.Esk river &amp; Haggard trusted no nigger would pot us  -  This I scoffed at considerably so on we went up a nice track &amp; over little bridges with trees &amp; lianes &amp; creepers on both sides of us &ndash; ferns too &ndash; Bird nest &ndash; Asplenium &amp; Aspidium &amp; Polypodies  -  no orchids nor Maiden hair were in view  -  At the far end we came up against the volcanic cliffs which dripped water into a small rivulet  at the <strike>top</strike>bottom.  We saw a gorgeous crimson &amp; black bird &ndash; a vision only &ndash; listened to the burble of a pigeon &ndash; startled a lizard<br/>&amp;</p>
