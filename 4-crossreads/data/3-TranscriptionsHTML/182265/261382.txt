<p>took us to <s>Reninghelst</s>&nbsp;La Clytte, another walk &amp; another lorry to <s>Roningheft</s> near Dickiebush, still another walk &amp; a ride in a staff car to Cap Belge &amp; finally most muddy walk brought us to the Camp near Belgian Ch&acirc;teau and also disappointment for the mail. Administrative Bn. Hqrs were at Ypres, about 2 miles farther on &amp; which it was already too late to visit. So we had tea with Padre Rettie &amp; returned. Catching a lorry at Vlamertinghe we journeyed to Canada Corner on the Border where we caught another lorry to Ballieul. Some exciting runs helped us to catch two other lorries along the Ballieul - Fl&ecirc;tre road. The second of these was loaded with Australians singing as if their life depended on it. We all sang all the old songs we could remember until we debussed at Fl&ecirc;tre, giving a tip to the Tommy Motor driver. Our Australian transport drivers won&#39;t take tips from us, but the Tommy driver always - as far as my experience goes - welcomes them.</p>
<p>We arrived back at Camp late and enjoyed another good dinner. Our Bn. had&nbsp;several Gas Casualties.</p>
