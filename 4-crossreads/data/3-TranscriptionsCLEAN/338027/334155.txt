  
 Saturday, 27 March, 1915 Morning spent in practising improvised stretchers by the aid of our saddle blankets and the stirrup irons in each corner.  It is a splendid idea and a man can be carried a long way in one. 
 Went to Cairo in the p.m with the intention of going to O.Rs but met some old friends who I have not seen since I left Aust, and as we were all hungry we decided to try a first class meal, we did so it costing us each 70 piastres. 
 Five hundred maories [Maoris] are here now and are magnificently built men, when the Germans see them they will wonder what they have struck.  In orders it was read the report on sir H. McMahon's inspection they are very satisfactory. 
 Sunday, 28 March, 1915 Beast of a day awful dust storm & millions & millions of locusts.  C. P. under trying difficulties it was held in the cinema and during the sermon the roof was blown off so we had to return to our tents.  I wrote home in the p.m. & went to O.'Rs at night. 
 News from the front lately is very scanty but satisfactory.  [indecipherable] has fallen  & operations are still being carried out in the Dardanelles.  Turkey I think is trying to sue for peace & Italy is just about to intervene.  The 3rd Bde that left here arrived to our astonishment in England, it is to be hoped we go there too.
