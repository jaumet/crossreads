10.7.15Sat. 10th.  Indian meal for breakfast again this morning & it is very good, had rice for dinner (quite a luxury).  Les came down shortly after dinner & has to go on again at 9 oclock tonight, put the afternoon in practising signalling & about 3 oclock the Lord Nelson & Warspite came on the scene opposite us & opened fire with heavy guns & appeared to be dropping them on a hill this side of Achi Baba.  Had a good feed of rice for tea & then went to the beach for a swim the water was rather chilly tonight also last night, but well worth the trip.  The days are getting hotter here & it is no trouble to work up a good perspiration.
