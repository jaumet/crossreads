 2 through the thick coating of ice for water, you would think we were in the polar regions. We have learnt of two new foes over here, and they are as bad or worse than the hun, - cold and mud. I'm sorry that owing to the censorship I'm unable to give you any details which may be of interest. I'll have to keep all this till I return. But I'm always turning my thoughts back to happy times, and always wondering whether someone has "knocked out" Austrochapernina, and how my Aphantophryne paper is getting on in the Linnean's hands. I'm coming right back to this work, never fear; absence makes the heart grow fonder. I do hope you are all well. Tell Briggs to write &amp; tell me of the Q'land trip. Now, keep him up to that. Give my very best regards to good of Mr. Mac &amp; the Doctor, &amp; with best wishes to self &amp; Mrs Hedley. 
 Yours very sincerely Dene B, Fry
