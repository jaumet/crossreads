I enjoyed it quite as much as possible under the circumstances; it seems as if everything, every enjoyment I mean, must be qualified till we are all together again.I am only wanted three afternoons a week to help in the cafe work at the Esbekiah Gardens among the soldiers, but the times I am there are quite strenuous busy hours.  Thursdays Saturdays & Sundays are my days from 3 o'clock till 7.30, or 8 sometimes.  It is a big open air cafe run by the Y.M.C.A & ladies of leisure give their time to it: for sale there is are tea, coffee, cocoa, cakes, sandwiches & buns of all descriptions, & at a separate stall cold drinks.  Everything is a half piaster each (about 1 1/4 d.) and it is so arranged just to pay for itself and make nothing and is merely for the convenience of the soldiers.  They do appreciate it too and flock there by the hundreds.  It is one mad rush the whole time and I can only compare it to one of Sargent's restaurants in the lunch hour, for its "busy ness."  One has not time to look properly at the men to see whom one is serving and there is not a pause the whole time.  They could hardly have more workers, or not many more, for if they did they would be getting in each other's way.

She is quite nice as far as I can see, but most of the other ladies
