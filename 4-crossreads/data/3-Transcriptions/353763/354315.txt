<p>yellow dab was a small crab &ndash; Body about &frac34; of an inch &amp; speckled black &amp; white  -  The yellow was due to a large 1 inch single claw  -  They scuttled into holes as soon as you approached &ndash; the claw acting as a lid (like the cat's eye)  -  If you stopped one by catching hold of his claw he instantly shed it &amp; off he went as lively as ever  -  He'd only one claw &amp; that on the Right side  -  He had 2 stalked eyes  -  I collected a handful of hermit crabs for Rawdon  -  There are millions of them  -</p>
<p>I noticed also how the mangrove shrubs send down roots from the trunk &amp; branches to grow into the mud  -  They are long brown supple sticks with a small black cap on the end of each &amp; they seek the ground, just like the screw pines do with their roots  -  Once in the ground they throw out roots &amp; eventually the shrub looks as if it grew out of the top of a big crab or lobster pot  -  There shrubs with their roots &amp; their fruit &ndash; torpedo shaped &amp; ready formed to stick into the mud &amp; start growing  -  Lines much of the shore  -</p>
