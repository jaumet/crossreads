  
 Theatre Royal. I had tea in a restaurant close by and left at 4. o'clock. It was after 5 when I got back & I came all the way in the train changing at Maurice Square for Camel's Head hospital. There was a concert here last night and again tonight. I attended tonight. There were some very good conjuring tricks done by a man from one of the warships. The Germans are making pathetic appeals for an alteration of the Armistice terms on economic grounds. President Wilson has referred them to the Allies as the proper channel through which to make the  appeals. There is great distrust of 
 the Germans everywhere & I don't think there will be any alterations in the terms. The German Admiral met Admiral Beaty and discussed the manner of handing over the fleet. 
 Wednesday Nov 20 1918. 10 Day of peace. Dull & cloudy. Today I finished reading a history of General Booth by George S. Railton - his first Commissioner. This afternoon a large number of us were invited to the Criterion restaurant by Navial officers & friends. We left here by tram and arrived at the Criterion in Keyham about 2.15. where we found that there were there a large number of soldiers & sailors from other hospitals
