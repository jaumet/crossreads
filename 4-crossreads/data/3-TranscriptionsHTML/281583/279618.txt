<p>being very heavily shelled by the Germans, the place La Boiselle is wiped off the face of the country. The British mined this and when I tell that 1000 tons of explosives were used in the one charge it will give you an idea of the magnitude of same. It was a particularly heavy defended position on account of the position of the land and warranted the cost. To look at the place now it has the appearance of a huge Brickfield Pit, The dimensions of the crater are  Breadth &frac12; mile length &frac34; mile, depth 1 to 30 ft deep. The Germans had frightful losses here on this occasion and assert that they have never experienced the like of it in their life, neither have I .<br/>The stench of decomposed bodies is very distressing hereabouts and it is nothing to see human remains blown about by exploding shells. Our artillery when digging gunpits, often come across pits of men and have to fill it in and dig elsewhere.</p>
<p>I arrived back safely, however, I cannot honestly say that I want to go out again, but if I have to go well never mind.</p>
<p>28.8.16 Monday</p>
<p>Our HeadQuarters have again moved up to the front and I believe it is to be our final  splash here for a while. The Germans</p>
