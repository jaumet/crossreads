Dear Father,
I have just received a nice big long letter from you amongst a batch of 5, two of which were from Mother.  I am still with the Batt. & keeping well & fit.  I have just had a spell of 11 days at a Casualty Clearing Station with sore eyes caused I think through dust & sweat, they started with a touch of gas at the C.C.S.  I had nothing to do all day so that I very pleasantly filled in my time writing or reading.  Every evening I used to go down the village near by & have a feed of eggs or chips
