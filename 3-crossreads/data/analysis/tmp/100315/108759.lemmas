 6/4/18 ? Front Line ? Albert Dernacourt It was a wretch and tri night for the men but they stuck it in fine spirit and cheer . Owing to the pitch dark nobodi knew the way round and they had to stand out in heavi rain up to the knee in mud and slush . Then " A" Coy ( alreadi veri tire and worn ) had to furnish a platoon to carri up the ration to the front line . It was pour all the time . Fortun I found a petrol tin of rum in the dugout and was abl to give a tot to all the men who were work . It put them in good heart as they wait for dawn . Out in front they settl down quiet . We had one flare in the air found the line well back .
