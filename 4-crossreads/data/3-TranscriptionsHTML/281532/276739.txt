<p>14/10/18 St Vast [Vaast] &ndash; Amiens</p>
<p>the glass has been removed. The front is quite intact although a few chips are off the stonework here and there. Entering there are many alterations much more sandbagging. The old bronze recumbent statues, the pictures many of the windows have been removed. L'Ange pleurant was left and looked cold &amp; lonely. Around the town many French people returned but still the damage and desolation (after the Amiens of old days) are terrible. Rode home in time for mess. Pleasant riding through sweetsmelling country</p>
