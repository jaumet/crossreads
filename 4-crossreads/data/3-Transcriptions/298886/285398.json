<p>Sent out long distance Signal stations this morning on a large triangle about 20 miles around and later I personally inspected them. A good deal of practical work is still necessary yet before they can be considered fit. They must have some more short distance work yet. The weather this evening is cold with a very cold wind and one must wrap up.</p>
