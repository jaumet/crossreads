<p>Saturday 9 March<br/>Beautiful day.  Spring is here &amp; to-night Summer time comes into operation, the clock put forward one hour. We go up to the line to-morrow in front of famous Hill 60.</p>
<p>Sunday 10 March<br/>At Mount Sorrel relay post nearby Hill 60 &amp; just to the right of Zillebeke Lake which can be seen from here.  The morning was very quiet indeed but this afternoon some 5.9's fell close about doing little other harm than covering my tunic &amp; some blankets with mud. Coming up we crossed the Ypres-Commines Canal &amp; in fact Ypres is not very far on our left. The line is a series of outposts, some good &amp; others not too bright.<br/>Our dugout was over a "pill box", but has been blown in &amp; decently repaired.<br/>Weather beautiful.</p>
