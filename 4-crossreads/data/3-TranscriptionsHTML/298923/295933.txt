<p>24 September 1918 Tuesday<br/>Es Salt<br/>Jacko's coming in.  They had made great defences here-   Our casualties very light, only pack transport single file-   Our wireless gear fell down a cliff &amp; killed the horse &amp; finished apparatus-  Struck aTurks metalled road at Es Salt littered with dead &amp; dying animals &amp; men-  Our planes had bombed them  Burnt Motor Cars, capsized guns including our friend Jericho Jane &amp; all ammunition abandoned-  A routed Army is a cruel sight.  Camped at AIN HERAN collecting straggling Turks en route- tally now 35 000 &amp; 250 guns.</p>
