  
 5.  of the Wind & drifted back again.  I returned Home via Southampton, Eastleigh & Salisbury. On Friday I had to go to Perham Downs on a D.C.M.  I was waiting about one of the Huts & thought I recognised a chap.  It was Stewart Rowe.  He is Depot Orderly Corporal.  He is deaf in the right ear.  He will not go back to France now as He is classed C1.  Mr Rowe is back at Lismore in His old job.  Gordon has lost His eldest child with Diptheria.  Stan is married.  I passed Tidworth Station on my way.  I was at Tidworth at the same Hour just exactly 12 months before, strange, that.  I went to Salisbury from there to my Home again.  We have had one wet afternoon this week, but otherwise the weather has been glorious.  Lovely clear moonlight nights too.  It was just lovely cycling too.  The air has a nip in it again.  We had frost this morning & there has been a fog every morning & evening in the low lying flats.  Well, Mum I've had a lovely week, but strenuous & the 20 mile ride to-night has made me feel just O.K for bed.  I rode Home the 9 1/2 miles odd in about 25 minutes.  Best of Love to All the Neighbours & to all those visitors of Yours whose names I think of every Time but do not put to paper. Lots of Love & Kisses From Harry
