They fired on our Ambulances capsizing 2. <strike>Our objective was a form and RECONNAISSANCE in strength to cover a Topographical survey party for MAP &amp; Royal Engineer work.</strike>  We are in virgin country &amp; in addition to finding WATER &amp; building railway we have to survey this within 2&frac12; miles of Beersheba-Gaza railway &amp; could see the Turkstrain.</p>
