  
 retired.  We bot back minus once officer killed, 3 horses killed (another hit during the fight) (but fortunately we collected a few stray mounts) & almost every round of ammunition used.  Nothing to eat 36 hours & nothing to drink since daylight.  The cavalry we met 700 yds from camp when I sent out to finish the chase. 
 On falling back into camp I discovered Moore packing up to clear but prevented this after telling him off as I considered it pure desertion of the people.  At night we pulled back a mile to a ridge for better defence & all that day Shed & Petros assisted by Kay got the people on the move towards Bijah.  We got into our new position shortly after dark.  Dr. Shed who complained of feeling ill went ahead but unfortunately lost his way. We sent two Sgts out to find him & his wife. They returned about midnight stating the Dr. was 6 miles further on & very ill.
