last night as I have done for a long long time, the way these Tommies go about things is a screaming farce after the way we carry out our "reliefs". First of all they were late in making their appearance, they kept on turning up in little mobs all hopelessly lost out of touch with everyone, why not even their N.C.Os nor officers knew for a start where they were going or who they were going to relieve, if you asked them anything all they could say we are 2nd/7 (second sevenths) they were going to relieve the Australians what Battn they had no idea, Capt Whitby I questioned them from what they told us I think we were able to put them on the right track, but to make things worse it had been raining heavily all day the ground was in an awful state they came the worst possible way the poor little Tommies were wet to the skin covered with mud tired out, they had given up all hope of ever getting to their positions were content to wander aimlessly round through
