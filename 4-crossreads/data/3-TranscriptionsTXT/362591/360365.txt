 My dear Father, 
 A letter just received from you reminded me that I hadn't written this week.  The only change that has taken place, is the move which we were preparing for when I last wrote.  It is distinctly a  nerve  change for the better.  Last night our Colonel took General Holmes &amp; the Company Commanders to dinner at a Club in Ismailia where we had a very enjoyable time.  Talking about O.Cs reminds me that you asked who had the Companies now.  Here they are:- 
 A Coy Capt. Ross B Coy Capt. Ferguson C Coy Major Paul D Coy Capt. Roper 
 Major Fitzgerald is second in command of the Battalion.  There is no doubt that he is the man who made B Coy the best company in the Bn., &amp; I think that it still holds its reputation, I hope on account of good management as well as good fortune.  Walter is well &amp; expects to come back to us any day.  I'm sorry that this has to be such a short note, but I know you would rather hear just a word or two from me, than nothing at all. 
 Give my love to Mother &amp; Dorothy.  I'm afraid I won't have time to write.  We are waiting for orders to move any minute. 
 Your affectionate son Arthur.
