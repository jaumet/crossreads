<p>We are getting a lot of fellows now direct from peninsular &ndash; it just breaks me up to see them &ndash; worn out, thin, nervy &amp; with typhoid.  They do wonderfully well poor old chaps but one can't get a smile out of them to begin with.  We have not yet garden for our Convalescent typhoids here &amp; I must say the latter type seem to regain all their spirits &amp; are the limit as regards pranks &amp; mischief.<br/>Do you remember that tableful at G.M.H. &ndash; General Kenna, Lord Hartington &amp; Co. &ndash; I believe they are all killed <strike>expec</strike> except one.<br/>The Nile is up &ndash; you never saw such a dirty muddy old fellow as he is now &amp; <u>very</u> smelly!  The fields in front of us here are lovely, all different varieties of green.  I do wish you had been to this place.  Try &amp; take a run down to Neutral Bay &amp; see my folk, one brother, stepsister &amp; Mrs. B., they would so love it.  Get to Neutral Bay P.O. (Ben Boyd Rd.), they are quite close to it.  We have a car here &amp; I get a turn in it occasionally &amp; drive it.<br/>Went to Mataria yesterday.<br/>Miss Maclean gone to Australia.<br/>Fan has gone on transport to England.  Bob has been invalided (dysentry) to Malta &amp; wires "going England".</p>
