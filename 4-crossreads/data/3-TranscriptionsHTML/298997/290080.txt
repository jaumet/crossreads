<p>is in consequence of an advance &ndash; a slight one &ndash; made by the third brigade last night or early this morning.  We had to dig our own positions on the lines of the ones we have left, act as our own ration carrier, carry wire &amp; wiring irons up handy to the line etc &ndash; a busy night.  Lt Wilkinson had just been telling us that our position was a good one, as long as we kept quiet &amp; did not let the Germans know we were there, when a trench mortar in our field gave Fritz his issue.  A position is likely to be quiet when a t.m. invites the enemy's fire.  Had a couple of casualties through fire on the road, &amp; "Knock-out[indecipherable] is missing.<br/>May 2<br/>Busy on digging &amp; wiring again &ndash; putting a strong barrier of wire before the trenches we dug previously.  No 7 was withdrawn before the job was finished, owing to machine gun fire.  We followed when our job was completed; after which Fritz blazed away at the place we had just left.  Later Phil Knight with Judkins Scholes &amp; myself when out &amp; completed the job No 7 had not done, in record time.<br/>May 3rd<br/>We moved into front line, our position being in hop field, where, if you are not careful in moving about, the loose wires from the hop poles make an infernal racket as they are disturbed, clashing against one another.  The position is a very decent little trench, which used to belong</p>
