on old Fritz I believe he squealed like a pig, put the wind up him alright
19th. Mr Sampson I had another patrol out last night, we done the right sector this time, shes nothing but water muck a mass of old tangled barb wire, when we were getting through our lot old Fritz spotted us opened out with a machine gun, made us bow I can tell you but luckily he got no one, I know "no man's land' fairly well now from one end of our sector to the other, we tried to cross the valley last night but had no hope for it is full of water easily 200 yard wide in places to attack first here is impossible for you would have to punt men across, what kind of a stunt that would be you may well guess, we were out a good 400 yds but never saw a sign. I fancy we have him bluffed now, its a cert his machine guns are, the instant one of them starts to chatter a battery of field guns open out on him he shuts up like a book this is the proper way to do things don't give him a chance
