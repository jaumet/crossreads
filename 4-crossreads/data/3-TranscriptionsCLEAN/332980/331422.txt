 Tuesday 16th. This day I caught a Light Engine returning to Les Fontinettes Depot & after a good run arrived at the Depot just before 11 am & after a chat with some of our Fitters who were stationed there putting the Rods on New Engines just over from England. These Engines are known as W.D. meaning War Department & They are a fine lot weighing 123 Tons when ready for the Road. They are 8 wheel Coupled with Outside Cylinders & Stephenson's Link Motion They are no doubt a very fine Engine & well up to date, having the Westinghouse & Steam Brake,
