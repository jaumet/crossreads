<p>bombs happily for us without any serious effect.</p>
<p>Wednesday 29th<br/>A little sultry. The Turkish Artillery opened up on us about 5 o'clock and made it warm for about half an hour. Our guns replied and the bursts and crash was deafening. One of our men named Gnr Turner a recent transfer from the Ammunition Column was hit in the legs and several L Horse men just near my store were wounded 2 of them died about an hour after. One shrapnel shell burst about 190 yds from my dug out door &amp; a shower of bullets scattered over a space of a &frac14; acre.</p>
<p>Thursday 30th<br/>Went to Ordnance. It was warm to-day &ndash; Well the flies know it. They seem to come from nowhere as while we had the cold spell you could not see any about. Now they are in droves &amp;</p>
