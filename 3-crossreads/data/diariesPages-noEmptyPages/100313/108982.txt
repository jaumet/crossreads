3/12/17 Bailleul Mt. Kemmell
6th Field Ambulance and after much hunting found the dentist who was working in a room over an estaminet with nothing outside to show the place. Had an impression taken and a yarn to the fellows there. There is a big market place here all cobbled. The old town hall and the church of St Pierre Vaast are essentially Flemish. A guild of lace makers operates here and there is a loom in every house. A few dirty looking girls were standing bareheaded round the square and now and then walking off with a soldier. The streets were busy with lorries and limbers and the traffic police are busy men. Left about 4 and had a quick passage home through Locre. Matthews being at Camiers today I presided at mess and we had a few guests from the 23rd. Smuts from a coal brazier cover up everything.
