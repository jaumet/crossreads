September 1916some new ones & about 15 % of the old ones have had to go away.  Things are very quiet about here now.  Aeroplanes come over occasionally & drop some bombs  A few scattered parties of Turks & Bedouins have been captured & brought in.  We have now had nearly a month's spell, only an occasional patrol or camel escort to do.  Still we manage to do a bit, exercising & looking after horses etc.  It is very slow & monotonous & I wont be sorry even when we get out at Bir-el-Abd, 50 or more miles E of the canal & do the outpost & patrol work again.  A big wet canteen has been opened close to the camp so everybody is feeling satisfied.  We received the Anzac books we paid for some time ago  I sent one home.
Sept 7thAs leave is still being granted & many of the men had gone twice I put in again & got 3 days & left by the train at 10.30 am from Mahemadia getting to Port Said shortly after 1 oclock
