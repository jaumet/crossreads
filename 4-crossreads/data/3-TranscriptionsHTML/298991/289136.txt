<p>Monday 22nd January<br/>We have reveille at 7 am breakfast at 7.30 fall in 8.30 am work till midday, dinner at 12.30 pm fall in 1.30 pm, work till 4 pm tea 4.30 pm. There is a rumour we will be here until the end of march. It is a camp of inconvenience, the cook house, Q.M. store, water tap, &amp; latrines are all about 5 to 800 yards away in different directions. Cleaning up tents during the morning, putting another up on another site in the afternoon. Snowed during the afternoon &amp; appears to continue. Hear heavy firing during the evening. This is about 9 miles behind the line.</p>
<p>Tuesday 23rd January<br/>The temperature was 14 degrees below zero today. There was a terribly cold north wind was blowing. Shifting a latrine, it took up nearly all day, as the ground was exceptionally hard to dig being frozen as hard as a rock. Informed that I was to start on night duty at the Buffet. Have to make cocoa for sick &amp; wounded coming through the dressing station. It is a very easy job. I just have found that I left my souvenir belt behind at Longueval. Will go out &amp; get it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wednesday 24th January<br/>Still very cold. We have a good few patients come though here, some are very much wounded, one poor chap had his left leg &amp; right shattered. Both were amputated upon arrival here. Went out to Longueval this morning got a ride in a motor lorry nearly all the way out, but walked all the way home, it is about 7 miles. Everything was very quite out there. German airoplanes have been coming over very frequently of late, our anti-aircraft guns fires hundreds of shells at them but without effect, as the German on nearly every occasion flies very high. Precautions have to be taken against the shrapnel &amp; pieces of shell that fall after bursting in the air. We start work at 8.30 pm until 8.30 am, 12 hr shift. Change over every week. The sun was shining all day but the rays are not at all warming. Very cold wind blowing all day.</p>
