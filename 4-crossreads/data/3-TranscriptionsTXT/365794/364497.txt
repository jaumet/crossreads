 Friday 6 [5] April 1917 [1918] Sisters Leed &amp; Peile come &amp; bring flowers, roses &amp; kind note from former telling of "Frank" &amp; his distress.  Am relieved though to find no visitors allowed though on enquiry from the M.O. get notices of "21 days C.B." [confined to barracks] &amp; heaven alone knows how long when allowed up.
