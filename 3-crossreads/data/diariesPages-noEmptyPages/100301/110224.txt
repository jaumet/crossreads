When we got to our camp we arrived there at 1 oclock in the morning had a good feed of stew (a new dish in the army) Tea changed my socks took off my drawers turned them inside out put them on again laid down for a bit of a sleep when at 6.30 the same morning we got into motor cars to go off to the Somme this was the month of March we travelled all that day until 2 pm when we went into Billets for one night next morning we marched to a Railway station passing on the way Mont-de-Cats got on the train for Amiens from there after riding in cattle Trucks (8 chevioux or 40 Hommes) about 40 men in each Truck all day, we arrived got into Billets at Gudinette where we only had one nights sleep.
then next day at 12.30 we got the order that we were wanted at once to pack up straight away be ready to get into cars at 1.30 pm so we got into the cars went quickly right through Amiens again to a village called Darnacourt where we got into Billets as it was raining hard all day we were glad of a bit of shelter. 
we each got as many bombs as we could carry extra ammunition Tucker at 8.30 pm the same night started for the front where the Huns had broken through a few days before. there were troops going in all directions, some coming down others going up, all seemed in a muddle to my mind. Anyway we arrived at a village got in a big barn where we stayed two nights when we got orders to move up we were wandering about half the night
