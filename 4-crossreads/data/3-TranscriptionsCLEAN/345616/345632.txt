 Friday 30/8/18 After waiting for 2 hours were told to make ourselves comfortable staying the night. There is a bit of sunken Rd off main Rd  about 2 am it started raining & it was not joyful. Stopped about 3 but very cold fritz's guns going all night. Brks. 4-30 Rice & tea & it warmed us up a bit. Great battle started on our left about 5 & still going strong. Our Planes are swarming over his lines & we move forw'd in about 20 minutes. Got here old French trenches about 7-30 & still here 5P.m. dont know whether we move or not tonight looks like more rain.  on the way up yesterday passed dead huns Horses, mules etc stench awful. This part of the country from Amiens to Peronne is very desolate where Villages were now is nothing but rubble the woods have been blasted & are all dead only the off shoots showing any green  & the fighting must have been  terrific, Passed shell holes you could Put a 4 roomed house in & as close together that only a fringe of earth separates them. All this was done by fritz when he was after Paris first time. the French soldiers must have had a murderous time of it 58-3-6 - 97/4. 
 Saturday 31/8/18 off again at 10-30 through Peronne etc 2nd Div took Mt St Quenton last night. Spelled for dinner 2-30 stew only. was shelled all the way & expect to be on to the finish being under observation all the time. So far he has got pretty close to us but no casualties yet. Must be near Peronne now a lot of water in front of us dont know if its River Somme or Canal or Marshes. My heel is skinned also one toe & feel very tired & stiff   have marched now for 3 weeks at this game. Think the Boys hop it in the morning. Raining letter from Syd Papers from Maude a regular God send.
