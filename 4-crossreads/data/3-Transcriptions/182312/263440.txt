<p>(10).</p>
<p>and completed her complement.&nbsp; The hospital service between Havre</p>
<p>and Southampton is maintained by the &quot;Gloucester Castle&quot;, &quot;Austurias&quot;</p>
<p>and &quot;Mahens&quot;, the latter two vessels being well known in Australia.</p>
<p>The &quot;Gloucester Castle&quot; had been used as a hospital ship during the</p>
<p>Gallipoli campaign and was excellently fitted up and also by the way</p>
<p>had an Australian Matron.&nbsp; The crossing to Southampton occupied about</p>
<p>seven or eight hours and was made under ideal conditions, a smooth</p>
<p>sea and&nbsp; a well balanced set of engines.&nbsp; Running in past the Isle</p>
<p>of Wight we anchored for the night in Southampton water just opposite</p>
<p>Netley Hospital.&nbsp; In the morning we moored to the Quay just near</p>
<p>where the Cunard Company&#39;s &quot;Aquatania&quot; is fitting out to act as a</p>
<p>xxxxx Stationary Hospital at Salonika.&nbsp; I fancy she is the biggest</p>
<p>vessel in the world - I certainly couldn&#39;t imagine anything much</p>
<p>bigger.&nbsp; It is estimated that she will be able to accomodate 4,000</p>
<p>cases!&nbsp; At Southampton an Officer came aboard and allotted us to</p>
<p>various towns in England.&nbsp; Australians (I was the only one) went to</p>
<p>London and English, Scotch and Irish went as near their native towns</p>
<p>as hospital facilities would admit.&nbsp; Hospital trains were waiting</p>
<p>and we were soon off again.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; quite nice to see hay stacks</p>
<p>which were real and not dummy ones concealing a gun position, and</p>
<p>farms which were not ruins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The line ran past Brooklands Speed Track which is</p>
<p>mostly used by would-be suicides and those wishing to avoid military</p>
<p>service and then on wards to Waterloo through the suburbs of London</p>
<p>names, such as Surbiton, Wimbledon, Barnes and Clapham, which at</p>
<p>least had a familiar sound.&nbsp; Arriving at Waterloo we were greeted</p>
<p>by the afternoon newspapers announcing the execution that morning</p>
<p>(4th August) of Sir Roger Casement and the rise in price of bread to</p>
<p>10d. the 4 lb. loaf.&nbsp; This rise, the papers were careful to tell us</p>
