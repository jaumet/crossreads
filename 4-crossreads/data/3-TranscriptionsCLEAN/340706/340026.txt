 I continued on till I reached the Post D'Aval then to Garden des Plantes - where whole glasshouses are devoted to the culture of our common geraniums. Here rain came on & as I had no coat I took shelter with the gardeners & told them all about the great size of our farms. 
 Then I wander down down & meet a NZ Captain who is visited a Mde Hautecoeur 21 Rue de [Gacobins] & after we dine at a tea room 
 I then go to Railway station & find that my train is starting almost immediately & that I must go in it or wait till 6 am to morrow all trains seem to leave at unholy early hours. There is no other alternate so we go on board leaving at 5-40 pm 
 On we go through undulating country fringed on limits with hills or forest reminding me of eastern coast near Poya. The whole country is intersected with filled in trenches & dugouts now of no use but once filled with an importance far beyond their present innocent look. 
 Night comes & finally at 11.23 pm we land at Rouen & find ourselves stranded the orderly is alright as there is a rest camp for him But for officers none
