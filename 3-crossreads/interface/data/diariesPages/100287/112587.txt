22nd. Paraded with the Tasmanians yesterday as I belong to them now. 
Another glorious morning scarce a cloud in the sky, the sea is very much quieter too, only an occasional big roller spins us about we sighted a lighthouse just after breakfast on the "port" side they say it is close to Portland.
Tons of fun at breakfast table this morning bites were plentiful you only have to throw out some little disparaging remark about Victoria to start things moving, next table to us is a "Tassy" he is one of the best bites on the ship, it's the fun of the world sometimes to listen to them, Victorians Tasmanians they throw off at one another N.S.W. Victorians are deadly enemies as far as the State is concerned, "Sydney Harbour"
