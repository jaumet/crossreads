<p>bombs in Hamelet, a couple of hundred yards away, and unfortunately caught some of the 3rd Division (<strike>4</strike> 6 Batt, I think) while they were resting at a Comforts place, on their way out. This morning he bombed a battery just over the road from us, but unlike last night I was half asleep &amp; did not notice it much.</p>
<p>This afternoon we discovered some men digging a gun position about 100 yds from our dug out, so we shall have to consider clearing out <strike>soon</strike> before he starts shelling &amp; bombing it. (Proved to be a searchlight position)</p>
<p>At daybreak this morning the 4th Batt  attacked the German position with the idea of advancing about 1000 yds I believe. Fritz was rather better in his defence, evidently because he is desirous of hanging on to a particularly high hill in front of our lines. We had one or two Fritzes through.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, the main trouble</p>
