at Victoria Station London just on 3 pm. Marched to Horseferry Road where I went through the usual red tape. Went to clothing store obtained new uniform. Clear of all trouble about 6 pm, hailed taxi flew up to Shaftesbury Hotel where we fixed up accomodation. Had tea after went round to "Hippodrome" where "Zig Zag" was staged, a fine entertainment. Arrived back fairly late to our quarters, but wrote home before retiring, thus ended the 1st day of our leave.
