<p>Rollestone<br/>4.12.16<br/>My dear Father,</p>
<p>Miss Miles forwarded on two letters from you &ndash; one from Wagga &amp; the other from Sydney dated Oct. 23rd.  She has kindly offered to send on all my mail if I have it addressed through her.  I can keep her posted with the changes in my address &amp; so should get it much earlier.  Of course by the time this letter reaches you, you will have had my cable dated the third.</p>
<p>If you have been sending any papers lately I have not received them, so I suppose somebody else has benefited by them.  Though letters are forward on as a rule, nobody seems to think it worth while to readdress a paper.<br/>That was a great piece of verse by [indecipherable]</p>
