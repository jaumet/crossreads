This afternoon I went through 2 of the most modern shops in Paris the Rue Lafayette Galleries another fashionable shop (Au Printemps) they are simply wonderful inside the floor space is tremendous all round the shop there are galleries with the different departments the top or roof of the shop is all glass built like a dome from the centre of the floor great staircases wind their way upwards elevators are all over the place, it is one of the prettiest sights imaginable to stand on the 6 or 7th gallery look down on the thousands of people many colored lights below thousands of flags are flying hanging everywhere the shops are all being decorated for Xmas from what I saw this afternoon I shall have to change my opinion as regards their shops for I fail to see how they can very well be improved they are absolutely splendid.
All buildings over here seem to be heated by steam pipes in the winter I can tell you they make the rooms
