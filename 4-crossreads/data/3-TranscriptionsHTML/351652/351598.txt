<p>walk with Reg., energetic aren't I?  Reg &amp; I went to Figheldean, about 2 miles from here, we got caught in a bit of a storm on our way, &amp; nearly got drowned.  We had a big afternoon tea over there &amp; came home again.  Jack is looking pretty fit &amp; getting fat, Reg also looks well but he is not too well at present, has a touch of the flu, the winter coming on is not agreeing with him.  I don't think I shall take your advice about the bending exercises, too much like work, I certainly need it as at present I am fatter than I was when the photo was taken, my weight being 12.6.  It is no wonder a chap put on weight as ever since I've been back, done nothing hardly at all, the signallers march over to some sheds about &frac12; mile from our camp, there we are left in charge of bombadiers, so another chap hop off to a Y.M.C.A. a short way off, there we have tea &amp; play billiards, we do this nearly every parade.  Our only work is at 11.30 &amp; 4.30, also early morning parade, when we have to go up to the stables &amp; groom horses.  We work them in spasms, every time a head comes along.  I pity the horses after this war as they will [have]</p>
