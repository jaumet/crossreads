  
 day did he worry us much.  I'll tell you all about that later on.  What did surprise me was that I was much more amused at the other chaps antics than scared.  Sounds callous but it is so.  We came out of the line about Christmas & went back to a little village.  In a way it was better there,  but  had a decent room to sleep in & decent meals but I had a very busy time working all day & till 10 & 11 every night.  Weather pretty rotten too.  Then I had to come away down here for a course of instruction in a new branch of clerical work which they are starting. 
 I haven't cared much about it, it is a big training camp & we sleep in tents (very cold & damp this weather) & 8 of us which is rather crowded. 
 It is terribly cold, snow every day & we have to attend lectures all day & swat at night. 
 Of course there are compensations.  I have met several old friends & made several new rather jolly friends.  Then we have had a couple of impromptu concerts.
