<p>2-3-16<br/>Thurs 2nd<br/>Put in this morning taking over Signalling Equipment from Nelson;<br/>This morning an English Tommy was accidentally shot (at Sequela) by a machine gun, the bullets went through both legs above the knees &amp; he died while being bought to the train at Sandafa; Capt. Wells had to go down to attend to him.</p>
<p>Captain Higginson appears to have sobered up for the first time since we have been here, &amp; celebrated the occassion by saying everything has to be <strike>done</strike> much stricter, &amp; is getting himself well disliked in consequence but I suppose it will only last for a few days; Reid goes on the 'phone with Head Quarters Sigs tonight &amp; we do no more patrol work for some time at anyrate.</p>
