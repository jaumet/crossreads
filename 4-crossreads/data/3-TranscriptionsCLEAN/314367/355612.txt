  
 We officers put on our dirtiest rig & proceeded to make the best of it - newspapers take the place of cloths in the ward room - Every man bar the Commander & Doctor has to work & the Doctor has to stand by for accidents - However I wanted to visit the Una on the other side of the wharf - I left word & cleared over & down to the pier - I went past the old Sumatra & was promptly hailed by Lambton & I went inboard & had a drink - I met him & Livesay - the paymaster of the Berrima - All seems well but no outside news save about the Scharnhorst - G - L - Like us they regard the Pacific job as a wash out now & want to get back to Sydney - Not a word of any European news & no out mail before January & you cant send a wireless without special permission - Troops at Rabaul are quite well - There seems to have been some little trouble with the Germans about the Natives & the Police - All this has been stopped by the destruction of their cruisers -
