<p>beggars will find nothing to do when we get back, all our patients will have been taken by the stays at home.   Never mind, we shall find a crust somehow.<br/>Heaps of the wounded continue to pour in here   More train loads to day, and it is seven weeks since the first fight took place in Turkey.  We were promised, if my memory serves me correctly, that two weeks after the ships of war began to bark at the Dardanelles the city called Constantinople would fall.  Has it fallen yet?   Is it likely to fall in the near future.  The cable lies are so persistent that they now fail even to elicit remark.<br/>I am sorry for Jack Paton, he has kept to soldiering for a very long time, I saw him start in the 4th regiment at Newcastle many years since, he was never in my opinion of the highest class, but he did his work well and climbed the ladder of rank step by step.  It will be pity if any trouble should come to him   He married a little girl named Donnelly.<br/>My Kitty has a cold.   Now why my Kitty?  But later sentences assured me that it had cleared away.  Good, my Kitty.<br/>Glad that you styled my letters lovely</p>
<p>President Wilson has done very little in regard to the wreck of the Lusitania.   Think you no so?<br/>Dust.   You should have been here to day.  The wind was hot beyond anything that you have ever felt, the sand of the dessert was flying in all directions and in thick clouds, and the sun set as a while ball in the western sky, in such manner as to suggest the moon rather than the orb of day, this due to the atmosphere being filled with the sand raised high above the surface of the earth, yet not so high as to reach the sky.  It was queer spectacle to see the sun in such state.<br/>You will have seen Dr. Kennedy before now, he is a lad whom I like, and though not strong he tries to do his piece of the work set out for him.<br/>Glad you liked to learn about the troops leaving, it will now be somewhat interesting to look back upon at this stage of the war.   You are becoming an interesting correspondent because you read the letters that you receive and answer the various sentences as they have been set out, thus giving the reason for their being so set out.</p>
<p>Clarrie Bridge has not so far answered my letter, it was sent to the care of the Admiralty, I hope that he is having good luck, he is a nice boy.  Reg is becoming quite a sqell [swell] in London? It will be great experience for him to have controll of so large an institution as the Middlesex hospital, if one battles well in this world he never knows to what he may attain.  I must write to Dr. MacDonnell Kelly some of these days.  Dr. Harris is doing good work at the hospital in Wimmereux.  Good luck to him.    Some of the boys from the Themistocles are in Egypt, I do not know the names, but I shall try to learn.  The Moultan with Dr. Fiaschi</p>
