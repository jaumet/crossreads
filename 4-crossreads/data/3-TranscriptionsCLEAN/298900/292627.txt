  
 Friday & Saturday 9th     Issued some drugs etc to outside units & also sent stuff to B. Section.  Cold developing rather badly pains in the head, in for a bad time.   Piano still in the Mess so have some music occasionally.   Trying hard to get a go on with French again but its difficult, I'm not in the mood.   More mail arriving but no home letters. 
 Sunday 10th    Feeling very off colour Neuralgia having developed to some time.   Kept quiet during the day & out of the cold wind when possible.   Church service in our mess at night the hymns being played by a tommy Sgt we dug up nearby.   He turns out to be some hit in Music being a Doctor of Music & after the service we had a great treat.   Capt Stevens of Melbourne singing several songs.   He is wonderful indeed & his Toreador is a wonderful effort.   After that we made an evening of it & I turned in about 1 A.M. being at peace with the world at large.
