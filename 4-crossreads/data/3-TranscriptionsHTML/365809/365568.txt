<p>Dear Mother and Father,<br/>I have just received letters, Mother 12-8-17 Father 13-8-17. They are both written in the middle of the long strike. I cant understand why those swine can't see that they are helping the Bosche and play the game a little better. I got back to the Battalion on Sunday last and found that it had been covering itself with glory but had lost a lot of good officers and men and then on Monday  morning we got news that Colonel had been killed. It was a dreadful blow; we all loved him dearly and had such unquestioning confidence in everything he did. He really was a great soldier and his loss is one which will be felt very deeply in the high places of the A.I.F. There was a distressing gloom over the Battalion for some days but we have to try and forget those splendid fellows who have gone out and we try to buck in again to enable the Battalion to carry on and keep up the very excellent name which it has.</p>
<p>I am still second in command. Simpson has been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and should do very well. We are at present out of the line in quite a nice little camp on a hill amongst some trees. Don't know how long we shall be here. One never knows anything these days, there is electricity in the air and everything seems to be going beautifully. The news from the line to-day is splendid. l<br/>I have been trying to answer a lot of things in several of your letters but it is awfully difficult to clear them up. Possibly to-morrow morning I may be able to get on to it. Tomorrow afternoon I am on President of Court Martial; a vile job.<br/>I am in best of condition. Best love, your affectionate son<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
