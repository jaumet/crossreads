<p>The floor is covered with a rich carpet  25 years old &amp; the walls are of beautiful semi-transparent alabaster taken from the river Nile. There are 5 chandaliers of huge size &amp; beautiful  appearance. The roof consists of several domes. Magnificently worked &amp; from these domes hang the chandeliers &amp; huge rings of lights. In all there are 2500 lights. The domes also have numerous small stained glass windows that make its appearance much prettier.</p>
<p>Mahomet Ali lies in his tomb just inside the door &amp; to the right.  As this tomb is in a kind of birdcage, one cannot see much. Words spoken here are echoed wonderfully. Natives enter here, &amp; remove their shoes &amp; pray. At the far end are two small alabaster columns in the wall that all the blind come to &amp; pray. The mosque is a most beautiful place &amp; would be very difficult to describe, with any degree</p>
