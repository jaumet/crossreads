14weird place.
The noble desolation of the place, the sacrilege, vandalism, and savage wilful wreck.
The dear quaint old city is an utter wreck, yet there is that about it which gives one the idea that it has dared destruction and with all its terrible hurts has never gone on its knees to the Hun.
Destroyed as it is, smashed to splinters its priceless carvings of wood, to powder its never to be replaced images of stone, to rubbish heaps, its dwellings, and to noble jagged piles its cathedral ad its churches yet will it never be forgotten yet will it retain the pity and the love of the hearts of men, and for a thousand years be as a heap of coals on the head of that terrible nation which has dared with the arrogance of brutes and pride of madness to master where is cannot rule.
