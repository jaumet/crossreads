the front facing the enemy, then pegs were driven 7ft away from the screws while the back of the entanglement which would be facing the defenders the pegs were 9ft away from the centre the reason of this they reckoned was that if the enemy threw scaling ladders over the front he would have 9ft to jump to clear himself of the wire and this he couldn't do when all the wires were connected up, which they are from stake to stake. I don't know what kind of a report they sent in but I don't think it would be favourable.
About 2 o'clock last night there was an air raid some of the bombs dropped quite close to us and shook the huts like a jelly, they are exciting things I can tell you these air raids, however they done very little damage and were soon hunted off.
