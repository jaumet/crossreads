  
 Am writing this in the YMCA, just under a ho shrapnel hole in the roof.  The YMCA man here is jolly good: he came all round on the 4th giving out cigarrettes to the chaps just behind the firing line and did not mind the bullets a bit. Please dont worry over me Mother dear: we are all in God's hands and now we have licked the Turks so much of it is pretty well over and we might be sent back for a rest.  I have not written to Mrs. Wilson and some how dont think I can yet: we do most of our work at night here and you have to get all the sleep you can in the day time although I had a good sleep last night and feel grand today. Our chaps are were jolly good considering it was their first time and they were all split up from their mates and rushed into it suddenly:  some of them are a bit nervy after it but it has not affected me at all; but I never did have any very great shocks although the concussion of the shrapnel bursting stopped my watch - they tell me there are very few wristlet watches will stand shrapnel. It is jolly nice being in with Ronald and he is a splendid officer. Will go over to the tent and finish this off. Later. Just found out it was Sunday & have been to a service in YMCA.  The man in charge is a great chap alright.  Think I'll send the other letter after all; its an account of things before we had the dust up.  We were formed up and this evening the Colonel have us a message from the General thanking us for what we had done.  I am glad I got here in time for it. Love to father Your loving son Rob
