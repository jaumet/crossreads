<p>Sat. 15th Dec.<br/>On Mon 3rd Dec. I entered hospital just before the "Wolf" rounded into the Atlantic on a N. Westerly course.    The doctor told me frankly that I had appendicitis, that there was not sufficient anaesthetic on board to operate, and that the only chance was complete starvation.</p>
<p>A couple of days later the white screens where brought out and they were told aft to prepare for another burial.</p>
<p>But I refused to die and am still pushing along although I have had nothing but a little ice since I entered hospital and am deplorably weak.    Webbie has been splendid;  he has come along to the hospital and when he came the patients (including self) got the first bath they had had for ages.</p>
<p>The German orderlies never wash anybody or anything.</p>
<p>Am semi-conscious most of the time being heavily "doped" with morphine and opium.</p>
