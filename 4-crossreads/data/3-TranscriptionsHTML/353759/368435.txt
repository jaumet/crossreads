<p>obviously he thought we were "coming on the grouter":  he left us though, and later the Q.M. of one of the other guards turned up.  He suggested we"d come to the wrong place - that we saw our O.C.  This was a bit sudden, and we"re still here &ndash; spring beds brigade, a fire, and blankets innumerable &ndash; and a pillow with a clean pillow slip.</p>
<p>The days here as changeable as a bookman"s moods:  snow and bitter cold &ndash; then sun and lovely warmth.</p>
<p>And so to bed &ndash; after reading some more of "The Little Minister" of the whimsical Barrie.</p>
