<p>2 Monday</p>
<p>Ran around to B.R.C. twice for passports &amp; really got away on 4 o'clock train to Southhampton. Lovely warm day. No incidents or adventures of any sort. A lovely baby in full bloom aboard. Shewed that no adventure was expected. Went to bed in ladies' lounge &amp; slept well in clothes.</p>
