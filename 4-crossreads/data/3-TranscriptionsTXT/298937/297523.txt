Sunday 30th January
Dispensing on & off all day.  The first field rations have been served today, & although we had a good dinner, tea was not splendid.Most miraculous coincidence this morning.  Met Buckle again, driving mule team into camp ground (barrack yard).He is still with the 6th A.S.C. & is now camped at Maadi.  Then Sellars, whom I did not expect to meet for some time again (since I lost touch with him after leaving 1st at A.G.H.) is also camped at Maadi.It seems as if I am fated to meet Jack Buckle.
