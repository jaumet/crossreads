27.11.17Dear George,Just a P.C. in case my letters have gone down. We are both well & trying to be contented here. We are having windy weather but that is OK. It is the snow & ice that we object to.This is a view in side Salisbury's Chapter House where all the Cathedral Meetings are held. The one in Westminster Abbey is very similar. They were both built about the same time. But the one in Westminster Abbey was used as the Parliament House one time but that was way back in the 1600's. I have no news to give you. We are just carrying on. Waiting like Mr Micawber for something to turn up.Best Love to You all from Dave Ellis & Harry
