F.We pass the Canaries about 3 am & I just see one island about 6 am. A nice howling quarter breeze & nice steady roll helping the ship slong.
I work hard all day & get a haircut which takes nearly an hour. I feel very I.O.W. sick on viewing Teneriffe all songs make me think. We have an extraordinary tea of fruit cake etc.
9 June, Monday
F.Very busy all day. Go to hi tea 2 class. A lot of teeth get scattered about. Fair swell all night & this morning. I was very cool all night. I eat all sorts of rubbish all day long. Jack Craven comes up for a couple of hours. This marks the first milestone in a 2 year journey.
