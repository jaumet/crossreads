 House on Wednesday evening, a dance was given by the "Diggers" to the girls of the Anzac Buffet. These ladies have worked very hard for the last four years at the Buffet, from 7 oclock in the morning till 8 oclock at night. Most of the workers came from Australia. I received an invitation to this function, so of course went along, &amp; had an enjoyable time. A presentation was made to each worker, of a souvenir handkerchief, and the following inscription was worked on them &ndash; "To the Ladies of the Anzac Buffet", "Thank you from the Australian Digger",   At an early hour on the 26th March, I was once again at Fairford, staying at Aunt Kates home in Hatherop. I found them all well there, &amp; they naturally made numerous enquires after the Pater. In the afternoon in strolled along to Bibury, &amp; called on a number of people who new the Pater when a boy.  In fact I visited the house in which he lived. Bibury is indeed a pretty spot, it is situated in a valley &amp; is entirely surrounded by hills. A pretty little stream runs through the village. A fine place to spend a quiet holiday in good weather.  Unfortunately I was greeted with a snow storm on arriving there. As before I was greeted with great kindness by Aunt Kate, &amp; felt at home at her place. Back to London at 6 p.m. the following day &amp; was present at another dance in the evening. The Function was arranged by some ladies from The Y.M.C.A. &ndash; was free to all overseas troops. A Ladies Jazz Band was in attendance. The following day was full of surprises for me, as I was continually coming across old Pals. I joined a party of chaps from the Unit, &amp; went to a music hall, unfortunately the show was not a good one. Caught an early train on Sunday morning to East Sheen, Mort Lake, &amp; spent the day at my Uncles Home. I enjoyed the day here immensely, after tea I visited Hock Douch's home at Chadwell Heath, Essex. Hock was married some time ago to a Miss Pearl, and I stopped the night at Mrs. Pearls home. I gave them a great surprise, as I did not write, &amp; advise them that I was coming along. On arriving there I found the house full of girls, probably on the look out for some more "Aussie" husbands;  but I did not "catch on". The next day at 12 oclock I was dining with Aunt Ada, at her home in Great Marlow. Of course she was full of enquiries
