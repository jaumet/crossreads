 Thursday Oct 29 - 1914  The Australian mail (to Sydney) closed at 5 pm yesterday  -  I got mine all away  in safety  & heaved a sigh of relief  -  I hope every bit of it will reach its destination in safety  -  I was ashore Wednesday aftn  -  seeing to the above & had just finished when a pleasing spectacle presented itself opposite the P. Office  -  Half our men were ashore on liberty till 5 pm  -  The wardroom cook it seems was vy drunk & was trying to appropriate a horse & trap & behaving in a disorderly manner when he was promptly collared by the civil authorities in the form of a white officer assisted by 2 Fijian policemen & I saw the cook   -  vy gone in the knees - being assisted to a police cell to sleep off & then explain to the PM his lapse from sobriety & dignity  -  We all hope he'll get imprisonment for life & so rid society of an infernally bad cook  -  He must send up the mortality bill whenever he cooks we are certain - I ought to have mentioned that prior to this   -
