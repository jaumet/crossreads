<p>We go Riddlers &amp; meet 4 P.M. Troc. to meet Mrs Bartlet Charlie's father &amp; Mother in law-  I find they have a Drapers Shop at Eltham a London Suburb, only a small one, &amp; also run a house agency business apparently well to do &amp; really not bad sorts but <u>not</u> what Laura would have chosen-<br/>Went to dinner (Champagne) at Capt Riddlers old friends of the Isherwoods &amp; very nice people-   I have married a dear little lady Mother, a bit extravagant perhaps but has common sense.</p>
