  
 September 1916 continued (Regular force) but after consideration I decided to remain with the Australians 2nd September. We were woke up about midnight in time to see the reflection of the Zeplin which was brought down in flames at Cufley by Lieut Robinson who later received the V.C.  We had been to London nearly every week end while we were at the school, but unfortunately missed this one 2 4 3th Left for London on week end leave & returned on the 26th.
