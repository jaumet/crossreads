Lieut Geo Edwards left here a few days ago with an Abscess in the ear, & we heard that he has died from it. he was a good Officer & very popular; Today we built a wire fence around the Hod, A Sqdn moved out & we put our horses in for the night tying 2 horses to one tree.  Sent Cpl Elliott & Sig Collins out to Geisi today as they are getting a good deal of Sig work out there
