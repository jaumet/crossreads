 The Lock Esk anchored 200 yds from shore & I stayed there till 11.15 pm without any luck - bailed lots of pinnaces but they wld. not take off anyone - till at that hour one condescended. So it took a continual fight & ten 10 boats to get ashore. The bullets were all the time hitting the Lock Esk while at anchor - these trawlers live in this state. Full of experiences I returned to camp about 1.a.m. 
 Otherwise there's nothing to say. We move soon & its just as well as this life had fed us all up. The NSW papers are funny with their accts of our "Still [indecipherable] to advance slightly" etc 20 ft we've done in 2 months. When we do move there'll be lots of casualties you know but I daresay you'll know before this reaches you. 
 I got yr prized parcel of tobacco - handerkerchief - socks soap & paper - very useful articles indeed - The soap however will keep. A crowd gathered to have a look at it & smell it! - - - - - 
 Can't write more as have dysentry & a cold & indigestion still - though [indecipherable] if I do talk to the flies - Man hit by schrapnel in the water bathing near me yesterday - put his head out of the water & said "the beggars have - - torpedoed me" 
 Gwilliam hit on the shoulder & gone - Clark is O.K & all the officers - good luck.
