<p>escorting  little cruiser was dodging round during the day and our course still being due W with constant zig &ndash; zagging. Passed several vessels going in the opposite direction but saw no land and we are due to pass Malta about midnight. A concert amongst the officers was held at night, but spent the time writing and fixing up company matters.<br/>During the afternoon while on the bridge I saw quite a tragedy, two passengers who were not detailed to embark and sail with us being killed and subsequently eaten. Throughout the day several land birds joined us including a small falcon or some such kind of hawk. Just before sundown this swooped down on a swallow, killed and carried it up onto one of the funnel stays, where it plucked and ate it. A small bird like a sparrow shared the same fate and when I went onto the bridge next morning and was told that the ships watch had succeeded in capturing the murderer abt.  4 o'clock in the morning, was not sorry.<br/>Sunday 2 April 1916<br/>A beautiful fine day. Up at the usual time and spent a little time relieving one of the men on bridge look- out coming off at 8.30. Our escort left us during the night when I believe 2 or 3 small warships visited us. We passed Malta before midnight, I heard.<br/>About 9 o'clock land was dimly discernable to our north: we were on a NW course at the time, this later being changed to W. The land turned out to be the island of Pantellaria. The coast was rough and rugged and the steep hillsides plentifully terraced, with small flat-roofed cottages painted white scattered about and in one place grouped into a village above which on a high almost isolated crag was a large castle. At &frac14; to 11 church parade was held on the aft well-deck and was attended by General Birdwood and special other generals, the service being conducted by 2nd Lieut.Bethuen, a Tasmanian who was formerly C of E clergyman.<br/>About lunch time land could be very dimly made out to the south; this was Cape Bon and the neighbouring part of the African coast. At 6o'clock our steward told us that the wireless operator had just received a call for help from a troopship that had been torpedoed near Malta. Immediately all manner of rumours began to be scattered abroad about the loss of life etc. Our course was changed to N during the afternoon. Passed several vessels.<br/>Monday 3 April<br/> A nice morning giving place to a dull grey day with a drizzle of rain occasionally. There was a distinct nip in the air; the coast of Sardinia was clearly visible and probably there was snow on the higher portions inland to account for the cold. About midnight we had picked up the light on southern Sardinia and right through the day the coastline of this island and of Corsica was visible in the dim distance to the E. The sea remained wonderfully smooth. At 11o'clock in the morning General Birdwood addressed the troops massed on the after well-deck making a rousing speech which was well received. By 6.30 at night the lights of Toulon harbour and the dim form of France could be seen to the E.</p>
