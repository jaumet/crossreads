24thSpent most of the day in the Gardens.  At 6 p.m. went on duty at Babel-Hadid tramway, to look after the soldiers on the Heliopolis trams.  Had no trouble, though.  Of course we had no power to interfere with civilians and the native police had no power to lay a hand on us.
25thAt 9 a.m. had to go to a Greek shop and arrest a soldier who had been absent for 4 days.  Town patrol 1.30 p.m. till 6 p.m.
26thSports in Cairo.  French display of 75 c.m. guns, and a French band of 100 performers.  Some of the 6th were in giving an exhibition of wrestling on horse-back, Balaclava Melee, etc.  Town patrol 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.
27thSpent the morning in gardens and in afternoon went for a sail down the river as far as Boulac Bridge, which opens up in the centre.  The boatman sailed and rowed us about for two hours, for the sum of three piastres (71/2 ).  No wonder he looked relieved when we got out.
In the cool of the evening
