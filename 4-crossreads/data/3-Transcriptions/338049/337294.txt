<p>Monday 25 March<br/>Astir early &amp; caught train to Glasgow.</p>
<p>Walked about until struck Overseas Club. Book beds etc. Visited North [indecipherable] Engine Works. [Note at bottom of page] Saw 6", 8" shells, aeroplane engines being machined. Afternoon walked about again &amp; finally finished up by having a swim.</p>
<p>Evening to Opera. Carl Rosa Coy. Madame Butterfly. Not too bad.</p>
