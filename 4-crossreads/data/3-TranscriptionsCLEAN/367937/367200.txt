No wonder you lost your breath when father told you he had got a car - it fairly knocked me all of a heap when I read it but my word I am glad!The Telegram to Fremantle came with the letters.  We only stayed there 24 hours so Mrs. Warner not sending it on did not make much difference.  I have not much time for writing now so will give you a list of the people I got letters from and will you please tell them and I will write as I can. I got one from Dick & one from Florrie and two from Mrs Nicholls the Dr.  Please tell Mrs Nicholl that I do like getting her letter very much and will write to her as soon as I can - 4 letters from the boys written at home in Easter Holidays.  I will write to Mr Wilson tomorrow.  It was very good for Mr. Wilson to write to Mr. Trelawny - of course I have not been able to see him yet but I think if I should get mumps again I would be able to see him this time.I am glad that Alan has got Gaida and hope he likes her.  I dont think there is anything that I want that you could post me as you see by the time a reply comes to this we might have got out to the Regt. and of course you cant take keep much clothing with you there. I would like an air pillow as they are jolly nice to sleep on, cant buy them this side and a things they all wish for is a piece of cheese;  wonder if you could send a small piece some times it would have to be soldered up in a tin I think.Any little edibles are always greatly appreciated here they make a change you know.
