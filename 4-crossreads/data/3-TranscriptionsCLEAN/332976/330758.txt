  
 November 1916 [No entry for 28th] 29th    The R.Es. took over the dump to-night & are going to look after it.  29th   30th   I went out to Needle Trench to-day with four others of the section.  We are making a large Dugout for an "Aid Post."  Needle Trench is the  third  fourth line of Supports & Fritz is continually shelling it.                December 1916 1st   This morning Abel & I went down to the end of the "duck walks," which are just at the back of the 3rd line Supports, & laid about 50 yds of them.  Fritz shook us up a bit with his high explosive shells
