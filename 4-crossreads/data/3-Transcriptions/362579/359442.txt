<p>to London, My leave is finished Monday night. Now for some news.<br/>Am not going back to France. Staying in England   &amp;  to be on Duty at Croydon, not far out of London. Miss Cornwell is Matron, so my luck is in. May not be very long with her because I have asked for transport to Aust. Am on the spot if there is room on a boat but about 100 names are before mine.</p>
<p>Maybe shall leave the beginning of next year, so please don't send any more parcels   &amp;  stop any friends from doing likewise.</p>
<p>My address will be<br/>C/ Officer Commanding<br/>Aust. Base P. Office<br/>Horseferry Rd.<br/>London.</p>
<p>Have had a gay time  since our arrival in England.</p>
