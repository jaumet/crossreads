<p>[Letter from Keith Ferguson, sent in above envelope]<br/>My dear father,<br/>Here we are at our second port of call, &amp; here we stay till further orders.  Since our arrival we have had a route march every day, but this afternoon we pulled out &amp; anchored in the bay, so it looks as though we have been for our last stroll through the city &amp; suburbs.<br/>The town itself is very much like Hobart, looking at it from the stream, &amp; is about the same size.  The population varies in colour from any tint you can imagine to any other tint with a few extraordinary colours thrown in here &amp; there to break the monotony.<br/>The above interesting account of our experiences &amp; description of the town &amp; its inhabitants will just about scrape through the censor; but I fear that any further information would be ruthlessly obliterated.  I can only say that our route marches here have given the men not only all the exercise they need but also indigestion</p>
