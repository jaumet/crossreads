<p>Sunday, 18 April, 1915<br/>The Egyptian Red Crescent train came right up to the hospital gates last night utilising the tram track the guage [gauge] being the same, there were nurses &amp; orderlies aboard it, there were no very bad cases on mostly rheumatism and pneumonia, they say it rained at Lemnos all the time they were there and they only had bully beef &amp; biscuits to eat.</p>
<p>Discharged from hospital at four o'clock an escort came to meet me on arrival at the camp I got a great reception from my mates.  The camp is quite deserted all the inf [infantry] having gone only light Horse &amp; a few inf reinforcements being here.  There is a big barbed wire prison guard room built.</p>
<p>Received two more letters &ndash; strays E &amp; G.</p>
<p>Monday, 19 April, 1915<br/>Saw Camp Doctor he put me on four days light duty.  It seems as if we will be here for some time all getting issued with helmets and summer clothing.</p>
<p>Received my back pay this morning.  The camp and horse lines are altered now, drivers being one side bearers the other.  The camp food is a great change to the hospital, I could hardly eat it.</p>
<p>Miss Lyon one of the ladies I met in hospital an English journalist wintering here called to see me in the afternoon, I showed her around the camp then received a kind invitation to Madame Shakour Pashas house to tea.  Her husbands position in Egyptian Army is equal to a General.  Went to Picture theatre with Clive B at night.</p>
