25 July, 1916A.G.H. CairoWhat a world it is.  here am I stuck in a hospital ward in Cairo & its much the same as being in prison.  true I can walk about but always between high walls & wearing these pyjamas all the time heightens the effect.  There is nothing to do but read.  The nurses are kindness itself & one gets every attention, there is plenty to eat & drink & to day we all got paid 10/- each so I expect that I should be dubbed an ungrateful person indeed if I had a growlMy hands are getting well slowly & I was able to scribble a few lines home & now make an entry in here I must write up the back stuff a bit but not now, Im not in the humour & the hand is'nt too good yet - I got a long letter to write to Vic, reckon I ought to blow him up   [indecipherable] him taking notice of Madge,  She's--------ed
