<p>In the afternoon of the 30th Oct. we passed Cape Agulhas the most southerly point of Africa quite close inshore. At about 6pm we rounded the Cape of Good Hope &amp; anchored at the entrance to Table bay at about 10 oclock pm. Sharks , Penguins, Flying fish, porpoises &amp; seals were around the boat in large numbers. The land that was visible during the day was thickly covered with vegitation &amp; the heat coming off shore was excessively hot.</p>
<p>October 31st At daybreak we weighed anchor and entered harbour at 7 o'clock . We moored at the wharf shortly after. The troopship Suffolk was in harbour when we arrived, she had a good many Australia troops on board.</p>
<p>Coaling operations were once more started as soon as the ship was made fast. The natives do this kind of work, altogether there was about 100 niggers employed coaling this ship, They are very amusing to watch at work, They are always on the trot they never seem to walk &amp; all the while they are working they chant some sort of native song, Its like bedlam when they are all at it.</p>
