  
 a good drink of water & at 3 am we marched last.  The going was heavy & several times our horses could hardly get a footing going down some of the sandy slopes.  Progress was very slow about 21/2 miles an hour & the sun very early let us know the day was going to be warm.  We sighted the enemy's patrols about 8 oclock.  Our squadron was advance guard & our scouts got very close at times but as they got on one ridge the enemy would be retiring to another & what is difficult to understand  they never fired a shot at our scouts.  One party left their breakfast cooking on the fire. 
 We followed for nearly an hour & came upon several new wells and wooden troughs & about 1/2  a ton of wire.  The troughs we packed together & burnt & we threw the wire down the wells  C & D Troops here took the opportunity of watering their horses & it proved afterwards the best thing we did all day.  The main body did not come so far & consequently did not water.  At 9.15 we turned back.  It was very hot
