there is a certain amount of vanity. They go through, doing their work at an easy going pace during the day (in the evening) In the evening putting their robes over them, walking stick in hand, they walk home in such a jaunty fashion that one would think they had’nt a care in the world. Some of the natives employed at the hospital have surprised one very much in this respect. Many times I have met them on the street and failed to recognise them until they had recognise me.

Whilst seated in a tram car on my way to Cairo to-day a well-dressed Arab sat down beside me. As he sat down he greeted me with the salutation"How are you"? with the emphasis on the you. I replied "Very well thank you". He then began chatting away on a variety of interesting subjects to which I listened or replied as the case may be with delighted interest. After we had talked to-gether for some time, he rather startled me with the remark "Your not an Australian your either a Scotsman or an Irishman more Scotch than Irish, I think."? I was much amused at this remark. "Yes" I said, I am a Scotsman. "Ah" he said, the only part that is Australian about you is your uniform". This Arab could speak very good English. He was a guide and some of these guides can speak quite a number of languages. I have had quite a number of similar experiences like the above and they all go to show that these people who come in contact with other nationalities can tell by one’s accent the country to which one belongs.
