<p>21st continued  I saw the B.M. of the 4th Div. who told me to see General ROSENTHAL. The General was very business like and asked me no end of necessary questions, to which I was able to give satisfactory replies. The General said that he would see General Holmes to substantiate my statements, and if all was well he would transfer me. I called to see him the next morning at EQUINGHEM and he said that everything was alright,"do you think that you could manage the Heavy Battery" to which I replied yes". He told me that I would have V 4 A Bty. And to put in my application for a transfer and he would sign it there and then. I went to SAILLY the next morning in the car to 4th Artillery Headquarters. I went with the 4th Div. Medium and Heavy T.M. Batteries and relieved Capt. BrownE D.T.M.O. of the 1st Div. The 1st Div T.Ms. had no steel or box helmets, rationing arrangements had to be made, and I had no staff, only LEMMING and myself. I went to Headquarters and obtained one bicycle, 8 phones and steel helmets. We carried on the line under difficulties and in a short time got into working order.<br/>Bdr. KIRKUP was wounded by a short round from our own guns. The same shell also wounded two infantry. We continued to work there until relieved by the 5th Division who had 1 &frac12; guns which they did not know how to use. Lt.KELLY was acting D.T.M.O. he was most ill-mannered. We then went by lorry and G.S. wagons to BAILLEUL WEST railway station and entrained there for a place we did not know but were informed unofficially that we were to join the LAHORE Divisional artillery which turned out to be correct. I visited BAILLEUL and had dinner there. Bailleul is a fairly large town with the usual market square. No young girls or fit Frenchmen are to be seen anywhere. We spent that night in the train and arrived at about 3 a.m. at Doullens. Y 4A Battery at CONDIA. I had difficulty in finding out where we were to go and to obtain transport to get there. At about 10 a.m. I obtained two lorries to take the guns, kits etc. to DOMART and then to ST LEGER where after&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  difficulty I found billets for Officers and men. I saw General NAIRN C.R.A. of the Lahore Artillery, the Brigade Major and the Staff Captain. We were billeted comfortably.</p>
