<p>I wrote a few letters but all so far very short, will get to work on them later on when I get out of the hospital, I put most of my time in reading it's a long long time since I done so much reading before.</p>
<p>A busy street runs right alongside this Hospital &amp; from our windows you can watch the traffic passing up &amp; down the roads, this a very big &amp; important city &amp; I am anxious to get out &amp; have a look at her.</p>
<p>28th. It is Sunday &amp; very quiet, went outside in the sun the first time for a fortnight &amp; found it very nice, as I was hobbling along the corridor a lady pulled me up &amp; started talking about one thing &amp; another &amp; finally ended up by giving me an invitation to come out to her place when ever I could for tea &amp; have a look</p>
