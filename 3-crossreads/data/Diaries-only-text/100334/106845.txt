Cocoa, I managed during the Day to get two more Blankets and slept much warmer all night. Monday All day Sunday it was very Wet miserable.
Monday 28th
All the morning it was wet miserable, but after Dinner it cleared up a little, so I went with a chum into La Havre and while awaiting the Train, along came a Motor Wagon and a lot of us scrambled into it and had a ride into the Town, both of us had to do some business first and then we strolled around for a while, but it was still wet miserable and we kept going until after 3Pm when we went into the Crystal Palace Y.M.C.A, a fine building with two rows of Galleries, the first is where Meals are provided, at reasonable rates and the 2nd Gallery is for Writing Reading, at one end of the first Gallery is a Picture Screen and at the other is a Machine erected on a staging and Pictures were shewn at 7 Pm. After writing two letters we both had our Tea and as it was fine, we went out for a walk until 7 Pm. La Havre is very much like all the other French towns I have seen, with it's narrow streets
