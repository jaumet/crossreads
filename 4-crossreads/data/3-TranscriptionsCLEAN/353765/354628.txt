Barbers Tailors & other dago shops & of course the Y.M.C.A. No duties for troops whatsoever & the authorities seemed to have done their best for us & everyone appreciates. As long as privileges not abused all goes O.K. Passes permanent granted from 2-11pm, especial passed req'e for all day leave Alex'da supposed to be 7m distant but does not seem more than 4m. Troops have to travel by tram which is about 3/4 or 1m away. Five of us went in at 2pm. Had a good time. Visited several places for feeds. Ended by getting a passable one. Had snacks at restaurant after Groppis [a famous tea room] style. Went to Kursaal 12th - at night, poor show, old Cairo stage clique, not one worth seeing again. Landed back in camp about 11pm, tired but satisfied Tucker in camp poor, but plenty of  "British Tea Rooms"  -  "British owned"  run & conducted by Greeks under military rego. 13th Had another good dip in sea & fresh water after it. Visited Y.M.C.A. for morning tea. Run on good lines, ticket system. Alex'da again in afternoon. Visited Catacombs & Pompey's pillar. Catacombs interesting bones of old Romans planted 2300 B.C. Bones very crumbly. Statue of Roman King & Queen. Left photos & negative of bombing at Romani at Kodak Co. to be ready Monday. Went to American Cosmograph Rather good pictures. Had dinner at Windsor Hotel
