  
 last night.   Sgt Smeaton of Reinforcements was killed in the action.   At about 3 am the Boche attacked the 5th Brigade and got well through their line.   Our chaps got on to them & captured 50 prisoners drove out & killed the rest and re-established our line.    Groves was walking round the posts last night with a runner & captured a Hun all on his own and brought him in.  This man appears to have been lost and wandering around.   The Battalion is coming out tonight so I sent Sutherland and others up to get everything ready for them.   A flight of our planes flew over Montigny while we were finishing mess and one of the English aviators dropped his bombs on us!!  Pretty hot.    We could not see whether he had got anyone with them or not.   The little village was extremely quiet and peaceful in the evening.   I went back to my billet and carried on a great discussion with a very old Madame.    She had been to Paris once only - to the Exposition.   All the old people went to the Exposition evidently!   A Monsieur also came in and denounced the bad Administration of France.   He was brokenhearted about his crops being destroyed.  One does not need to talk to these people for long to realise what a tragedy this War is to them.   This last advance of the Germans has aggravated everything and made it so much worse.   Amiens deserted.
