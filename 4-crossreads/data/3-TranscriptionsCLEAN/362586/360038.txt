Yet.  What marvellous people are the Russians.  Once they take it into their heads to push nothing on earth seems able to resist them.  I see no reason why we shouldn't do as well as the Russians, & feel pretty confident that we will.  It will not be long now, I hope, before we are able to prove it.I sat down with the intention of writing a letter, but have been interrupted.  Give my love to all.Your affectionate nephew
