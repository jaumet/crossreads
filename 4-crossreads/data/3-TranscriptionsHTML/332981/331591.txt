<p>and again after tea, all of us went out together to see the sights of the town of an evening.</p>
<p>We spent a good hour in a estaminet, where dancing takes place, one goes in first and has to buy a drink and then into the hall, where a number of girls and soldiers were flittering about to the music from a large organ built up on a gallery, which is worked by a handle turned by a Belgian youth. I wemt upstairs &amp; behind the instrument &amp; had a chat &amp; saw a portion of the instrument. I was told that the organ cost 2,000 francs, about &pound; 15 and is about 8 ft high and about 12 ft across and very nicely painted and finished off.</p>
<p>Needless to sat the hall was crowded with soldiers and lassies, and the music fairly fast, the pace was fast and furious and all hands seemed to enjoy themselves. After we were tired of watching the dancing we went out and along for a walk and after the boys had bought more cards we all returned home to the depot for supper after a very interesting day of sightseeing and today Saturday we are still waiting</p>
