<p>11.  We go to Grimsby next Monday week &amp; return on the following Friday.<br/>The weather is very bad at present so they say but it must be on the change now.  This has been the longest &amp; coldest winter since 1077 that is 840 years.  It has not seemed bad to me.  I have had a bad time with colds etc, but have only been real bad once.  I have had 3 attacks of Catarrh but soon have checked it except just the once some months back.</p>
