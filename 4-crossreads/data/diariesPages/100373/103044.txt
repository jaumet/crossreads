Sighted the Daidalus Lighthouse. It is built on a rock which is hidden by the sea. Three P & O Steamers are said to have been sunk on this hidden rock before the lighthouse was built. The Keepers who were on it; went mad, it is so lonely. To obviate this a jetty was built so that the Keepers would be able to take exercises. One could see the jetty, but very indistinctly. Sighted land about dinner time. 275 miles to-day

Read Dr. Johnston and his Circle in M. K. Series. Very interesting. Very stormy all last night. Had to wear my overcoat whilst on guard. Rather a contrast to which I had previously thought and heard of the Red Sea.

Whiled away the weary hours on guard by studying the stars. Saw
