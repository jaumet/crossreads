<p>Yesterday was Trafalgar day. I went up &amp; saw the Monument decorated. Also the crowd collected there. I had a letter from Mrs Lunn just before leaving convalescence. She gave the address of some people to call &amp; see here. But I have lost the letter can't find it anywhere. Thought at the time I was putting it in a very safe place I evidently did. I am sorry as it is pretty deadly trying to find your way about here by yourself  I am to meet two of Mr Harrisons daughters in town here during the week They were running the V. A. D. Hospital I was in. They are going to take me around London one afternoon. I have a photo of their place given me when leaving shall send it across to you in this letter shall have it enlarged if I pull through. If not well it will be a souvenier for you of a place where I spent a very pleasant time. While at Cambridge I met a Mr Noble he is in Chris'ts College there going for some degree he is a parson. A son of the Cricketer Noble or that family don't just know what. Mrs Titterington took me around to his rooms &amp; introduced me to him he is a very fine fellow. I had one afternoon out with him seeing the sights. This is his third year &amp; final says he thinks England a rotten hole to live in &amp; wont be sorry  when he is abel to return to N. S. W. I haven't seen or heard of Bert so far don't know why he hasint dropped me a line. Have been wondering</p>
