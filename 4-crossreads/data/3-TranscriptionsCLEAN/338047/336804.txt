When I awoke I found that one of the gas splashes had raised a big yellow blister on my hand, about 2 inches long by 1/4" high. I didn't know whether to let it out or not, but it decided the question by bursting itself. 30 Aug Next morning 30th August we moved back past Foucancourt to a gully near Fontaine le Cappy. I was fairly tired so did not go into the village, which was further up the valley. We thought we had come back for a long spell so made a fine big dugout out of salvaged Fritz galvanised iron etc. In this valley was a railway shunting yards with damaged locomotives. They had been either shelled or bombed, and belonged to Fritz.
