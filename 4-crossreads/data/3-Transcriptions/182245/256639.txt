<p>4 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Think this weather</p>
<p>must be too good to last. Fixing</p>
<p>harness, horses ect in morning</p>
<p>&amp; cleaning harness all</p>
<p>afternoon. The other two</p>
<p>sections went up to the pits</p>
<p>in evening. Fritz was</p>
<p>doing a lot of shelling in the</p>
<p>morning round Erquingham</p>
<p>&amp; Fleurbaix. I had to go</p>
<p>up to the pits at night to</p>
<p>show the man with the rations</p>
<p>the way. Saw Capt Campbell</p>
<p>&amp; he said he would get me</p>
<p>up to the guns shortly.</p>
