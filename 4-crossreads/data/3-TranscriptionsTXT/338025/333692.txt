 Monday 21st May 1917 Left camp about 9am for Dump at Favreuil. In the morning we loaded motor waggons with empty cases. In the afternoon we finished the staking and cleaning up. At dinner time I had a walk through Fritz grave yard and one strange thing I noticed was that all the dates were cut of the crosses. [several lines crossed out evident on next page]
