During the night some Tanks were travelling about and seven of them started to come down this bank in line. The occupants of the Dugouts   ouh   had to rush out and only just managed to save their lives & their little "homes?. It would be rather nasty to have ones corpse scraped off the wheels of a Tank for Burial purposes. 
 16.5.18   Bright moonlight again. Fritz over every night as usual 
 17.5.18   Visited the Searchlight last night but had no luck. Fritz would come drumming along untill the lights began to play around & then would he would sheer off to either side. 
 Ride  we   18.5.18  (Welsh Cpl) leaves for England with improved machine Gun Possy. We have had "Umpteen" generals inspecting the idea every day. (It is a miniature Barbette). 
 19.5.18   Seen a picture show last night at one of the Aerodromes. They put on a picture (OHara Star Reporter) I think. This picture showed war scenes & had about 5 reels. It tried to show aeroplanes bombing Artillery in Action, Battle scenes etc.  I'm sure the author never anticipated that it would be shown just behind the lines in an Aerodrome above all places. Even while the picture was showing. Just outside the Hangar they were firing rockets to guide
