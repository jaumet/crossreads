January, 1915Saturday 16We altered our course due North - the Indian Coast last night towards Bombay as 2 Cruisers are supposed to be on the look out for us, but all the trade Routes from Colombo to England are Patroled by the Navy - our "Chips" has been busy painting out the German name "Plaz" (not PHAZ as I at first wrote you) on the boats lifebuoys etc: This boat was only built last year & fell a prize to the Victorian Govt. on the outbreak of war.If attacked our orders are to scatter & then rendezvous at an appointed place.
