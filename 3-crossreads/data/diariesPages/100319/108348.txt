1/9/18 Mt St Quentin ? Peronne
the dugout and his chaps had evidently pushed on better with higher casualties but were still very much up against it. Duggan rang me up to say that he had moved two companies up to work round Mt. St Quentin with another to rush up and another in Nucleus in Save Trench. Warned my "C" Coy to be ready for a prospective move. Our gully still congested. I put the R.S.M. on to reorganizing men of the 5th Division and sending them back to the line. Fellows who carry wounded down or escort prisoners accumulate in safe places if one is not watchful. Very bloody sights here this morning ? so many poor rent bodies and shattered limbs. Some men dead on stretchers. Passing Germans are used to carry the wounded away to the rear A.M.C.
