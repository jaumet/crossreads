January, 1915Wednesday 27Wireless operator picked up news of the sinking of the "Blucher" & German Raids - day & night the operators wear the receivers on their ears, but are sworn to secrecy as to what they hear. Measles have broken out unfortunately among the men, we hope not in bad form as we should disembark on Saturday next.This afternoon we pass the spot where the Israelites are supposed to have crossed the Red Sea!!  "Ajana" dropped out of sight astern, something gone wrong with machinery.Vaccination took well on me.
