  
 at Kensington, pleased to see one of Melbournes beauties. 
 Sunday 9th March  My last day in London.  Left hotel about midday and went to Earls Court for dinner after which strolled through Kensington Gardens & Hyde Park having tea at the Corner House.  Said goodbye to D.W.A.  & went to Waterloo where I caught the train to Dinton, walking from there to Fovant. Arrived about 11 p.m.. 
 Monday 10th March  Found the camp much as I had left it very few having gone away.  Idled the day away and went to the pictures at night. 
 Tuesday 11th March  Nothing doing all day.  Went to a lecture at the Y.M. at night on Alsace Lorraine, part was OK but the usual trash about Nurse Cavell etc. spoilt it. 
 Wednesday 12th March  A cold change.  A stroll during the morning and by the fire during the afternoon passed the day.  Reading and playing Quoits the medicine.  Concert at night by the Attractives quite a good show.
