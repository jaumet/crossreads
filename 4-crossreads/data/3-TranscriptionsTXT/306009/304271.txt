 1915 Mar. 26 Fri. Nothing particular happened to-day. Rather exciting little combat between members of the Office Staff &amp; others working in Mena House about 9 p.m. &ndash; Turning out the electric light saves the situation. As the room I have been occupying is to be turned into a ward I have found fresh sleeping quarters on a balcony &ndash; on an iron stretcher &ndash; very nice, too!
