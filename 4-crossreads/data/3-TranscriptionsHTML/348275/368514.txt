<p>Firing Line<br/>6.8.15<br/>Dear Aub,<br/>How are you old chap your must think I am a nice sort of chap for not writing to you before.  I would have written but I did not know your address till a week or so ago.  How are things over there.  I suppose the next thing I hear will be that you have enlisted.  I suppose you are very anxious to come &ndash; but the next time there is a war I will be a flag waver, that will do me.  But don't let me put you off coming.  I know you have wanted to come from the start but I don't think mother &amp; father will allow you.</p>
