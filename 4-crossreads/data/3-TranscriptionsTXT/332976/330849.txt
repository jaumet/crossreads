 April 1917 28th   We were instructed to be ready to "move off" this morning &amp; at 1 P.M. the section left Mametz by motor transport, together with limber &amp; tool carts etc, en route for Contay where we arrived about 3 o'clock. Contay is a quiet little village about 11 miles from Amiens &amp; near Warloy.   There are very few soldiers here &amp; we are living in the Chateau de Contay, a large &amp; picturesque building of the typical French Chateau style. The tool carts &amp; cyclists etc arrived here about 5 o'clock.
