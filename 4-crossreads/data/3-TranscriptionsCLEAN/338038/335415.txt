 My dear Father & Mother, Since writing you from Exeter last week I have done a fair amount of travelling - My friend Read & I left for Edinburgh on the night of the 2nd and had the 3rd & 4th & part of the 5th there, leaving for here midday yesterday - We had a wonderful time in Edinburgh & think a great deal of it as a City.
