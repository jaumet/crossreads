Today is simply awful in regard to heat and quite a number of chaps have gone out to it, and been sent away to Hospital. The sooner we get out of Egypt the better I’ll be pleased. I thought this would be an easy job but lately it has proved otherwise. Tomorrow the new drill order is coming into force. No parades through the heat of the day. The 15th Fld Amb moved off today to Ismailia.

We have been very busy again today and short handed as os crop has gone into Cairo. A tremendous lot of venereal cases are being sent away from the L.H. men. A good many of the troops have been marching to Ismailia. This is a crying shame in this heat as numbers of empty trains go down every day and I understand quite a number have died on the way down and one man committed suicide.

We had a tremendous sick parade again this morning 70 odd and I had to get away from the dispensary for a while as I am going to spend the day in the Y.M.C.A. writing letters. I had to go without breakfast this morning Capt Marshall told me to put up on extra stripe so that I can have the privileges of the Sergeant’s mess. He is fearfully exentric and absolutely without tact. Went to pictures tonight.

I have a few more aspersions to cast on officers in general. When in Camp in Heliopolis several Canteens were erected on our ground (5th Fld Amb). Something like 40£ rent was collected which was supposed to go to the Unit. It went instead into the Officer’s mess. Also in our last Camp in Tel-el-Kebir (15th Fld Amb) about 10£ a week was collected which also went into officer’s mess.
