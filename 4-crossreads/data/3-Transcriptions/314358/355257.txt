<p>Now has changed</p>
<p>No boom or roar of gun makes [tremendous?] the aim, no crack of bursting shell tears not [indecipherable]. The Hun has been pushed away, pressed back from where he had counted himself invincible</p>
<p>Autumn &amp; winter have come and gone, and all the noble acts and the endurances of those brave men who held him off are now well nigh forgotten.  Spring has been here and now summer is present.  Nature of these her two glorious seasons has streatched out her arms and spread her splendid wealth with endeavor to cover up the signs and wreck of war lwfe and plade weaves a green mantle over shell holes and curtain entrances to dug outs cloaks over gun placements and trenches and over wraps all wounded soil of shell crators</p>
<p>Nature with kindly hast thus with her beauty would hide the signs and the shame of war, trees which have withstood in some small measure the weck of bombardment through no longer with the beauty of spreading arms, hold their shattered stumps of limbs forth from torn [indecipherable] to die and proudly bear the few green leaves which nature hangs upon them like the molde [indecipherable] of worthy poverty</p>
<p>Red splashed are on the landscape</p>
