<p>praise for the marvellous fighting they have done.<br/>This afternoon after tea Lindsay &amp; I went for a walk down to Shearwater a very pretty sheet of water from which the Camps round here drain their water supply  it lies in a lovely little valley clothed on both sides by beautiful trees &amp; pretty little cottages are sprinkled all over the place  there is a nice little path &amp; road which runs round the lake &amp; is largely patronized by the girls round this quarter, I took my camera with me &amp; got a few snaps  on our way back we met Jack Gribble I had not seen him for ages &amp; we had quite a long yarn, he wants Lindsay &amp; I to come round to his diggings tomorrow &amp; meet a few more of his pals, Jack has been in trouble over his Italy stunt</p>
