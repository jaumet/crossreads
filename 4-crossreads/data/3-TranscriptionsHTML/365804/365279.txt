<p>France<br/>19.9.16</p>
<p>My dear Judge<br/>Just received a postcard from you on way to Cairns. I am still quite fit and at present very pleased with myself. I  sent a small organised raid over to Fritz a few nights ago and they did quite well and had only six men slightly hit. I have since received congratulations from Army Corps Division and Brigade and have been detailed to send over the same party again later on. These raids are delightful things if successful and I have thoroughly enjoyed training</p>
