  
 The H.M.A.T. Camberra & H.M.T. Norman still here moored with us at the entrance of the cannel full of troops. At noon we had orders to proceed to Port Said, so at 4 pm we let go & proceeded in charge of a pilot steaming through the cannel. A bow search light put on board for the purpose of steaming through at night. We expect to be at P. Said at 9 am to morrow morning unless we have to make fast for ships to pass. Whilst steaming through the cannel at 5.30 pm one of the Lieut.'s of the flying corps which we brought over from Basra this trip flew low & circled around us 4 times quite a treat. He kept a distance of 200 feet away & finally flew back to the hydroplane depot. At 12 pm we reached Ismalia & change of pilots. Here we heard of the hospital ship Kanowra having struck the bank yesterday & aground in the cannel for 5 hours & having lost 2 blades of her propellors. She was bound from Australia to Port Said for wounded soldiers.
