Wardreque Thurs 23/8/17Last Tuesday the old gentleman who owns the chateau in which we are billeted and which is also our Bn H.qrs invited the C.O. and two others, myself being one to a drive in his car to St Omer.  It was a beautiful day and as the roads were good, the old chap who was driving himself, let the engine "out" and we sailed along at a great bat.  We passed through the town of Arque on the way and saw a very ingenious contrivance which lifted barges holus bolus, from one canal level to a height of 42 feet
