 I omitted to mention change in Imbros. The ravages of the storm could be seen. The Egyptians gone etc 
 Friday 3rd Dec I left list of goods to be got at Canteen with Eltham &amp; we made a start for Panaghia about 10 oclock &ndash; Lieut Sparrow, Sergt Warner (N.Z. Artillery) Sapper Bates (6th Brigade) &amp; myself. We decided to walk in place of riding Donkeys &amp; I quite enjoyed the trip which proved very exhilerating indeed. Up over the hills &ndash; down rocky pathways &amp; ravines. The sky was overcast &amp; the clouds were low &ndash; quite enveloping the high peaks &amp; as we passed through them we got quite damp. We passed some Greek hamlets. Built of rough stones but they looked comfortable. Here &amp; there were spaces in the Valleys which were cultivated &amp; the old time custom ploughing with Wooden Planks &amp; oxen could be seen.
