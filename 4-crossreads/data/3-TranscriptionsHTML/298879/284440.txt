<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Tuesday 21<br/>Windy    Had to replace a chap in the Brigade H.Q. who had gone sick and was exempted from duty. Had a couple of good rides on the bike. Roads are very bad, merely cart tracks here and there and full of ruts.</p>
<p>Wednesday 22<br/>Still Windy Again   I have been sent down here to Bgd. H.Q. as the other chap is still sick. It is not a very hard job as it happens. I have to take despatches around the ditch mostly to the Post Office. It is about 3 miles away.</p>
