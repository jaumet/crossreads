<p>I am still feeling awfully fed up about Colonel Simpson going away. The incedent has at present taken away all my ambition to rise above my present rank. I did not think it possible that anyone could receive such shabby treatment as he received. However I suppose I shall feel better about it as time goes on.</p>
<p>I sent you a wire today saying that I should be in England until 30th.</p>
<p>Things don't seem to be going too smoothly in Australia. In France, however, they are going splendidly. There are no indications of the Bosche Pushing on our front.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C R Lucas</p>
