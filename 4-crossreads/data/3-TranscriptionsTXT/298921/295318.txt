 1915 Saturday December 25 peace on earth &ndash; Goodwill towards men!!! What a farce I have not said much about the Navy but it was under their guns we left Anzac they acted as our Sponsors [indecipherable] Those of us who have lived in our clothes in the past 2 months are pretty ragged, compared to the Units who have no been further than Lemnos &amp; are rather looked down on by the Brilliantined superiors. Had reinforcements come early &amp; the British Nation listened to old Lord Roberts warning, we would have had men for Serbia &amp; the Dardenelles. We intended having a Concert last night but the Skipper would not allow light &ndash; as we are in the danger zone of Subs.
