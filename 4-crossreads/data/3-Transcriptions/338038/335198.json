<p>I am writing Father separately this mail, also acknowledging your Christmas Cable &ndash; I hope mine from Alexandria went through allright.</p>
<p>I had a great surprise when I heard of Myra G's wedding &ndash; Mary also told me they were not expecting it to take place quite so soon. Mary sent me some sox &amp; other things at Christmas. Sis also sent me a parcel and Mrs Forsyth so things altogether have been good.</p>
<p>I wonder what people in Australia are saying about the evacuation of Gallipoli. It will hit them all very hard no doubt but there was nothing else for it.</p>
<p>We are having a fairly good time now. The weather is lovely and reorganisation &amp; training is just about to commence. We are still at sixes</p>
