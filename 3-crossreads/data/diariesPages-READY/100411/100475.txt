If I get home I can see a time almost too good to be true. Fancy just strolling round the old familiar spots will they seem different? I wonder will young Eve recognise a bloke? Will old Grub have a bit of a 'blub', such are a few of my happy thoughts as I write this. Of course 'Does she still love me' is out of the question isn't it.
Ray Prior is in camp over here now. I suppose young Jack Hayter will be over soon too. Jimmy is still well. Excuse expression but he is what we call a bit 'tin-arsed'.
There's a movie-show tonight with Charlie Chap. featuring so will close. With best love to all.
Your loving son boy, Vic.
