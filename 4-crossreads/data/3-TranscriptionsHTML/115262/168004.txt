<p>Saturday 25 August 1917.</p>
<p>Nothing much doing. Tonsilitis seems to be prevalent among troops off the desert. 5 patients went to Raffa this morning. 3 Br. planes above all day. No rations.</p>
<p>(The last few days a number of boats are to be seen on the water horizon every evening, apparently on their way to Port Said.)</p>
<p>Ammunisiton barges were being brought up this morning at no distance from shore, to the dump at Beelah 6 miles from here towards the line.</p>
