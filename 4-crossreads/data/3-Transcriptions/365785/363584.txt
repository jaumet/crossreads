<p>Aus. Aux. Hospital<br/>Southall, Middlesex<br/>England<br/>8.12.16</p>
<p>I hav'nt heard of you for quite ages dear Lady, quite intended scribbling a few lines of greeting to be in time for Xmas but really there is so little time.  I am up to my eyes in work at the Red X Store of the above Hospital and seldom leave much before six often after and by the time Home letters &amp; Mer's are written each week I'm so tired I don't get many others written.  Am wondering where our letters are, your last which I answered months ago said you had written several which certainly had'nt come to hand, probably my reply has never reached you.<br/>I hav'nt heard a word about your brother for a long time.  Mer. has'nt managed to strike him in France.<br/>I live in a little cottage near the Hospital, a very quiet and distinctly lovely life, &amp; at times get desparately Son-Sick &amp; Home-sick but I'm so thankful to have plenty of work,</p>
