<p>Dear Mother<br/>I am enclosing my Pay Book as a Record so I will not lose it &ndash;<br/>I should hand this in to Field [indecipherable] but prefer to keep it in case of arguments later on.<br/>You will see I've spent a bit, but I have the big item 153:16:11 in the Bank in Cairo.<br/>I sent you a Field Service Card to say I was alright as we have had another good fight at RAFA repeating</p>
