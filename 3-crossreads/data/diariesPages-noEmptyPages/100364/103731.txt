but our every movement was observed and checkmated. When all was in a satisfactory condition for the advance, the attack was begun by the great bombardment, and the enemy naturally anticipating the attack directly on Gaza was surprised by his eastern flank being surrounded. At the same time another force moved up along the seafront and further threatened the cutting off of the Turkish force. This had the effect of a hurried evacuation. The Turks went pell mell, fighting a poor rear-action and leaving behind enormous dumps of stores and munitions. From this tine "Jacko" has had the "wind up" properly, and has not ceased running away until the mountainous country of Judea has made impossible speedy pursuit. 
Heavy rains set in during the afternoon, and made the roads very sticky. We skidded into Bela and camp at 5.30 pm.
