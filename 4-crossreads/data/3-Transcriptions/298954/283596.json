<p>1918<br/>Wed 29th Mchy<br/>Back in Nummer 25 again with Bowell, Cramer, etc. and I am no longer under the care of the handsome Olga ("La Grande Duchesse", as one poetic Hun designated her to me.)</p>
<p>Kate Schmidt, the old dear, can by no means described as "Duchessey".   She is thin, angular &amp; sharp, and was a pre-war governess in England.</p>
<p>Cramer (R.N.D.) is a card.   He tells bluer stories then the bluest and tells the funniest yarns of the "Heast-Hend" and life in the "Harmy".</p>
<p>Having quite a good time; more then sufficient to eat, thanks to Red Cross parcels from England, and the two Russkis entertain us occasionally with national songs.</p>
