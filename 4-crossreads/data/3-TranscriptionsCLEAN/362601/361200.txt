 F. We all walk over fields up to Gorse patch. I take photos. We sit in cosy room & look at books, etc. I am surprised to be back at old games as in Sydney 6 & Mel. 4 in Egypt. Elddoe & Korse.

 F. We go up Snaefell much against my will but it is lovely & we have a real good time, we tell stories about one another & have a lovely cycle down hill. Tea near Sulby station. We are very confidential. I help Uncle sew peas & dig garden all morning. I watch uncle at puzzle & won't sit down.
