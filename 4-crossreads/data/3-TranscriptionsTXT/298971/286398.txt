 at 6 a.m. tomorrow morning bound for Armentiers to relieve the Scottish. 
 Friday 22nd Sept. 
 Up at 4.30 a.m.  The unit moved off at 6 a.m. but I was left behind through having to load a waggon.  This however proved a good thing because my friend &amp; I put our packs on a motor and rode on the Ambulance Car behind the unit.  I met Jack Ellis &amp; young Best on the road.  Reached Armentieres early in the morning.  It is a fine big town (or city to be more precise).
