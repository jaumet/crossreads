<p>there is no doubt we have had a good time here, one could scarcely realise we were in action at all.</p>
<p>About the end of October 1916 the New Zealander's relieve us on this front &amp; we get orders to move down to the "Somme", although we were not actually told that we were going there we knew pretty well that the Somme was our objective. So after a hurried farewell to a few friends we had made, we start on our march.</p>
<p>Nothing worth noticing on the way down. good trip, fine weather all the way, a bit cold till the last day when we pull into camp some four or five miles</p>
