I see the dear old school houseWhere we spent some happy daysAs bathed in golden gloryFrom the suns last glowing raysThose days I cant forget dearOh could they with me only stayWhat things I would as differentAs I go through each long day.They are the happiest daysof memories golden storeAnd could I but go back againI would not ask for moreBut still the years go by my friendAnd seasons come & go,Many lives are made & marredIn this world of weal & woeBut the sunshine & the shadows,they both walk hand in handUntil our cares & sorrowsPass unto a better landBut the memories of the past
