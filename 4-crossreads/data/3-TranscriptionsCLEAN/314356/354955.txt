  
 December 22, 24 Divvy Transport there - drinking Cognac and Bitters - a so-called 'Liquer'.  Together they make a great crowd of rich vitality.  Lofty - the tall lean erratic diver and swimmer of Sylvestre Cappel - a typical Digger Transport Type, and a fine picture lazily lounging over his chair. 
 A rain-sounding wind in the trees, and a dull drizzle from black skies. 
 December 24 6. Slow rare rain.  Yesterday a day of buying in Charleroi and Chatelat with one of "Q" men.  Result - after endless pilgrimages and two bon dinners of Chips and Steak - two bottles of Cherry Brandy - 63 F:  Box lemons - 9F:  and 3 Nutmegs for Rhum Punch 1.800:  6 Tins of Pears 27F - at the Canteen today, one larger tin 1.25 and Vinegar, Chicorie (a new vegetable) and stray odds. 
 Arrangements for tomorrow night's dinner half compleat:  all raw and tinned stuff ready, & three stuff'd turkeys to be roasted in 'Q's ovens, and with 15 bottles of wine - Graves and Sauternes, - 100 litres of Beer, and a great Rhum punch, 190 Francs still to our credit - For New Year's Eve!
