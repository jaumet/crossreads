<p>a lot this week. The atmosphere is foggy and it is impossible to see very far.<br/>This morning I made up a packet of 18 P.C. for my wife mostly of Plymouth &amp; Devonport with a short descriptive note written on the back.<br/>This morning I was pleased to get a tin of Australian tobacco by post.<br/>I was issued with an Australian overcoat tunic &amp; pants today. Also boots. I returned the Tommy overcoat and boots issued to me in the hospital.<br/>I was in Devonport this afternoon and</p>
<p>posted some letters &amp; a packet at the Post Office. I had tea at the Sailors rest. Two sausages, potato mash a bun &amp; cup of coffee for 9d. the cheapest place I have yet been in.</p>
<p>Sunday December 1. 1918. 21.<br/>Three weeks of peace.<br/>The time is fleeing fast. Christmas will soon be upon us. Probably the year will be out before we start on our way home to Australia.<br/>I was at a C. E. Church parade this morning in the Hall. It was poorly attended. It was conducted by the same chaplain as on the previous Sundays.</p>
