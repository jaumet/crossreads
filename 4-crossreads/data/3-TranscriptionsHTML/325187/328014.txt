<p>[Thursday 28 September 1916]</p>
<p>Went to Donoughmore Church &amp; saw grandfather's grave &amp; on to Tullamurry quite a nice old place but only Farmers there now-<br/>Off to see Mr Ferrars Mother this afternoon.  The marshals got most of the old Grandfathers things I understand   And the bronze Sundial that was in the garden has gone &amp; all the place is out of repair.  Aunt Anna has had the grave done up for herself she says dear old lady- I hope not for many years- she is wonderfully well at present</p>
