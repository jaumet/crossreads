<p>1919<br/>Feb &ndash; Mar<br/>full of shells 5.9s &amp; whiz bangs &amp; Minenwerfers also a lot of flares, rockets &amp; old clothes, &amp; a truck load of second hand brass fittings (pinched from the froggies I suppose).  At night time these flares were to be seen going up all over the place.  I got a small bomb &amp; unloaded it.  Another walk took us to Dimont &amp; through there to Domechaux.  The day following we intended walking to Doulers, but the rain turned us back.  The winter seemed to be fast breaking up &amp; there were signs of spring everywhere.</p>

<p>Mar 10<br/>On 10 March we moved to fresh billets leaving Beugnies at 9 am in fighting order (ie no pack).  Our packs had been sent on ahead by lorry with our blankets.  Outside of Sars Poteries we picked up the 29th &amp; 32nd Battns.  The 31st were a day ahead of us.  We marched</p>
