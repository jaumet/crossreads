 Friday 9 November 1917 Rose 10 a.m., sewed, read of the fall of Gaza &amp; how well our Australians have done.  Home sister gives me a cup of tea 6.30 a.m. so suppose am very favored, they are kindness itself but I should like to be on duty as soon as these legs feel strong enough. 2.30 p.m. went to Cairo with S. Watson &amp; shopped till 5 p.m., then Groppi's for tea.  Managed well though our French being nil &amp; no knowledge of current coins the same, shopping is difficult.
