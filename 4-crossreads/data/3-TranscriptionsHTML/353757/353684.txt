<p>Dear Friend Vol</p>
<p>Xmas Day!  Up to our eyes in Sand, crook tucker, plenty work.  We are right under the Pyramids.  They are very fine.</p>
<p>A party of us climbed the Cheops or Great Pyramid, right to the top 451 feet;  it is worse than a hard day's work &amp; very dangerous. We also climbed the Second Great Pyramid which is "out of Bounds" on account of the extreme danger involved in climbing.  <strike>They</strike> This one is smooth at the top, as sketch.  [See image for drawing in margin.]  The black part is of granite &amp; very slippery.  It was granite all the way down once, but someone shook thousands of tons of this stone from the sides to build a great cathedral with.</p>
<p>You should see the Museum here!  Mummies &amp; smells a treat.  Rameses, the cove that iltreated the Jews, looks harmless enough now.  The old stone carvings, gold work &amp; ornaments are unique, modern art looks silly beside these works of the ancients.</p>
