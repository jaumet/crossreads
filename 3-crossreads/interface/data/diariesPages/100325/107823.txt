outpost line. Bright moonlight everywhere sand hills on either side. On the left the old Suez Road. About 9 pm the 7th Brigade marched by, quite invisible to the unaided eye but given away by the rumble of the transport. Tried with binoculars and could distinguish men and horses easily. Turned in 9.30 and slept with full equipment on and with saddle as pillow slept till 3.45 am.

All roused then and stood to arms until daybreak. Very tedious standing still with bayonets fixed waiting. Heard scattered firing along the outpost line. Breakfast and then formed up for return with advanced and rearguards. Morning
