(12) Very funny turnout to day, through a mistake made by the people at Horseferry Road Office I missed the Investiture this morning at the Palace, So I had to see the Lord Chamberlain (Sir Douglas Dawson) at St James palace and arrangements were made so that I should receive my Cross that afternoon. So at 3 o,clock I was taken to Buckingham Palace on my own and after wandering through several Corridors and large, gaudy, Halls etc I was finally ushered into the Kings presence, sure I felt a little excited being all on my own before the King-Emperor of the greatest Empire the world has ever known, (I also felt a wee bit proud of myself when he pinned the Military Cross on my brest and shook me by the hand, exactly what he said to me I cannot quite remember as I was in a sort of fairy-land, I must have been in his presence fully 10 minutes, and he asked me what state I belonged to, if I was married, who I served with in S. Africa, had I been in Gallipoli and
