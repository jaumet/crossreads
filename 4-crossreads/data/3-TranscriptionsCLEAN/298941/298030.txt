  
 Felt very "anyhow" this morning owing to the rough night, & a dose of "jerks" did little to improve matters. At present we are still standing by, so I expect we may be called up at any moment. Later The somewhat misty morning has cleared, and it is now a fine Spring evening. It is good for planes, yet at the same time it is a calm & peaceful evening, & makes me almost forget war
