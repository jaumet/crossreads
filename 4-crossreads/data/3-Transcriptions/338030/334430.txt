<p>walked, and the mules slipped several times on the slippery road. We eventually arrived at 7 p.m.<br/>Every day we take horses and mules to Heilly, about 3 miles away, for water, morning and afternoon.<br/>On Monday, 12/2/17, left Franvillers and went to Behencourt, 3 miles away.<br/>On Wednesday afternoon, 14th, I took a walk to Pont Noyelle, and arrived back in time for tea.<br/>On Saturday, 17/2/17, I had a day's leave and visited Amiens. Left at 8.15 a.m. and walked to Pont Noyelle where I caught a motor lorry and arrived at Amiens at 9.45 a.m. I paid a visit to the Cathedral which is very fine, although all the good work is hidden by sand bags to protect it from bombs. I had a ride in the electric tram and walked all over the place looking at the shops. The streets are very narrow and most of the shops are poor compared to ours. Meals are very dear, costing about 7 or 8 frs. for a dinner, and then not up to much. I purchased a souvenir table centre and then caught lorry back to Behencourt, arriving at 9 p.m.<br/>On Thursday, 22/2/17, was awakened at night by a couple of rats running over my face.<br/>Next day I took a wagon to Corbie for a load of coal for German Concentration Camp.<br/>On Saturday, 24/2/17, took a team of horses to Albert and brought back a wagon. Could not get anything to eat there as there are no civilians.</p>
