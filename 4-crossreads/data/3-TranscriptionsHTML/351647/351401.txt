<p>France<br/>14-4-17</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>I have two letters of yours since I wrote last (&amp;as usual I don't know when that was) but it is very sweet of you to go on writing so regularly &amp; sweeter still to say the nice things you do.  When I read what you said about dear old Tog well I felt like just starting out right away for Marseille &amp; stowing away.  Blast the army.  The dear old place and the dear people.  You just don't know how glad I'll be to finish this &amp; get back.  But I can't come really before its finished (or I am).</p>
