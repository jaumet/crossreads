  
 Leaving the hospital I had brought a number of books with me to read. In addition I did some Teneriffe wheel work. Writing too was part of my occupation and when in the vicinity of Gibraltar I was able to put some letters in a tug which took them ashore. 
 The boat unloaded a matter of 25 men who had contracted the influenza after leaving England. 
 Gibraltar is just a big fortified rock - not a big place either. The vessel reached there at night time so that when we woke up it was to be confronted with the place bathed in the sun.
