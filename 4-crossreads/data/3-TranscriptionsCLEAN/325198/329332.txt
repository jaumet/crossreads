28 July, 1916No 3 AGH CairoThe sickly hours drag by so slowly that one would think that old dad time was at last getting tired of his weary march through the ages, he's a contrary old josser to say the best of him for I guess if I got leave tomorrow he would put on such a spurt while I was out that I would likely find my self making excuses & intreaties to the sentry on the gate with reference to the lateness of my return.  Sir Walter Scott & some lesser lights in the literary world have been the means of helping me to cheat the hour of some of his [indecipherable] minutes but my back & neck aches with the eternal lolling about & I have to  turn old Sir Walter face downwards & take a walk round, & swear a little just to ease my feelings.
