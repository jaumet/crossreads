<p>France &ndash; my first leave since joining the A.I.F. (101)<br/>Tuesday 31st Oct. 1916 (7 pm)<br/>The weather we are having now is very bad, cold, wet, windy and stormy. The fine weather may <strike>have</strike> be said to have ended on 30th Sept. &ndash; three months after we arrived here. Then the stormy weather commenced. The two or three days prior to my departure to Paris were bitterly cold with a heavy frost and when I returned from the Capital where the climatic conditions are much better, I found the "mauvais temps" going strong. Last night there was light rain only but the strength of the wind blowing off the Channel was tremendous. A number of our tents were blown down &amp; several torn to ribbons. The bell tent that I am in stood the strain</p>
