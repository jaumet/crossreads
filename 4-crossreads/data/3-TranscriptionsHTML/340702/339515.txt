<p>tin to 4. Bottle of sauce to 6. 2 loaves to 5.</p>
<p>I changed over the connections of the Dynamo today. It was a great success.</p>
<p>20.10  Paddy Shortall completed 927 days service today. A Bomb dropped very close this morning. Fritz also supplied a very unnecessary encore. The old Engine was pulled out tonight. Not a bit too soon either. A Petrol Engine is being substituted. We got a Rum issue tonight &amp; everybody is telling brilliant stories at once</p>
<p>22nd.10  Monday  Fritz bombed the Light (Anzac) Railway last night causing 12 Deaths &amp; 26 Wounded Our Engine room is 200 yds away and it fairly shook with the force of the explosions I thought the bombs fell within 20 yds of us. The scene of the explosions looks horrible, there are blood brains &amp; human debris everywhere to say nothing of shattered huts, stretchers etc. The shrapnel kept very low. We got the Japy Freres Petrol Engine on to the Dynamo last night I had to look after both for a couple of hours. Had one stop due to defective plug. This Petrol motor won't do at all. It is a single Cylinder &amp; one Kick in every two Revs is no good to a Dynamo. Received a rather generous rum issue tonight with the usual result "I don't care if its Snowing or Blowing" There's very little doubt that it is</p>
