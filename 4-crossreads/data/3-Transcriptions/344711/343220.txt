<p>3rd<br/>Left Colombo at 8 a.m.  There was a heavy swell on, and the ship rolled and pitched a good deal.  I soon got very sea-sick.</p>
<p>4th<br/>Still sea-sick.  Crossed the line late at night.  A flying-fish flew right through one of the port-holes into a ward.  He was only a small fish.</p>
<p>6th<br/>Been sea-sick ever since leaving Colombo.  Felt a bit better to-day.</p>
<p>9th<br/>Passed the Cocos Islands last night.  We were to be taken in close to have a look at the Emden but it was dark before we got to the islands.</p>
<p>11th<br/>Burial at sea of a patient who died last night, after an operation for removal of a shrapnel bullet from the brain.  He belonged to the 13th Battalion.  A guard, with fixed bayonets, was drawn up, and the bugle sounded the "Last Post" as the body was committed to the sea.</p>
