<p>there are no police round and boats are able to come right along side and talk to us. A police boat came for a few minutes this afternoon and tried to punt boats but the mob booed them off and pelted them with potatoes &amp; they soon left; Yes Loyal McNally is on this boat. I was speaking to him to-day. We are having a great lot of fruit sent to us, which is very nice, we got very good tucker on board though, and they say tucker in Q is worth writing home about. please thank Father for his letter. &quot;Home this week! What Oh!&quot; Love to Father, Hal &amp; Fred.</p>
<p>Your loving Son Rob.</p>
