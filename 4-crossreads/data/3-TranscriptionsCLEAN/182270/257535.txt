 MONDAY, AUGUST 11, 1919. 
 Fine, but cloudy and hot. I lopped 
 in 4D & then went down & was 
 working at Boundary troughs 
 for rest of day putting up a 
 batter to them. 
 Tickle put a couple of posts in 
 Cow paddock fence & then he helped 
 me. 
 Al & Phil Charley went down 
 to Sydney by the 9.30 train
