<p>have been on the "Arabia" also.  I have been very unlucky this time with my parcels, as they have all miscarried.<br/>When I was classified a few days ago I was moved up a step to B1 A3:  The next step (B1 A4) is active service &amp; they are sending 500 men per week away from this camp alone; that is to France I mean.<br/>I was very pleased to hear that Nancy did so well at the S.S. Exam. &amp; only hope she is as successful in her Intermediate<br/>I hope you &amp; Mother are keeping well, &amp; will be able to keep clear of colds this winter.  I still have a cold hanging over me but otherwise I am O.K.<br/>They are working us pretty steadily.  We generally do a 12 mile route march a day beside an hour's physical jerks.  These are the things I have set &amp; I would rather do 2 hours fatigue than an hour of these.<br/>Must close now as I have some more mail to write before tomorrow.<br/>With love to you all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
