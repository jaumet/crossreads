<p>25.11.17<br/>13&frac12; seconds from the sound of discharge until the shell arrives!</p>
<p>26.11.17<br/>Still normal, so you may as well hear more of our above.<br/>Behind our trench the big ridge slopes away for 1500 yards to Wulverghem, and on our right rear, is a gully down which runs the Light Railway, and also tons of water, from crater to crater.<br/>It is this gully &amp; railway that our pal the Hun shells at all times:  but especially at night.  More and more guns are being put in quietly.  Our home is only 30 yards from this gully &ndash; not far enough for comfort.<br/>Other features of this landscape are,</p>
<p>Some very dead mules<br/>Some equally dead Huns<br/>Numerous wooden crosses (4 on our parados)<br/>Much stagnant water and twisted wire<br/>A very batterred and broken Tank.</p>
<p>And this is the year of grace 1917!</p>
