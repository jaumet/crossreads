<p>1915<br/>Oct. 14 Thu.<br/>Paid a visit to the Armenian School at Boulac &ndash; The pupils are all taught English, French &amp; Arabic. There is no doubt that English is rapidly taking the place of French in Egypt.<br/>Went in to Cairo to the Australian Intermediate Base. Sharia Shawarbi Pasha to trace the whereabouts of a chap, which I was successful in doing &ndash; Seem to be a kind of detective.<br/>The 5 orderlies who left on the "Kyarra" (1st  load of returning wounded) 4 months ago returned this afternoon by "Ballarat". How about going back to Australia, Bruce, to eat your Christmas Dinner at home?</p>
