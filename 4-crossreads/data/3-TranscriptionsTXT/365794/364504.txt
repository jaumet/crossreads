Friday 13 [12] April 1917 [1918]A letter today from Miss Hunt.  Kind & reports all going well & Wilga overfull.  How homesick do I feel hearing of my little garden & all the details of life there when am laid aside in a lonely land with not one human being to whom I can speak.O.C. visits me & am gazed upon as so much wood or machinery that has to be repaired & sent on duty again.  Wonder where these "men"? came from & how can there be such a gap between our live dear Australians & these creatures in men's clothes with no feeling or mind inside them.
