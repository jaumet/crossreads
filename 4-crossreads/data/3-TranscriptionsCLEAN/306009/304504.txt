Goodness only knows what we are going to do with them all, there being fully 150 occupying their time with drill & marching only. There is nothing doing on the Peninsula & A.M.C. work in Egypt is pretty slack. Our staff at Gezira to-day is :- Officers - 34 Men - 385 Nurses - 75 Natives - 75 = 569 There are only 400 patients in Hospital.
