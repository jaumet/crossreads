<p>Saturday Sept 14. 1918. 1502.<br/>Last night was clear &amp; moonlight consequently it was a good night for the enemies bombing planes to come over. They came in large numbers, and 5 of them were picked up by our numerous searchlights &amp; received a hot fire from numerous machine guns &amp; a few archies. Two planes were brought down in flames. One was very high up &amp; making for back areas he was met with a barrage of shells &amp; machine gun bullets, but persisted in going. He was hit &amp; came down with all his bombs which exploded on striking the ground lighting up the sky in one vivid flash for miles around. The other had dropped his bombs &amp; was making back when hit. Several of the others dropped their bombs &amp; returned home when caught in the barrage. They both fell some distance from our camp. The pilots &amp; observers in the planes must have been burned to a cinder when they fell. Shorthand: I wrote to my wife this evening. Letter 141.<br/>Word came through yesterday that Capt. Toule died of wounds in hospital. He had been wounded 3 times before.</p>
