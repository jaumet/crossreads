wondering what sort of Peace it is, The French have been cutting the hide off him today at Peronne and Verdun. Our chaps all hopping the parapet all over the joint and he is getting rattled. Im feeling better tonight, the R.S.M is drunk (on our rum) and he wants to take 20 to 1 about the Fritz outfit putting their ticket in before Xmas some Xmas, eh. If Im alive on Peace Day Im going to get horribly skifs and break things
