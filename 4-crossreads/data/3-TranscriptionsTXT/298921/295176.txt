July, 1915Saturday 24Found Harry Phillips this morning he is camped about 1 mile from me is very fit, looks well & happy & has been made a Sergeant.I gave him a plan to find my Tent & he's coming up this afternoon; If I can do anything for him I will of course do it & have advised him to fill in a form for a Commission & I will send it on - He has grown into a fine man - very like Harry Arthur Phillips, with blue eyes, & all the characteristics of the Phillips. Tell Marion I will do all I can for him.
