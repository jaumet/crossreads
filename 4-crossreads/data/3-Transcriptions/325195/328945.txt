<p>Nelson and I went over the hill &amp; down to the bottom of the gully in the new saps just dug to put out another 'Phone; The 'phone is an old Mark 2 &amp; perfectly useless,  we tried to get another from B.H.Q. but was told they had no others &amp; we would have to make it do; so we took it out &amp; connected it up &amp; put in half an hour trying to buzz someone up, the buzzer went bung on us &amp; we could make no one hear by talking, so we decided to take it back as it was worse than useless in such an important post: Just as we had disconnected the 'phone  the General (Godley) came along with the Signalling Officer; Godley said Good-day boys how is it going! Nelson said it won't go at all Sir; &amp; then complained about the 'phone that we were given to put in the firing line; Godley agreed it was an important post &amp; told the Sig. Officer to find a good 'phone for this place.</p>
