<p>[Transcriber's note:<br/>On page 16 of the Diary L/Cpl. Gordon lists the places where he served commencing with his arrival in Egypt on 9 December 1914, thence to Gallipoli, back to Egypt and then to Romani.  This diary, however, covers his time in Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula and Palestine.  He describes his duties looking after the horses and saddlery and life in general at this time.  The Section moved frequently from place to place and he names each area in which they camped, or passed through and the battles that ensued.  In early November the Division is involved in an attack on the Turks in their endeavours to press towards Jerusalem.]</p>
