<p>1918<br/>Aug 8<br/>of signalling material there, and I picked up a few things. We ran a line back to Battn HQ. About nightfall Fritz came back and let us know that he was there, by machine gun fire and a few shells. Needless to say he shelled the hospital (his own CCS) and made our Headquarters fell that they had picked a bad place. our hot tucker came up about 8 or 9 pm &ndash; right up to the front line in limbers. It was very much appreciated.<br/>Aug 9<br/>The next morning our barrage opened up again, a lighter one this time and the 2nd Division advanced through us. We stayed where we were, acting as supports. They lost some men through machine gun fire. more prisoners came back. We could not move about so freely now in the day time as Fritz was making things a good  deal warmer. On the night of the 9th we got an extra  issue of rum and some plum pudding.<br/>Aug 10<br/>I had mine about 2am on the morning of the 10th and went for a lie down in one of the bunks of the dugout. I was sorry that I had taken so much but hoped to sleep it</p>
