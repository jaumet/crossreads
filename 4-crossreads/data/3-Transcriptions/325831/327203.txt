<p>We were all very disappointed at the result of the Conscription Referendum, &amp; at first very much ashamed. Lately, however we have heard rumours of a successful recruiting campaign, on which we have built hopes of Australia maintaining her five Divisions through this year.</p>
<p>During the week I went to see the Birmingham Art Gallery, which has a fine collection of modern paintings, many new cartoons by Raemaker [Louis Raemaekers] were also to be seen. I noticed a number that had been drawn primarily for a Dutch audience &ndash; Cartoons which rebuked the Dutch people for their attitude towards War &amp; also their unpreparedness.</p>
<p>Holland appears to have a number of cranks or selfish or un-intelligant people who preach much the same sort od doctrine that the "Anti's" of Australia, used. They must be fairly numerous or surely Reimaker would never have drawn these scathing cartoons against his countrymen &ndash; if they were few. The subject would have been devoid of interest. These Cartoons made me wonder, how many countries, situated as Australia is &ndash; could have enforced Conscription with such a democratic weapon as the Referendum.</p>
<p>While I was at the base at Etaples, I went to hear a lecture on the War, by an Army Chaplain. He re-viewed the whole operations, made many optimistic prophecies, (which have since turned out wrong) &amp; circulated rumours, of super-tanks that would soon be at our disposal, &amp; of wonderful methods which enabled destroyers to trace enemy sub-marines. He then went on &amp; explained the secret of how the Zeppelins are brought down. His story was that every 5th bullet in the attacking plane's machine gun belt is covered with some phosphorous material, &amp; if one of these bullets heated by friction with the air, passed through any gas chamber of the Zeppelin &ndash; well, you can guess what would happen.</p>
