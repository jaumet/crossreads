 The secret of our Empires glory    The women there are at home Greater than the wealth of a nation    God on our knees we invoke Support through great desolation    The women there are at home.

 When you're crouching in a trench, or    out in No man's Land Or in a charge or gas attack, or in a    raid well planned, What makes you set your chin so firm    what makes your courage rise, You see beyond one smiling face, You    see your woman's eyes, Aye, while you strive, she toils &amp; hopes    and fights a harder fight She scans each day the fateful list    &amp; dreads each fateful night. Smile on our Empires women folk    smile on though hearts may ache, Keep smiling smiling smiling till at     Last the dawn doth break.
