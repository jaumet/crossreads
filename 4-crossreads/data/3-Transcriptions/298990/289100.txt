<p>Flessells 4/12/16  Parade 9-12.  Marched as a Battalion to a little trim paddock near the station and carried on with a syllabus of drill and musketry.  Specialists (Lewis gunners bombers and sigs.) were all busy on their special work.  The ground was frozen during the morning but the sun caused it to thaw and become slippery.  Examined some NCOs for their stripes.  Same programme in the afternoon.  Give the men 2 hours off in the middle of the day as it is quite dark by the time the afternoon parade is over.  My batman [indecipherable] is a great character and a great talker to his kin.  At present I understand that he is running a Crown &amp; Anchor School and in one night cleared 1700 francs.  The people of our billet are very nice and kind to us and do all they can.  There is a shortage of coal and kerosene at present.  Most of the women go about bareheaded and wear a knitted shawl over their shoulders.  This is a centre for tapestry work, like Bailleul is for lace and there are looms in many houses.  Nearer the firing line the people are poorer and many houses depend for their daily bread on what the soldiers leave and what they can pick up.  As we expect a batch of reinforcements tonight, made arrangements for a hot drink to be ready for them and some blankets made available.  Have been so busy the last few days and the days are so short that I have not been able to find time for a look round the village.  Must try and have a walk in the wood tomorrow somehow.</p>
