<p>3rd September (Sunday)</p>
<p>No work.  Saw a magnificent sight in the air &ndash; 25 of our planes were performing and Fritz was firing frantically at them.  Went into Estaires again this evening.</p>
<p>4th September (Monday)</p>
<p>A cold day.  Laying flooring on job.  Orders have been sent to us requesting the return of the pocket patches which we have previously had sewn inside our tunics.  Another satchel is being issued instead to carry the second gas helmet.</p>
<p>5th September (Tuesday)</p>
<p>Raining all day and the guns are still hammering away.  They seem to take advantage of the rain.  Still on flooring.</p>
