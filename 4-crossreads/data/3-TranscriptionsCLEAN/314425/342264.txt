  
 the German bayonet that I had left behind and came back after tea. The Daily Mail today as well as the French papers announce the acceptance by the German Government of all President Wilson's 14 points & the subsequent 4 points, which amounts to unconditional surrender. There is great jubilation everywhere when the papers came along at midday today. Civilians and soldiers were shaking hands & all were in great glee. "Le Guerre finished" 
 Monday Oct 14 1918. 1532. Cold & frosty this morning. I was as cold as a frog when I got out of bed this morning. As I had a sore throat last night & this morning I paraded sick & got some tablets and light duties. After dinner we were all paraded to Hallencourt for hot baths. This evening I got some sulphur ointment from the [indecipherable] and past to rub in for the scarvey. I have had a slight attack of scabies for some time & it is very hard to get rid off.
