 Dec.28th We were chased off the deck at 3.A.M. this morning by a shower of rain but it cleared up later & was a fairly fine day, my cold eases off towards evening. Read 'The Wilderness' Joseph Hocking - In the evening we played 500. 
 Dec.29th It was very showery today, we had physical jerks all the morning. Sports were held in afternoon & evening, the record for skipping was 3380 - We had a front seat for the boxing in the evening. 
 Dec.30th A beautiful warm day we were on fatigue preparing for the sports which were held in the afternoon, & we had a front seat again in the evening for the boxing. 
 Dec.31st Sunday again & another beautiful day with a shower or two at intervals. We are mostly wearing shorts & singlets & going bare-foot. I spent the day on the deck in the sun reading & sleeping. I read "Happy Valley'  B.M. Crocker, very pretty yarn. Saw one of the most beautiful sun-sets I have ever seen & watched it intently for over an hour - & the night was wonderful - so ends the year 1916.
