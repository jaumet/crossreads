<p>May 30th<br/>12 miles, thro pass evidence of Russians being massacred in that we passed three motor vans overturned on the road.  Supposed to be dangerous country, so far so good.  Plenty of food.  A wagon pulled into the village this evening with 4 horses abreast &amp; outfits like the Russian conveyances one sees on pictures.  Feeling pretty fit.</p>
<p>May 31st<br/>Camped at a village called Abba Garm, the native for boiling water.  It is really a wonderful place.  The road leads thro a big valley with the village on the right of the road.  At the further end is a Russian post used in former days as a toll station.  Nearby a huge rock covering about a quarter of an acre juts</p>
