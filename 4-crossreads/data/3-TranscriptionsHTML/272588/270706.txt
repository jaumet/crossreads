<p>Tuesday 14 May<br/>Beautiful day, &amp; Aeroplane activity has been great to-day &amp; to-night.<br/>Fritz has been shelling off &amp; on to-day &amp; to-night but so far no casualties have resulted. We have spent the day in trying to make our place fairly bomb proof.</p>
<p>Wednesday 15 May<br/>Glorious day &amp; things have been very quiet except for desultory shelling round about.<br/>We are still living very well indeed. A very big gas attack is to eventuate shortly here, about 1200 projectors to be sent over. Since in the 8th Battn. has had no stretcher case at all.</p>
