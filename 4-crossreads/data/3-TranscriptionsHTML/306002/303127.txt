<p>1.5.15<br/>Sat. 1st.  My name is in orders this morning as Corporal.  We have been getting great reports of the doings of the boys at the Dardanelles, dismounted parade &amp; were cleaning gear &amp; watering the horse lines.  After dinner we had nothing to do, but lay about the tent.  Boxing with Conway after tea, &amp; put the night in writing.  To-day was fairly hot.</p>
<p>I believe more wounded have arrived from the Dardanelles.</p>
