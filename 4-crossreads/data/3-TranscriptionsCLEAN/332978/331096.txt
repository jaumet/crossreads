 June 30th Good sleep. [Double-ended arrow links back to end of previous entry:] 12 months yesterday since I was first wounded. Left France for England also 12 months today. 
 Good meals. 
 To medico again. Doctor examined my foot & said that they intended to perform an operation to remove some skin from both sides of my ankle to place over the ankle bone, so as to eliminate some of its sensitiveness when I am able to wear a boot, as the boot will rub against it. But as I have not sufficient skin around my ankle the operation cannot be performed. He said that I will remain here until my foot is right, & in answer to some of my questions he said that my foot would not be the same as before inasmuch that it will be a little stiff. So I expect I will have a little limp. 
 Leickler, Dickson & I went for a walk in the Garden - first time I have been outside since being here. It is glorious down there  under  in the shade of the trees. Feeling very well. Visited Chandler. Played Bridge & Patience.
