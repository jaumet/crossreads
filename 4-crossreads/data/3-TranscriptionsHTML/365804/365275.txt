<p>To the 3rd Div.Signallers, so I gave him a letter to his O.C. stating his innumerable qualifications and excellent qualities. He should have a good chance of getting in provided he gets a fair show.</p>
<p>I saw Mel in London a few weeks ago. He was as usual fed up with things in general but looking very well for all that. He wrote me the other day from Rugby where he is [indecipherable]  &ndash; still very blue, but he hasn't had a chance of making any friends yet.</p>
<p>Mike O'Reilly came and spoke to me the other day. He is In the 19th and expects to get back to France in a few days. I asked him round to my room and we spoke of wars, food, newpapers etc. till the lights went out when we retired to bed. He has a standing invitation to call round whenever he feels so inclined.</p>
<p>I have given up all hope of receiving any more letters for a few months, as it will take that time for the postal authorities to find out where I am.</p>
<p>Give my love to father and Dorothy &ndash; also Catherine.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Keith.</p>
