<p>Arrived there the C.O. was called to a conference at Bde Hqrs.</p>
<p>2.30 p.m.  The C.O. returned with the news that we are to attempt the crossing after all tonight.</p>
<p>5.30 p.m.  Attack cancelled again.  Patrols only have been ordered to establish <strike>ed</strike> themselves on the opposite bank.  The difficulty lies in the marshes which exist for a considerable distance on the other side of the river.  We moved forward about 1000 yards along the trench about dusk.</p>
<p>Mr. Gannon the Intelligence Officer of this Bn. whilst reconnoitring along the trench was severely wounded by a gas shell.  The enemy shelled this area fiercely with H.E. and Gas Shells about this time.</p>
