I am keeping in good health & strength & trust you are all well at home. Any amount of work in hand to keep us going, & last few weeks writing of any sort has been impossible other than Field Service cards. Haven't seen anything of Rid for 4 or 5 weeks now but Wal said this afternoon he had seen him recently & that he was keeping well. Must close now with love to all at home Your loving son, Leo.
