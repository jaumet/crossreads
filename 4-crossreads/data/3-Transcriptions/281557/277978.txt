<p>God that made our Fathers strong<br/>Lead us when the dangers throng<br/>God that made our mothrs pure<br/>Make us steadfast to endure<br/>On the waves or tent or field<br/>Be our sword and battle shield<br/>Hail our Empire spreading far<br/>Great in peace and dread in war<br/>Banner brave as in the past<br/>Float on fort and tower and mast<br/>Let thy blazon flutter free<br/>South and North and every sea<br/>Here thy sons shall guard the gates<br/>of thy southward shores and straits<br/>On wide ocean we shall meet<br/>One unsundered flag and fleet<br/>And the pathway of the sea <br/>Prove our broadening destiny<br/>Oh for peace or battle pray<br/>Nelson's signal points the way<br/>Duty's claim and country's call<br/>Shall be our concience for us all<br/>Set that signal high and then<br/>"Forward" Quit yourselves like men.<br/>                          <br/>                 Refrain</p>
<p>God that watest through the day<br/>Gurad each seaward coast and bay<br/>God in loves unsleeping might<br/>Keep our homes through darkest night</p>
