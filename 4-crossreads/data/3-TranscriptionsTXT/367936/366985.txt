 Monday 29 May 1916 Land on both sides all day.  Very rough mountainous sandy country.  Fearfully sharp peaks.  Passed Mt. Sini [Sinai]. Saw where troops landed near &hellip; Country very pretty at sunset stretching away peak after peak.  Pity this country is not in Australia.  Govt. would settle Returned Soldiers on it.  Water fight in evening.
