We got up to 2,500 feet &amp; he kept her at that as he had a "new-chum" on board.  The three registerings now were counter-rev. 1950, speed, hovering between 55 &amp; 60, altimometer 2500 ft   "Banking" i.e. turning sharply to either right or left felt very funny at first as the turn is done at an angle of 45&deg;   I realized, then, the necessity of the broad strap across my body.  Machines were passing &amp; repassing us constantly some above us &amp; some below.  Of course conversation was out of the question as the roar of the engine just behind us was deafening.  Anyway I was too busy with my eyes to talk.  Other instruments just in front of me included a compass &amp; a spirit level.  We stayed up for 35 minutes then turned her nose for home.  It took my unaccustomed eye a long time to pick up the aerodrome although I knew we were steering straight for it.  At last like a tiny doll's house I distinguished the hangars.  The landing ground, a paddock of roughly 640 acres, looked like a patch 2 feet square   Then came the sensation of dropping from 2000 to 500 feet.  Then the ground rushed up to meet us &amp; we landed at a speed of 50 m.p.h. as lightly as a bird- in fact I was watching for the wheels of the undercarriage to touch the ground, otherwise I wouldn't have known we were on terra-firma, or next door to it.  Quickly we reduced speed</p>
