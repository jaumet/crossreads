<p>Bulford<br/>16.3.17<br/>Dear George,<br/>I was very glad when I learned that Young Tom Porman is so far alive &amp; well although a Prisoner in Germany.  Let us hope that He has got in with some decent Germans, &amp; there are decent ones, &amp; that He will be returned to us all safe &amp; Sound apres la Guerre.  I don't think I'll write to Him just now.  I may later on.  Who the blazes put you on Scratch in the 100 yds H'cap.  I could have understood in the &frac12; Mile but not the other.  It is to be hoped that the H'capper will wake up &amp; put You up on about 5 or 6 in the sprint race.  Fitz is a great powerful runner.  He aught to give You a few Yards I think, but if You train well, You aught to make a go of it.  Don't box without bandages on Your hands &amp; wrists.  You will only break all the small bones in Your hands &amp; wrists &amp; they will become like mine, as weak as a childs.  Dave Ellis &amp; I went to the Theatre last night.  We go regularly once a week &amp; we see some bonzer shows.  Bulford has a bad name but we have a Theatre, &amp; a picture show &amp; vaudeville, &amp; about 6 or 8 shops where we can purchase almost anything &amp; then Y.M.C.A. &amp; Salvation &amp; Church army Huts too.  The whole of our Unit has been classified to-day for Field Work.  I was too busy to go over</p>
