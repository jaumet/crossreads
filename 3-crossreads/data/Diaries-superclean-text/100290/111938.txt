Monday
First news this morning is that 37 have been picked to go forward up the line. Tony Bob omitted self chosen. Two former put in names to go. Staff Smith dies not want to let any of us go. Consents ultimately. We had a soft easy job on the wards could retain it if desired, but we decided it was our duty to go forward. Rest of day taken up preparing for departure in morning.
