out of the "hangar" again and renewed our acquaintance with the trenches
Today Friday April 5th 1918, Fritz opened up with a terrible bombardment, he gave support, front lines and all back areas particular hell! He had a fine natural screen, viz a heavy fog to help him. One of our Companies (D) had over 60 casualties (12 killed). A shell landed right onto the hangar, they happened to be resting within. It sadly depleted D Coy
On (5/3/18) we left the trenches and made our way towards the line. We rested in a terrible muddy trench till the early morning of the 6/3/18.
The 50th Battalion moved up to the support lines not far from Beurre. We stayed here till 7 that night (6/3/18) Fritz put over a strong barrage late in the afternoon. I had some close calls, that was all!
We left the support lines that night in a drenching rain.
