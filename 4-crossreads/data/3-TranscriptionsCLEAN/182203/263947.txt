My dear Mother & Sisters, Received Belle's No 2 letter & very glad indeed, also Bessie Froomes nice little note, thank her for me & tell her I shall send her a post card as soon as I can. We were in port but not allowed any "Shore Leave", so contented ourselves with watching the soldiers embarking &  the crowd seeing their friends off. We really had good fun - the remarks & actions of some of the crowd was most amusing. Dorothy Newton is a hard case & sees the funny side of human nature. There has been some trouble with the Stewards - they went on Strike but got their way, so went back to work. Then the firemen were behaving disgracefully, ever so many of them returned to the ship very much the worse for drink. Some were put off, then the others have gone on Strike, so suppose they will have some trouble fixing them up. We are all very well & expect to have calm weather. We have not spent much money so far
