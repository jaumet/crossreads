<p>Friday 7 September</p>
<p>villages.  Fights between the Portuguese &amp; Australian troops are frequent.  Some have been killed.  These Portuguese troops are hated by everybody.  They are small vicious little good-for-nothings and are quick to flash a knife, but the Anzac knows how to deal with them.<br/>St. Omer is a nice place over-run by these W.A.A.C. girls from Eng.  (The Womens Army Aux. Corps.)  Aire is also a nice place.  The fruit in the orchard surrounding our Orderly Room Tent is now ripe &amp; of course we get a good share, though only by pinching it at great risk.<br/>My bike is now in the Workshops at Morbecque being overhauled.</p>
