Wednesday 2 August 1916Same weather. After breakfast moved down to Bde. H.Q., my new billet being merely a bare room without a stick of furniture, & not too clean at that. Getting things straight generally during the morning : met Cousin Ray, now Transport Corporal to the Bde., who made himself known to me. In the afternoon rode round on a bike to see Divl. Gas Officer, & on the way back met Rid who is quartered in St. Leger, the next town but one, & was looking for me. Delighted to see him & have a yarn, & afterwards rode out with him to their bivouac, returning in time for dinner at night.
