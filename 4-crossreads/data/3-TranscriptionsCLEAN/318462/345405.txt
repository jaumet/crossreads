 Saturday 20/10/17 A lovely morning like spring but every where mud from yesterdays storm the Artillery duel lasted all night & was the greatest yet since we came here. deferred Pay 34.13-0. - 26/7. Yesterdays storm was a corker at 1-30 it was as dark as at 5 oclock then the lightening & thunder got to work the thunder drowned the roar of the guns & between them kicked up hell, first came a deluge of rain then Hail. The hail fell so thick that you could pick it up in hands full an hour afterwards. The ground had just begun to dry up but now it's all a mud hole & so it goes on every day. Kept fine all day. expect the Taubes over to night. Our Boys coming out tomorrow.
