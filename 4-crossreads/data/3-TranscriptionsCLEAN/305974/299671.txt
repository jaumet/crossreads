We are billetted in the third storey of a storage shed of a french flour mill.  The mill is wholly worked by waterwheels & is still working.  My cold is still keeping very bad.  Things here are very quiet.  Took very bad in evening & admitted to Hospital.  Temp 102 
 8 Friday There are a good few sick here, & pretty near as soon as they are cleared to the C.C.S. batches of others come in.  The place is full all the time.  The general complaint is influenza, but patients with influenza are not now sent away.  I have the general complaint every bone in my body is aching, altogether feel very sick. 
 9 Saturday We get fairly good attention here.  A good few  of th  fellows come every now & again to see me, including fellows out of the 13th Batt.  I put in a terrible night & had to be given morphia to deaden the pain in my back.  The hospital is on the base of the flour mill. 
 10 Sunday We are having very wet weather here now, it rains every day. Still keeping very crook.
