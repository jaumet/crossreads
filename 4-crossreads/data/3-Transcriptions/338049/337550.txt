<p>Friday 6 Dec.<br/>Up at 7 &amp; after breakfast down to the wharf. In spite of great scheming could not travel on morning boat.</p>
<p>So knocked about the town instead. After dinner visited the wharf &amp; finally got aboard &amp; said goodbye to France. Arrived Folkstone &amp; then London all right. Dug up Will, &amp; Bert &amp; put the night up with him.</p>
