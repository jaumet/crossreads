There is little more news to tell you but before I close I had better tell you that the allotment has been increased from 3/- to 5/- from the 30th 8th. 18.   You see I now have the two bars, and so draw extra, however I did not want it all so increased the allot.mt and should I want extra for furlough etc will send across.   I am drawing 3/6 per day so I think will be pretty right as so far the 2/- has kept me going now I must ring off with Love to all Relations and a Special Share for Yourself and Bett from your Loving Son Chas.
