<p>clean ends first, don't make it too rough I said as I walked off.<br/>4th.   Anniversary of our declaring war today &amp; still the ends seems very little nearer.<br/>This morning I went down to where Lens girl is stopping, for the 3 of us were going for a stroll, it was a nice morning &amp; we wandered about till 4 oclock then we went up to the Mess, I had my dinner here &amp; then went on to our Camp, &amp; in the evening Lindsay &amp; I went down to Warminster here we met Starkey &amp; the 3 of us set out for Freshwater, &amp; after a walk round the lake we went home &amp; so ended a big day walking for we must have covered a good 20 miles for the day.<br/>5th.   Looks very much like more rain today for it is very hot &amp; overcast</p>
