C. easily accounted for the second so things so far are equal.
I am sitting writing all this tonight in a noisy crowded little estaminet I have 20 men on piquet have split them into 4 parties, as things are very quiet on the whole I have told them all to take up their Hqrs in some little estaminet till just on closing time, when we will all meet at a certain place proceed to clear the estaminets which have to be emptied at 8 oclock this of course just suits all hands they are enjoying themselves. 
At present you can scarce hear yourself talking the little "boozer" is chock full of Tommies Australians, beer, wine, mullager" grenadine is circulating freely opening all their mouths, as for smoke why you can scarce see to the end of the little room, every now again some one strikes up some old tunes on the piano there is a violin to help, at present they are playing everyone is singing "If you were the only girl in the world"
