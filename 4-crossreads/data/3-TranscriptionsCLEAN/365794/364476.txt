  
 Friday 15th March 1917 [1918] S. Piele's day of Inspection morning & Matron & Colonel Young are around 11 a.m. sharp before we are really ready in fact but - marleesh [maleesh - never mind] - Matron looks at me with reproach but I have got tired of "bed worship" of this place so say nothing of feeling that to spend our days worrying over beds is so trifling compared to the strain under which my dear people are living & yet there is nothing to be done.
