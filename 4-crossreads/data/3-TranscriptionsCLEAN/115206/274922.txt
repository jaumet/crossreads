 At Sea. H.S."Karoola." Weather very wet but brighter in the afternoon. Commenced a long letter home which I'm hoping will arrive before I do. "She" did her 347 miles today which means that we have now 1092  miles to go before we reach Port Said. I suppose we shall have Xmas Day in or not far from Suez. Played Auction until I felt too bad to do so. Had a relapse of fever which I quite expected.
