 A blazing sun shining down on us all day. We cross the equator at 2 p.m.  Bath has been erected on board in anticipation of Neptune's visit. He & his retinue came aboard at 3.30. & constituted a court. The O C & all the officers were haled before him & sentenced to various penalties all included the orthodox shave & ducking. Fun was fast & furious. Makes up were clever & original. Charges were smart & witty. Queen. Anti-swearing League. Ever hungry. Binoculars. Equator line. Pills. Sounding hammer. Soft soap & lead: yard broom & whitewash brush. Chief officer's way to end[?] the fun.
