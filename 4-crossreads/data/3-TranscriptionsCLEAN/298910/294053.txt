Got a very rude awakening at 2.30 am & told to be at our posts at 6 am. Some 50 Bearers moved out to various Posts - Myself - Deshon - Woods & Longden, went to Wye Farm - near Bois Greniers  Our part of the line had to give some sort of a demonstration, while something big was going on at Armertiers - At 11 am, we got word that the stunt was not coming of as arranged, we had to stay at our posts till 1.30 pm & were then told to get back to Nouveau Monde, I never said a word after carrying stretchers - dressing, sick & tucker for 3 miles - Drizzling & rain all day.
20th  Monday
Very nice day. Got orders to go out & relieve bearers at Foray House - Here myself - Page, Bowden & Gurner found a very [indecipherable][indecipherable] out, got 3 cases during the night - very heavy artillery firing both sides - 30th strafed Fritz with bombs for an hour - Plenty of shells coming very freely around our dug out, but beyond stopping our freedom, done no harm.
