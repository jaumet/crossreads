<p>from Tare and as it is more useful and a better article I have transfered the note books to it from the new one. The rest of it may prove useful to Douglas if he doesn't mind my name appearing on it. The Drv. E Sullivan, is a mistake. The donor laboured under the impression that all the A.M.C. were drivers.<br/>It is bitterly cold here now. We have a fine fire in our room and it helps to keep things cosy but still we feel the cold considerably. Those mittens Kit sent are a real God send. Did she knit them herself? The arrangement to permit of the fingers being slipped out is very cute.<br/>I pity Kit if she is to type all my letters as I intend to take your tip and write down things as they occur. Sometimes I have quite a fund of interesting news but by the time I come to writing a letter it all seems stale and I forget what I have already told in the previous letter.</p>
<p>That episode of the lady at the University is certainly very amusing. I can just picture Douglas finishing her off with his message.<br/>Give my love to Aunt Kate and Uncle Vesey. I know Kate is always with me in her prayers and I feel more than grateful to her. She certainly hit the mark in her dream about the voyage but since then I have picked up wonder-</p>
