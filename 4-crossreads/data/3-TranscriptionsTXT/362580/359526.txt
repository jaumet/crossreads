celebrated in the Colonel's Office.  Only we two woman, The Col. & about three other men.
I have spent most of my time in the Officers Hospital to-day - have seven now, so one of us will have to be there always.
The was an Evening Service in our dining room at 7.30 p.m. and quite a number were there.  Had a little hand organ - I heard the end of the service, while at our dinner in another room.  Nearly all our Medical Officers were there & it sound so nice to here all the men's voices - some of the Orderlies were there too - I should think there were some fine voices amongst them.
We are expecting the other sisters on Tuesday - hope they come.  I was late for dinner this evening.  It is a rush to get done at times.  The minister (Padre) is a great old chap & seems to be very popular.  Must stop now am deadly sleepy.  Fondest love & kisses to you all.  Hope to get a letter from home in a few days.
From your loving sister,Edith
