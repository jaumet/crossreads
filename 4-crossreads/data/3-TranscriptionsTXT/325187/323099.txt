(Dr Arnold has married a Nurse out here don't know her.  I told you Ralph has a Commission.) omit  I s'pose a man will be able to earn some daily bread when this is all over, all I want is clean shirts, clean linen, plenty of flowers &amp; no flies, that's how I feel tonight; as I'm back under Canvas, &amp; the dust is very bad, whenever the horses go to water, it fills the ears, eyes, nostrils, tucker blankets &amp; everything.
