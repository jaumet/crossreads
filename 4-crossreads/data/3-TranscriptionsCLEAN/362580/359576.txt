  
 stayed in to write to you.  We are meeting Sisters Ross & Weiss in Alexandria this afternoon.  It is simply perfect here, so cool & fresh. 
 Dorothy brought a few letters for me from The Palace - one from Fred from the trenches & he is very well - cannot give any news - also another from a friend from the front.  A Penzance Paper from Mrs Barrie's sister.  So you see my friends are awfully good to me. 
 Mr C. is ringing up to-day to see what arrangements I can make to go out with him.  He is fearfully busy, it is a wonderful place, the amount of letters & parcels that go through would astonish you. 
 My friend (the officer) left this morning for the front.  Oh, it is sad to think such grand boys are going to such a dangerous place.  Hope it will soon end.  Little Eddy's letter was lovely & he has a very good idea of writing & drawing. 
 Fondest love & kisses to you all. 
 From Your loving sister Edith.
