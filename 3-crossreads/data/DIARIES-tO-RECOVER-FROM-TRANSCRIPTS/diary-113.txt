Cold barren looking place. All of town we saw resembled only a cantonment of very simple [indecipherable].From the sea the "city" resembles a cockroach under the heel of a boot.

[Sketch]
Sketch of Freetown where we spent a few [indecipherable] days. Population about 80,000 of whom perhaps 80 are white. Niggers houses quite [indecipherable] but quaint & clean. A city of palms, smells & disease

Monday 4th Mch (Previous note’s not available being in kitbag)
Notified to be ready to march at a moment’s notice "Stand up by" all day with kit etc. Saw four of the ships leave about 3.30 p.m. We have an eagle’s view of proceedings – or rather we share the "goods" with a few thousand vultures. Went monkey hunting (We call it "Lion chasing") this afternoon. Saw one large ape at fairly close quarters but he only cursed us and walked into the vines backwards. Boys killed young green snake, nasty little brute with fangs like a cat’s. On Guard at 4 pm. All night job. Promises to be very funny.
5th Very funny guard all night. Spent my shifts with the Jamaicans, sampled some of their national and enjoyed a feed of canned tongue & chicken. Reveille at 5 am. Advance Guard 6 a.m. We headed main column & marched down about 9 a.m. to town. Drew our hammocks, & baggage from Admiralty store & carried same on to lighters. Following was my load with which I had to climb on & off lighter. Two kit bags, Equipment with pack filled, Hammock, & blankets, one oil sheet, Thermo, abt. 96 % humidity. Some load to carry up a swinging ladder, especially so if you are also smuggling sundry ripe fruit & & breakables that require careful handling & have a bottle of old Spanish Tosara down the leg of your pants. We found the Tosara in the store. It resembles sherry but is wonderful in its flavour & [indecipherable]
Shown our new quarters. The Deck board says L deck Messing 236. Sleeping 233. There
are 333 of us, we fill the space (not long before we discovered that an old freezing chamber had been prepared for our reception & christened L Deck) Enough regulations on this boat to sooner or later [indecipherable] individual of a regiment of angels


[Page 8]
5th Port L our old ark, left yesterday she deserves to get through, will try & get to dock somewhere & repair. All sorry as we’ve got a kindly feeling for the old ship & consider her lucky. She sure broke down, but had she not done so it is considered almost certain that the trap would have closed in on her. Also had she not finished up on the Banks, we would not have spent these good days on the mountain. Thus is she a lucky ship. Drill on the new boat pretty stiff – we’re not a damn bit like buccaneers now, by George. 
6th Getting settled in new quarters – a process similar to that to be seen in any big store. No pay for 18 days – all very broke. It hurts not to have the cash to get a few little souvenirs when we hit a place like this. The officer who has undertaken the doubtful task of re-organising & educating us Lincolnites has started battling with the Powers to get us a few bob, & expects to pay soon. He is a very decent chap. Lt. Bruce of the Aus. Engrs., when we came down the mountain, he says, his heart ‘was stirred with pity for us’ we looked about to the best imitation of troops ‘returning from a hard hammering in the trenches’ that he’s ever seen outside of France. All sorts of rumors on the ship but one does not believe everything these days unless it comes down officially.
7th
No indication of departure. Rations reduced slightly. Warnings issued against waste of any food!


[Page 9]
8th Had as easy a day as is pos without a smoke. War-dogs went out this evening, cleared [indecipherable]
9th Addition to family. Lad left behind by – put in our mess &, seeing our smokeless state, sparred up 1/- per man for the wherewithal. We regard him as a real hero. The man that lent 21/- to the machine gunners takes a risk. War dogs back still looking dozzy. Brought another ornament for the harbour – a Greek that left ahead of them yesterday, & [indecipherable] back still ahead. She wont leave again, as she’s well fenced in. A lot of news handed down to day, not very hopeful. 
Signals outside. We have just moved further into the Estuary to an anchorage closer to the mountain.
10th Sunday Out at 6am. to see the ‘trippers’ come back. Two out of the four that sailed on the 4th have got in again. The other two, with our own boys aboard, are not sighted & we’re speculating – 10.30. Three more arrivals, a chow, an oil tank & a mail boat. Plenty smoke outside war dogs very active. Church parade at 11 very significant Service – the service before action, all about over confidence, etc & preparedness for eternity – very cheerful man, our sky pilot.


[Page 10]
Rumors lead us to place tin fish second on the list of things to be considered unhealthy
12 Two more arrivals. A big auxiliary & store ship. Put in afternoon as usual, playing five hundred – Got two slams in succession for the first time since I’ve played the game.
4pm. Big Frenchman, Montcalm class, arrived. Big flag – could roof house with it!. Japs just visible outside, lying to. We have hopes of departure. Rumours that we run tomorrow
11th 
Nothing doing. Pay 9/-. One shilling held against loss of cutlery when disembarking. Big French Auxiliary just in. Short of stores – other ships in port all depend on us for food – particularly vegetables. Water run short & ship unable to take on sufficient fresh to keep up supplies. Condensed water here awful.
12th 
Officially informed of the whys & wherefores of our stay here. We’re here because we cant get out! We wont get out for days possibly weeks. We’re going on short rations. We not going to wash in fresh water any more, any more.


[Page 11]
We going to be good little boys & do what daddy says – if he wants us to coal ship, transfer cargo, launch boats, stoke fires or swim ashore & duck for the tall timber on the other side the ramp – well we’re to do it & say nixsy. Fact is we’ve been poking borak at Fritz for being bottled up, blockaded etc . Now Fritz has got it on us good & strong & its us to sit back & [indecipherable] low.
There are this evening, just 20 ships in. There is a 35 knot beauty outside & we dont want to see her.
13th / [indecipherable] Another big Frenchman, much stained & battered, just in. She looks bad – very sick.
Other ships in offing.
1.30. There seems to be a sort of fleet arriving. One more of the boats that left on the 4th ran in at dinner time. She was followed by a castle boat (well filled) a mail boat and a Britisher. The latter is some ship & should be equal to any Deutcher afloat.– a Great cruiser of the latest, light but mighty dangerous looking.
Other arrivals during afternoon & evening – a Shire boat, two Cays Steamers and a big ship of the Marathon type. Three small colliers brought the total of our harbor ornaments to 31.

The Lincolnaise
Oh we’ll never see the Exford any more
and we’ll never see the Carlton any more
For they’ve wrecked us on the mud
Far away from any port
And we cant go navigating any more
Then old Admiral Fremantle did he roar?
did he roar?
And he sent us off in flat-boats to the shore
Where the – niggers smiled
As in sadness we defiled
With our baggage to the Admiralty shore
We were weary & full rotten to the core
To the core!
On the mountain road a million feet or more?]
Up above the - town –
where the - - brown
Monkeys madly through the treetops from us tore
With the monkeys & the niggers of the shore
by the shore –
Eating bully beef & biscuit & paw paw - 
Oh! tell mother I’ll be there
Where they never drink or swear – 
For we’ll never see Australia 
Anymore! 
Sierra Leone [indecipherable] 
4/12/16
13th One, a navy transport went at tea-time & was saluted by all the French ships in the lines. There’s much conjecture as to her mission; about 15 to 20 thousand pairs of eyes watched her with the same thought:
Where the deuce is the tub going to – unescorted & unarmed?


[Page 13]
The ways of the navy seem strange. Another bulletin published to-day – all about Germany’s politicians & Holbeig’s ramblings in particular. We take such things with salt and anyway it does not let us out or increase the rations. Spuds finished today, but luckily there’s plenty rice & I like it better than spuds. Some of us are enjoying the whole stunt & get a lot of fun out of the wild yams that come out of the mud. But its bad for the majority of the boys – the sick parades are coming very heavy & those not sick are looking very washed out. Three of ours who were chucky as niggers this morning are out to it this evening. There is so much moisture in the air that the least chill is dangerous. – the first pneumo death occurred night before last – a fireman. Met [indecipherable] Jamieson tonight on this boat. Funny how things go – when Jaken J stayed behind at Addison road none of us expected to see much of him again. However here he is - & he’ll see the war not a moment later than we will, poor cow & over 20,000 troops held up here.

Steaming WNW at dusk. Sea like a mirror. Parade 6.30 – 7am. 9.30 -11 am (lecture Lt Bruce on field engineering, bombs & grenades very interesting – wonder why we are not taught more about other arms & explosive which we must use the little pea shooter?
Afternoon parade 3 to 4p.m. a very imposing affair.- All hands stripped & standing round – fighting one another – under the salt water faucett. Our canteen can only sell lemonade’ cigarettes & tinned fish. Tobacco & matches are ‘non est.’ Also, all fresh water being barred except a small quantity for drinking only, it has now become a crime to shave. All from Commandant down go unshaven & look pretty rough. This is the result of orders issued on day of departure.

[Page 16]
16th Steaming N.W. Many sick aboard mostly suffering from "low proli" – a funny complaint; they get very weak, suffer from pains in the head, particularly about the eyes & often collapse. In the latter case they go the Hospital trip up three ladders feet first to return looking as if they wished they didn’t. Some of them can do nothing but hang on to their heads as tho afraid of losing them.
To add to their tribulation, we are under orders to go nowhere in the ship without a life belt. This applies to all on the ship. We must parade with our belts, drill with them, take them to the mess table & the shower bath , and finally use them as a pillow at night. There’s one ship in this squadron that annoys us. She ought to get the knock. Every couple of hours she gets up a big pressure in her boilers & not being allowed to get ahead, she runs rings round the other ships and does snaky turns in & out of the line. Occasionally she lags behind for the pleasure of catching up again passing round the head of the lines & falling astern on the opposite side. The exhibition of so much pace naturally gets on our goat, & then we dont like to see the flying fish disturbed so much.


[Page 17]
[Sketch at side of entries for Dates 17th and 18th]
17th Still N.W. cloudy, long slight roll from N, beginning to chop at mid-day. Breezy. Getting cooler. Very slow travelling warship starboard (astern) at reveille. Detailed for submarine guard. Had hair cut other day – have the inevitable cold.
18th Guard . Have good position broad deck immediately with Bridge. Heavy roll. Good view of our little fleet- its very funny to see how some of the ships behave. Pt. Melbourne, right ahead, side steps each swell like a giant crab; sometimes she actually jumps about 25 to 30 yds & looks as if she is trying to steam sideways. 
19th Saw a few fine [indecipherable] & a splendid display of phosphorescence last night but no Subs. Had the pleasure of reporting the [indecipherable] twice – there’s something fishy about that ship. Ever since leaving Freetown she has shown a bright light each night Escort, I believe, roared at her twice but last night same thing occurred. The light showed at intervals from different parts of the ship; usually a porthole, all night. Think there’s some swine there trying to put the show away. OC came to look this morning & there’s going to be hells delight for some of her people.
Spent the day malingering up under the gun platform. Did not seem worth while to parade. Auction sale of dead men’s property. – I


[Page 18]
did not buy anything.
20th. Fine bright day. Course NW by N, N, NE & E at 5.30. Am told on good authority that our detour has taken us well over 1000 M west of the trade route & consequently we wont get to old Blitie before 27 or 28 Inst.
21st ENE, heavy swell running. This is our 63rd day out from Melbourne. We are all reckoning on a fine pay after landing. £4/6/- owing me to date. Medical experiment in progress – Several down up to date. Our turn to-morrow. have a cold but don’t expect any trouble with the M.O. as regards fitness. Got my notes jotted down on old Lincoln & at Mt Aureol & am entering them here in case the other papers go astray. We have difficulty this way as one cant always carry ones things about in onship rig, & the spirit of comradeship – the Esprit de corps – of our army is so fine that nothing is safe from the sneak thief and the casual pilferer. While on this tack we wonder would people ever give to war funds if they could see the misuse & scoundrelism that goes on. One of our chaps bought a box of chocolates from stores today


[Page 19]
inside was a note from the lady donor & an address. He paid 1/6 for this lot – it was only intended for some wounded man in hospital. Several cases of [indecipherable] goods – pyjamas, dressing gowns, hospital slippers & socks, white shirts, rugs, washers & towels were broken up to-day & handed out to able bodied men who fancied them. It was in no way a case of need – just that the goods were handy & the men had recently been paid. Thus, while the people responsible could make good fellows of themselves by giving away the unwanted stuff they could also grow richer by charging small sums for the most useful articles
Incidentally the canteen being short of everything, prices for such things as are yet in stock have been raised about 200 % . We ask where does all this cash go to?. A soldier can buy anything but his discharge – at a price, but he often wonders who makes the profit. Hell will be overcrowded with Military administrators & charity Committees!
Our advice to the women who want to help the soldiers: Dont waste your time & money working to make riches for a lot of rogues – send what you want to send direct to those you know or those someone else knows & will tell you of. Preferably, let your donations be in cash, registered in the post.

Examination. Xmas orders issued – no singing, lights etc. Parade & Drill Xmas Day – Compulsory Church Sunday. Canteen closing 23rd for a good.
"Plum" duff for dinner today, we’ve been amusing ourselves making little tombstones, discs etc with slices of it. It’s quite solid & will dry up into a semblance of hard, grey soap or compo. Some of the lads have inscribed pieces of it, carved them in various shapes & are posting them home in cigarette boxes. Rougher weather & much cold rain.
23rd
Heavy rain squalls
Last night the the P Melb went missing but came back to the fold this morning under protection of a cruiser. Still bleak & watery. This northward section of the voyage is worse than warfare itself – under troopship conditions
24th Church parade this morning. Steaming west slowly all last night- now making slow progress N.E once more. Weather clearer, but still showery with indications of fog. 
N.Z. ship hove alongside this afternoon taking in tucker. Dont know how they are faring, but they must be pretty short of rations on some of the ships. Informed that everything possible will be done to give us something decent to eat


[Page 21]
for dinner tomorrow. Of course none of the transports were expected to be still at sea by Dec. so no Xmas provisions aboard.
25th Xmas Day. They found some cocoa somewhere & managed to give us a weak unsweetened decoction with a slice of bacon each & a roll. Quite a pleasant change for breakfast.
Dinner consisted of a slice of pork each, a spud, tinned cabbage, roll & plum duff – plenty of latter. O.C. troops made a sort of speech to the Port Lincoln machine gunners. Complimented us on the way we settled down to conditions on this ship, deeply sympathised with us as "shipwrecked soldiers who, own home having gone bung, were forced into cramped quarters 
[indecipherable] 
of a strange ship. Regarding us as guests of the Ulysses had decided to use the balance of Ulysses sports fund to present each of us with a packet of Three Castles cigarettes" & a few odds and ends from Canteen (now closed). He concluded by reading George V’s message to soldiers, & sailors, & informed us that not only was it not forseen that we should be so long on voyage, but, having been within an ace of going under the sea in coffin full of portholes, we would not be un-nerved by the information that we are still much closer to the sea bed than to England! If luck continued with the ‘hungry six’ we might expect to reach some port unknown by Wednesday , 27th inst when


[Page 22]
our troubles would commence. Advised us candidly to take a last good look at the sun & enjoy it to the full, as we might not see him again for a considerable period. "Where you come from they register rainfall – where you are going they only take notice of intervals of sunlight."
Passing from fog to fog all day with bursts of weak sunlight. Dont feel the cold – but then we are all done up like bales of wool. All "blues" handed over on to-days parade to be dumped. The dumping consisted of piling the abandoned clothing in a hatch & then looking out to sea (officers) while crew downed on the deck & ducked off with them to their own quarters. When you hear of the military dumping ‘blues’ at sea towards end of voyage – wink once & let it pass. Today a curious coincidence came my way. Sitting on deck after dinner noticed a cobber with life belt on which letters C.G.P. (printed) caught my eye. It[seemed like Charlie’s writing &, therefore, I got hold of the belt – swapped my own, - and examined it. "CGP" appeared in couple of places, but inside the letters were written "CGP" & underneath in what looked like another handwriting, C.G. Price. Looks as this belt was Charlies property on voyage to France – a number of belts on this ship are from other transports, therefore it is strange if his found its way to myself in


[Page 23]
in the jumble of transfers from ship to ship.
Afternoon & evening travelling dead slow & zig-zag. Stopped all night.
26th Repacking kits & equipment. Orders to do away with superfluous kit – No man to land with more than one kit bag. Have managed, somehow, to get all into one bag & pack, but it necessitates abandonment of much useful stuff. We are told we are (9am) 500 miles from port, but cannot hope to get in before Wednesday or Thursday night. Picked up escort this afternoon – 8 destroyers came tearing up to us just after dinner & lined up on each side the convoy. We hit the speed up for the first time for days & are now making good time with the TBD’s line astern.
More [indecipherable] fail us.(1) We receive two blankets prior to dis-embarkation ... all we get in Dear old Blighty. Our O.C. told us he expected we’d freeze hard long before due for France, but he can’t help it. It appears that old Blightie’s children need more blankets than we do. They feel the cold so, poor dears. (2) We land in the west, in fog etc, & possibly spend some time in a Depot before joining camps.
This means we must take rations with us from the ship! (3). We will be due for £ 5 back pay & 6 days leave or settling down – but Australians are not allowed loose in England beyond certain limits – which do not include any big places of


[Page 24]
interest, especially London. This latter bit of news we can hardly credit. They’d hardly have the nerve to put the kybosh on us to that extent, although I must admit that Australia’s record in S Africa, West Africa & France would be good excuse for them to bar us altogether from their towns & homes....if it were not that they’re not much better them-selves. (There are plenty with us to judge by).
Weather still wet & foggy, But cold not as bad as expected. I feel no colder than I’ve often been in Sydney & we’re close to Snow now

X Late . Passing Lizard Light
Calm off Eddystone, going into Plymouth Rds.
9 30 Entered Plymouth
(Up this morning 4.30 in order to get off early to train)
Packed up & ready all morning, raining. Took gear off & had dinner. 6 separate sets of orders re dress. Boarded tender at 5 p.m. Hour in which officers luggage taken on lighter. Arrived docks 6.30. Lined up & waited for train. Train left 8.30. Arrived Exeter 11 pm. Bun in bay & w bottles filled with hot tea by [indecipherable].
Incident of debarkation as tender drew up to whf. Officer of Flying Corps "All off – Flying Corps first!!" [indecipherable]


[Page 26]
Mild looking Senior officer (in charge disembarkation)
"Never mind – come along just as you are!" Flying man with M.G’s laugh long & loud.
Plymouth full troops going to front held up by subs. Consider us lucky to run through safely. People here have been very anxious re boats at sea during past couple weeks. Our O.C. tells us things very dicky for us just prior to arrival of T.B. flotilla. 
29th Detrained at Penham Downs 6.30 am Marched through mud & darkness about a mile to camp. Then marched aimlessly round the camp roads until 9 am looking for a home wherein to rest, 9 am still dark & wet, marched into huts – 15 in a hut – warm & snug when cleaned & fire lighted. Fooled round in mud all day getting fixed. two biscuits all day – the mob’s half starved & savage. Seymour was a king to this.
30th Fixed up at last. Complimented by commandant for good behaviour coming in. Tucker supply arriving slowly – margarine bread, a little jam, tea, & bully. Nothing hot so far, but promised. No work until hunger appeased. The trouble all arises from the mix up caused by the wreck, & subsequent splitting up of P Lincoln units among other ships.


[Page 27]
Later details of our little affair out in the channel seem to show that the Subs mistook a merchantman for one of ‘us’ and got her. She SOS.ed & T.Bs of our Escort went over. While looking for her the subs were tempted & got two, [indecipherable] but showed themselves to other TBs who got the lot thus fully [indecipherable] their pals

Copied 27/12/16
Sat
25/11/16 at 6.37 Experienced our first incident of note since leaving Cape Town. Came in the manner of a heavy jolt, followed by peculiar stunts on the part of ship & an avalanche of officers into the engine room. Excitement; speculation Struck a mountain trout, a whale, a rock, a derelict, or a jettisoned carcase of cape mutton (I favor the latter theory.) Actually she has flung a blade & split her tail shaft: Cause floating wreckage of some kind unknown, but as we’re in the Gulf it may have been a log of African hardwood tangled in floating weed. She scraped it & got it finally with her blades.


[Page 31]
Fortunately we’re not right out to it – there’s enough left to do fancy stunts at 6 knots while the weather holds & thus we’re not salvage. The old man & mates used dreadful language in front of us soldiers too! We rather wish she were a twin screw & could smash the other. It would be an education.
26th The old bosun goes down the trap every few minutes to view the ship. He comes up to work off his feelings on any part of the army that sits handy. "Crawlin" up to Dakar would afford R.K. a fine subject. Afraid the war will end before we see land again.
Blasted shark swimming astern – takes an occasional jaunt up the port side with her nose & down astern, then goes over to Africa for lunch, returning immediately.
Evening Have changed our mind – are going to America. No reason given
27th Lame duck still waddling west. They have doused the lights as from last night, adding to our joys greatly. Submarine pickets detailed, double posts, & ball ammunition – to shoot periscopes! ( we’re minus the big g’s).
28th Course altered early & pickets redoubled. Ran NW for a while then respectively, N, NE, NW, NE, E, SW, S, & SE. Can’t say very definitely whats wrong but the above speaks volumes. Chaplain’s came down & talked to all hands told us to be ready for anything. Boats sway out. Axes ready for cutting lashings, lifebelts checked & ‘spares’ put handy. Rumbling all day in a thick haze., ship suddenly quiet & orderly. O.C. told us we’d not sleep if we knew half of what he knew.


[Page 32]
8.15. Due E. five minutes ago strange white flare showed ahead Saw it myself – three white flares like opening a furnace, then other lights. She got round in her own length & stopped dead for a few minutes; then crept off dead slow. She’s still firing – engines hardly murmuring.
9.30. They’ve managed to hit her up to over 9 knots, doing the ZigZag act.
10.30. Dead slow again. We know what’s up now. If we get nabbed we’ll miss the English winter.
12 Lying to (nearly stopped). She’s taking full advantage of the haze & dark. They say that a Sub can only ‘find’ a ship at night by the sound of her screw. It seems a joke that they’ve cut this lame duck out from two [indecipherable] & are still hunting while better ships have gone down. They also got us far from the possibility of Escort at first but there’s one on the way now & they’ll have to get us to-morrow or we win.
29th Moved at 4a.m. SE all speed possible. Sighted smoke at 7 a.m. Three C’s – what a blanky relief! All hands wax cheeky at the Hun’s expense. It’s dam undignified to play the part of a lame duck hiding round the sea from the [indecipherable]
10.30 Off the Mount of Leon’s – otherwise Sierra Leone. Freetown shows distantly in the haze, but most noticeable is the fleet in the roadstead or whatever the harbor is.


[Page 33]
It all explains why the C’s could not come after us earlier. They say there over 12000 men on the transports sheltering here & they’re short of supplies. 
11.30 still performing stints. This time it’s the finish for ark. Tried to take a short cut to shelter after the C’s left us & as a result are piled high on the Banks. Sailors say they’ve heard of ships going on here but so far have got off again – its a sort of shifting quicksand. Another unfortunate total wreck lies about a mile to Starboard – She’s been on about 8 months.
2.30 [indecipherable] waiting for high water. Getting up a T sweep on the time she’ll be refloated. Winner takes pool.
Other ship referred to is on rock as well as mud. She’s a fine looking boat, similar to the N Coast boat Puljanbar, but has been abandoned. Scene from our "wreck" is glorious – Great ranges & peaks rise back from the shoreline, Green to their summits; with the splendid colors of African bush. One mountain on our left culminates in a green grassed knoll on which many buildings are visible. The town is low lying, good type of houses, palms & foliage everywhere. Roof & wall a whitey brown color. Foreshores on right covered by


[Page 34]
dense cocoanut plantations. River mouth in front of us, but a larger stream seems to run in higher up the inlet, behind the mountains. The English garrison is barracked on a round hill that rises out of the center of the town. They have fine looking buildings. Churches form prominent landmarks all over the town. 
30th All efforts to refloat have failed & we are under orders to abandon ship.
1st Dec Came off yesterday in nigger lighters, towed in strings of three. MGs last ashore. Were told that we must go into Barracks – marched , not to garrison, but through the town into the bush up a winding mountain road to the top of that same mountain I noted yesterday or earlier, Mt Aureol. A Jamacian (black) regiment is quartered here, 13 West I Regt. (a crack corps of regulars be it known) They made us very welcome, put their supplies at our disposal, quartered us in comfortable huts & generally were most hospitable. Fine men & first class Soldiers, these Jamaicans. They can give us points everywhere. The place is so rugged that the small square & the tennis court have been built up on the mountainside . The huts are ornamented by little rocky gardens


[Page 35]
Jungle plants mingle with black French roses & Australian gums. Paw Paws grow like weeds.
But the March – it was a terror. We had full kit on & were not half way when they began to fall to it. When we got to the top, there was only a handful left & the others came up like strayed cattle. One has since died of exhaustion. One man tried a short cut in spite of warnings re snakes. He died to-day & the snake still waits for victims! We are warned the place is a nest of snakes & one has only to look at the jungle grass – ten to fifteen feet high – to believe all they say. Have spent the day hunting fruit, snakes, monkeys etc. They got us a new ration of Bully & Biscuits after much trouble. I gave mine to one of the carriers, thereby securing his services as guide. My ration made out at sundry oranges, paw paws, lemons, native apples, (like a gigantic lilli-pilli, pear shaped & very fleshy) plantains about 15" long, some boiled yams, & jungle beans, a couple of young coconuts, washed down – a miracle! by whisky (Walker’s) & lemon juice & a dash of sweet native punch. The latter is a hot beverage composed of a kind of beer, fortified with old Jamaica, & spiced

It’s not bad at all especially after six weeks at sea. Last night I lay out & listened to the noise of the bush. Every sort of jabber imaginable until a couple of leopards started a sing song in the gully just behind us. The silence broken only by the hurried departure of various monkeys.
There are three dreaded man eaters on this mountain the mamba – a poisonous tree snake, very ferocious, the Cameroon Ape, a grey side whiskered party who is harmless enough by day but a terror by night & the black leopard. The latter are numerous & with the muskcat are the only dangerous felines nearer than Koro. Lincoln refloated.
2nd Returned to ship to remove baggage. M Gr’s commandeered to handle cargo. Ship leaking badly & no good as troopship. She is to run to Gib to repair & we know her no more.
3rd Finally abandon the Lincoln & returned to the Mountain. 
Used my nut this time & gave nigger 9d to carry my worldly goods.

Something here made me think hard & at last I remembered it. In an old magazine under heading "Curiosities – you will find a photo of a monkey food tree (kind of fig) that has rooted on top of an old wall. The roots bound up a section of wall & still hold it – the rest of the structure having long since disappeared. On either side at foot stand an old [indecipherable] gun. The structure was an old slaver’s look out tower. Theres a big rockery garden in front in which, by the way, lives a dreaded Green snake about 8 feet long. We killed one of his descendants, a youth 18 inches long with fangs like rat’s teeth. On the ridge back of this live boas up to forty feet long. One killed only yesterday, measured 34 feet. They are looked on as common. The Koli snake a green & gold beauty with a whip tail of bright orange, is another terror. He’s very deadly & hard to see. Also grows big. Two at the observation station, alive, measure 6 feet & 8 feet respectively. Four of our chaps so far have had narrow squeaks.

One Joe Ford, a cobber of mine, was going for a wash when a big brute started up in some cut grass. Joe went one way, snake another, but he was nearly on the brute. But the big joke occurred at night. Our section slept on balcony- verandah over the slope. Under the hut is an old cordial plant. Iron roof lies about 1ft. under boards. I spread w. proof out & lay on it. During night woke suddenly. Heard one of the boys swearing & at same time some reptile slid under me, below boards, stopped, seemed to circle & next thing tapped me smartly between shoulders. He was merely trying a broad crack over which I’d spread my sheet. I jumped several yards & landed on sundry gunners, who woke & cursed me. Someone else repeated ‘snake’, the chap who woke me up yelled "Dinkum – Snake , boys, he crawled right under me – – ear!" Then the rush started & in ten seconds the MG’s were all inside the hut. This morning a Jamaican told us "big snake under this floor – zin look out for that one"


[Page 39]
Other reptiles are plentiful. Lizards of many sizes & colors bask on the concrete buttresses & foundations of the huts. Counted 9 varieties from a grey frill to a Goa. One is very fine- a large frilled, bright golden colored with red tracings.

The cool mist clung to the Mountain Side Soft shading the slopes of green and a wind came over the waters wide rustling the palms & ruffling the tide.
Yet never a sail was seen. But heavy & thick the mist dropped drops down 
As a bird is struck in flight
The tide creeps out from the white walled town And fever walks in the mud banks brown. It was ever thus in the days long flown when the first sail rose in sight.
The [indecipherable] came. You may see his mark of hatred, of fear & shame.
But he passed again in the throbbing dark that reddened with flame of his burning barque And the flag of England came!
[indecipherable] goes back to the mountainside

who is it.
1 Leans over the rail, as the ship turns up in a strange port , and insults the foreigner with silly questions of a more or less personal character and with smutty witicisms 
2 If it happens to be the port of Durban – treats the coolies & kaffirs to a display (lasting the length of his stay) of patronising ignorance mingled with vulgar familiarity?
3 Makes a point of insulting every colored woman he meets & expects them to be flattered because his skin is white? 
4 Wonders why white women in such places studiously avoid him.
5 And why white men look contemptuously on his conquests among the black element
6 Treats the coolie who carries his baggage with the familiarity of an equal (or inferior) and kicks him when he asks for more than is due for the job over

12. Mobs the Freetown orange women, steals their oranges rather than pay 6d doz for them, ill treats the women in the streets, robs them of their bead necklaces & bangles and then gets insulted because the BLACK - - - s call him a "white coolie" and appeal to the navy for protection.
13. Starts a row in a native pub over 2d change and after terrorising the nigger, loots all his whiskey etc and breaks what he cant take.

17. Gets out early in the morning & raids the garrison vegetable gardens, lemon trees, paw paws, & cocoa- nuts.
18. The paw paws not being ripe , cuts up many in sampling & pulls off many more to fling at the monkeys. Cuts down a few bunches of green bananas; Also a few cocoa nut palms, in order to see if the young nuts are ‘nearly ripe’

23. Insults the garrison women with such bland pestering that the B.W.I.R gets on its dig & requests the Admiralty to remove him back to his ship.
24. Goes into the native town & commits atrocities that a mad Hun or Chow would blink at – (He is going to fight because of the way the Huns treated boys & girls of tender years in Belgium)
25. Is insulted when his Chaplain tells him a few home truths but scornfully rejects the information that , "these people look upon you with scorn & contempt, because of your treatment of their women & children – the men call you ‘white coolies’ because of your filthy talk directed at them & theirs – You have made the name of your nation stink here just as you have in the South, just as those who have gone before you have also done in France and England. These people are not only civilised, they are citizens of the British Empire – as loyal as you – in all but colour – Superior to you in knowledge of war. They have fought for Britain, many of them are now away fighting. They helped to win the Cameroons. They are helping to win East Africa & they are helping.

in France. You come among them bursting with superiority of the kind that has led white men to do what was done in the Congo. You go from them leaving only another smudge on a reputation already none too sweet. You are morally inferior to these black people. You do not seem capable of recognising that they have rights as you have. Nor do you appreciate the fact that they are educated sufficiently to realise with contempt, your inferiority, your loose morals in regard to property, and your [indecipherable]! You say you are up against the German – what have you done? What will you do? Have they done any single thing that you have not shown yourselves capable of doing during your short stay here.? Here you are among allies – In Belgium they are among enemies! What will you do in an enemy’s country, if you are beasts enough to rouse hatred against you among your allies?"
25 ( All this is true of him, yet he resents hearing it,)
26. Of whom a Japanese student has said "In morals & refinement he is inferior to any other white race – he respects his own women very little, but the women of other lands he respects not at all."
Who is it?
The parson, best explained, was speaking specially to a section of a crowd of poor men. A large section, but not a majority, only a section large enough to Damn the lot. The Parson is a man & speaks like one.
