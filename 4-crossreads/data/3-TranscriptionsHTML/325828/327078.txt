<p>[The bottom right corner of next 3 pages torn off.]<br/>My dearest Father,<br/>You will be glad to know that your Xmas hamper arrived from Griffiths Bros 2 days ago.<br/>My word it was absolutely fine, &amp; I sincerely thank you all at home for your kindness.  It arrived in splendid condition and I can tell you that I appreciated it very much.  It was awfully good of you at home, &amp; please accept my heart felt thanks.<br/>Your letters dated 17th of <strike>N</strike> October &amp; thereabouts reached me on 24th November which is absolutely a record for speed.  I am sorry that I can't write separate letters to you all but as I only have one lot of news to write about I think a long general letter just about fills the bill.<br/>We had our first fall of snow here on the night of December 1st.  It certainly was not very much, about an inch in the open &amp; of course more where the wind drifted it into hedge &amp; ditch.  My, but it is fine to see the English countryside covered with Natures white mantle.  Well can I compree the expression now, "As pure as the driven snow."  Every day since, <strike>wh</strike> we have had [torn page] of snow, &amp; to-night as I write I glance out the [torn page] &amp; see the Aerodrome one huge mass of glitter[torn page] &ndash; glittering under the stars.</p>
