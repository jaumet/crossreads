  
 August, 1915 Sunday 15 Every day better & every day + trains bring more wounded 30000 casualities so far, but the Peninsular is ours if all accounts are true - I am still afraid to give you names of the different military successes. [indecipherable] Censor but he should hardly block these simple notes - there is one thing I am a thankful man to be here alive & kicking casualties have been so heavy 3rd Batt Infantry after three days fighting a Subaltern was O.C. - 
 Have not used a crutch since my knee was bad at C.G.S
