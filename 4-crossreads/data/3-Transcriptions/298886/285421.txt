In this place the Arab children come to the side of the road and follow one for miles with an armful of "burseen" (green Lucerne) for the horse. And, having given the horse some, they clamour for the everlasting "Backsheesh" That word has a magical effect. They expect "Backsheesh" for every thing they do.
