 Dear Mrs Ferguson 
 I am writing to say how deeply sorry I am to hear about Arthur. If the love &amp; good wishes of those who served with him could have saved him, your son would have come through scatheless. I know of no officer in the 20th, who was held in higher regard, as a soldier &amp; a gentleman. 
 I am most glad, for your sake, that Keith is not in the fighting-line; and, for my part, I do not think there is any likelihood of his getting there for the present. From what I can gather, he would have a considerable period of training to undergo, before getting to the front &ndash; &amp; by that time he may not be needed. 
 I can only add again my deepest sympathy for you all about Arthur &ndash; &amp; I cannot say in words how much I feel. 
 Yours very sincerely 
 Archie Bloomfield.
