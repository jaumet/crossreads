<p>one of the bands  &amp; by the way Sis none of the cigars were broken. We are having glorious summer weather again &amp; as there is a canal &amp; lakes right near us, we have a great time in the water. You would laugh to see the way we get about in just a pair of shorts &amp; boots &amp; socks, nothing else &amp; sometimes not even our boots &amp; sox. We are looking just like blacks now but are all in the best of health. We are in the line again but our section is lucky as we are back in supports. Well dear Old Sis there is no more news. Give Noni a big love &amp; kiss for me &amp; remember me to all Vol's people. Well dear Sis must close now so fondest love to you &amp; Vol from your brother Hal</p>
