  
 14 March 1918 Thursday (X to X crossed out)  Wadi Auja  The Cave I camped in had been used by Bedouins I am now LOUSY, & not had my clothes off for 1 week I shall come to Australia when the war ends X even if my wife Dolly goes home.  After all my work & expense to get her out through the Red X  & I have no chance of going England myself- I understand the little girls wish to be with her Mother under the circumstances but would prefer her to go to Bronte. X  No word of going back yet.  Collected 214 Bedouins today they live in Caves, Donkeys & all together & are very poor.
