 Tuesday 6 March 
 Taking down 10 large tents all day.  Worked up till 9 p.m. We have now moved to another part of the grounds but are even more comfortable than before.  There are ten of us in a large tent.  A good coal fire burns all day long.  Toast and various other additions which are made possible with a good fire, are making us quite fat.  The tent presents a very homelike appearance with deck chairs, forms, and stretchers surrounding the fire.  The smoke from the coal makes us as black as niggers.
