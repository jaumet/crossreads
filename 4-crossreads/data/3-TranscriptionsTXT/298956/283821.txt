I was carrying it with this American.  When we had finished dinner some of the Germans took the cans on a wagon and dropped them nearly half way.  At night going home the American rushed ahead or at least sent somebody else ahead to get the can and he carried it as far as the half way line - a distance of about five hundred yards from where the can was when he picked it up.  Then he dropped it and told me to carry it to the barracks and when I protested the American came along an told me if I didn't carry the can he would not let me come for the dinner again.  I didn't say much there
