<p>Sunday 30<br/>Move from Steenvoorde to Dickebusch partly by foot &amp; partly by motor through Poperinghe Camp for a while in Buren Chateau where we were in the centre of a Fritz bombing stunt.</p>
<p>Oct., 1917<br/>Monday 1<br/>Move up to the line through Ypres on the Menin road where the fighting lately has been very severe. The ground is broken up very much &amp; the roads back are lined with dead men &amp; animal. The shelling just now is moderate.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2<br/>Very busy day on left of Menin Road at R.A.P. &amp; other posts. The system of practice barrages is being adopted two very heavy ones daily taking place. Fritz counter attacked tonight &amp; his barrage was very heavy. Held up by it for about two hours. Post is being heavily shelled &amp; it is decided to move it up to safer position. A battery blown out above us.</p>
<p>Wednesday 3<br/>Move back to Dickebush through Ypres. Pass the ruins of Cloth Hall &amp; other buildings. No building has more than a few bricks left to mark it. I suppose this battle will be called 4th Battle of Ypres or Menin Road. Another attack takes place tomorrow &amp; elaborate preparations are being made for it<br/>From accounts it will be the final objective of the battle the ridge commanding a great amount of flat country &amp; hazards any coastal enterprises of Fritz. The dead in horses &amp; men is enormous, especially well back</p>
<p>Thursday 4<br/>Move back through Ypres to [indecipherable] Nestock ridge &amp; thence to forward posts of the new advance. It has been raining &amp; the place has been converted into a veritable quagmire. <br/>The advance this morning was entirely successfull &amp; to-nights counter attack was repulsed. Zonnebeke was taken  <strike>last night</strike> this morn.</p>
<p>Friday 5<br/>At forward posts of new advance where we up to our knees in mud. The carrying is very heavy &amp; long. The shelling is very severe, nearly all 5.9 &amp; over. Our casualties have been heavy &amp; since the ambulance has been on this sector 13 killed including Major Hunt &amp; about 30 wounded, including many old boys.</p>
<p>Saturday 6<br/>Not much work today &amp; it has been showery. Two more casualties have resulted bringing total to 45. Morris was killed.<br/>Move to Garber point for night</p>
