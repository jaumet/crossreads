<p>throwing our boys were blamed for breaking a window that was smashed before they ever saw Perth and that made some join in that would not have done so.   We received a fine welcome when we arrived, we marched off the boat and after waiting a few minutes on the wharf for the train to arrive we entrained, and were taken straight out to one of the W.A. camps "Black Boys Camp", it is a lovely place we were assigned to our huts and told that no one was to leave, then cooks were called for, to prepare dinner for us, this was our welcome.   the cooking arrangements will not stand pulling to pieces, our Officers were treated just the same as we were, there was a train leaving about 1 P.M. and when that train left, there were very few N.S.W. men left at Black Boys  Some of them did not come back to camp untill the evening before the Boat was due to leave ..  then they simply secured their Kit bags and left for Freemantle</p>
