Wireless news re the Peace Conference & various theatres of the war.  Our hospital has 50 sick cases orderlies & 3 sisters in attendance.  We have a special doctor for the Civilians & 2 Army Medical doctors for the troops.  We the officers & engineers hope this will be the last lot of passengers we shall have from India & sincerely hope we shall return from Blighty to Australia with Troops.

The passengers collected 100 for to buy the troops extra comforts & fancy foodstuffs at Port Said.  A concert was held by the 1st Saloon passengers in the 1st Saloon music hall.  The Civilian passengers did not invite the Tommies to this concert so they were disappointed.
