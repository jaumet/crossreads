Monday 9 December
Jumped at the chance of a run to Charleroi to-day, though a bit wet and we had two punctures, we had a good day. Charleroi is a fine lively place is going on as in pre-war days. Mining for coal is the great industry of this part of Belgium. The country en route, 36 kilos is fine well cultivated. The town is en fete bedraped with flags the people display great curiosity at us Australians thinking we are Americans. A debate to-night was very good. The women with hair cut short ? the sign of the Boshe - the Museum, are rather typical of the Continent.
