<p>1917<br/>Tue. 25th Dec<br/>Christmas Day.   I have just completely starved for three weeks and have had milk for the last few days and today I got &ndash; a small piece of pork, sauer kraut, potatoes and &ndash; coconut cakes!</p>
<p>Moans, morphia, and almost an inquest in the evening in consequence.   In the afternoon a gramophone came into the ward and the Germans took a huge delight in playing "Rule Britannia" and "God Save".   Webbie, who was cheering me up with extracts from the Bible, rushed out and "attentioned" during three verses of "God Save" sung by a cracked baritone, to the huge delight of the Huns.   They made him take an encore.   A small Christmas Tree came in at night, Wolfe the Omart turned all the lights out, lit the candles on the tree, and played sentimental songs of the Fatherland on a mandolin till the tree caught fire and interrupted the "music".</p>
