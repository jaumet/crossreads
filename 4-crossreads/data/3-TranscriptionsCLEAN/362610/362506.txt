  
 Tuesday 17 October 1916 Another beautifully clear & enjoyable morning with an overcast afternoon during which some rain fell. After breakfast went to the A.M.C. to try & get relief for a neuralgic complaint that was worrying me & by them was sent in to the English stationary hospital at St. Omer for examination & preferred to come back to camp rather than go into hospital, which seemed a very nice place, situated in an old spacious building. Had some lunch in town & then went inside the adjacent grand church in which were some 13th century statues & an inscription on the wall stating that in 1553 Chas. XV had entered that particular portal. The stained glass windows were exquisite. Came out again in an ambulance & lay down for the rest of the afternoon.
