extent to come down low, and all they got was two camels, one killed, and one wounded, and one ?nigger? got a piece in the foot.
One of them had an exceedingly bad shot for us. It dropped about fifty yards away. It made a decent hole, which in ten seconds was surrounded by fellows looking for souvenirs. All together, it was absolutely the poorest exhibition of bombing that could have been put up. The field was absolutely clear, none of our planes cruising around, the "Archies" could not have got them had they flown low, and with machine gun and bombs they could have done tremendous damage. Luckily for us all, however, "Johnny" in his fiasco was apparently far more scared than we were on the ground under him. 
Word has just come in that we are not moving after all. We stay where we are. Well there could be worse places. Plenty of water handy, and green feed for the horses, and good warm days. What more could one want, nothing much, except "go forward". We were sitting around the festive board, which in this case was a bag spread on the ground, yesterday evening, regaling ourselves with such delicacies as biscuits and cheese, jam or bully, according to taste. Some of us had finished and were discussing an after-meal cigarette, others were not yet in that state in which etiquette demands one should leave the table. Suddenly "Archie" barked and all eyes turned automatically to search the sky. And there they came out of the north west, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine Taubes. Then somebody uttered an exclamation, "Gee-whizz, look on the left", and there were six more, fifteen Taubes, sailing out of the grey sky like big dragon flies, with semi-transparent wings. "I say" said another, "there are some beautiful wild flowers in this Wadi over here, whose coming to look for them". The response was quite encouraging. I was among the number.
