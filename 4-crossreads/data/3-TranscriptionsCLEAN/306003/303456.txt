4-8-16Fri 4thThe second Bde came in about 11 oclock last night & the Turks followed them in, & at midnight we got the alarm & were out in quick time & found the Turks at the entrance to the camp just before daylight our outposts were retiring & fighting their way back;  we rode up close to the Turks dismounted for action & were soon in the thick of it just at dawn.
The Turks were coming up the gully in hundreds & the closest were within 100 yards of us when we opened fire , & they charged yelling Allah Allah, but again Allah deserted them & they fell thick & fast & the fight ended with both sides taking whatever cover they could & sniping;  at this we more than held our own although the Turkish machine guns made our positions rather uncomfortable
