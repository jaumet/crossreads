<p>France.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 22.7.16<br/>7.6.1916.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>It has been very quiet up this way since I last wrote on the 31st. ult.  I have seen Walter several times &amp; a few days ago when I <strike>had been</strike> was round at Walter's billet Jocelyn Carr &amp; Arnold Hazlewood dropped in.  I thought Jocelyn was looking anything but well, &amp; he was ever so much thinner than when I saw him last.  I went round to see Wal on Sunday afternoon last &amp; he was just about to go out to hear "Gipsy Smith" of whom you have doubtless heard.  However on our way round to the meeting</p>
