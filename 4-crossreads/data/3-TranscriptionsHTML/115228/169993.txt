<p><u>Oct 24th</u>:&nbsp; The Brigade moved out at 4.39 p.m. &amp; travelled to Abassiniel(?) - Kebir (about 7 miles) where we arrived in camp at 8.30 p.m.&nbsp; We expect a big offensive operation to commence by us in a few days time.&nbsp; Two enemy aeroplanes were recently brought down by our new fighting machines.&nbsp; We have something like 250,000 men now on this</p>
