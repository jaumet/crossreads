<p>Our chaps tell us from France that they live like fighting cocks there &amp; die too &amp; all arrangements in Commissariat, Line Canteens, Hot Baths etc are splendid, but that the Trenches are not as good as we made in Gallipoli.<br/>The English Paper shew many of the good ships that backed us up at Gallipoli, knocked out but from all accounts the Hun was kept from laughing- &amp; honors are at least easy if not in our favour-<br/>Evening airplane flew over we fired a few shells &amp; the Machine guns got busy, but by the time our Battle planes got here, the Turks had flown- good for nerves-</p>
