<p>looking lot too.  We are now just a few miles from Ammon, which is to be attacked this afternoon.  We are waiting now to go in if necessary.  Wonderful to relate, the <strike>Anzac Mounted</strike> Brigade are only reserves this time, and everybody is growling about it.  They want to be in it.</p>
<p>1st October  1-20 A.M.  By a blazing wood fire in the Ammon Wadi, as I do my hour's picket on the horse lines, I write this.  What a wonderful success this push has been.

At the last minute their owners had boarded the train, which our troops arrived in time to see steaming out of the Station, but just too late to stop.  The whole old camping area was a scene of the utmost confusion, and the most indescribable filth.</p>
<p>In the morning I went up and had a look through the Turkish Hospital.  It is awful.  Filth and stenches abound.

And their plight is indeed pitiable.  They are dying, they say, as fast as they can carry them out.
