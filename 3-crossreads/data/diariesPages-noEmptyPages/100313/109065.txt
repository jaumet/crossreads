20/1/18 Edinburgh
up past Tron church John Knox's house to the Law Courts St Giles getting a glimpse of St Giles: We then did a promenade on Princes St. and returned to 27 Abercromby Place for lunch. All the afternoon and all the evening we yarned drank wine and whisky. The Colonel showed me all his regalia and retailed stories of all the old judges and the Law of Scotland for ages past. Grand to get into the company of a chap like this among such refinement and the ease of a well lived life. Lord Young, the Lord Low, the leaders of the clans and all the leaders of everything that is Scotland, figured large in the Colonels yarns. The kilts, the sporrans and the many trophies of chase and fishing all furnished material for anecdotes.
