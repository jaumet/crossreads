<p>Dear Dad, Mother, George &amp; Ellis</p>
<p>I expect that Ellis will be Home before this letter as he sailed to Aussie on the old 13th again &amp; I marched out of Bulford to this place on the 13th.  I have a much easier job with a lot more responsibility which does not trouble me now.  I've been over to Bulford this afternoon to get a few things that I had left behind.  I've just received another &pound;5 from the Firm.  The wind &amp; rain during the last few days has been worse than a sou-easter.  It is good over here now &amp; I have more time for study &amp; reading.  I have not the faintest idea when I shall be coming Home so I can give you no information on the subject at present.  I am contented now that one of Us has gone Home, so don't you worry about me.  Ellis would have been in an awful state had He been left, but I can always fill in time.  There is no news to give You.  I am well &amp; happy.</p>
<p>Give my Regards to All enquiring Friends.  I have several letters to write to-night, to Auntie, D.J's &amp; some of my mates in England.</p>
<p>Best Love to you all<br/>Harry</p>
