12/8/17 Rouen 
about which there seemed nothing very wonderful. Coming down by some old old places struck a richly decorated side door to the Cathedral in a Cow yard and went inside and sat down. A service of some kind was in progress. The old Suisse was extremely gorgeously attired in gold lace and cocked hat. Went back to hotel quite tired again. Returned to Notre Dame in time to see the celebration of High Mass with a crowded congregation. In the distance the gorgeously arranged priests looked very small and tiny mites at the altar of this great Cathedral. The smoke incense filled the air. When the service was done took a walk round. A very old Servian officer in his distinctive uniform was here. Now by rear streets to the church of St Gothard where another mass was in progress ? a large congregation in a small church. There is good stained glass here too. Next door is another old church (St Laurent) which has been turned into a museum. From here went on to the Tour Jean ?d?Arc a funny old donjon not unlike a windmill. A round tower with a beehive
