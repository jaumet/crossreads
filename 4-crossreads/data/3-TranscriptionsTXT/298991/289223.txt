Friday Oct 5thNo 4, 5 & 6 Military Districts (South, West Australia & Tasmania) were paid today. 10/- only being paid. A shilling per man is being deducted for breakages etc caused during the voyage, It is an enormous amount to deduct,  & the mob are kicking up a row about it. The Officer explained the reason for deduction & said a committee would be appointed to decide what would be done with the suppluc cash after the fee had been paid. We are given a lot of liberty on the ship, one can go & do nearly just as he likes.
Saturday Oct 6thWe have got into the land (or sea rather) of the flying fish. Very big schools of them were observed nearly all day. They are mavellous, & some can fly a long distance out of the water. They are very small. Also saw a couple of sharks go by. A concert was held on No 3 hatchway this afternoon, we haven't very good talent on board. A few of the items were very funny though.
