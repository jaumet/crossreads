<p>be that the reason or not I do not know, but this is certain, no shell dropped on the beach during the final evacuation.</p>
<p>Dec 20th Mon.<br/>Much to the surprise of the staff on board the "Dongola" instead of seeing wounded men pouring on to the ship. A thing they were fully prepared for, they saw healthy but tired men walking up the steps carrying their packs on their backs. We were all dog-weary, I hadn't had a decent wash all the time I had been on the Peninsular, and had about a fortnights growth of beard on my face, wearing a Tommy cap on my head, an Aussie tunic and Tommy trousers I for one must have looked a picture. When we got aboard the "Dongola" we all rushed the bathrooms for a bath, Hot cocoa was provided and clean sheets and a comfortable bed made us feel as if we had landed into Paradise. Looking from the ship away on to the position we had just left all one could see was the bright light of the burning stores, and about fifty yards from the hospital ship a British warship slowly passed us by. I was too dead tired to take any more interest in what was going on and getting down</p>
