  
 there are some splendid specimens of Gothic architecture in Australia. The arches in the nave of St Mary's are a very fine sample. 
 After a yarn with a genial old policeman on duty at the door, and watching a boy sketching the tower of Parliament Houses we moved along Whitehall, but were disappointed at not seeing any of the Horse Guards on duty. 
 We then went along the Strand which is a street very much like George Street. It was curious to see so many officers of all grades about; in half an hour we passed nine brigadier generals, which necessitates a great deal of saluting  which is  a very sore point with many Australians. 
 Though we went a long way we passed very few other Australians, which made us all the more noticeable to the crowds
