<p>1919<br/>April 6<br/>Amsterdam, so went around there   We got some pay, &amp; I enquired where I could get my boil (now almost better) dressed.  We tried the Hotel Windsor for beds, but found the tariff too stiff &ndash; we were all comparatively hard up so went back by tube to the place de la Republique to the Hotel Moderne, part of which has been turned into the Army &amp; Navy Leave Club.  We got a bedroom with 3 beds for 4 francs a day each.  Meals were 2 f to 2f 50c.  There were also regular trips to the sights, conducted from here by girl guides at very reasonable charges 3 or 4 francs for an afternoon, &amp; 10 to 15 francs for a whole day.  No tipping of porters, caretakers etc nor train or tram fares.  The girls, also, were full of information regarding the places visited.<br/>In the afternoon we went with a guide to Les Invalides.  It was built by Louis XIV as a home for sick &amp; war worn soldiers.  It is a big building with a quadrangle</p>
