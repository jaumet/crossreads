<p>Very cool night &amp; day &ndash; still very calm &ndash; Fire alarm went about 4.45 pm &ndash; all hands had to turn out. All the Boats are swung out ready over the side. Most of the lights are put out of a night now. Have two queer cases in Officers Hospital, they see a lot more than they should &ndash; they require a lot of watching especially thro the night &amp; I still only have 3 Orderleys.</p>
<p>Passed a ship about 11 pm &ndash; fancy she was a Hospital ship. No sign of land yet. I fancy some of the fellows who perhaps were very apt to scoff at Red Cross Workers &amp; AMC men will have a different tale to tell in future, especially those who have been thro the Hospital. They never dreamt that when they are sick &ndash; thousands of miles away from home &amp; land, that they would be provided with comfortable</p>
