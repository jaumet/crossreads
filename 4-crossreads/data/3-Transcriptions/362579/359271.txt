<p>Glad when dinner time comes to see the others. Our M.O's are wandering about trying to get into mischief. They may move on to-morrow then we shall have to go b ack to the 29th Mess. It will be very different to our own but maybe only for a short time. All our tents are down   &amp;  a number of the buildings &ndash; We are leaving six large huts (Wards) for 29th C.C.S.   &amp;  we are to help them until further orders.</p>
<p>We had great fun Toboggan yesterday probably our last time. We shall miss the fun very much. The snow is very hard, real ice   &amp;  getting less, so unless another fall of snow comes soon, no chance to continue it.</p>
<p>Dorothy is still on Night-duty. Had a bust time in 29th C.C.S. last night. Sorry she had her leave, we could have had it together if not.</p>
