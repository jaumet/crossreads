 In Lone Pine in an angl of trench the wither wizen dead hand of a corps protrud itself from it grave . To this hand some of the boy affix a placard " Give it backshees " and put a few piastr in the rot palm . After Bullecourt . " Come out " . Our hors were wait and we canter back to camp . Later poor tire exhaust men just out of hell , start to come in one by one . Then one call out to other plod in . " There 's hot tea" . The patho of it !
