We bearers move up to-night on the South of the Somme in the vicinity of Proyart for a pretty big stunt.
Thursday 22 August
At 10.30 last night we moved to a quarry on the outskirts of Mericourt sur Somme, where we arrived at 2 a.m. this morning. Everything is now quiet the line is not too far away. Rumour hath it that some troops went over this morning took Bray sur Somme. Certainly the artillery here was active. Very hot all day Fritz has been shelling the village all day off on. We are camping in the village, in a cellar, to-night.
