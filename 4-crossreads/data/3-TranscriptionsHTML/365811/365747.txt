<p>4.<br/>About a month ago I paid another short visit to Paris. It is a wonderful city &ndash; some of the buildings and boulevardes are beautiful &ndash; and I am sorry to hear the Huns have been bombarding the place with that mysterious long range gun.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of our Australians now have seen Paris &ndash; leave there was very liberal. The city retains a lot of its old brightness in spite of the war &ndash; the authorities seeming to be anxious to make it as pleasant as possible for the many troops &ndash; especially colonials &ndash; visiting there on leave. I went to the Opera one evening and saw Faust &ndash; the Opera House is of course a magnificent building and I hope it never stops a bomb &ndash; hostile bombing is <strike>of course</strike> part of the routine</p>
