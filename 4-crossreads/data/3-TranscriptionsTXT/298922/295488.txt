 Speaking of Comforts Fund reminds me that the Depot at KANTARA has been burnt down which is bad luck. The Y.M.C.A. are here on the beach "Ubiquitous" &amp; the old PIANO too, but the treble notes have been rather damaged by a bomb. Those wearying music lessons were worth it all, to be able to strum now. 
 General  Chauvel  who has the Division &amp; one time our BRIGADIER inspected us carefully this morning. He looks  to  older as we all do &amp; shall do if the end does not come soon. Our Rest!!! will be up in a week then back to the front line again. 
 SODA TABLETS &amp; the issued RAW LIME JUICE pushed us through by taking the rust off IRONS, BITS etc.
