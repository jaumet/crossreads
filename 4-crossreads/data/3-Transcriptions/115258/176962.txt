<p>Am so glad you had the trip to Sydney in the car - it would do you all so much good and ought to have been great fun. I&#39;ll bet Fred swanked some Driving down to Sydney in his car to attend the sheep sales. Don&#39;t you know! eh what! It will be a great lift for us Father getting all those ewes of Cousin Jocelyn&#39;s - will they have to come round in the train by Wang or is that new line open for traffic to Dubbo yet? Coming in off out post last night I saw two Jackalls and three gazell. I wish they would have a truse here for a couple of days and let me go poking round with a &nbsp;rifle and camera. Hal would enjoy being here, there are tons of animals and birds to study. <s>here</s>&nbsp;Will stop now and write again when the rest of the the mail gets in. Must go and fill up my sand bag with horse feed for tomorrow. Love to Father and Fred &amp; yourself.</p>
