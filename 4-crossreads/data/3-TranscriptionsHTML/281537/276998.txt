<p>30/8/15 Alexandria<br/>natives we notice as before different from those inland in dress etc.  A busy port this &ndash; transports all around.  The high masts of Arab dhows sticking up everywhere.  Went into Alexandria at 10 am to purchase a supply of morphia for our doctor and succeeded in getting a good supply 200 grains cost &pound;3-5d.  Round the docks here there is great squalour but there are better class places about two miles away.  Passed through the small shops and dirty crowded native quarter.  All very dirty.  The colour of the people is different to those at Cairo but too many armies have passed thro' Alexandria to expect its race to remain pure.  In the Mohamed Ali square are Steins Oriental Stores &amp; the Bourse &ndash; fine buildings.  Then part of the city modern fine and clean.  Great variety of colours everywhere.  Returned to ship lunch.</p>
