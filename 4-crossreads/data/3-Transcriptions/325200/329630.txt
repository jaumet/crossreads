<p>Sept 26th<br/>There is a sudden rumour afloat that the Brigade is going to Kantara next thursday  &amp;  from there to &amp;  Maadi to Heliopolis y Zeitun S upper Egypt to try conclusions with the Senussi once again. It seems to have a sort of  indefineable sense of being right somehow but as yet I can get no reliable information concerning it.<br/>Anyhow Heliopolis would be like coming home again, and even Upper Egypt &ndash; in the wilds of Sohag  &amp;  places such as that &ndash; would not be so bad; there at any rate be something to look</p>
