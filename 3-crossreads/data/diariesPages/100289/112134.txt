wild tonight raided the canteens practically pulling some down, there was no occasion for an act of that description for the prices charged were as reasonable as could be expected here. All the mules we have been carrying on our strength for some time, were today struck off our strength entrained for Alexandria.
Paid 100 piastres (1.0.6.)
Wednesday 7.6.16
March with full packs up.
Since our arrival in this camp the food has been very poor; practically the worst food we have had during our stay in Egypt; complaints have been lodged by a few of the boys we are in hopes of improvement from date. Piquet again to-night
