Or spread the oil that's issued usTo keep our steelwork clean,Upon a slice of issue bread,And save the margarine.Or pass it to the HMCInstead of number minesTo cure some sole from agonyWhen he unwisely dines.
It must take quite a lot of iron,To make those ordnance razors,But what about the biscuit tins,Allowed to go to blazes.I think theres still a lot to learnOf various ways of saving,And after twenty years of warThey'll know that I'm not raving
