<p>gradually slopes downwards to the Battle Line &amp; ends in a maze of marshes &amp; dykes which dot the whole country hereabouts. A battery of heavy guns is consistently firing away on our right &amp; so far the Germans have not answered for fear of disclosing their position.</p>
<p>I will try &amp; give a description of the new British Engine which at the present time is the talk of the world.</p>
<p>Imagine a machine almost as large as a railway engine, on one gigantic caterpillar wheel on either side, heavily armoured &amp; with small &amp; big guns inside to say nothing of numbers of machine guns.</p>
<p>They can cross a 12ft trench easily &amp; demolish an ordinary house by running against it or smash trees down. They can do a frightful lot of damage &amp; generally work in liason with the infantry. They go ahead &amp; destroy the German machine gun emplacements &amp; so enable our troops to advance without serious loss. In my opinion they have destroyed hundreds of German machine guns since they have been used. The Germans are terrified of them &amp; well they might be, as nothing but a direct hit of a high explosive shell can hurt them. They are like a big tortoise, they way they crawl in &amp; out of the various places. Altogether I fancy they are a great asset to the Army &amp; save a great lot of life.</p>
