All the hedges & trees are beginning to bud though, so in about a month's time everything aught to be livening up.  My, Dad must have had a good time up the Mountains.  He has seen the Jenolan Caves at last.  I must do the trip when I come back.  I believe Mrs Valentine is very nice.  The Boys are not bad.  A bit hot-headed & a chap has to be very careful how he approaches them.  But do not say anything.  We have never had a row & get on very well with both of them.How are Harry's Youngsters going to be kept.  Poor Kiddies.  Aunt Annie aught to be able to give one of them a Home anyway & have them educated.Will be interested to Know How George's Sports Club succeeded at the Carnival.  I was grieved to learn that Walter was such a fool again.  Ida will never trust Him now.  You must congratulate Her for me on the Birth of the little Girl.  Walter has no doubt made a good Husband as far as Property etc.  It is a pity he is so foolish.  You will not find many men who will stick all the time.  Now Mum it is pretty late & I have yet to write to Dad.  Nothing happens & we still jog on
