<p>It&#39;s all rush and bustle in the underground railways, and it was necessary to keep a pretty cool head or you would be carried to the wrong place.&nbsp; I generally used to get in the train which was most popular with the public, and then get out when the train began to get a bit empty, and catch a bus to where I wished to go.&nbsp; Hours and hours I spent in going to places which other people did in a few minutes, just because I was too big a fool to ask.&nbsp; People have asked me out to dinner and I would start on my journey leaving ample time to arrive early, I would miss the dinner and lose the friends through my stupidity.&nbsp; They would write to me giving definite instructions as to trains, trams, or busses, so that it would be impossible for me to do the wrong thing.&nbsp; I would start on the journey and then discover that I had left their letter in my other tunic.</p>
<p>If all went fairly well, and I was successful in arriving at the house, then my whole evening&#39;s enjoyment would be spoilt by the thought of my missing the last 58 car.</p>

<p>A chap in the office had worked out travelling in London to a fine art.&nbsp; He knew the cheapest and most satisfactory way to get to anywhere.&nbsp; He even knew the times of the day that the underground trains would not be packed.&nbsp; He was a marvel.&nbsp; He ought to have given up office and gone in for &quot;guide&quot; business.&nbsp; I got &quot;route&quot; instructions from him on several occasions and started out with the firm determination to &quot;carry&quot; them out to the letter, but in a weak moment I listened to anothers advice, and as usual made a mess of things.</p>

<p>On one occasion I received a letter from a friend at Finsbury Park, asking me to go out there at her house at 4.p.m. the following day.&nbsp; She gave me full instructions how to get there, stating that from the office to her house would occupy not more than twenty minutes.</p>
<p>I left the office the following day at about a quarter past three to ensure my arrival there at the time appointed.&nbsp; Of course on looking for her</p>
