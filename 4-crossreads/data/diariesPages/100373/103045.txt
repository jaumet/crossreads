the Plough, Cassiopia, [indecipherable] Plieades, Orion, the night was so beautifully clear and starry.

Jan 11th Mon.
On going up on deck this morning, I witnessed a very pretty scene as the sun was rising just over the mountains on the Arabian side of the Gulf of Suez. The P & O steamer Malura passed close by us this morning. There is great jubilation amongst the troops as they expect to get letters by the mail which the Malura is carrying to Port Said.
Reached Port Suez 8 p.m.
The Suez Canal.
The town of Suez lies several miles from the entrance to the canal. A narrow strip of land from the dock forms a road across the lagoon.

After making preparations such as fixing the searchlights over the bows of the steamers, etc. we enter the canal, passing the large first station which has a statue of De Lesseps, its famous engineer.

The sandy desert stretches as far as the eye can reach. It is very peculiar and forms the main characteristic of the scenery along this wonderful and highly interesting engineering feat.

With a length of 87 miles, 20 yds in width and a depth of 25 ft the canal has 13 signalling stations all connected by telegraph and announcing the coming and going of the various steamers.
