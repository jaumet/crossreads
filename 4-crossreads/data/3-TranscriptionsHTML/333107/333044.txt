<p>Tues May 28<br/>Glory: Alleluia. Got some more mail today. 3 letters from Lill and 1 from Mother. Everything going good.</p>
<p>Was up before the S.M.O. today but he left me on the old mark B2A. I may as well give up any hope of getting Home now. Finished Letter 23. <br/>Wed 29<br/>It's pretty solid here putting a man on Fatigue Party's after having been confined to Bed for a month. My opinion of the Aust Med Service has fallen very much during the last few months. One quack puts you down for one thing and another one for another. Anyhow it's nice to know that I'm going to improve. I wouldn't like to think I was going to be an invalid.</p>
<p>Wed May 29th (cont)</p>
<p>Was told off to report to Board Room for my Final Board at 10.45, but after fooling around till about 3.30, they said I would not be wanted till Friday. I'll be glad to get it over and end the suspense.</p>
<p>Thur 30</p>
<p>Things about the same. Most of the chaps I came down here with are on Boat Rolls. The weather is keeping glorious. There are plenty of Yankee sailors about the Town and they are a very likely looking crowd.</p>
<p>The war news is not looking very cheerful. Fritz is advancing rapidly on Paris.</p>
