<p>garrison but the dispositions have now been altered and the post is a 2 Coy one with the other Coy Commdr. (senior to me) as O.C. Post.  It means much less work but also less responsibility &amp; consequently it is not nearly so interesting.  It is strange that I am now camped in the identical spot where the 17th Bn. H.Q. were camped for 6 weeks.</p>
<p>I think I am about drained out of news.</p>
<p>Best love to all,<br/>Affectionately yours<br/>C.R. Lucas, Capt.</p>
