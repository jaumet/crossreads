 January, 1915 Monday 25 Out of sight of land again. The Red Sea is between 80, &amp; 100 miles wide here, &amp; the Arabian Coast is a hostile one. We pass several P &amp; O boats en route Australia &amp; Singapore &amp; I wish I was able to send you greetings by them. Nights are very bright now &amp; heavy dew falls &ndash; We have lost the Southern Cross &amp; have instead the Great Bear &amp; the North Star. Regret to say 4 of my men refused to be vaccinated &amp; must be sent back &amp; replaced by others. Later above men changed their minds.
