 [indecipherable] today Letter from Laura &amp; Charlie all seemed well- Posted you some verses written by a Bushie now in the Pay office, being wounded too badly for further Trench work- It is the high qualities of the Rank &amp; file which keep our Regiments going &amp; I always feel how extra good the officers  should be  to lead such men- Anticipated being away ere this but here we are still as no water available at our outpost at present. Climate is lovely here, now warm days &amp; cold nights.
