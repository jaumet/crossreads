there is no harm done. But if Vol gets putting any extra in paper tell him to be very careful ras I can get into serious trouble over it. Of course I know he is no but then he may not realise how strict they are about . If it got about in the paper that I squared the major not to report me wounded, how do you think we would get on? I sent some photos home to Laurel that I had taken in London told her to take one down to you so hope you will like it. Well dear I'm no good at letter writing so will close now with fondest love to Vol, baby you from your loving brother Hal. I sent you a card letter for your birthday. Hope you got them in time.
