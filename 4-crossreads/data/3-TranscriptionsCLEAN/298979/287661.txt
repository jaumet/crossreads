  
 On seeing the Sentry stop, - silently taking in the whole picture, his first salutation was, Ah! Ther! Yis! hic [dash] At las! hic [dash]. 
 The Sentrys attitude at once stiffened, & he gave vent to his feelings of wrath in calm, but hard words. What a beautiful picture you present! What an honor to be associated for a fortnight with a "thing" like you! What a splendid advertisement for Australia! What a glorious way to support the word of a gentleman! 
 You know our compact we both part company here & now.!! The road is wide enough for two!!!. 
 Opening his then fish like eyes to their widest extent, & realising that he would have to pick up some other friend, he poured out strings of pure Australian Camp language so fluently that graded him at once as an expert. 
 He evidently horrified the onlookers & the woman in the Office at once beat a hasty retreat to the room beyond. The Sentry replied:- I personally have so often before heard the whole of those words & epithets, that to me they mean absolutely nothing, but your acts have only made me feel how foolish I was ever to have had anything to do with you, but for your own sake if not for the fact that you are an Australian please recollect that these people should be spared particularly as you yourself could not have gained admittance to this house had it not been the fact that your conduct was guaranteed by the word of a gentleman. 
 Clenching his fists & straightening himself up he ejaculated You [dash dash dash] & took up an attitude as if to strike a blow, However the Sentry was quite prepared & looking the man straight in the eyes walked towards him, & passed him, at the same time saying to the Manager, If I am wanted I will be in the Smoke room. 
 The man, glowering, turned with an oath, & demanded his bill.
