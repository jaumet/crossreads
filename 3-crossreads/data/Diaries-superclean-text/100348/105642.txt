Struck camp yesterday and marched 9 miles or so, crossed the River Ancre and halted at this village Buire-Sur-Corbie. A very cold day. We have been issued with large sheepskin gloves they are exellent; in this frosty weather. This village is no class. Fooled round all day scraping the mud off ourselves and off our equipment.

Left Buire, and got aboard motor lorries. They conveyed us through Amiens to the town of Flesselles, distance about 30 kilos I have a good possie on a heap of straw where I hope to have a real good sleep.
