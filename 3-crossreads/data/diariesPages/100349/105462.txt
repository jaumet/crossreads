Hazebrouk at 12.noon. Rejoined the Battalion at Sec-Bois. I'm not a full wake- up yet.
30/8/17.
Having to drop back into the old rut has been very hard. Have been suffering the last few days, what the boys call "Leavitis" a curious malady. A sort of enlarged "morning after the night before". A huge new Hun Bombing ?plane called a "Gotha" came over the place promiscuously. Missed our billet fortunately and was brought down a few miles away. This unlooked for reception has helped me to remember that there is a war raging hereabouts.
1st September. 1917.
Warned for the Line today inspected in Heavy Marching order. We shall not be long now.
