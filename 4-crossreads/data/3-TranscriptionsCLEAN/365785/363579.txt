  
 an easy style if possible but really one must converse with French people to learn to speak the language properly. It is great sport sailing in the harbour, I had a jaunt this morning, we went out fishing & I sailed the boat - we caught 29 fish and had a very enjoyable time. Give my kindest regards to the Doctor & my love to Margaret & the other two please.
