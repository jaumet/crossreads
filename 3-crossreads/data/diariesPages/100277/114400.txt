Well this is about the finish of the little book you must take no notice of the scribble for you have no idea of the difficulties I have had to put up with in the daily scribble, wet mud, rain, cold, personal discomfort all but still I have never failed to put my days entry into it hope it reaches home safely It is now raining heavily by way of a change, Holmes is almost ready to go so I must cut it short say goodbye for a time I will send the others along as I complete them for I intend to keep it going until I either get knocked out or the war finishes, at this date both Len I are safe we are out behind the firing line for a few days so don't worry "Finish."
