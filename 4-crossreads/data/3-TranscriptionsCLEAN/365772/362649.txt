  
 rules & regulations. I had my photo taken in Heliopolis before leaving Cairo in company with some friends of mine most of whom returned here with me, they the photos are being sent to mother one is for her one for you & Dad & the other I want sent to Ulmarra please let Mother know will you dear I dont think I told her how to cut them up. I cant explain the sensation I feel here, now right alongside of me are two men on post & every now & then they will have 5 rounds rapid at "Johns" loopholes you see them jammed up against the bag legs spread out putting the 5 in. It puts me in mind of a Red Indian picture one sees at the Pictures, then the Turk will sweep our sandbag tops with a machine gun it is a fine life but damnably dangerous. Our boys are fine men to fight with, cool calm & sometimes they get collected when a shell hits them. The last big attack we had the boys were sadly cut up as you will see by the casualty lists. Major Scobie killed with them & other good men. General Walker "so the lads say" shed tears & said "by God these men can fight".
