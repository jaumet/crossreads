<p>them at my London "Home" No 5 Matham Grove, East Dulwich SE 22.<br/>I intend having another try for a Pilot very soon, as I am sure I would make a good job of it if I only could get a start at it.<br/>Was so please in your letter to hear of your wee grandson.  Hope Daddy dear it is not making you feel so very old, for I dont want you to be changed at all when I come home again.  Lets all hope &amp; trust that it will be before 1918 is among the past &amp; gone years.</p>
