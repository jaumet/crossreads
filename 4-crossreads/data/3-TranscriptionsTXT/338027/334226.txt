Monday, 16 August, 1915A quiet day but terribly hot, most of our patients were Englishmen suffering from sunstroke - There is a sniper that cannot be located not far from us and he gets a lot of men coming down the sap, these snipers are plucky they have bushes on their backs and their rifles & faces are covered with leaves.  There is a well in the enemy lines and the road by is just one mass of Turkish dead piled on each other, one of our machine guns has the range & gets them when they come to fill their water bottles.  Our guns did a lot of damage today & the enemy sent up two Taubes but they only come out when ours are not about.  Fleas are causing us a lot of trouble sleep is a hard task Chailak Dere is flies by day & fleas by night.
Tuesday, 17 August, 1915I went up into the trenches to-day & on to the highest peak the view was wonderful but as an order has come from hdqtrs that diaries must not contain any thing that would be of information to the Turks, I will not write anything about our position.  The Turks have published an Aust diary, translated and distributed it right throughout the Turkish army.  I had to go to Anzac at night to bring up all kits stores etc it took a convoy of 15 mules and we had to run the gauntlet along the beach where a Turkish machine gun plays.  What we are going to do with our stores is a mystery but we were all glad of our kits & blankets , as we were sure of at least one warm sleep free from lice & fleas till they find them out.
