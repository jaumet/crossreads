 It's all such a waste, &amp; then poor Scott, he was such a fine chap so full of the joy of living &amp; such a fine Soldier quite one of the finest of the younger men we  could  had, it cut me up terribly.  I used to lie in the Hospital &amp; look round &amp; think that we could spare any ten of them rather than him, but its all part of this bloody business of war, how I loathe it all &amp; yet how necessary it is to keep on &amp; on till we have won once &amp; for all, nothing could be more tragic than the thought of a patched up peace with the impending horror of it all again in a few years. 
 Am too gloomy to write more now.
