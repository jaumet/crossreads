Autographs Torquay  17/8/16
Sometime when you think of the days that have goneIn prosperity, even in failure,Though our friendship was shortStill spare just a thoughtFor the comrades from sunny Australia.
We're glad to know our English friendsExtend the welcome handAnd hope as time goes on they'll notforget Australia's band.

Words may be false tearsbut unrecorded untruthsbut eyes are the windows of the soul
