<p>The most remarkable thing I saw yesterday was an aeroplane duel, 3 0r 4 of our planes, tackled a Hun.  One of ours turned four or 5 summersaults, just like a sheet of paper caught in the wind, dropping a few thousand feet; He then made a magnificent recovery, making for the aerodrome.  He must be wounded.  Another Hun plane brought down in flames.</p>
<p>12.11.1916   Somme, continued.  A fearful mishap at Bty last night.  Gr Allen Gr Hassell, Corp Fairey and Bdr Beeks all killed.  The last two mentioned were M.M. men.  The 101st Howitzer Bty had a premature, wounding 2 of their own men.  More reinforcements arrived.  Fine but foggy.  Rumoured that we move out of action on the 17th inst.  Our men that were killed yesterday were all Bty H.Q.  They were in a dug out; A.77 M.M. shell hit it, another Bdr (Horan) was in the same dugout, He was not even scratched.  Horse lost in shell hole last night, destroyed, impossible to get him out.  Colonel Anderson, in wagon lines today.  A stunt on our right, 4.30 P.M.</p>
