<p>being played here. Adjourned to a caf&eacute; for some coffee (served in vase like glass) cheese &amp;c. The people love to get together and yarn over their coffee. The liquors at the bar were rhum and a few other spirits and different liquers. Had a glass of Benedictine in a glass twice as large as our liquer glasses. Much struck with the great courtesy of these folk both to strangers &amp; among themselves. Always bowing, exchanging good wishes and giving thanks. Left in a passenger train at 5 pm and had a cavalry Major and an Engineer for companions &ndash; both Eton men &amp; good fellows. A slow journey travelling all night and reached Amiens about 3 a.m. Got a room at Hotel Belfort &ndash; a fine place and had some coffee and rolls before turning in. feet very sore and very fatigued. <br/>Rouen is a pretty place and those who are stationed there like it very much. It has a background somewhat like Marseilles. Sanitation is weak. Streets full of fine looking girls and women. Saw a peasant girl with little white nun-like cap on her head. Quite happy on the arm of her bucolic lover</p>
