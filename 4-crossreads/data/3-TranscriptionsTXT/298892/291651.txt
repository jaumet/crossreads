There were (one word blacked out by censor).. on the parade yesterday and this ( one line blacked out by censor)...With the best of wishes for the new year and love to all at home and next doorYour loving sonEugene.
P.S. I received the parcel with the knee pads, soap and tinned Pate and it was very welcome. The soap was particularly useful and the paste was delicious and a welcome change from bread and jam. The photo of Kit was a very good one. She no longer looks like a flapper and has developed into quite a handsome young lady. I also received Aunt Kate's note and was glad to hear that they are all well. I submitted it to our interpreter but he said he didn't think it was French although it might be the patois of some of the country centres.Tell her it as much as I can do to get off
