On town patrol 1.30 till 6 p.m.  Helped to keep back the crowd in front of the Greek Club, while they were waiting for the ex-Prime Minister of Greece, Venizelos, to arrive.  There was great excitement when he came, in a motor-car.  The Greeks yelled "Zeito, Zeito" (which means Hurrah), hats were waved and thrown into the air as if they would never be needed again, and a great bobbery was caused.  Venizelos is very popular with the people as he is in favour of joining in the war on the side of the Allies.
23rdIn the gardens most of the day.  Crossed the Nile in a rowing boat.  Had a joke with the boatman and frightened the life out of him almost.  On duty at the Esbekieh Caracol at 10 p.m.  Had two tables to sleep on, but owing to the native police arresting a lot of women, we did not sleep a wink, as the women squealed and jabbered like hyenas all night, and fought amongst themselves.  Next morning two Arab boys were brought in, & soundly flogged by the chief.
