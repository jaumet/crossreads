21/1/18 Crieff
Changed trains at Gleneagles and had a rather wet wait there in an old carriage. Came into Crieff about noon and was met by Audrey Craig who drove with me to Benveula Ferntower Road and there we met Mrs Craig and Sheila. Most thoroughly kind and hospitable people who are free and unaffected. After lunch went for a long walk with the two girls on very slippery and icy roads. Snow over all and a chilly enveloping mist. Returned before dark and after dinner spent the whole evening in conversation and relating anecdotes and experiences. In the bed they very kindly put a pig ? a hot water bottle and in such comfort it was not hard to get good sleep and to rest without disturbance until the knock of the bringer of the morning hot water.
