  
 Dear Frank The cigarettes you so kindly sent me arrived in good condition & were very welcome as I had run out of smokes & could not buy any as I was busy strafing Huns, & dodging what they sent over in return, & where that goes on there are no Canteens or shop's so you can imagine how much I appreciate your gift. Now I am out of it for a little while doing some work at our waggon lines in the rear & to-day I saw a little boy driving a cart with four dogs pulling it abreast, for they make dogs draw all sorts of things in this country. Best love to you all, Yours sincerely Horace C. Lovegrove
