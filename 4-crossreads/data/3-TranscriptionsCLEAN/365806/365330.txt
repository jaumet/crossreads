  
 Candahar Barracks. Tidworth. 22/11/16. 
 Dear Sir, 
 I received your letter containing your cards of introduction and I wish to thank you very sincerely for your kindness & for the trouble you have taken on my behalf. 
 I met Keith shortly after I arrived at Rollestone camp in the middle of November and of course we were delighted.  He was looking very fit & seemed to have grown considerably since I last him.  He was then at the Officers Training School at Tidworth to which I also went the next week.  We were together there for a fortnight; after that Keith returned to Rollestone and expected to go across to France in the next few days.  The weather is fairly cold & snow has already fallen, which was a novel spectacle to me, as I have never seen before. 
 Hoping yourself & family are all in the best of health I remain yours sincerely Allan.
