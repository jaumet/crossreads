 Wednesday 8/8/17 couldn't enter up much in my Diary have been too much upset after leaving London & the messing up job of getting here & two days with no Rations to go on with. Came as far as Hailsbruck then back here to Lynde. Will be here some time yet. Bat. away but doesn't it hurt, almost wish I hadn't gone. Couldn't see Maude hadn't time. Its a beautiful time going to & Back from Blighty I don't think, am amongst some cranks here talk war all day or else play an infernal accordion all the time talk about nerve stretchers these take the band curse them.Thunderstorms every afternoon & lightening very bad. The women here very frightened of it, hope I get my other stripe soon.
