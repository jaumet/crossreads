<p>New From Home</p>
<p>I have received no letter from home now for over 3 months.</p>
<p>now it is seven months ago since I received a letter from home&nbsp; This shows what sort of postal system we have in the army our letters [Hopping?] from one place to another. There must be 50 letters for me Some where&nbsp; But where God only knows&nbsp; I am sure I Dont know where they are.</p>
