<p>4-4-16<br/>Tue 4th<br/>This afternoon Les &amp; I tried again to get into communication with Ezbet-Soo-Doon but with no success &amp; I am now satisfied that it is impossible to get them from here;  We seldom get papers out here &amp; everything is very quiet;  Mick O'Donnell applied for a transfer into Remount Unit this morning &amp; I am trying to get Les Ryan into this Regt. in place of him</p>
<p>5.4.16<br/>Wed 5th<br/>The natives killed a cow here for us today &amp; it was rather interesting watching them.  they first cut its throat &amp; then shoved a stick up the leg between the flesh &amp; skin &amp; put in about half an hour blowing air into it to make it skin easy, they were the whole morning doing it;<br/>Everything else the same as usual</p>
