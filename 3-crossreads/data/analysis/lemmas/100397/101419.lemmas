I can tell you that they will not find it a veri flatter one , Say Sweetman is the sort we want over here No doubt they will present him with the Royal Human Societi 's medal Well I show the account of the rescu to one of the Lone Pine men and remark that , Sweetman would no doubt receiv the R.H.S.M. and would be just the sort to pick up a V.C. or D.C.M. in action . " He said oh yes . Perhap . " in my opinion it harder to win the R.H.S.M. than either V.C. or D.C.M. " ?
