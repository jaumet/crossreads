<p>whispers about certain things connected with our work -  then lapse into silence again. Then some ones horse stumbles and a smothered oath is heard and something to the effect that he has got four blanky feet cant he keep on them does he want as many feet as a blanky centipede before it is safe to ride him? Etc. Etc. Then he lapses into silence.<br/>As I go along busy with my own particular thoughts, a horses head appears one side or the other followed by the neck then the rider sitting bolt upright and sound asleep. A sudden lurch forward brings him up with a jerk and he opens his eyes and stares around bewildered not knowing for the moment where he is. He can see troops all about and it takes some time to locate his bearings before he reins back and rejoins his proper section. He is very much awake now and determines to keep awake but the enforced silence soon takes effect and off he goes again. Generally when they come abreast I lean over and give him a sharp push which has a magical effect. Then the officer will suddenly increase the pace and go forward and get lost among some of the leading sections. He comes back and rather unnecessarily tells me that he dozed off, we make a joke about it and silence reigns</p>
