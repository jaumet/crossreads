<p>IV<br/>a fairly wild &amp; woolly time now.<br/>It looks as though poor Servia is to be subjected to a worse time than she has already been through if that were possible, unless there is something startling in Asquith's speech in the house which he was to deliver yesterday and in which it was forecasted he was going to state that Serbia would get material assistance from several points. What those points are I cannot for the life of me see, but we are in interested expectancy of what the above statement will disclose. However, all this will be ancient history by the time this letter reaches you.<br/>This mail will be the last I expect before Christmas. It seems a futile wish to wish anyone a Merry Christmas in these rotten times, but what there is, may you all have your double share. I am writing the Mother separately this mail &ndash;<br/>Trusting you are keeping quite well,<br/>I remain, dear Father, Your affect Son<br/>Terence W. Garling</p>
