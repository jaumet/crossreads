Saturday 19 May 1917.
No sight of land yet this morning.  Everyone looking out for it all the same all day. NO RESULT
On no duty today and feel benefit of being above deck in fresher air. 
A good day at sea all the day, today.  Feeling, good oh! now.
At 12.15 p.m. we followed the Cruiser "Encounter" in a decided Nth Wstly direction.
Believe we are fairly close to land compared to before.
Close to "Encounter" all day.
Sing-song up on deck in evening
G.S.S. Crmn & I thinking where we wold be at this time if on week-end leave in Vic.
10 days. now since leaving Pt. Melb. pier.
