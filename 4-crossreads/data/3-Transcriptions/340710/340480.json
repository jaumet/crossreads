<p>Chap VII.<br/>France</p>
<p>Strazelle. France<br/>4.4.16<br/>And so at last we are here, we are really in France and to-night I sit in a billet in an old world village not so many miles from the line and the guns shake the walls ceaselessly.<br/>Somewhere a concertina is pumping out some of the time-worn rags and now and again a Frenchman's voice can be heard singing one of those many songs the war has given to these poor people- they are pathetic songs telling of the devastation of their lands, of the loss of their dear ones.<br/>We landed at Marseilles and so by train through the Rhone Valley, the vineyard country and then skirting Paris to Calais and then here.  Every <strike>thing</strike> where the women are wearing black, everywhere</p>
