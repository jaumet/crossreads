13/2/19 MarcinelleIn our area the Brigade cinema has set up and tonight it was going and a band was playing. Had an early mess and went with Dr David to the Cirque to see Carmen. The building was ramshackle and draughty and all plastered with advertisements. All things considered the players put up a good performance. Our seats cost us 3.75 and as much smoking as one liked was permitted. The last act was fairly good but, in falling, poor Carmen's legs went well up into the air. We walked down to a cafe for some coffee but it was dreadful stuff nearly pure chicory and tasted bad. Canal and locks here all frozen over and covered with ice. Reached billet at 10.30 - the reek of stale air and cooking fills the whole house. Slept soundly all night.
