to try ourselves on the longer ranges then the fun commenced, Raffan was first to go down on the 100 yards, he is a first class shot, he scored the high tally of 8 out of a possible 20 how we all laughed Raffan was as mad as a March hare, Len was next down he got a doubtful 10, Jack Hayes I fancied ourselves after this display I was next down I thought I would allow for a degree of wind, I did I got the best score 11, well this sort of ting went on, all rotten scores, till we moved to the 200 yards then the pantomime started Cameron got a wash out, so did I the best score was a miserable 7, when they waved me a washout I was nearly speechless for I could have sworn I held the rifle as steady as a rock we could not make out what on earth was the cause of it, for all were shooting absolutely rotten, the only thing was the day which turned out at 12 oclock rotten heavy shower of mist were drifting across it
