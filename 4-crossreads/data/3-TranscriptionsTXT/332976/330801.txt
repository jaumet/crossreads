March 19172nd.   Our lads took another part of the enemy lines & captured about 13 prisoners, but also lost about half a dozen to the Germans.  Some of the prisoners passed us on their way back this morning.  They were the 8th Bavarians & looked very haggard & worn.  I got into conversation with one of them, & he seemed quite confident that the war would be finished in two months.I was down in Millerson Post this afternoon & Fritz was shelling it very heavy & had been doing so practically all day.  Our lads suffered a few casualties but nothing to speak of.
