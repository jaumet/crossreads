Villers-Bretonneux
Found that our headquarters was a dirty and stuffy dugout crowded to the utmost limits. The 21st Bn - Sullivan's coy. ? was in the place when we arrived. Our men gradually commenced to come into their positions. It was dark, the trenches were full of slush and of water and many of the bivouacs had fallen in. So all hands had to set to work to try to make their places into some sort of shape. We had to put on a fatigue party to carry timber up to the place where a new power buzzer is being put in. Our Yanks are very novel with their accent and their ?figuring, guessing, outfits, c c. They are as keen as mustard and full of buck. A very great fillip to our morale.
