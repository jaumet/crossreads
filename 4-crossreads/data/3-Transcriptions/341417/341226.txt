<p>Dear Drs</p>
<p>It is some while since I had a letter from you but I heard that measles, smallpox &amp; probably a few more of the 7 ancient plagues are keeping you busy.</p>
<p>I am still in the land of unpleasantness &amp; doing well.</p>
<p>Jaundice is common here &amp; monotony of diet gets the credit of its origin.<br/>I understand it differs from the ordinary complaint, in that the intestines are the seat of the trouble. It is mostly accompanied by diarrhoea with the usual yellow skin &amp; eyes.<br/>"Played-out" swells the sick reports. Mumps &amp; Measles add to the list.</p>
<p>The Anzac Medical Ass'n, is the latest institution here. I cannot say who they have on their black list. Probably it is the Turks &amp; The Ordnance Dept.</p>
<p>Pow-wows are held regularly every 2nd Sunday &ndash; Shelling permitting.<br/>All the high-browed specialists</p>
