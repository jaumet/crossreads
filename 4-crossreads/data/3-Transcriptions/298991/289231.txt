<p>Friday Oct 26th<br/>Every one is very busy preparing to going ashore. Leave is granted from 9 am till 11 pm. We got punctually off the boat at 9 am &amp; walked up to the centre of Capetown, a distance of about 2 miles. Capetown is a very nice City, with a fairly large population chiefly consists of Dutch &amp; half castes, &amp; I can safely say, that every other nationality is represented, of course, bar those of the enemy.</p>
<p>The streets are nice wide &amp; cleanly kept. There are some very fine buildings here especially the G.P.O. etc. The people seem to be on very good terms with the Australians. My pal &amp; I were rather fortunate. A Lady, by name Mrs Morton invited us out to an Hotel she is staying at. She is a Tasmanian Lady &amp; is down from Johannesburg on a holiday. We had a very pleasant time at the Hotel (boarding only), of course we felt out of place sitting down to a six &amp; eigth course meal, everything was made very homely for us.</p>
<p>Went to Camp Bay in the afternoon, it is about an hour &amp; a half in the tram, very picturesque and a most pleasant ride, supposed to be one of the best in the world. After tea we went to the Tivoli Theatre.</p>
