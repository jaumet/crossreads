a rest camp at 2 am in the morning after watering feeding horses, threw blankets on ground snatched a few hours sleep.
14 - 7 - 16 Friday
I arose early this morning am feeling dead beat. It has turned out to be biggest day I have yet had.All officers are on work away from the Camp I have all the Transport to arrange control.To say that things are mixed would be to express it mildly. Units of all descriptions are arriving one can only wonder however they sort them out of course we are at the base of the Somme operations.Our temporary camp is in a hollow between mountain ranges which are carpeted with green. It gets frightfully cold at night time I can imagine what it must be like in winter time. We are moving out to the front in a few days time.This has been a most interesting journey although full of hardships. For instance we have to camp on the ground wet or fine, I think it is nearly always rainingMy little horse has cracked up I am forced to spell him. I have been doing 7 or so miles a day.
