it is an old, but truthful saying,"even the dark cloud has its silver lining"And while the battle to and fro is swayingSomeone is watching o'er your fate and mine.
You hear the call for stretcher bearers singingFrom mouth to mouth sounds forth the first alarmAnd soon strong, willing arms are bringingThe wounded quickly from the zone of harm
At "Red Cross Stations" nimble hands are waitingTo dress your wounds & ease your stinging painPerhaps you have some soft voice sweetly stating"the fight is won, you have not fought in vain".
And then comes sleep! Perhapschance you may be dreamingOf flowers, sunshine, and the hum of bees.While some kind nurse with eyes of love all beamingWhispers the words "saved by the A.M.C.s"
