  
 time but things are beginning to get a bit monotonous now that we have almost completed our first week aboard. 
 Tues. 17th. Aug. Sighted land for first time after leaving Port Phillip & incidentally had our last glimpse of  Aust. for some time to come - That is the ones lucky enough to come back. I think that the old band at the Sydney wharf ought to cut out their "This is the Life" tune & substitute the old "Kathleen M." "It may be for years - It may be for  keeps " Our sight of the "Land of Promise" is just a faint outline of Cape Lewin on the horizon at 6. A.M. Believe ship has been keeping out of the trade route (some say 100 miles) "Goodbye Australia for a while!" 
 Thurs. 19th: - Still on our monotonous trip &  still weeks  to go. Ship has got a big list to starboard & they say it is the coal causing it. Getting mean with the food & water. Most of us are buying tinned fish to eat & our money does not go very far as they only pay us a shilling a day aboard ship. Experienced our roughest weather as yet yesterday. 
 Sat. 21st .Aug. Starting to get hot; could not sleep below last night went on deck. Will have it proper
