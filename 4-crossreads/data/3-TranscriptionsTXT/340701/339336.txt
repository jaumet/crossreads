9-3-16 about 11.0 AM.I have been sick twice this morning & had to camp on Deck last night simply couldn't trust myself downstairs.  Joe Martin is sea sick too, one fellow said this crowd was the quietest lot of Soldiers he had seen - good reason why about 3/4 of them were sick.  Their faces are perfectly green.  None of the Middies are sick.  All the Officers were very bad in fact they put Tonkin in the Hospital which made the boys very cheerfull.  We have a very tin[?] Kiffley piano on board but there seem to be plenty of very good players. A chap on board with a one string
