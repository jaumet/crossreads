  
 However got back all right.  Cleaned up and got to bed about 9 and slept well.  Foggy. 
 15.4.18 Up at 5.30 and left at 7.30 for same job.  Took a roundabout way and picked up a can of paraffin.  Usual work and things very quiet.  Met Laurie and worked till 3 o'clock and back same way salvaging an old woman who was evacuating on way.  Home tired and fowl etc. for tea with pudding afterwards.  Walked to Morbecque for canteens in evening but no luck so went to bed.  Foggy & dull.  On guard at 5. 
 16.4.18 Slept well and taken off guard at 7.  Whole section is moving out to an evacuated farm closer to job at 11.  Cleaned myself up and wrote diary before moving out.  Hazebrouck heavily shelled last night and this morning and I believe with gas shell also.  Moved out about 12.30 and had to go back for rations so followed Jacobs who was on limber.  Quiet going out but many places badly knocked in Hazebrouck and a lot of shops manifestly broken into.  Took wrong road going out and had to wait for limber's return.  However arrived about 2.30 and settled down as we are not going to work.  A farmer & his son came back to collect the remnants
