[This page crossed through.]Arranged Dolly's affairs & she remains for present at Heliopolis House, Heliopolis, may come to Ismalia later on. My Diary now will only be of interest to the family - if I am not in the front line. The Moral of all ranks has improved tremendously with the success of the advance on Jerusalem. I have not got any mail yet, but it will be with the Regt. address as before & I will get it stopped if remaining here.
