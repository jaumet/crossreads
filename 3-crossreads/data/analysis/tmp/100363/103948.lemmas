 Hospit , warmheart and ingenu , they remain . Everi man is a horseman . The general and his offic have not assum that rigid militar , which is so obvious in Franc and so one find more harmoni , sympathi and kinship . No doubt of cours this is produc by dissimilar condit . Life here is more Australian , open air and expans . There is not the strain of war nor the etern fear of death . It would be a man 's bad luck to be kill here in action , whilst in Franc he might consid himself fortun to escap with life . Franc is hell , Palestin more or less a holiday . True , here they have arduous time , but they are neither longliv nor doe the shadow of death etern accompani them . The Australian in Franc has lost much of his charm , due to associ and intermingl with societi .
