 We sisters had a good time. On our breakfast plate was a box of handkerchiefs from Red Cross for each   &amp;  our letters &ndash; I had three &ndash; one from Esther Hart with a pretty handkerchief, also Miss Mary Sergeant   &amp;  Miss Sharlie Sergeant with handkerchiefs enclosed. 
 Had some pretty little Xmas Gifts from friends, but can tell about them later. Anyhow they all    went   helped to make life much happier than any one expected. 
 Helped with patients dinner, then went to see the other wards. We had our dinner at 1. p.m.   &amp;  a real jolly time we  had. A Turkey, ham   &amp;  vegetables, excellently cooked. Plum pudding, mince tarts   &amp;  coffee. The room   &amp;  tables decorated beautifully. Crackers on our plates, the prettiest ones I've seen. 
 Returned to ward   &amp;  talked to patients. Set the table for tea   &amp;  got everythin going then I left at 5. p.m. Dressed   &amp;  caught the 5.48. p.m. to Paddington.
