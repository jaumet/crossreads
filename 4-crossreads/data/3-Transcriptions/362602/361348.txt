<p>scribble over them.  We are still looking for the piano.  I saw a great lot of flying-fish this morning &amp; they look pretty, with big wings that take the colour of the water.

A number of whales have been seen too but I must have been looking for the piano when they were about.  On the second day out we passed Wilson's Promontory.  We passed quite close in &amp; waved to the Keepers.  There are numerous Islands round about Wilson's Prom. &amp; one is a sheer mass of rock over 100 feet high &amp; about &frac12; a mile round.  We were to have had a rough time in the Bight but we must have gone a long way south &amp; missed it.</p>
<p>We have arrived at Fremantle &amp; are soon going ashore.  It is a bonza harbour view &amp; we are all quite excited.  See Page 5 [previous page].</p>
