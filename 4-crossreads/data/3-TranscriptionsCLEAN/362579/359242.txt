Sorry she was recalled because we were all a happy party but I'm delighted to say it has come through that Dorothy is taking her place, so we are expecting to see her at any minute. Hope I shall be able to stay, it would be very sad if I was moved now. I'm just loving my work   &  the M.O.'s are grand to work with.Last night I stayed on duty late - the Night-Staff had their Xmas dinner and concert. I got back to Hospice about 11.30 p.m. One of the Officers escorted me safely   &  we had a car, so you see we are well cared for.The other Sisters (29th) came back about 11.45 p.m., so we had a little supper in bed-room, saw the Old Year out   &  the New Year in.  Am off-duty now 6 p.m.,  having dinner early 7.30 p.m.   &  then to bed
