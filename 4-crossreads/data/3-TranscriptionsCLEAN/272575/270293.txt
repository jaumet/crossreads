A.Coy - 19 Batt Casula 28th 11.15
My Dear MotherI received your letter card with news that Jack Harris was killed, in Aug. yesterday evening.   things are very unsettled here at present and there is every indication of a storm, the men will most likely follow up the lead given them by the men in Liverpool camp.   The paper this morning made little of the disturbance there on Friday night.   I fancy things were only middling there for awhile some of the men turned out with fixed Bayonets, they set fire to some of the police tents then puled others down, and piled all the contents up and burnt them, blue metal was used freely one liverpool lad I was talking to last night said that one of the Red Cross men told him that there were a dozen men in hospital, and that one man died as a result of injuries received during the riot.   I received a letter from Dr. Armstrong,   with two papers enclosed, one to the O.C. 19. Batt. and one to Capt. Lenchan.   L. Horse.   Dr Armstrong evidently misunderstood things, and told the Major that I wanted, to get into the L.H. the letter to Capt. Lenchan was a recommendation, and also asked him to arrange for a transfer for me, to the L.H.  I have not been able to go over yet and see Cap. Holborow    I will very likely go over one evening this week.   Last Wednesday we were taken out on a Route march.
