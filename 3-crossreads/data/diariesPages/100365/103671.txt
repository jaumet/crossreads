even speak to one another in hushed voices. We are expecting news in after the Artillery Bombardment has ceased and the infantry get to work.Our move has again been cancelled we are ordered to stand by, be ready to move out at a moments notice. I sincerely hope that it will be forward. The rain has ceased today everything points to a victory for our armies. The French are battering away on our right, but we do not know much about them, save that they are trying to take Peronne.I wonder what you are all thinking of in Australia when you read of this long Battle, but God knows it is better to read of it than participate in it.So far our Australian Divisions have not been used on this front but they are not far in rear no doubt will be thrown in at the correct moment.

I went for a long ride today through the surrounding Forrest. I don't think I ever saw such beautiful scenery in all my life. The Forrest growth was very thick in places it was very dangerous riding as the ground broke off abruptly on either side down the numerous valleys which abound in this vicinity.All the tracks are entirely covered in overhead by the creepers dense foliage, forming one huge canopy of greenery
