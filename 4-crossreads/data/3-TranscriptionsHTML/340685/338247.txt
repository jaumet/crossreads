<p>in he afternoon. Very foggy and cold ice formed on the branches. Saw Birdwood who had a good chat with me. Came home early and chopped wood for the evening. Big bombardment going on a little to our left.<br/>2.12.16 To-day was to have been our day off but we were about 3 minutes late on parade and had to go to work. Very foggy and frosty all day. After dinner our job was pushed &ndash; we had done little in the morning as no rail came up and had to work on in the dark until 5.15. Went to bed with a fire for about 2 hours. 4 parcels came for me one containing the clothing. Yesterday saw an 8" howitzer Fritz left behind.<br/>3.12.16 had to work for the cooks this morning and carried heavy logs across here and strained my back a bit. Cleaned the dugout in the afternoon and chopped wood as well as I was able. Fire refuses to burn well to-night. Day foggy and cold.<br/>4.12.16 Usual routine now working on the edge of Delville Wood. Fine clear sharp day and aeroplanes active. Artillery active to-night. Some fell near us this afternoon. interesting mail in to-night. 3rd Brigade returned to-day.<br/>5.12.16 usual routine and joined up to-day.<br/>6.12.16 our day off to-day. Didn't hurry at all and cleaned our dugout and carried over some wood and some more in the afternoon and finished with a shave and wash. Our job to-morrow is to assist in surveying the line we have put down. Weather cloudy and gloomy with a strong <strike>west</strike> cold east wind which has been going since yesterday afternoon.<br/>7.12.16 Dull and foggy at times. Did nothing in the morning and in the afternoon made some tally rods and carried home more wood. breakfast at 6 to-morrow probably because some sections can't get a parade in time owing to late calling of cooks by the picquet.<br/>8.12.16 Mild but drizzling rain all day. breakfast at 6 and the section went out at 7 to put in a crossing. Quite dark then so we waited comfortably in our dugout until 8 when it grew light and after making our chain set out. (of telephone wire) Worked under difficulties all day as sights were difficult to make and it was very muddy. After dinner chained on to 3000 feet and came home at about 2.30. Issue of boots and a jack knife. Almost incredible news of capture of Bucharest, Ploesti. Vague reports of the Greece crisis and the formation of new English Cabinet. My front tooth came adrift this evening and I wish I could secure good attention.<br/>9.12.16 Miserably raining all day and has set in heavier to-night. Carried on with the surveying until dinner time when it became too wet and our prism in the compass became clouded with moisture. Sat in the dugout for the remainder of the day.

Artillery very active and Fritz used his armoured train again. Air tactics to take greater risks. Afternoon cloudy and gloomy and started to drizzle again. last night there was some very active bombing by Fritz's planes but I heard nothing.<br/>12.12.16 Very remarkable experience. Rotten day. Snowed in the morning and intermittently all day and was windy making it fairly cold. I decided to go on Sick parade with my teeth and went down with Rice's Sick parade at 9 to 3rd Field Ambulance. Found there was no dentist there so they sent me on to the 14th Field nearer us. Rice went home so I followed but found I should have waited and got an order at the 3rd so I returned and then on to the 14th where I saw a sergeant dentist.<br/>[Following words appear upside down at bottom of page &ndash; Grant leg birthday Jenkins.
