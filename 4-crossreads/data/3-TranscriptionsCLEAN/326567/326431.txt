As no leave was granted to the Troops to go into the Town also as we had not been paid for some time, we took it in good spirit. Still some broke camp & went for a stroll. As for myself I went out once for a stroll for about a mile, but as I could not speak French & had no cash I soon went back again.  Sunday Morning 13/5/17. Medical Inspection took place at 9 a.m. by the Chief Medical Officer, we had to show our Arms & hands. At 11 a.m. the Camp Commandant inspected our tents & kits likewise ourselves & then we were dismissed for the Day & passed the time away laying about chatting. In the afternoon a large Air Ship passed over head very low down also several Airplanes in fact they were continually flying about scouting from the Sea & up the River. The Seaplanes were a sight to look at, planing down on to the water & rising again
