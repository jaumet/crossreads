<p>May 1<br/>101.<br/>Two years ago May was the month of days of gold and blue by the hills of Mousset by the Mediterranean, days when I first knew the Pagan Jake and went swimming with him from the breakwater by the Cornish Coast.  They were days of ballad colour, and only Jake could have painted our nakedness in the hot sun.</p>
<p>Jake, standing to his knees deep in the water, leaning his hands on a ledge of rock, looking up with the sun full in his eyes, at two sturdy Provencal girls, looking down at him laughing, and his laugh as he hopped up and turned.</p>
<p>"Jove some people haven't much modesty Frank1"</p>
<p>Russel Hunt could manage the first part.  It was an episode from the golden Age.</p>
<p>May was splendid with colour and action at Mousset.</p>

<p>There's a rumour going the rounds of Blighty leave opening this week, if its true I'll be early on the list.</p>
<p>Evening:  Another dull grey day:  the usual shelling &ndash; searching for the hedge guns.</p>
<p>Read walking by the orchard wall along the poplar walk Keats' "Ode to a Grecian Urn".  Last night's shelling snapt in half one of the even trees:  now their lovely even perfection is broken, and a stump spoils their perspective.</p>
<p>Today read first three chapters of Lethaby's "Architecture".  He quotes Prof. Reisner's theory of the Sphinx and Cephron being contemporary.  Prof. Petrie's name only is quoted, but the discovery I think was Prof. Reisner's.</p>
<p>B. Bearers came down late last night, relieved by the 2nd, they have gone down to H.Qtrs. and Cliff was to be buried there today.</p>
