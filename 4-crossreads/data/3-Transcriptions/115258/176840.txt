<p>I walked down to the Jordan yesterday to get a photo of the pontoon bridge and I met Colin having a swim down there - so we sat down on the bank and had a yarn and afterwards I took a photo of him on his horse on the bridge. It seemed funny meeting him on the banks of the Jordan like that.</p>

<p>No more letters from you since I started this, Mother, so I think I&#39;ll finish this off tonight. We had a church parade this after noon held by the Presperterian padre - while he was on the sermon the turks started to shell the river away behind us and you could hear the shells whining along away up over our heads. It made our service quite a dinkum war one, such as you read about, but its the first one I have actually seen. I have still quite a lot of negatives here of all the last lot of photos I sent you. I have been keeping them as some of the chaps wanted prints of them, but I&#39;ll send them all home as soon as I can. The winter and the rainy season seem to have quite finished here now - it is getting very warm down here and we were able to hand in our second blanket today. The swimming in the Jordan is our greatest joy and we are only camped about 100 yards from its bank - so are pretty often in there. There is no doubt this front line work is the best</p>
