Saturday 14 July 1917.
Early morning parade as usual & as on every other Saturday morning we struck our tents at 5 a.m. to give to tent space an airing. Mess orderly today with "Nat" and then at 9 a.m. fell in for swimming parade to Bitter Lakes. Saw several native women. They are rather good looking and that's all.
Hospital boat "Niagra" & a Br Cruiser in the Canal (Suez)
On return pitched tents. (This was good in the midday sun too.).
Wrote a letter later.
Sun 15th We visited the Spanish, Greek, French & European quarters and were pleased to see some people who reminded us of home.
