  
 it may take me all my time to keep you posted up in news.  I hope Father's leg is better by now & does not give him any more trouble also hope you are keeping well and not worrying over me too much as I am quite alright & will take every care of my skin.  Give all my best love & kisses with whips to yourself. 
 From Your loving son Douglas
