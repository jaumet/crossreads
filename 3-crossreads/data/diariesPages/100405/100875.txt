To Mrs M.A. Rose,

Petersham.
I have great pleasure in forwarding a letter from your son, picked up by me in a bottle on the Ocean Beach at Point Lonsdale in Victoria on 20/1/17, where at present I am spending part of my vacation, before returning to Newington College, Stanmore, N.S.Wales. This I feel shou sure will be very pleasing to you even after two months.
Yours sincerely,
Tom P. Hewish.
