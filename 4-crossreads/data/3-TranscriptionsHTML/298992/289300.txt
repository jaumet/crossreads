<p>S.S. -<br/>B -<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>Arrived here this morning after a fair trip up. It was pretty rough when we left Sydney, but the wind changed round to the South &amp; we had a following sea which was a lot better. Most of the lads were sick, and the ship was in an awful state. It was very funny to see some of the lads, who, it didn't matter what you threatened them with in camp, would not stop making a row, all subdued, lying anywhere, in the scuppers amongst the slush &amp; dirt, or on the deck, in fact anywhere where they could find a place to lie.</p>
<p>Middleton is on the same boat as we, and I was very surprised when I saw Eric Greenwell walk on board. Nearly all my pals got together, and mess at the same table. We are all housed down below in the 'tween decks, and it is very crowded and stuffy even now, I don't know what it will be like when we get to the tropics. I'm lucky in as much</p>
