<p>Tuesday, 23 February, 1915<br/>In full marching order and in the broiling sun, the whole L.H.F.A [Light Horse Field Ambulance] went out for a days manoevers.  We commandeered an old building  and the tent division, erected a dressing station, the bearers then went out and found some wounded and carried them to the waggons thence to the station, we picketed our horses at the station and had lunch, we returned home about 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Next day and I did not rec. a single letter, if my friends and relations only knew our disappointment, they would write out of sympathy.  Attended a lecture at night by Chaplain Werrington on the Aust. Poets at night, I am giving a paper on Lawson next wk.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 24 February, 1915<br/>A great day the sort of day I would like always.  We went out in full marching order with the brigade and the sun was just blazing as we marched across the desert in extended order.  We then got an order to make off for an oasis whilst the brigade went on.  We dismounted in the welcome shade watered &amp; fed our horses, then had our dinner and lay down and went to sleep until 3 p.m then we returned to the camp.  I rode Ginger and intend doing so until I get a new horse.</p>
