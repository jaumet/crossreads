 They shouted &quot;go it &quot;Joey&quot; - &quot;Aint .E. funny&quot;, Hip Hooray&quot; - 
 My triumph &amp; my failures &amp; then, my fall. 
 They&#39;ve rung the bell 
 The Curtains down 
 Im waiting for my call.&nbsp; Bills;&nbsp; Not those I owe but old Play bills of the Show&nbsp;

 The laurel on my brow a favourite &amp; now = 
 forgotten! - A Fallen Star
