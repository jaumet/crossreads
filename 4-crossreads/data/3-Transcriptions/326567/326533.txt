<p>still raining &amp; nothing doing, I heard today that Fritz has captured St Julian &amp; is now holding it. Our Casualties up to date have been very light &amp; from reports Fritz has had a lot killed.<br/>Saturday 4/8/17<br/>We attacked Fritz again today &amp; forced him out of St Julien &amp; now we are holding it &amp; it will not revert again to Fritz. I obtained leave &amp; went into Poperinghe for a change, while I was walking about I noticed some Purple Ribbon in a shop. I bought &frac12; yard &amp; was directed to a Tailoress who had some Terricotta Red in stock, so I got her to make me our Regimental Colours, as up to date Headquarters had not supplied us with them &amp; as all the other Australian Regiments had theirs I decided to buy my own. They cost me 1 Franc each, the Colours are Red 2 &frac14;  inch square with 1 5/8  inch diamond of Purple with the number of our Corp 59</p>
