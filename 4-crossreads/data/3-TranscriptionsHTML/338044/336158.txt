<p>17th March,<br/>See Lieut Butler re interview with Colonel McGlynn &amp; I put in my application which he promises to support</p>
<p>18th March to 29th March.<br/>During this time I have been feeling too much annoyed  to even write my diary. Will these stupid people in Australia who write, wildly suggesting that a fellow should be at the front, ever get sense. Here am I doing my level best to get there as probably few others have done &amp; I am beaten at every turn. During this period I have continually worried Mr Butler about my application but with no result  They do not wish to allow me to go. Yesterday I was informed that it was finally refused because, as stated, I am "B" class</p>
