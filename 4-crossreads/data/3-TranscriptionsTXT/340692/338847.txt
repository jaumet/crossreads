I have come in from my carry at all hours of the wet nights, soaked with mud & water almost up to the waist;  to crawl into a leaking dug-out, which you did no know at what minute the vibration of the battling guns were going to shake the whole thing in on top of you.  All one night I sat up, fearing to lay down, as many a dug-out had fallen in that same evening.  There has been times when I have been fit to lay there & cry with fatigue & exhustion - when the call has come again for "No. 3 squad!"  Out you go into the pitch black night,
