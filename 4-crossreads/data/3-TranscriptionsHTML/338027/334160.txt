<p>Tuesday, 6 April, 1915<br/>Much improved my temp has gone down and I am normal again.  Am not allowed up yet but I wanted to smoke so badly that I sneaked out of the ward whilst the sister was not looking.</p>
<p>English ladies bring us flowers and any amount of papers and magazines, so we are well off if I was only allowed to smoke I could stop here for months.  The food is splendid, cocoa, rice, milk, chicken, oranges being part of our daily diet.  I am in that part of the building known as the Casino, and the fittings are more beautiful than can be imagined, everything is marble &amp; granite &amp; alabaster, and all the fittings are of native carved brass.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 7 April, 1915<br/>Allowed up to-day, much improved pains still in my back, Sister put a large mustard plaster on and stood by &amp; laughed whilst it burned.</p>
<p>Rec. mail in morning from H. E. &amp; E.  Had mates in as visitors, one brought me Cigarettes &amp; money and another a neat parcel of writing pad envelopes, pen ink, chocolates tobbacco &amp; cigarettes.  It is good to know that even whilst you are sick there are mates who think so well of you.</p>
<p>Part of the 4th Bde Infantry went to-day, but there is some stoppage on the route.  Three fellows died to-day here, of pneumonia.  I passed one poor chap as he was being taken to the mortuary with the Union Jack over his coffin and I thought what a fearful end in this God forsaken country and victory and fighting in sight.</p>
