 So I sent Nicol with Place & Nimmo with 12 Christians & a Lewis Gun to hold this valley in case the enemy were there or if we drove those out of the village to prevent them from doubling round on our rear.  I then took Scott Olsen the other 4 Sgts 12 Christian & two guns forward to the Scrap.  Sgt Murphy & a Russian officer with this party rode on as a sort of advance guard & when within 600 yds of the village were fired on.  We moved up under cover of the dead ground & got our Lewis Guns into action, which had the effect of clearing the enemy from the village about 20 of them galloped
