  
 13 January 1918 Sunday Khirbet Deiran No Transport till 2 o'clock 4 inches rain fell & one of the coldest nights I ever experienced- This evening in the wind I put my Bivy up it got torn to pieces I am now in a dugout & hope no Bronchitis will result-  Joe's leather waistcoat saved me from Pneumonia because water will not go through it- Feed is growing & soon the wild flowers will be blossoming again-  The Bedouins are busy putting in their Crops.
