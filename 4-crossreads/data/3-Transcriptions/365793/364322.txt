<p>Aug 10 want? What we don't want perhaps are the parades at 10.30 &amp; 2.30. Guess the old jigger is doing about 10 or 12 an hour, &amp; she increases it at night. Pay day today, but im not in it as my book is a quidlet overdrawn. Guess it doesn't matter &ndash; seeing that I've got a fiver! The Doc is also out of it as his book is in England &ndash; also his wife! <strike>Sentr</strike> Alan McDougall is on board with us. He watched the Colonel dishing out our pay. Very few Hospital cases yet, so the Nurses &amp; Doc's have plenty of leisure time. Beautiful sunset &amp; a sea like glass</p>
