<p>Our next - and my last place of residence, in a foreign country for some time to come, if ever again - is</p>
<p><u>DINANT</u>.</p>
<p>Lying in the valley of the Meuse, this town at once appeals to the lover of the picturesqueness and beauty of nature.&nbsp; Right through the centre of the town flows the beautiful - and now historic river, which is spanned by bridges, the principal one being a very fine piece of work, with the exception of one end of same which was destroyed in the very early days of the enemy advance. - during August 1914.</p>
<p>From both sides of the town rise precipitous hills, - or mountains - grand and picturesque, as if protecting this pretty town.&nbsp; On the summit of the east side is a huge fort, surrounded by a great wall, from which is a sheer descent of hundreds of feet to the valley below.</p>
<p>Many large and substantial buildings remain, but unfortunately a few of the main ones were destroyed, when the enemy first took possession.&nbsp; Otherwise the town is very little knocked about.&nbsp; The church steeple - which was, I understand, of copper - was removed by the enemy, as were also many other things which were of military value.</p>
<p>The advent of the enemy into this beautiful town of Dinant on the 23rd. August 1914 was accompanied by wholesale murder, rapine, and other atrocities unparallelled.&nbsp; Civilians were placed against walls and shot by the soldiers as sport for the drunken officers who gave orders. - Over six hundred and fifty men - old and young - were dealt with in this manner, during the first three days of the enemy&#39;s occupation. - Three hundred girls were placed in the church to which access was only granted to the enemy soldiers.&nbsp; Many committed suicide, many lost their reason. - Houses were burnt and children were bayoneted and thrown into the flames. - Many people sought refuge in the forts and when this last chance failed, they threw themselves over the walls and met their merciful death on the rocks below.<br />&nbsp;</p>
