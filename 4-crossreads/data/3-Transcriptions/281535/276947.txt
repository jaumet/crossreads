<p>5/5/19<br/>Marcinelle<br/>Exquisite sunshine &ndash; the best we have yet had. Loafed about all the morning and the best part of the afternoon. The Duke of Connaught visited here today for lunch at Siebertz's but I did not bother going to see him. Some of the walled back gardens round here are veritable pictures with their masses of fruit blossom. We have two murder trials soon coming off. One is our one and onlyBanks. Some files at BdeHQ this morning were interesting dossiers of crime and violence with photographs of handcuffed and shackled desperadoes with vice written all over them. The celebrated Broncho is said to be so rotten with syphilis that one cannot touch him. Went to splendidly hospitable house of Mathy's relatives at Mont Sur Marchienne &amp; returned just mellow &ndash; this is hospitality.</p>
