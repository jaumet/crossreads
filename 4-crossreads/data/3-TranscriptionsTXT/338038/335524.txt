Dear Uncle Willie,I was more than pleased to receive in a bunch during the last few days your letters & card of 20.6.18, 15.7.18, & 5.8.18. and to note how well you & aunt Marie are bearing your loss.  It gives us fellows great reason to be proud, when we know, that at the back of us are the brave unflinching hearts of those we love, and although unable to be in the front line, are none the less bearing the burdens & the sacrifices, & that cheerfully, which war demands.
It was a great relief to me to hear of Pat's obtaining his discharge.  Tell him from me, I do think he did the right thing, for I know too well what doubts assailed him, & hardest of all, he has to go amongst a world, who in its ignorance may judge him wrongfully.  I hope he will buck up, & battle on manfully where he is, and when we come trooping home
