 well again now and getting up today. I knew when I came here it was  ol  only Jordanitis and if I&#39;d been out at the regt I&#39;d hardly have bothered going to the Dr with it, but when you are at a rest camp and know of &quot;a better role&quot; like the 14th what&#39;s the use if you dont go to it? The Xmas mail closes on 1st Nov and I had hoped to write tons of different letters by then; however they wont matter being a little late I suppose so I&#39;ll write &#39;em as soon as I can. Wonder when the wool will be appraised? Am looking forward to seeing us top the market absolutely this year! I know we can do it. Well! I&#39;ll write again &nbsp;in a day or two. With love and A Merry Christmas to all from Rob.
