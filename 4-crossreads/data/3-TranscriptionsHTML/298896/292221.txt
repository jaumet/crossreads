<p>the theatre party &amp; going to the Op&eacute;ra being conducted there by a representative of the Club. We had paid 14 Francs each &amp; had one of the best boxes in the house, probably a concession so it paid to go per means of the Club. Aida was the piece &amp; it was wonderful. Magnificently staged, the Egyptian scenes were great &amp; this combined with the good music made it very enjoyable. The building itself is a sight of a lifetime, rightly renowned the world over. Marble staircases on a huge scale communicates with each floor and a promenade room of great length &amp; beauty is very popular between Acts. Gorgeously decorated &amp; brilliantly lit with immense chandeliers, one could gaze at it for hours. Finished up the day feeling well satisfied with things in general.</p>
