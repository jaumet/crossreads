  
 November, 1915 Saturday 27 Last night was one of the worst thunderstorms I have ever been out in - Do you remember how the storms rolled over the Ranges at Switzerland, this country is similar - at 3 a.m. I went to my "Bivy" which had been fairly weatherproof, 1 boot half full of water & the Biscuits sodden, several rats had taken refuge in the Dugout - we are still under orders not to return enemies fire for another 48 hours - the question is will they come.
