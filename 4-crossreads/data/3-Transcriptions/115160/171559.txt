<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>Our mail comes in batches now for we are not in much communication with the rest of the Section. And I have received your end of August letters and mid-end of September. &nbsp;I see that Dad has had a bad time with a touch of pneumonia, but I am very pleased to note that he is over it and was able to go on holidays. Bess, too, I hear had a touch of the flue. &nbsp;It&#39;s several mails since I&#39;ve had a few lines from her.</p>
<p>So you were pleased with the good work the Aussies were doing over here, Mither. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad to note that&nbsp;</p>
