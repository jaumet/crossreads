to meet the train at W Maitland.
28th NovrArrived Armidale 8.40am & got a car about 9 oclock for Dorrigo.  Met Billy Ryder & Mr Schley at Wollomombi.  Got to Guy Fawkes for dinner.  Fairly cool breeze blowing & on the way from Guy Fawkes it started raining.  Kept up all the way driving right into the car.  Got to Dorrigo Roy was waiting for the car.  Had a yarn to a lot of Dorrigo citizens & Roy borrowed Marsden's sulky & we took the short cut home arriving at 7.25am.  Found the place looking A.1. My only wish I hadn't to go back.
29th NovrHad a quiet morning at home.  Looked round the place & was much pleased with the progress made during my absence.  After dinner all of us went round to Sturts to spend the afternoon & stayed to tea.  Got home about 10.
