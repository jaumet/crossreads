DIII and then the poor operators work starts.
Oct 2nd
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are told we are to spell here for a few days &amp; rejoice for we are weary &amp; worn &amp; dirty &amp; hungry &amp; the smell of decomposed Turk is ever in our nostrils.&nbsp; A little way up the road there is a dead Turk.&nbsp; He is lying with his head on his arm as if asleep.&nbsp; I discover a [tibben ?] dump &amp; the old mare gets a good feed &amp; not before it is wanted needed.&nbsp; I am ashamed to look her in the eye some times when I can only give her two handsful of grain.&nbsp; She seems to say &quot;so this all you give me after all the way I have carried you&quot;.&nbsp; About 11 am the order comes.&nbsp; &quot;be ready to move off at 3 pm.&nbsp; Dear oh dear. are we never to have a resst.&nbsp; On again along the dusty road.
