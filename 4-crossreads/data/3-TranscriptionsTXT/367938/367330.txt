 Ari Burun or Anzac 8.7.15. 
 &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; Had meant to write you quite a long letter but you have no idea of our discomfort here. The heat is intense &ndash; about 88&deg; &amp; like Sydney &ndash; no cool verandah to write on &ndash; only a blanket just over ones head. The flies are the ghastly limit &ndash; give one indigestion as one has to blow &amp; bolt ones grub. I cannot grumble however as I have again been on board the "Sicilia": This time got very weak from starvation following on a weeks indigestion, owing to an issue of bread, mostly dough &ndash; &amp; getting influenza on top of that, I was sent away. 
 Have told lots of generals &amp; Col.

 There I saw 2 huge navies, dozens of naval officers rushing about the harbour doing nothing, &amp; hundreds of red tabbed important staff men trying to look as if they had some thing to do ashore. I cld. write a good article on the carelessness &amp; mistakes of everything from beginning to end &amp; I'm awfully glad I went to Lemnos for I see now how the mistakes etc reach here: but must wait for a Chair &amp; table &amp; comfort. 
 I had to go off the Sicilia as she was off to Malta. On landing with 7 others I deposited my small kit bag &amp; a box of food I was taking to trooper Knox of the Vic 4 L.H. from Graham, &amp; eventually we separated &amp; I was taken  by  alone by a Cpl to No 1 Hosp. (Australian). 
 From outside I heard the Regtl. Sergeant arguing he couldn't
