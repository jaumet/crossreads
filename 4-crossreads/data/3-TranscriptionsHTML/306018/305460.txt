<p>September 1917<br/>football.  They are encouraging it as much as possible to get us in good condition.  At night I went over to the 5th LH to see Williamson &amp; Crawford.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th<br/>Quiet day.  Very dusty &amp; windy.  B Squadron was Brigade duty Squadron.</p>
<p>Thursday 27th<br/>Reveille at 4.  Breakfast at 4.30.  The Regt went out early to practice an attack.  There was heavy gun &amp; rifle fire just before daybreak.  Lasted about &frac12; an hour.  There are some new aeroplanes at the aerodrome alongside our camp &amp; we see some good exhibitions of flying looping the loop etc.</p>
<p>Friday 28th<br/>Genl Allenby inspected the camp.  We had another game of football in the afternoon.  Wasn't feeling very energetic after the game was over.</p>
<p>Saturday 29th<br/>The Regt was on the range today.  We had it very dusty &amp; windy in the afternoon &amp; at times you could hardly see the target at all.  I got 6 hits out of 10 shots which was a good deal above the average.  The range was 500 yards.  It is hard</p>
