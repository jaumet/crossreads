There are not a great mani flower bloom now except poppi , marguerit and cornflow there are plenti of those , still bloom in the field . some of the garden here have a few differ flower grow I do not know the name of them , there are some rather nice rose but none so fine as those we saw last year . some of the Small Wood here are veri pretti most of the tree have been plant , and then other have grown natur . there is one place about 4 mile away , that is veri pretti . as you enter the wood from one side you find yourself in a long green aisl the branch of the tree meet overhead . I suppos it has been left for a road then there are other similar leafi aisl Through the tree on the outskirt of the wood there a patch of strawberri grow wild , it did not take our boy long to find them and sampl the berri .
