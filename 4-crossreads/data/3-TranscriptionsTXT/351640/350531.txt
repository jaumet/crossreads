above named Britishers do the whole of the work. I entertained Dr. Wilmot to dinner at The Union Club at 8 p.m., the hour for dining here.
I enclose you a set of surcharged postage stamps, Indian, place them with the others, they will grow in value, the 1 rupee one especially.  I got them from the post office at the San Stefano hospital.
We expect to be leaving here tomorrow.  I send on also a newspaper, which is published daily at Cairo and is distributed here.
The weather in this place is ideal.  It appears that 8 in of rain falls per annum in Alexandria & none in Cairo.  At Bourke in N. S. Wales the fall equals 9 in. per. ann.
My next letter will be from Cairo.  The first part of this letter was written to amuse you.
The Military people here must look upon us as a lot of silly tourists.  Officers, who should be monished go out with walking sticks, no gloves, cameras on backs, & such nonsense.  It grieves one sadly.  However there is no attempt at discipline, there never has been.  Suppose it cannot be helped.
Goodbye now my dears.  May the best of Fortune's gifts be with you now & always.  Heaps of good wishes to my friends. Especially to Maria & the Watt family.
Love in loads & kisses in abundance to Car, Joseph, & Kitty fromtheir loving and affect FareeJohn B. Nash.
