28 ThursdayA very heavy frost on the ground this morning, very cold & bleak all day.  Went to the Dentist at 10 am & after putting a bit of filling in one of my teeth (about 5 minutes work) he gave me another note to call tomorrow.  It is absolutely ridiculous I reckon standing out in the very cold weather for 3 hrs. for 5 min. treatment.  Detailed for filling the water cart out of a well in the afternoon.  Very cold monotonous job.
29 FridayWell I have got my teeth finished at last.  went up at 10 am this morning & the Dentist finished filling them.  Wrote three letters today.  The A.D.M.S. Inspected A section including the transport, this afternoon.  We had to go about half a mile away & as soon as we came back, I was detailed as orderly room messenger.  I only had one message to go on though.  Raining tonight.
30 SaturdayA kit inspection was held this morning, Result! I have to change my mounted equipment for dismounted.  I prefer the mounted.  Arrangements are being made for another evening New Years night.  Not on any duties during the day.  Two of our fellows overstopped leave in Amiens & were today awarded 3 days C.B.
31 SundayVery quiet all day.  New Years eve kept up by some of the Bhoys.  Carrying a bit of timber during the morning.
