 2. Officers' hospital. This was down in Surrey. The Autumnal scenery there was glorious &amp; we had some jolly fine walks &amp; motor drives about the district. There were about 40 patients at this hospital, including several Canadians, a Bermudian, a South African, a chap from China, another from India, one from South America, a couple of New Zealanders, some English, Scotch &amp; Irish &amp; several Australians. 
 Thus the Empire was well represented. The place was mostly run by amateurs &ndash; society people of the County &ndash; &amp; their efforts at times in the housework etc were most amusing. 
 I had two weeks' sick leave most of which I spent with friends in Scotland. 
 I got back to France soon after passing the Medical Board &amp; found my battalion down here labouring in the mud.
