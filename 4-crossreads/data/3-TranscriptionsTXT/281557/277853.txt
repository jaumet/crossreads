out) & at the end the Sgt Major (who fought at the Aisne) gave us a very interesting lecture on what we had just done & also recounted a few stories & gave us some splendid hints : after being dismissed I bumped Sorrensen from Leichhardt & was real pleased to meet such old cobbers : tea : wrote letters & then bye-bye
Wednesday Feb 9thDull cold day with a few showers : Revellie 6am physical & drill : boys played up a lot with Dick : No.14 tent were ordered to be paraded for not having their blankets out on time. M Farlane also paraded for talking in ranks. They got two days. G. G. & one was let off with one day : breakfast : turned out in full kit & were marched off (all our brigade). After going a while we were formed up in mass formation & a photographer took a photo of the parade : dinner : march across the sand. We were going to do artillery formation on the way back but left it too late. We passed  a lot of trenches  & they are very up to date : wire entanglements & all : A few of the niggers were mobbed & their oranges taken off them. I think it is nothing more than German methods & my blood boils at the little notice the officers take of these assaults for they are nothing else : on the way back one officer was man enough to speak up & paraded all the N.C.O's for allowing the men to break out of the ranks. He let them off with a lecture & a caution : paid 50 disasters after parade : tea : went to Heliopolis with Joe, Allan, & a mate of Joe's (Bill Wright  & E Chenhall did not turn up)
