<p>structure. Just had news that "Majestic" has been sunk this makes the third ship running &amp; is a heavy blow to us. It will certainly necessitate a rearrangement of  plans besides putting heart into the Turks but it cannot alter the ultimate result. Later. A doubt cast on the truth of the "Majestic" sinking. Supposed to be a transport but the usual rumours afloat. In the evening took a stroll through the village &amp; witnessed a good deal of drinking. The place is full of French regiments, Zouaves, Senegalise, Algerians etc besides Hindoos, Soudanese, Australians, British, then Greeks who have enlisted in the French also New Zealanders. Add to these a sprinkling of nomads of other races &amp; a good mixture is made. Wine is very cheap 1d &amp; 2d &amp; drinking shops have sprung up all over the place &amp; at night the scene is a busy one. It is remarkable the number of languages some of the people speak, seven different ones is quite common.</p>
<p>Friday 28th. Received a new issue of clothing English pattern khaki drill tunic &amp; trousers (which we afterwards cut down), splendid boots, 2 pairs socks shirt &amp; towel. We now have more clothing than we can carry. The weather is still first rate &amp; we had a very easy day swimming etc. A cricket march between the N.Z.M.C. &amp; ourselves we won easily. Just missed being put on to dig graves today. I wonder what our next job will be. Sinking of Majestic conformed, makes 5 up to date, "Ocean" "Irresistable" "Goliath" "Triumph" and "Majestic". The presence of the enemies submarines</p>
