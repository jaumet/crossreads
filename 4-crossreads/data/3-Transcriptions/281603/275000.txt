<p>January &amp; February 1917<br/>after fixing us up with a tent sent a dixie of tea &amp; an issue of rum.  Next morning we had breakfast &amp; set off for the battalion.  We reached Highwood East &amp; there was a platoon from each company there on fatigue work &amp; my platoon was there out of "A" Coy.  Our stay only lasted a short while but during the stay we had to push rations &amp; engineers gear up near the firing line on the small tramway (Last).  We received orders to move late in the afternoon of the 31st &amp; the platoon moved up to Cough Drop &amp; our duties here were to carry miners gear from the dump to advance company Headquarters &amp; making saps out to the outposts.  On the afternoon of the 4th of February, the platoon moved back to Highwood but I had to report to Coy H Qtrs &amp; stayed the night &amp; next day in a big dug out near supports.  That night the 5th I was given six men &amp; went to the firing line &amp; took over No. 23 post.  It was the flank post of the company &amp; I had to report to "C" Copy ever second hour.  We had it very cold while in the line &amp; we used to get hot stew &amp; tea of a night &amp; hot tea about 4 am including a rum issue at midnight.  We only did twenty four hours in the line &amp; next night we were releived &amp; went back to supports at Coy H Qtrs for twenty four hours.</p>
