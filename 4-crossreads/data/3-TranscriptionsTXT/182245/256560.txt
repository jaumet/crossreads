 FEBRUARY 1917 
 14 WEDNESDAY 
 Fine &amp; sunny &amp; warm. Was 
 called out at 4 AM to go 
 up &amp; shift our gun out to 
 the trenches sniping. We 
 took it right down the 
 Houplines to within about 
 800 yds of German trenches. 
 Came back to waggon 
 Lines &amp; went up again in 
 evening &amp; brought it 
 back to the pit. Got 
 letter from mother.
