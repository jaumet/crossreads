<p>the cable on instead of the note. Anyway I would like five minutes with them. We struck a fairly&nbsp;<s>rolling</s>&nbsp;big sea outside and rocked a bit but not nearly as much as the other boats. We show no lights at night now &amp; if we want to light a pipe we must get into cover. No noise is allowed either after dark. Its pretty awkward I can tell you getting about in our confined space in the dark. if you dont run into a man you run into something else and bark all your shins.</p>
