go clattering to one end & mix themselves up into an awful mess, then the boat will roll back on the other side, & everything will go clattering to the other end, On to the floor, & everybody at the table will have stew, tea & etc all over him. The tables were not like some ships which have flanges fastened on them to prevent things from slipping about, These were quite plain! & in some rough weather like it is to-day, it is almost impossible to get much to eat.

Sunday November 19th
The sea is still rough slightly worse than yesterday, the wind is blowing a gale. Two or three accidents occurred yesterday amongst the men through being thrown down & dashed against the bulwarks with the movement of the ship.

We passed very close to a steamer & a sailing vessel to-day, They were being tossed about a good deal at times they were not visible when they went down into the trough of the sea. Even the tops of their masts were out of sight, Church service was not held to-day
