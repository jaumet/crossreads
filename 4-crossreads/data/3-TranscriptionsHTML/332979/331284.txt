<p>St Patrick's Day<br/>My duty was a lot easier as I only had Six positions to look after &amp; no Men to look after on the Forecastle Head. As the Weather was chilly with a strong wind blowing it was necessary to keep on our Overcoats. Our Course was West Nor West nearly all day. At 6 Pm we were all lined up &amp; when the new Guard arrived &amp; our Men relieved we were marched down on to the Promenade Deck &amp; dismissed &amp; we were not sorry after our Cold &amp; Windy Shift.<br/>We have now a Draughts Tournament started it is competed for in 3 classes 1. 2. &amp; 3. I am in the 2nd Class &amp; as there are a Euchre &amp; Cribbage &amp; Bridge Tournament we will have a very busy Week next Week which I trust it is the last of our Voyage, as it is nearly 7 Weeks Since we left Australia, &amp; we are all just about tired of Ship Life.</p>
