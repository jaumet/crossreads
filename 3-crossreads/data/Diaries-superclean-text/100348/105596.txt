Have been under a terrible bombardment for three days now. Our trench has disappeared and we are holding on in shell holes. Have advanced in front of his barrage and are better off here. Have no food or water. Don't know where the Battalion is. Was buried by a shell yesterday Palmer dug me out. He is not with me now.

Last night we were relieved by the 5th Brigade. Found my way back to Becourt Wood. I found Palmer there he has a slight wound in the head. The cooks gave me a grand hot meal and I had a good sleep
