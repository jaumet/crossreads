  
 107 Chantilly to day - the prettiest & most homely of all the chateaux. As usual I stray from beaten tracks & descend at Orry Coye. 
 We are very late starting owing to having spent night previous at Montmartre & then to cap all having to take an omnibus train. 
 The forest of Coye lightly timbered & yet completely shaded is a subject for a picture but what shall I say of the Pool & Chateau of the Queen Blanche. The small tower situated over falling cascades on to a velvet  carpet  tree covered carpet while a view of the railway viaduct of 15 arches towering overheard. 
 The lake, down to edge of which the forest descend Coye on one side & Chantilly on other though really the same forest, is fringed with a road - forest on one hand & a hedge on the water side. Sunlight & then a heavy shower followed by a mist rising from lake makes varied pictures 
 So enraptured are we by the scene that we dine on rising ground in view of lake & chateau under an enormous elm & though rain is heavy & we have no macs we continue to dine well & dry on chicken & wine & cheese & cakes, while the million drops of gold splash on the gilded surface beneath us, & the air is full of that sweet odour of woods after april shower. 
 This is the prettiest spot I found
