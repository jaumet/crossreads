[26th Aug. contd]Seeing a French officer on the platform with some stomach I enquired of the guard in my best French if he was a Flying Corps officer & as the guard mentioned this to the officer he got a kick downstairs in reward.  They took it as a joke though & laughed heartily.  It began to rain soon after and visions of a wet tramp back from Faughemberghes came up before us.We arrived at Thiembronne (stop before Faughemberghes) at 8.10 and it was nearly dark & raining heavily.  There was no shelter & we just had to push on.  We were soon drenched & after an hours walk we got to Thiembronne - took the wrong road twice & eventually arrived at our billets at 10.30 drenched & cold - but soon into bed & right O.
Monday 27Still raining windy & miserable.  I was working outdoors all day on odd jobs & it was not very comfortable.  I was rewarded however for I received 17 letters 1 parcel & papers from good old Aussy  (inc were 3 letters from M.B. 1 from home also the parcel which was good).  Slept well.
Tuesday 28still raining heavily.
