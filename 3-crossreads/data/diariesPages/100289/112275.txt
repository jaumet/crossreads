Lecture in morning, also signalling. Two days route march commencing to-morrow.
Tuesday 17.7.17
Left here at 8 Am joined Brigade in two days route march to Corbie. On our arrival at Corbie crossed pontoons placed across canal to test them. Engineers have been practicing a good deal of that work of late, apparently their services will be required in that direction in the near future. Placed in billets about 5 pm on the outskirts of the town. Walked into town for tea ? some of the boys made a wild night of it, it was 1 o'clock in the morning before I managed to get the last of them to bed. Billeted in an old factory.
