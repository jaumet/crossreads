 MAY&nbsp;&nbsp; SUNDAY 28&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916 
 Cold &amp; windy, but it was a following wind so it was not so bad. We had a church parade in morning. It looked very impressive; all the men in the sombre Khaki &amp; the parson in his surplus with a Union Jack hung just under him. He is a very ragtime sort of preacher anyway. I wrote letters most of the afternoon, wrote father Linda, Spes Wharton and M rs  Allison. There was a Church service at night also, but I did not go.
