10/11/18 Yzeux
A fine cloudless day with a sun getting feebler daily. Church parade in front of the Chateau. Fethers at the piano and Buckley preaching, was less funereal than usual. Matthews came over for lunch and we talked much of après la guerre. After lunch I went out for a walk over the north side of Flexecourt road. The woods are now practically bare except for a few shreds of autumn leaf yet hanging. The thinning of foliage makes one comprehend how densely populated the countryside is. Villages are frequent and church spires seen surprisingly often. Dening, MO was in the mess and had things of interest to relate re the treatment of our prisoners by the Huns. On 8 August Hun prisoners suffered much at our hands – bad day and bad water arrangements due to Army messing.
