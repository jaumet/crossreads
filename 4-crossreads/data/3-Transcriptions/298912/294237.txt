<p>at 6.00 &amp; we had to turn out. It was so cold during the night that I had to get up &amp; put my leather vest on. I then had on a singlet, cardigan, sheep skin vest, &amp; overcoat  &amp; even then it was cold. The water to wash in was like ice &amp; numbed one, but the air was glorious.<br/>The first parade was stables, when we had to clean them out, feed &amp; water the horses. When "feed up" is blown on the trumpet a ( bugle is only used in infantry &amp; others, but bugles are used for the mounted troops) all the horses in camp neigh &amp; stampede. They know every call. All the work we get is horses ! horses! Horses!</p>
<p>Thanks to the Egyptian Govt we get a decent feed here, The Govt allow each man 8&frac12; (eight pence halfpenny) worth of rations every day. This must be in rations &amp; we get butter, pineapples, sugar condensed milk, treacle, etc, etc, allowed to us at the rate of 8&frac12; per man per day. This is in addition to the usual rations. Life is worth living now [at meals] &amp; today I had the best feed I ever had in camp &amp; I feel  - full, to be polite. Two letters have already arrived for me from the girls I dropped notes to, in Melbourne</p>
