<p>October 1918.<br/>Thursday 17</p>
<p>Advance position and in front Becvigny.<br/>Heavy fog and rain heralded the stunt this morning. Barrage very heavy, laid down on Fritz line. Poor headway made by the Tommies against Fritz, and we left their flank crossing to the Yanks 120th Regt in the line again and as usual held up. They are very poor fighters and seem to have very poor leaders.<br/>Heavy rain all the day, and that made things very uncomfortable. News to hand that Roy's application for my leave has come through, same has been recommended by the Major.</p>
