commit all sorts of offences and spend their time in the "clink".  I really think it is worth one's while to be a T.T. but often one gets very sick of rusty water & the tea made therefrom & longs for a glass of beer or a wh. & s.  I am not a T.T. here but I am glad to be able to say that I have not been the worse for drink so far.Australian letters are the greatest assistance in keeping one on the straight in any direction in the army & that is why I appreciate them so much.Thanks so much for writing.  Give my love to Margaret & Mifanwy & Peter (whom I have not yet seen).
Very affectionate regards to Dr. & self.Yours sincerelyArthur M. Davidson
