  
 Tues. Feb.11. Weather continues rough. One chap, named Findlay, got knocked down by a wave yesterday & broke his right arm; & another chap was admitted to Hospital today with a sprained wrist caused by falling on the deck. There are 9 Patients in Isolation & I have 3 to look after in the Gen. Hos. Yank & I went along to the Pantry about midnight to get some Supper but all we got was a cup of Coffee & some Bread & Butter. This was not much good to us to last all night on, so we complained about it. Had a hot Salt water Bath & turned into Bunk where we managed to have a few hours sleep. The weather is getting warmer & the sea is calming down. Wed. Feb.12. Was on night duty again last night with the Yank. Supper was a dismal failure again & Yank said "We're slippin'". I agreed with him & this morning I spoke to the Second Steward about it, who said he would see into the matter. The weather is quite calm again now & the Diggers are getting their sea-legs"..

Yank & I got turned out of our Cabin today & had to seek fresh quarters. We passed Gibraltar about midnight last night. It was too dark to see much but we saw "the Rock" looming out of the water & innumerable lights flickering along the coast on either side.
