  
 our spring. The foyer is large but the balcon open on the rue & has little attraction except for smokers. Most of world promenades in foyer & I limp there also. My leg is now very painful. 
 8-8-19 Pay a visit to M. Petit Dupalle re my certificate but he is out & I arrange to see him to morrow. (When however I am to ill to move) 
 I then visit garden & Musee de Luxembourg with its wonderful statuary though one can find fault with much that is there In fact it turns out that [indecipherable] is not the [indecipherable] by which one is placed in Luxemburg but rather [indecipherable] 
 The paintings are removed in [first] place to an exhibition of Carolus Duran whose early painting, The Dame au gant (1848) are the best. The finest picture in collection is a painting of Duran himself by one of his pupils an  Englishman  American named John S Sargent. It is a masterpiece & puts to shame the rest of the collection. I should very much like to see more of Sergents work. 
 After this we reached the Church of St Sulpice in front of which is the Square St Sulpice with it fountain supported by the 4 leading preachers of France & alongside The Seminaire du St Sulpice where one of the acts of Manon has peace. The church is in Renaissance style - a roomy edifice once a Temple of Victory in times
