 Dear Mr Horan Just a line or so letting you know that I have seen George who was in a Convl. Camp down here after an attack of Measles, and at time of writing was well and expected to be going back to France in a week or so. 
 I have been over from France for about 3 months, having been sent over with a fractured ankle and then contracted Bronchitis but am now well and in No. 2 Rest or Conlv. Camp here and was lucky enough to meet George and we spent the day together.  I also met Sammy Dickinson over here with the C.L.S.C., but believe he has now gone over to France.  It was bad to hear that poor Horrie Logan &amp; Horrie Hellyer got killed.  I told George that I would write and let you know how he was as I heard several times while in France that George was killed and was surprised when I met him here so thinking you might of heard the same thought I would write and let you know that he is real well
