  
 other hand we have gained considerably, when we realize that they have not fallen in vain, since what they gave up their lives for is  WON .   The 11th inst. saw the end of hostilities, & the close of the bloodiest, most cruel & most uncalled for War in history. The Kaiser & his gang have fled to Holland & Europe is left to repair the handiwork of these monsters. We have great consolation, however, in knowing that those who caused the damage will have to pay in hard cash for the repairs. On this great day 11-11-18, we had the remarkable experiences of celebrating not only the 3rd Anniversary of our departure from Australia, which we did in right royal fashion with a banquet & musical evening;  but, also the  end of the War . Few of us at present can realize that such is the case. We have sang, cheered, waved flags & so forth and watched the French people do the same, but still we cannot fully realize the situation and what it means.  I am very doubtful if we will, until we set foot once more upon the sunny shores of our own dear land, & there greet our long "lost friends & dear ones". Then I am sure we will appreciate all to the full & more.  No doubt the return of the troops will bring extra sorrow, to many an already stricken heart, there will be no "Son', "Father", "Brother", "Cousin" or "Sweetheart" returning to them.   Their grief must naturally be increased in proportion to the joys of others
