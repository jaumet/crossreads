6/3/18 Boulogne
We pulled into Boulogne at about 3 pm and found that the new officers club was full up so had to put up at the old one with McConnaughty Harwood Herrod all Colonels. Went and saw the R.T.O. regarding the train for Bailleul tomorrow. Met Col. Travers in the street and had a yarn with him. With McConnaughty Herrod walked up the street and made some purchases All the streets thronged with people and very dark. Had an amusing conversation in one lingerie shop. The W.A.A.Cs hunt in pairs and don't seem averse to glad eye. Made round to the Officers Club and had a good dinner being waited on by a very pretty little WAAC with
