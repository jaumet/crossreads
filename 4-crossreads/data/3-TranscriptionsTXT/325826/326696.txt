6.  failed.  However the librarian was very nice this morning & promised to keep it for me.Yesterday afternoon Gwen invited Mr Leckie, another girl passenger & myself to a French tea & we had wedding cake & sweets & a novel game & altogether quite a jolly little time.  Then at night we were present at a dance though needless to say I did not dance.  Gwen & the doctor did though & Mr Leckie & I enjoyed watching them quite sufficiently.  This Mr Leckie is such a well-read young fellow and always so gentlemanly that we all think such a lot of him.There are a fair number of children on board & though some of them are unbearably spoiled, some are just little dears & make a pleasant change.  One little child takes fits of haunting my cabin and is by turns an angel & again a rather tiresome little body.         My knitting is going ahead, & though I hardly ever seem to have it out of my hands, it doesn't get done quite so quickly as I had bargained.  Still I love doing it & it forms a splendid outlet for superfluous energy.  The gentlemen have had cricket a couple of times but we ladies have had no exercise of that sort.
