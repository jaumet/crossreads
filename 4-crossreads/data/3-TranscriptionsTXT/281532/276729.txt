going to billets. They had neither telephones or Lewis guns and were much upset by the sudden orders. Their old Colonel of the Regiment was a fine old chap. All of them seemed at sea. We got to work with plenty of effort and they took over alright but after a tremendous amount of trouble. Left 1 N.C.O per Coy, 3 signallers, 16 Lewis guns, 3 'phones & Major Matthews to tide them over their troubles. Their coys. were 225 strong and the whole area was crowded with men. At 6pm under a heavy barrage the Tommies attacked Montbrehain and their assaulting waves looked very well as they crossed the open. Relief was not complete until 3.30 a.m. As we came through Estrees on our return journey we were shelled. Ended up before dawn in cold dugouts near Billiard Wood.
