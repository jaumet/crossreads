<p>Gruss Aus Herbertshoh  Bismarckarchipel</p>
<p>Poor Capt Pockley of the A.M.C. went right into the firing line I believe. He was brought down by Dr Donaldson and Chook Henderson and was carried aboard   but passed away about 12 o'clock and he now rests in the neighbourhood of these houses.[the postcard is of a village on a river] <br/>Dear Keith, Perhaps you have now heard of Herbertshoh where our men first went ashore. The wireless station some miles inland was attacked. The half battalion landed one day and we of the right half expected to land at dawn. We were called up at 4am and were ready to leave but we were not wanted. However A Coy. Was 1st to land at Raboul the capital.<br/>We marched through the town at dusk and did [indecipherable] on the hills at the back. This is exciting. Remember me to all</p>
