  
 hard & day after day we did nothing but stables, (that was after the Barrage trip & we do very little now. All we do is saddle up in the morning & tour the river valley or banks & date-palm country & in fact go sight-seeing, & come back home about 2.30pm in the afternoon. The other day we all went into a small church among big trees, in a old garden, & were shown the inside by the caretaker, - the whole regiment , mind you officers (& all) it was a Catholic church. The walls were painted beautifully with large pictures of the Virgin Mary, & Christ & Joseph coming into Egypt. There were beautiful little statues & carving etc.
