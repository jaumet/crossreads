<p>November, 1915<br/>Monday 29<br/>Last night we had our first Snow storm &amp; everything is white. The trenches as one gropes along in the dark show a white wall on each side &amp; are mud to the knees &ndash;<br/>The men are bricks &amp; only a few wasters growled &ndash; we will have real Holly &amp; snow for Xmas here &ndash; Folk at home should knit gloves &amp; Mits now, in lieu of soks I am using a pair of the latter for Mits as I lost my gloves in my old Kit, after the charge. Certainly the hills look pretty!! But it is not the Creel Hotel Kosiosko. Posted you Diary yesterday.</p>
