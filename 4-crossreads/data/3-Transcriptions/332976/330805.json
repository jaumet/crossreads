<p>March 1917<br/>(6th continued)   "Eternal Ally" and "Central Sap" into the front line Sunray Trench.  This trench was taken three <strike>of</strike> or four days ago &amp; is in a deplorable state.  It could hardly be called a trench at all- it is simply a line of "shell holes" connected up in parts &amp; with mud, in places up to the thighs.<br/>The infantry fatigue dropped the material in the trench &amp; I had to carry on with the four sappers &amp; build four shelters for the men to sleep in, at four of the bombing posts.  We were handicapped to a great extent by Fritz's bombing &amp; artillery, which at times was fairly heavy.  We had started two of the shelters &amp; at about midnight</p>
