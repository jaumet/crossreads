 Dear Sir, I have to convey to you the deepest sympathy of the members of the Royal Society of Queensland in the loss of your son Dene, who gave his life for his country. He is the first member that this Society has lost on active service and we deeply deplore the loss of one who gave such promise in his scientific work. 
 I am, Yours faithfully, A.B. Walkom Hon. Secretary. 
 Mr. Fry, Northcote Rd., Lindfield, N.S.W.
