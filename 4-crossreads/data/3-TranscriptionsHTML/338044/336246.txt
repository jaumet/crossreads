<p>(six of us) &amp; after repaying 45 francs advanced first day we have 105 left aproximately &pound;3-10-0 &ndash; good pay. The Pay-officer here (Capt McKay) is one of the best. Anticipating leaving for the front I spend two hours to-night packing away all my souvenirs gained in my travels to send to Mother. Expenses to-day light &ndash; 1 &frac12; francs</p>
<p>19th August:- Saturday<br/>Arrived at Hdqus to find the usual amount of work. Just graft  Put my head    &amp; go it hard until 12-30 pm. The amount of casualties coming in for the 2nd Division is astounding &amp; the harder one goes the more comes along. Just before leaving W.O. Oliver informs me that we must work this afternoon (my Asst &amp; I) &amp; &amp; this after Capt Parker told us all to get out    &amp; have some fresh air. Great life this. Work &amp; nothing but it &amp;  not even a few hours to oneself. Being</p>
