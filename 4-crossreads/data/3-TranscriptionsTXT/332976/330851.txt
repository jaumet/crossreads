April 191730th.   We resumed our work this morning and a fatigue party of about 20 German prisoners have been attached to my party & a few to the others.   They are working very well & I am general interpreter to the lot.   They are living at Tootencourt, about 5 Km away & are brought here & back in moter transports.
May1st.  The weather has been beautifully fine since we have been here & the trees are shooting out in green foliage.   We had the Germans again to-day & are carring on with our usual work.
