 On arrival at Camp we were very much surprised or rather disappointed to find that men who had left France 2 months ago had not left England yet. This means that we will be here until they have all gone.

 For 5 days after arrival at this Camp we have had nothing but Q.M. parades medical inspections, and innoculation for the Flu.
