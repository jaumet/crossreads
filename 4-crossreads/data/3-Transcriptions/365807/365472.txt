<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>This afternoon we had a visit from Mr Holman. Had a ceremonial parade with Birdwood presenting decorations to the men of the Brigade.  Holman said a few well chosen words. He was well received &amp; very tactfully steered clear of all dangerous references to party politics. I afterwards met him &amp; had a few words conversation with him. It is a long time since I have seen a well dressed civilian in a blue serge suit raising his hat to senior military officers. A man with less tact than Holman might have found the situation this afternoon rather embarrasing.</p>
<p>We are still "Resting" and training. Having quite a good time, only 5 hours parade a day. Plenty of other work to do I find. Everyone in excellent spirits &amp; myself in splendid Health.  Best Love</p>
<p>Yours affectionately<br/>CR Lucas</p>
