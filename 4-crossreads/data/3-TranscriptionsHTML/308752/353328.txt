<p>Wednesday 29th March.<br/>Reveille 6.a.m. Moved off at 9 oclock a bit too late I think, as we will again strike the hottest part of the day. About 9 miles to go, it will be much easier work as we have a hard road to march on all the say. Troops looked very well marching along with their different bands playing a good hearty tune.  The <u>Prince of Wales</u> took the salute as we marched past, we gave him a good hearty cheer. The march through Ismailia was much more enjoyable than the previous days struggle. It was quite a treat to have a little shade whilst moving along the beautiful avenues, in the picturesque little village. Great crowds of natives, Egyptians &amp; French lined the streets on either side, it was quite a unique experience. About 200 men fell out of the infantry in the last stage of this march. The heat was too severe for them, we were only allowed three spells in the nine miles, which is not very liberal. Crossed the Canal by means of a pontoon bridge built by the Engineers. The water looked very tempting for a good swim, but of course no halt was made here. Reached our new camp at 12.30 p.m. The great memorable march is completed. It was a great experience, one that can never be forgotten. In the afternoon we all enjoyed a swim. Advance party left us again to a place called Railhead 8 miles further on. The heat all day has been very oppressive.</p>
