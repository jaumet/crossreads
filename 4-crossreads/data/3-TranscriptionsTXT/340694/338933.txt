 48 Hack turned up later &amp; I had tea with them &amp; stayed there all next day &amp; next night the reason was our stuff going astray. Came by Motor Lorry &amp; turned up intact. 
 We are in very good quarters here, built by the Engineers of weatherboard. My friend &amp; I have a nice bedroom with two home made beds so we are "home &amp; dried". Mitch is still cooking for us &amp; is a dag. I was greeted with a huge mail the first day also numerous papers.
