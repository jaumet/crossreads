  
 night, all wet & covered in mud from the trenches. One fellow who had his cheek nearly blown away, but very cheery, said how long will it take before I'm at them again - this is a nice Souvenir, just 12 months married today. 3 other lads unconscious from Gas. One fellow was shot in the groin by a snipper - said just going on Guard when the blighter got me. Took a walk while slack about midnight & followed the horse shoe of the trenches by the flash of the star shells & guns - it is hard to realize what war in reality is - but when you are forced to believe that your turn may be next, it is almost nerve wrecking - Some of the wounds nearly turned me up & it proves that a man can stand a devil of a lot of the Huns. The Boys that fell were buried quietly nearby. At our Billet in the Village in the backyard along with others lies Pte S H Schroeder - 9th Battalion 3rd Brigade A.I.F. 
 13/7/16  Thursday 
 Very cold day - A Party of us took rations to our lads in the trenches - The Boys still coming in freely, all slight clean cases today.
