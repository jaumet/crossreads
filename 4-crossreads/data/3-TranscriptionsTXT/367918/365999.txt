Dear Father & MotherA day of great excitement. Have at last started on the long trip home. It makes me feel pretty sentimental. Many a time have I little expected to start for home.
Left the School at 1 o'clock & train started at 3.30. Shall be at Havre France for about 5 days & then go to England. Got two letters from you today.
The train is shaking too much to write
