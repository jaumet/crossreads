<p>at 4.30 p.m.  Left the boys at there ward &amp; then met Dorothy &amp; we left about 5 p.m. for Cairo.  I tried to get a Panama but they are all sold out.  We have a regulated band &amp; panama hat now for out-door uniform but I have to still wear my old one &ndash;</p>
<p>We had dinner in Cairo &amp; came back early about 8.30 p.m. &amp; went to bed.  Slept very soundly.</p>
<p>When I arrived here Sunday found 2 or three letters for me but none from home.  Anyhow to-day I received two Nos. 24 &amp; 26.  Alice &amp; Ethel's, so I am very delighted.  Have had a lovely lot of letters to-day.  One from poor old Keith, written on a Hospital Ship but he did not know where he was going &ndash; thought England &ndash; but will write and let me know.  A lovely lot of bags to hang onto the patients beds from Mrs. Boynes, so I have given all my patients one &amp; they were very delighted &amp; asked me to thank my friend</p>
