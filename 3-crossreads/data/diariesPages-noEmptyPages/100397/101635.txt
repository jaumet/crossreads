camps, then back via the Base, so even if I do not get anything else out of it, I get a trip. The weather has been very good so far, just the last few days have been dull and cloudy, and there has been a little rain, but not very much Right through, the winter has been wonderfully mild, and the hedges were out in bud, in February the Young leaves had burst their buds in places, so I expect that this year Spring will come early. I hope that it will settle this business for I think that everyone is just about the same now "fed up." I know that I am, but its not much use feeling that way. The game still goes on.
