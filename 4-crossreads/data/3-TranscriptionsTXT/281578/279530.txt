Australian Comforts Funds, London sent on behalf of the Head Office Staff of Bank N.S.W., very nice things in it too & a nice letter enclosed from K.A. Birkmyre hon. sec for the committee. The limber arrived with a hot drink of cocoa about 9.30 p.m. as usual, & when it was dark at 10.30 we set off on our customary digging job about a mile away. An engineer officer pointed out the work, digging a trench 4 feet deep - it was soft earth , & already half dug, so didn't take long, & we were back in our little "homes" at 1.30 a.m. Even when home is only a dugout, it's the nicest spot there is, just because it is home, & Crain & I are comfortable in our pozzy, with the mattress on the ground, & quilts round the sides, evidently salvaged from the houses in Corbie by previous soldier boys. Wedn. 5 June Went straight to sleep on coming in from digging at 1.30, roused up at 3 when breakfast arrived (tea & bacon), went to sleep again till cocoa came up at 11.30. About 4 dinner comes up (tea & stew) & at 10 p.m. cocoa before starting out on fatigue. The rations for 24 hours (bread, jam & cheese or margarine) are issued each afternoon. We had a good day as regards shelling
