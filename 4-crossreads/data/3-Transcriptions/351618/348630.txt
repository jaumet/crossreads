<p>towards evening the wind rose &amp; lightening lashed in the S. Western portion of the heavens. I had secured our supply and conveyed all the goods to the store by the mules and had just returned when the rain commenced to pour down accompanied by strong gusty wind. I was anxious about the roof of my dug out store standing as it was only Water P sheets &amp; blankets. Fortunately it stood the test but I was up most of the evening catching the drops of water as it leaked through in various places. To catch the water I had large Dixies we make tea in &amp; I emptied several of these during the night. It eased off towards the morning &amp; I fell asleep very tired but satisfied I had protected the bread &amp; other perishable stores.</p>
