5-2-16Sat 5thHad rifle & kit inspection this morning, & were also paid. I had to take a shift on the phone this afternoon as 3 Sigs received passes to town today; Two teams of this Regt played football this afternoon; The Welch miners did not take their beating too well yesterday & have not proved themselves sports; We had a few good showers of rain late this evening;Some gift parcels were distributed today amongst the troops. The 2nd L.H.Regt held sports today & in the alarm race the bugler blew the alarm; The English officers hearing the alarm stood the whole 53rd Division to arms & sent a messenger over to find out the reason; they thought the enemy must have been sighted close by, but found there was nothing doing, but it caused some excitement for the Tommies
