And I know just how 'twill be,When the evening shadows, deepeningShall bring in eternity
3Though the Sun go down for everI have his unfailing GraceAnd the Shadows darkly creepingCannot hide His blessed FaceFor "they shall not walk in darkness""Who follow me, said He, And Glory of His PresenceShall go down the Vale with me.When the Shadows, darkly creepingShall bring in Eternity
LM Rockdale SydneyMarch 1916
"The Past""It is a well known fact that many men who had been in Holy Orders previous to the War, and enlisted, have thrown away altogether all profession of faith  Some it is known, have been through Hospital even as Padres for venereal disease
The PastThey march before me in solemn arrayThese ghosts of my buried yearsGhosts of the days when I served the KingAnd knelt at His throne with tearsAt the foot of His Throne with tears
2Knelt at His Throne with tears for thoseWho were as I am to day.Wandering, wandering, out in the GloomAfar from the narrow way.The straight and narrow way.
3The Ghosts of a thousand Sermons passAnd gibe at me as they go,And whisper, and whisper, stealing pastOf bottomless pits of woeOf death, and pain, and woe4
