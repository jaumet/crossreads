<p>Ring out old shapes of foul disease,<br/>Ring out the narrowing lust of gold,<br/>Ring out the thousand wars of old,<br/>Ring in the thousand years of peace.</p>
<p>Thoughts on a life ended.</p>
<p>What I spent, I had!<br/>What I saved, I lost!<br/>What I gave, I have!</p>
<p>Sunday 19th Nov.<br/>Had snow yesterday the first of the season &amp; also the first proper fall I had seen.  It was indeed a pretty sight &amp; lasted most of the day rain spoiling it in the afternoon.  It was of course bitterly cold &amp; when the thaw came the mud was as bad as ever.  Cases now coming in by train as roads too bad for cars.  A large number of sick &amp; trench feet cases also coming forward.</p>
<p>Monday 20th Nov.<br/>A fine day once again.  Went to the German camp for the last time &amp; had a last talk.  Had the "Hymn of Hate" recited to me &amp; translated, it is certainly a powerful poem but of course sadly mistaken.  On my leaving they wished me the best of luck during my visit to the trenches.  On reaching camp again, I heard of a move.  We were to pack up immediately &amp; join up with our own crowd in order to go to the Advanced Dressing Station.  Marched out at 5 P.M. met A &amp; B Sections &amp; continued on to some huts where we slept the night.  Plenty of mud but otherwise fine.</p>
