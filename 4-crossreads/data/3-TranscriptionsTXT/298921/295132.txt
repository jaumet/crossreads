June, 1915Thursday 10My recommendation for Captain has gone in today - The Colonel tells me I will get the rank, but not the pay at present, however, the Rank is something - it means 3 stars I have 3 Court Martials running at the present time, all Reinforcements - just arrived - The 6th Brigade of Infantry are here & I am told that Jack Lorimer is among them but at present Quarantined at Suez - the whole boatload - I expect Harry Phillips will turn up soon, but one never looks for people among soldiers like needles in Hay Stacks.
