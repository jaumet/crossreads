<p>September 1917<br/>15th   We were on the same job again this morning &amp; did all the communications to front line, &amp; the whole of the front line &amp; outposts on the sector we are to occupy.   At 9.AM our artillery began a barrage on Fritz &amp; kept it up for half an hour, fairly heavy.   We had got up to within 300 yds of the front line, when Fritz retaliate with a barrage &amp; we found ourselves in the midst of it.   Although it only lasted half an hour it seemed ages &amp; it was a miracle how we escaped.<br/>He kept up a steady shelling on the front line &amp; supports throughout the remainder of the day &amp; we had a good many casualties.   The front line is in a very bad state &amp; in places not more than a couple of feet deep.   The 7th Londons are also</p>
