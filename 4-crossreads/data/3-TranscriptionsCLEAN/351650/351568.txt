must be a very bad sailor if anticipation does this:  anyway I do not feel extra keen on the trip home.
How long are you going to be away with 'Linda', whoever that is - and you want to be very careful messing about New Guinea of all absurd places - don't catch fever or get into any other tropical pitfalls.
On the strength of your good advice I shall not drink strong liquor on the way home nor at home till after the war - please do not imagine I'm improving in standard, but it makes for a safer recovery if one gets ill or hurt.  Goodbye Mrs. John.
Yours sincerelyJohn Chute Ellis.
