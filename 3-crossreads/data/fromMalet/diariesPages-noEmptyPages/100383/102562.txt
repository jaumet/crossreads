right through to Euston Station after a lot of stopping. On reaching Euston we took tube for Charing Cross where we change into another tube for Waterloo Station where we arrived at 6 A.M. We then had 25 minutes to wait & then the train moved out & had to change at Salisbury & took train for Amesbury & arrived back at camp at midday. On Friday evening went for a walk through village of Durrington which is very old but is very pretty. Later I was sent to Officer school at Candahar Barracks Tidworth which is only a small township but with beautiful scenery & the barracks are supposed to be the most comfortable in the world.

On 13/8/17 written examination which I passed with a 63%. The school finished on Friday 17th & the same night I took train from Tidworth to Bournemouth via Andover & Salisbury. Bournemouth is a beautiful sea resort & I spent a very pleasant time there leaving on Monday night by 6 pm train & arrived back to camp at 10.30 pm. Next day I had to carry on again with parade ground work & am still going strong on the close of my second years service with A.I.F.
