of campaign life when men who are behind the line make their official position felt as much as possible.His company had lost a primus stove, smashed in a bombardment & he requisioned for a new one.  After some delay, an answer came like this, "I am not clear about your requisition for a primus.  I cannot understand how such a thing could be destroyed in action.  Was it a hostile shell?"  He was very indignant & replied as follows.  The requisition was signed by myself as C.O. of the company, that should be sufficient guarantee of good faith.  The details are as follow.On the - Mch. a shell known in the trenches as a 5.2 fell on a cookhouse near our gun emplacement.  It was a hostile shell.  When we had picked up from the ruins, one man killed & two wounded, we found at last the damaged primus.  I shall be glad if you will forward new one.I mention this to show how officialdom sometimes makes unconsciously the most humorous (if it were not so annoying) requests
