 Most of the day has been spent on the dump on account of the utter confusion of the traffic.  the holdup in all traffic is unavoidable on account of the terrible nature of the road &amp; the way the shell torn country is battered about. It is marvellous to think that this devastated country was once of a smiling &amp; agricultural nature, now it is awful to look at. Gaunt &amp; isolated tree trunks are all that is left of forests &amp; a few scattered bricks mark where once prosperous villages were situated. 
 Old Fritz with habitual regularity is trying to make us shift our camp &amp; unfortunately he is beginning to get closer. This afternoon he landed one over which everyone thought was right here. It landed however just over the railway trucks right in among a camp of guardsmen, who fortunately had just moved out, otherwise there would have been serious casualities. Since I have been here there have been about 6 killed &amp; a lot wounded. 
 I do not anticipate much sleep tonight as the guns have opened much earlier than usual. 
 I do not profess to be a hero &amp; I can honestly say that the sight of these exploding shells causes many anxious moments after they strike it is alright, but hearing the hiss coming towards you &amp; not knowing where they are going to hit is absolutely unnerving.
