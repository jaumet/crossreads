<p>Auckland Weekly<br/>Capture of Jerusalem<br/>The British Proclamation</p>
<p>London, Dec. 12<br/>On his entry into Jerusalem the commander of the British forces, Sir Edmund Allenby, caused the following proclamation in various languages to be read to the populace from the steps of the citadel and posted on the walls.<br/>"To the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the blessed, and the people dwelling in its vicinity.  I have placed the city under martial law, which will remain in operation as long as military considerations make it necessary.  However, lest any of you should be alarmed by reason of your experience at the hands of the enemy, I inform you that it is my desire that every person should pursue his lawful business without fear of interruption.  Furthermore, since your city is regarded with affection by the adherents of three great religions and its soil consecrated by the prayers and pilgrimages of multitudes of devout people of these religions during many centuries, therefore do I make known to you that every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place of prayer, of whatsoever form of the three religions, will be maintained and protected according to the existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they are sacred."<br/>The populace received the British with favour.</p>
