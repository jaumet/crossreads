<p>not far from here, he was working on a light railway at Mametz Wood.  5-30 p.m. an issue of shells over in our lines, no one wounded, a fire bucket knocked out.  The concussion was so great that the lights in the tents went out.  Great Artillery activity on just now.  This is a real hell hole, don't know the day a man will get slogged out.  Just heard how G. Gibbs got killed.  Three coal boxes come over, he and two more took cover behind a stack of timber, the third shell hit the timber, killing George and a signaler Sgt., the third man escaped.  I am trying to find out where his grave is.</p>
<p>5-12-1916<br/>Wet, with hail, very cold;  nothing much doing.  A bit of a stunt just starting.  Germans sending a few shells over, 6 p.m.  A rumour that the Bty. is going to be formed into a 6 gun Bty.  8 remounts received.  D.A.C. getting all mules.</p>
<p>6-12-1916<br/>This morning at 1 a.m. enemy shelling.</p>
