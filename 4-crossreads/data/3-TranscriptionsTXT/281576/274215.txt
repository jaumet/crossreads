 Friday. May 11.  2 men of the S. Staffords were also hurt, one stretcher &amp; one walking case.  Just before it got dark Fritz made things very hot.  A big working party of Tommies was going through to the front Line &amp; for an hour or so it was perfect Hell.  One big shell landed outside our dugout &amp; put the candle out.  Bricky sang out "Hello! any Blighties" just as a chap stumbled into our dug-out with a knock on the side of the Head.  Sam Wallace got wounded in the leg, while on his way back to the dug-out; which made 3 wounded from our Post.  It was a most unhealthy spot &amp; we were mighty pleased when our relief, the 15th arrived about 1 a.m. on Sat. morning. 
 Once during the night we got lost &amp; were wandering around with a stretched case for about an hour. I sang out "Reg Sutton" &amp; away in the distance Reg replied "Hello is that you Peter?  It was the sweetest voice but one that I ever heard.  We got back to the A.D.S. about 3 on Sat. morning.  Bricky &amp; I got a lift in a motor Amb. from the A.D.S. to a collecting Post &amp; from there on to our little Home in a motor, with a crowd of sitting wounded.  They shelled our crowd out of their old position &amp; they went further back, 2 miles nearer Bapaume.  The A.D.S. are in a pretty good place, just outside the village of [Vaulese?].  It took us some time to find our Packs &amp; Blankets as they were all dumped in a heap.  We were jolly tired &amp; soon fixed up a place to sleep.  We put down a couple of duckboards &amp; lay down between our Blankets.  In minutes we were sound asleep.
