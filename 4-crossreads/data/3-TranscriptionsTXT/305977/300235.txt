July 1915see but an aeroplane was up all the time & the Turks must have fired over 50 shrapnel shells at her.  We did some more trench digging at night.  Am beginning to get fed up with all this night work, as it is nearly impossible to sleep in the day time for heat & flies.  Was not feeling too good at night time.  A change in tucker would be very acceptable.  The menu is not sufficient to stand much pick & shovel work on.
Sunday 11thWent to the doctor & got a pill.  Still on duty though.  Chauney got wounded slightly by a sniper on the beach.  They have been pretty hot these last 2 days.  Was on the pick & shovel at night digging a support trench.  Came in at 2am.
Monday 12thThere was another demonstration in front of our lines this morning. The Turks put in a hot shrapnel fire.  We had 4 men killed & 9 wounded out of about 27
