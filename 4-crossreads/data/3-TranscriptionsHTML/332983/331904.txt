A terrific straff this afternoon, one of our men slightly wounded. Also one horse. Over 1,000 rounds of ammunition going to Bty. A big advance coming off tonight. My orders are to have every horse harnessed and drivers to stand by. Our wagons in a tight corner. Dead horses and men strewn about. An English Bty had one team of horses left out of six. The Artillery is getting hell, Our old friend the 12 inch is firing away. The Germans were very comfortable</p>
