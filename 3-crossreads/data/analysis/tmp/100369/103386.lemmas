Dec 25th 11.45 Xmas day 1917 is almost a thing of the past . It has been a most miser day . Rain near all the time , with thunder and lightn , and a cold bite wind .

The Rothschild distilleri peopl provid free wine for all the Soldier this morn . That " Jolli " them up a bit . With what they procur elsewher , that has kept some more than happi all day . I am on picket to night , one hour and a quarter . To morrow we leav here for the vicin of Eshdud again . This move of cours , is owe to the difficulti of transport to where we are . I am sit shiver in my wet overcoat to write these few line on the edg of my bed befor the morn dawn . Wet feet , wet overcoat and to top it all , wet blanket . A Happi Xmas , Oh , Yes , certain , and a shift in the rain to morrow . I forgot to mention that my cobber (young Billi Beasant ) and I to day went into the Synagogu to have a look round . It is the first time I have been insid a Jewish Synagogu . The men seat below , are of some light wood , varnish .
