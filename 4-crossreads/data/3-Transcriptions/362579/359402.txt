<p>My dearest Mother   &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>Received two home letters this week. July 9th came on Tuesday   &amp;  July 1st came Friday. It is strange how the later mail get here first, anthow I was very delighted to get them.</p>
<p>Eddy has soon learnt to write   &amp;  I daresay he will get on quqickly because he is such a good little kiddie so pleased he likes his school   &amp;  the playmates are what the little chap needed.</p>
