<p>the edge of the aerodrome. One bomb exploded, and the machine burst into flames. A number of officers and men ran to the assistance of the Pilot, and when they approached the machine a second bomb burst wounding 6 men. Amongst them was No. Aus/607, 1/A.M. Dell,  W.R. (Photographer) who was admitted to hospital, but succumbed to the effects of his injuries before morning. He was buried in the RAMLEH cemetery.</p>
<p>On the 7th Capt. R.M. Smith M.C. (Pilot) and Lieut. E.A. Mustard (Observer) accounted for an enemy two-seater near JENIN. The enemy machine crashed into the side of a hill and burst into flames. On the same day Lieut. A.V. Tonkin (pilot) and Lieut. R.A. Camm (observer) accounted for two Albatross Scouts.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th hostile scouts shot down one of our Observation Balloons near BIREH, and the following afternoon they attacked two of our Balloons North of JAFFA, both of which were sent down in flames.</p>
<p>On the 16th Capt. R.M. Smith M.C. (pilot) with Col. Lawrence as passenger, and escorted by Lieut. C.S. Paul and Sgt.. Mechanic Horscroft, flew to KERAK and KUTRANI. The machine landed at WADI HUFIR, 10 miles South East of KUTRANI, for the purpose of allowing Col. Lawrence to get into  touch with the Arab forces belonging to the Sheriff of MECCA.</p>
<p>On the 22nd Capt. R.M. Smith M.C. (pilot) and Lieut. W.A. Kirk (observer) accounted for another enemy single seater near NABLUS, while on the following day Lieut. C.S. Paul (pilot) and Lieut. W.A. Weir (observer) attacked 4 enemy scouts at 11,000 feet over BIREH, two of which were shot down. The German diary records that one of these scouts crashed badly in their lines, the pilot being severely wounded.</p>
<p>On the 29th, Lieut. G.C. Peters (Pilot) and Lieut. J.H. Traill (observer) accounted for another two-seater near BIREH.</p>
<p>Very little was heard of the Turkish Squadron located at KUTRANI. Their machines were only twice seen in the air by our pilots &ndash; one by Capt. S.W. Addison, and some days later by Capt. A.R. Brown. On both occasions they were driven down.</p>
<p>Referring to a bomb raid on the aerodrome at JENIN carried out on May 9th, the German Flying Corps diary states that the machines of the 303 Squadron were 'mostly considerably damaged'; while 2 lorries, 2 motor cars and a quantity of mens clothing were destroyed, and one man wounded.</p>
<p>JUNE: The month of June was a period of even greater activity than the preceding months. This will be evident from the fact that the Squadron's total flying hours for the four weeks increased to 716. Matters having now become comparatively quiet in the Eastern Sector, this area was reconnoitred less frequently; but the KERAK, KUTRANI, MADIERA area where developments were expected, was more closely watched than at any time previously. In the course of this reconnaissance, which was made on 13 occasions during the month, our machines usually swept the country up to a point just South of AMMAN. It involved a flight of approximately 240 miles, across the DEAD SEA and over large tracts of mountainous country.</p>
<p>The NABLUS, TULKERAM, KAKON, area, together with the whole of the coastal sector, was reconnoitred 13 times. A special reconnaissance of JENIN and AFULE was carried out, while HAIFA was visited by our machine for the first time.</p>
<p>There was a falling off in the amount of photography done. During the month 14 photographic reconnaissances were carried out, chiefly of the SHUNET NIMRIN sector, 365 plates were exposed and 4647 prints produced, covering an area of approximately 85 square miles. This completed a specified area required for mapping purposes. It embraced the whole of the enemy's defence system at SHUNET NIMRIN.</p>
<p>The number of hostile aircraft patrols for the month increased to 133, in addition to which, escorts to bombing formations from</p>
