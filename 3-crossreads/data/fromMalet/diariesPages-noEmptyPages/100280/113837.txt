trenches with 2 men myself the portion of trench I was in was mostly 5th Bde they had the wind up properly as they had lost heavily as the numerous dead lying about showed all too plainly, when we were taking over old Fritz made a counter attack but he was beaten off. I'm hanged if I know where were until day broke for shells seemed to be coming from all sides flares were going up practically all round us it seemed very queer.
