<p>Wednesday 14 June 1916<br/>Steady rain during the night &amp; in the early morning, conditions underfoot being execrable.<br/>Lt. Cullenward returned from leave. An extremely quiet day, very little firing taking place on either side. A fair NE wind in the afternoon together with a little sunshine dried things up considerably &amp; by evening it was fairly pleasant, though cold. Visited by Lt. Newth &amp; Lt. Moy during the day, &amp; also by Arnold Hazlewood who came along from B Co to have a yarn.</p>
