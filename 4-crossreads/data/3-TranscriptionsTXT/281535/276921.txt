 21/4/19 Strassburg Their national Costume and headgear which is very nice. Now to Square at the back where are Kaisers palace Library etc. Everyone is speaking German &amp; I can see that the people here seem to be much more German than French. Strassbourg seems a clean well kept and fine city. Had a ridiculously cheap early dinner at the Hotel du Poste and then went up to the State Opera House and at 8pm saw a splendid performance of "Mireille" in French followed by the ballet play "Coppelia". The music scenery and production of these could not have been better. Met an elderly American gentleman who was very interesting to talk to &amp; who says the religious question here is one the French want to treat sympathetically.
