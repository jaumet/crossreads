<p>a huge bridge which crosses the stream.</p>
<p>Mar 18<br/>This morning we passed Ezra tomb which is erected on the left bank of the River.  It came into sight some considerable time before we reached the spot, standing like a sentinel, casting off the suns rays from its blue enameled tiled dome.  It stands inside a square mud wall, round about which are a number of date palms &amp; appears to be in an excellent state of preservation, no doubt due to the fact that both Mohammend and Christian preserve the memory of this grand old Jew.</p>
<p>Quite a number of Arab women are nearby, some of whom are extremely pretty in their quaint native dress.</p>
