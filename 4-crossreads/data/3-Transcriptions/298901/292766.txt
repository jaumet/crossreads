<p>&amp; various lots of wool bandages besides shell dressing, haversacks &amp; waterbottles.  They all marched off at 8 P.M..  The few left proceeded to the M.D.S. at St Acheul to join up with the 6th Field for the stunt.  About 10.30 the Colonel &amp; I left by car for St Acheul where the 6th Field are running an M.D.S. in a huge building lately used as a French Military Hospital.  Turned in in the dark no lights being allowed.</p>
<p>Tuesday 6th August<br/>Up at 7 A.M. for parade but ordered to stand by.  Another parade at 10 A.M. when the men were allotted to jobs but there will be nothing for me to do until the stunt starts as there are plenty of dispensers.  Mooned away the rest of the day &amp; wrote a letter, went for a stroll in the evening.  The Sgts live very well here, the mess being first rate having plenty of vegetables etc.</p>
<p>Wednesday 7th August<br/>Parade at 7 A.M.  Still no duties.  Washed some clothes and wrote letters during the day.  At 6 P.M. went on duty giving A.T.S. as the stunt is imminent.</p>
