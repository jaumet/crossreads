[August 1915]
20th Very cold last night after the rain. A little sniping going on this morning otherwise pretty quiet. About midday Turkish Artillery got busy again hurling shells about, one of our Cruisers done good shooting, one of her shells crashed into Turks gun pit, putting gun and most of the gunners out of action. Our forces are well supplied with aircraft no fewer than 5 were up this afternoon observing, The Turks got to work at them with anti-aircraft guns but did no damage. Shells look pretty bursting high in air great danger from falling empty cases.
21st Fairly quiet night, Turks made attack at daylight on S.W.Bs trenches on our left but were beaten back. All prepareing for another dash, our Howitzers start heavy bombardment of enemy trenches about 5P.M. the boys waiting ready for charge. Tough job on hand, about 6 o,clock we lept over the parapets and dashed down the slopes and on towards the Turks trenches , many of our boys were knocked over getting out of our trenches, others killed wounded going forward. The Turks had several machine guns playing on us besides rifle fire. Things were very warm, an 8 inch shell burst and set fire to scrub, many of our wounded were burnt to death. We reached our objective and captured part but lost heavily. Lieuts Carter Thompson wounded. We consolidated position through the night.
