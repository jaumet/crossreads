<p>(96)<br/>Charge of our general duty sergeant Sgt Crook.</p>
<p>The Tommies had left the place in an indescribably filthy condition swarming with flies. We soon set to work and cleaned the place out and baled it out. This dugout was afterwards a very secure and comfortable abode. It's walls were four feet thick and made of solid concret. The roof likewise or stronger still. The inside walls were panelled with heliotrope wallpaper and one could stand up straight inside &ndash; a rare situation.The remainder of our bearers had proceeded up the railway line about &frac14; of a mile to the next pill box "Rabbit Villa" and leaving 8 men there the remaining 8 men of B section went on to the RAP. Meanwhile more men of B section worked another line for evacuation similar to ours down to Bavaria House along the Z road.</p>
<p>Our infantry had taken over the previous night, and we commenced carrying down wounded soon after our arrival at Wilde Wood.<br/>1st October 1917 (Mon)  we were kept busy carrying to Bavaria House. We carried in parties of 4, 2 at a time, with slings.</p>
