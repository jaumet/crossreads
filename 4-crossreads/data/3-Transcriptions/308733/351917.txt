<p>France<br/>21st April 16</p>
<p>Dear Uncle<br/>Just a note to let you know I am still kicking and have not yet seen anything very fierce over here, every thing dead quiet after Gallipoli, expect things will liven up in the dry weather, at present Artillery do all the work.</p>
<p>We have just done four days in the trenches, had a nice restful time in my Company, one of the others got hit to leg a bit but nothing very serious, losing a few men. The trench arrangements are not bad considering the country, but there is room for improvement, the ground is very heavy so all the trenches have to be boarded with what they call duck-walks, it must have been truly awful for the poor Tommies in the first Winter, they say they bogged to their wastes in some places. Was very anxious to have a look at the German front lines, nothing very remarkable about them &ndash; miles and yards of barbed wire of course, the greenest green grass, untrodden by man for many a day, we missed the usual dead men which dotted the inbetween trenches in the Penins [Gallipoli Peninsular]. Had a post card and parcel from Aunt Mary tonight, I often hear from her now, if I could only get away</p>
