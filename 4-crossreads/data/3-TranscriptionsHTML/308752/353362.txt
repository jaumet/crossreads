<p>October 1st 1916.<br/>Sanitary job still going strong. Met an old pal of mine today. Joe Punch (once a member of the Cammeray Cricket Club)   He left Sydney 8 years ago &amp; enlisted in Queensland. Received the sad news today of the death o Eric Conolly   I can hardly realise it.</p>
<p>Sunday 8th October. 12 months today since we left Sydney for Melbourne.</p>
<p>Thursday 12th October.<br/>Shifting again on Saturday 14th. have no idea where our destination well be. It may probably be to our winter quarters. For the last week Fritz has been very quiet I believe our guns found his battery, &amp; blew it to pieces. A bright prospect in front of us (I don't think). When we leave on Saturday we will carry as well as our packs, two gas helmets, one steel helmet &amp; a blanket.,  some weight. One cannot realise how heavy these articles are unless they have been through the ordeal.</p>
