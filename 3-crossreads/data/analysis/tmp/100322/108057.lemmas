 29/4/19 Wiesbaden Spring day . On my trip I have inde been lucki with the weather . Went to the Opera ?Die Judin " ( The Jewess ? " ) at 6.30pm . It was veri good inde . In the interv all the audienc promenad and eat . Remark ? the number of bald men , the number of men with shaven or close crop head and the number who have head peculiar shape . The girl are not blond as one might be excus for expect but they are rather light brunett . Their cloth are neat and there is noth dare about their even toilett . The ?chic " touch of La Petit Parisienn is absent . There is no make up . At the Opera the bouquet to the singer took the form of bough of fruit blossom ? all the tree are now in bloom . To the Cercl des Officier at 10 pm for dinner and wine well befor write this .
