through. On the way we passed through Aire" in which there are many ancient historic buildings, dating back to a very early period. At about past 2 we came to Hazebrouk which is a big town situated on the Railway which is the main supply distributing base to the front which we are fighting on. On the other side of Hazebrouk our Company separated Nos 1 2 going on to Morn barle 3 4 to Casre . I went with 3 4 arrived at Casre at 5 p.m. Just after arriving their being billeted in a farm I received orders that I had to join up with the right Half Company Nos 1 2. So on the top of a heavy days travel I had to saddle up go another 15 miles to catch up to the other columns. I found them after 4 hours riding quartered on an out of the way farm was allotted a barn to sleep in. We are here to rest for 4 days after that I do not know.We have received orders to shine up all our steel parts which in my mind is absolutely ridiculous. It seems to me that this is all the Tommies are doing, while they sleep in villages clean up we have to work clean also.
