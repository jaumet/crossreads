 Saturday 12 [11] May 1917 [1918] Yet another swab taken of this luckless throat. Wrote Eddie Palethorpe re F.R.H. to go through papers if nec. Wrote N. Hitchener, Eva, Mother, Matron, Miss McCulloch, since coming in. These English people are positively the coldest ever met.  Dr. &amp; 8 Sisters freezing &amp; Aust. one on her dignity so I'm worse off than at Choubra where they were all friendly.  Here we are absolutely patients &amp; nothing more, there I was one of themselves. In fact I've got "the blues" badly &amp; want a touch of "home" somehow. M.O. comes 7.40 p.m. &amp; standing beside me says, "You are being a good girl now", immediately I ask &amp; obtain permission to get up tomorrow &amp; am promised a drive on Monday!!
