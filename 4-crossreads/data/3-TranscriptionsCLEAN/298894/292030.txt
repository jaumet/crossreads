THE WAR CHEST FUND, N.S.W. DIVISION A.C.F.
London, the needy villian's general home,The common [indecipherable] of Paris and RomeWith eager thirst, by folly or by fate,Sucks in the dregs of each corrupting state.                                             Dr.Johnson'Tis true,'tis  fily,fily 'tis 'tis trueWe builded better than we knewUnconscious stones to beauty grew. earth hath not anything to show more fair.
