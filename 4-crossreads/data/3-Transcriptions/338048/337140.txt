<p>Saturday 23<br/>Not having made my bed properly I woke several times in the night &amp; noticed no matter what time it was, there we chaps in the place having some coffee etc. The place is near the station &amp; I suppose the fellows were waiting for a train.</p>
<p>Punctually at 5.30 am I was awaken and after cleaning up, having a couple of eggs for breakfast I walked about the streets &amp; finally caught B'ham train at 6.48 am. Owing to the mist I could not see much but it was not a bad district. Leicester is noted for its shoe &amp; hosiery &amp; has about 60,000 people. It has I believe an interesting historic past.</p>
<p>At one of the stations a party of munition working girls got in. They were very lively creatures but evidently decent sorts. One was a very <strike>yellowship</strike> yellowish colour which I discovered was temporary &amp; caused through dealing with "T.N.T." This girl was making "pellets" for bombs etc. the pellets evidently forming the explosive.</p>
<p>Arrived at B'ham 8.17 am &amp; dug up the Y.M.C.A. but was not of much use to me. Was directed to Bournville where after a tram ride (2d) of about 4 or 5 miles I arrived. I called on Cadbury's &amp; was informed that no visitors were allowed on Saturdays mornings as it was cleaning up day. No chance of getting through the official told me so greatly disappointed I set out to see what I could of the famous Bournville. Immediately you get near there you notice the place to be more intelligent looking.</p>
