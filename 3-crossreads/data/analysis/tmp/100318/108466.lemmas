 3/8 /18 Villers-Bretonneux Found that our headquart was a dirti and stuffi dugout crowd to the utmost limit . The 21st Bn - Sullivan 's coy . ? was in the place when we arriv . Our men gradual commenc to come into their posit . It was dark , the trench were full of slush and of water and mani of the bivouac had fallen in . So all hand had to set to work to tri to make their place into some sort of shape . We had to put on a fatigu parti to carri timber up to the place where a new power buzzer is be put in . Our Yank are veri novel with their accent and their ?figur , guess , outfit , c c. They are as keen as mustard and full of buck . A veri great fillip to our moral .
