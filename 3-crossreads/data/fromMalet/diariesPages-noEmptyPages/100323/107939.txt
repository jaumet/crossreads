19/7/19 Chemnitz
Still in bed. It keeps hot and we should go over the Equator tonight. A concert was held for the troops.
20/7/19 Crossed Equator today ? a pleasant day which after dark (6 pm) became decidedly cold and the equatorial temperature called for a blanket in bunk. flying fish today. Sunday.
21/7/19 Got up and feel weak but it was good to go out on deck and see the miles of blue sparkling Equatorial sea. The Atlantic runs in long rollers and though the sea was calm and no white horses yet one could see the steady underlaying breakers coming along. It was dark at 6 pm and then Padre Fox gave a lecture on the South Sea Islands. A dark cool night with bright stars. No doubt the Southern Cross is on view but I could not find it.
