<p>wide and gay with innumerable striped umbrella tents, the Casino hotels are enormous, cafes numerous, and side-shows everywhere, the sands were crowded, but there were very few bathers, most people seemed to content themsellves wading and [shriping ?] in the shallow water.&nbsp; The trip both ways was made in excellent weather by a small steam-boat across the estuary of the Seine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Etretat is a pretty little resort, small and select set above a shingly beach.&nbsp; I went there by motor with the same Major, Jack Harris (Lieut of 29th A.I.F.) and we had a glorious day, cliff climbing, pelting shingles at one another, investigating smugglers caves and lying in the sun on cliff-tops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Octeville I reached by cycle through the picturesque undulating country: Lieut.Cheall (Royal Sussex Regt.) was my companion on the trip which was thoroughly enjoyed, and on the sands near the M.G. range lay a melancholy object, half a hospital ship which had struck a floating mine and which the French were slowly dismantling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; These few notable trips and many little journeys on foot through the woods and villages surrounding camp and many trips to Havre which is a fine town, prosperous, lively and interesting, all helped to make my trip to Base a very happy and memorable one.&nbsp; Now here/I am back at the war and feeling very fit and ready for anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am finishing this off before going up again to the trenches, this sector is fairly quiet but very muddy - Ugh!</p>
