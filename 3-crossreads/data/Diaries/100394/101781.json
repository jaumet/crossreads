We had a very acceptable swim in the public baths in the afternoon and afternoon tea at some Church Canteen run by English ladies.  It was a treat to talk to an English women again. Had to be back by 7 p.m. to dress Major Caddy's arm.</p> \r\n <p>April 6<br> \r\n Very busy sick parade this morning   Went for a swim in Lake Timsah this afternoon.   All the New Zealanders are moving off to France from here lately only a few left.  The few left their mark by burning all canteens to the ground tonight   It started by the proprietor of a wet canteen doubling the price of his beer.  He thought he could ask anything as they were leaving, but they had swift retaliation drinking all the beer first and then burning the Canteen.   Of course all other canteens</p> \r\n <p>April 7<br> \r\n had to go once they were started.   I dare say a good many Australians were mixed up in it too.  Nearly all these occurrences take place under some provocation.   The N.Z's left their Camps in filthy condition.   I must say all Australian lines are left scrupulously clean when leaving and our sanitary arrangements are always perfect.   I have an A.M.C. Cpl to take my place if I can arrange to get into a battery.    More canteens are being burnt tonight.</p> \r\n <p>April 8<br> \r\n I saw Major Cuddy today about getting into a Battery and he promised to let me in as a gunner if the A.D.M.S. will approve.  Today a man came on sick parade complaining of pains in the back, and got pack drill.   At lunch time he reported to me that he had done pack drill all the morning and had to do so again this afternoon - He was running a slight temp so I informed the Dr. and got a note exempting him.   I gave it into his orderly room and his Lieut. told me that he had only done this pack drill in the morn &amp; and wasn't going to do any more in the afternoon after my running round for him for an hour</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301031\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 31]<br> \r\n April 9<br> \r\n Bob Prior Wynne Arthur and myself are spending today in Ismailia.   Lunched at Hotel des Voyageurs after enjoying a very pleasant swim in the public baths.  We are sitting in the gardens at present and intend going for afternoon tea at the canteen run by English ladies which is the only place I have struck in Egypt where one can obtain home made cakes.    About 6 we intend visiting the cinema for about an hour and then dinner   The gardens here are simply [indecipherable] especially as they are made right on desert ground.</p> \r\n <p>April 10<br> \r\n Reveille at 5 a.m. this morning and we started packing up in preparation to moving off to Ferry's Post.  We had to pass through Ismailia on the way so I had some tea and cake at the Canteen run by N.Z. ladies.   We had our camp going fairly well by night.   I had to bustle round to make my arrangements for taking my sick parade.   The 14th Fld. Amb turned me down but Capt. Marshall has arranged to take it</p> \r\n <p>April 11<br> \r\n Had a very large sick parade this morning ? Poor old Crop. and Marshall are having tremendous rows and Crop has applied to go back to the Ambulance as a stretcher bearer.   I have my application ready to put in to go as a gunner and will be well pleased if it comes through.   Capt. Marshall asked me to go with him but I refused it.   My M.O. is expected any day now.</p> \r\n <p>April 12<br> \r\n My smallest sick parade this morning since being here, only 26.   Late this afternoon a tremendous dust storm blew up and lasted most of the night   The sand and grit were something awful.   I thought I had seen some storms in Australia but they were nothing to this one.   I had to be down for a while in the desert while it was blowing</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301032\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 32]<br> \r\n April 13<br> \r\n Inoculation report made out, to send to A.D.M.C.   The storm has continued today.   They say one becomes used to it in a week   It is supposed to last a fortnight so the second week should be fairly pleasant.   The natives call it by the name of Khamaeen.  I put my blankets outside this morning but I had to dig them out tonight.  I hear an old N.Z. lady (who is in charge of the Empire Club Canteen I mentioned run under the instigation of Lady Maxwell)</p> \r\n <p>April 14<br> \r\n expressing very strong views a few days ago.   She said it was a criminal shame in the first place to bring our boys to Egypt \"Can you wonder? she said \"at the number of chaps being sent back home in disgrace when they are longing for a sight of their own women folk and none to see except black women who throw themselves at them\"   Capt. Mapleston M.O. of the Howitzer Bdge took my sick parade today.   The storm seems to have blown away after a very heavy fall of rain</p> \r\n <p>April 15<br> \r\n Capt Mapleston is taking the Howitzer Bdge 13th Bdge and D.A.C. at present so Bob Jack and I are working the dispensary together   I was on duty last night.   Today the A.I.F. canteens are opening as the native's contracts have expired.  We might get our things a little cheaper now.   It has taken the Govt about 18 months to find out that we should have our own Canteens and I suppose we shall all move off as soon as they get properly going.  Had 2 letters today, one from Adelaide Smith and another from the lady who sent my Xmas [indecipherable] from S.A.</p> \r\n <p>April 16<br> \r\n I went round and saw Russ &amp; Edric today and went for a swim in the Canal with them.   We tried the new A.I.F. canteens and found them as dear as the natives and much harder to get near.   My transfer into the Battery has been recommended and sent on so I expect to be a gunner any day now.  I shall be very backward in regard to drill but should soon pick it up.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301033\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 33]<br> \r\n April 17<br> \r\n I was swimming and sitting on the banks of Lake Timsah alternately most of the morning.   Bob and I went over and saw the boys in the 15th Fld. Amb for a while tonight.   When I came back I got orders to report to 51st Battery tomorrow.   I was given a choice of 4 batteries and accepted this one.   all those who were on Anzac had their names taken today for bars.   Red and blue for those who were in the </p> \r\n <p>April 18<br> \r\n landing and plain blue for those who arrived after.    Anzac Day (25th) is a holiday and we are holding sports.  The Prince of Wales and all his entourage were round again this morning.   I reported to my Battery this afternoon and will start tomorrow.   I am in a tent with Bombardier Dunn (a friend of Bobs) a very nice chap out of C.S.R.   I am pretty nervous for a start but I daresay I will get along alright after a time.   Got 2 champions and a Sunday times a few days ago.</p> \r\n <p>April 19<br> \r\n Started in battery this morning.  Squad drill for 1 \u00bd hours before breakfast.   Fill in again at 8.30 and got orders to fall out with specialists.   I am on the range finding and observing staff and as far as I can see I am going to have an easy time of it.   This afternoon I got orders from the Adjutant to report back to the M.O. who arrived this morning and help him 'til another Corporal arrived.   I was very disappointed as I am very keen and every day lost makes it harder for me to make up.</p> \r\n <p>April 20<br> \r\n Have been trying to get a dispensary going today and also working my head to get a Corporal in quickly.   My officers are O.K. Lieut Prior in charge and Lieut Cullen (second in charge)   All the officers in this Brigade are good.   Capt Wilkinson is the new M.O. an awfully nice chap   Tomorrow is Good Friday and a holiday.  I daresay there will be another full dress parade for the Prince of Wales or some such celebrity.  It is an awful farce in my opinion.   Had a swim in the Canal this morning.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301034\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 34]<br> \r\n April 21<br> \r\n We had a whole holiday today.   Russ and I went down for a swim.  Edric couldn't get away as he was on duty.    I am in a tent with a good many R.C's, so I had a good old feed of meat for once.   I am trying to study artillery work every opportunity and if I see a chance will go into an officers school of instruction for a few weeks.   We are going to practice firing next week.  I'm afraid it will be an awful showing as very few know anything about the gun.</p> \r\n <p>April 22<br> \r\n I have been out with the directors all day.  I understand we have to do guards and fatigues on Sundays and holidays as they argue that we have an easy time through the week and it is only fair the others should have a spell.   Young Bunting a friend of the Daltons and also out of A.B.C. Bank, Forbes is with me on the instruments.   I don't go much on him, but it gives us a little to talk about</p> \r\n <p>April 23<br> \r\n I'm very lucky to have missed fatigues today as all the others got let in for something    There is a Church parade at 9 o'clock.   I went round and saw Russ &amp; Edric this afternoon.    They are coming round after tea and we are going to see if we can get something to eat at the Canteen.   A tin of pears or something.   It is too hot for chocolates and the beer is simply abominable.   I am as keen as mustard to learn this artillery work.   We will have a great day on Tuesday (Anzac Day)</p> \r\n <p>April 24<br> \r\n Have been out range firing again all day.  It is very interesting work and not too hard.   Two more canteens are being established quite close here which will be handy.  We had a medical inspection of our Brigade today.   Major Moseley conducted it.   We just marched by him naked.   I am just beginning to get a glimmering of the gun.   It seems disheartening at first but I suppose I will pick it up by and bye.   Church parade tomorrow.   If we have a good speaker he should be interesting.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301035\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 35]<br> \r\n April 25<br> \r\n Anzac Day ? We were presented with colours today on parade by the O.C. of the Battery Lt. Prior.   Plain blue for those who were on the Peninsula and red and blue for those at the landing.  I am mess orderly of all things.  I felt quite proud to be one of a dozen out of the whole Battery.   They are practically all \"deep thinkers\" as we call them.   I went to a splendid concert tonight given by the 8th Brigade.</p> \r\n <p>April 26<br> \r\n Today has been almost unbearable, and consequently nothing much of interest has occurred.   As a matter of fact it is too hot for one to do anything.   I don't know how the troops are going to stand the severe training they are having at present if this weather continues.</p> \r\n <p>April 27<br> \r\n Today we went to an awful lot of trouble and put in some hard work to be ready to be inspected by General Godley in charge of 2nd A. A. Corps.   He was in charge of the N Zealanders on Gallipoli.   We had to stand out in a baking sun for about an hour and a half and then he gave us about 3 minutes of his valuable time.   However we might get to France quicker if he sends in a good report.   Got two letters today from France, one each from Moll &amp; Liz.   Also box of chocolates from unknown address. </p> \r\n <p>April 28 <br> \r\n Today we are having another inspection by a Major General Long-Smyth or it may be just plain Smith.   I hope it is any rate as he will be more likely to put in a good word for us.</p> \r\n <p>[The following is a note added at the bottom of the diary entries for the 26 and 28 April]<br> \r\n A drunken soldier was travelling in the train from Cairo the other day and opposite him sat an Army Chaplain.   The soldier wished to start an argument so he said \"I don't there is a Heaven\"   The parson reading the \"Egyptian mail\" took no notice so the soldier repeated his remark.   Still no notice.   The soldier snatches paper away from Parson and repeats his question \"Well\" says the Parson \"go to Hell and be quick.\"</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301036\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 36]<br> \r\n April 29<br> \r\n We are going to try some practical work today with the guns and on Tuesday we will have some proper target practice.   Our ranging turned out fairly well but the signallers couldn't get our messages through.   The 14th Brigade had some target practice today but the shooting was abominable   I hope we can do better at any rate.   We will probably be leaving this Camp next Friday another stage towards France.   We will get there eventually.</p> \r\n <p>April 30<br> \r\n Just got official news through that General Townsend with 2000 Tommies and 6000 Indians have been captured by the Turks in Messopotamia ? another instance of British cocksureness and optimism.  Never enough men.  It was the same in S.A. and on Gallipoli.   Write to Mollie Messenger.   The 49rth Batty starts their shooting tomorrow and ours on Tuesday.</p> \r\n <p>May 1<br> \r\n We have been watching the shooting practice by the 49th Batty all the morning and it was jolly good shooting too.  We were also watching some bomb throwing by the Infantry.   The 50th Battery is shooting this afternoon.  We must try and beat them as we are the only two Batteries doing indirect laying.   The 49th and 52nd are doing direct laying.   Major-General Christian is in charge of our Division and is taking notes in connection with the shooting</p> \r\n <p>May 2<br> \r\n We have finished our firing and as far as I can judge we have come out best.   I haven't heard anything more about us moving this week although a few days ago our O.C. Mr. Prior told me himself that the latest orders were we were to move on Friday.   Am writing home today and also several other letters if I have time.  I don't think I will have much chance of advancement where I am unless several of the officers get knocked while on active service and I don't. </p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301037\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 37]<br> \r\n May 3<br> \r\n We are being paid tonight and it will come in handy as I am stony again in fact I never seem to be anything else lately.   It has been an awful day   Tons of dust seems to be flying round.   I have been doing practically nothing all day.   Took a few observations with one of our Subalterns this morning.   He doesn't know anything at all about Artillery work.</p> \r\n <p>May 4<br> \r\n Half holiday today.  Wrote long letter to Adelaide Smith in reply to one from her.<br> \r\n Also wrote Liz Williams yesterday.  The pay has been deferred until tonight    I understand I could easily get home as unfit with my deformed toes.   Lieut Cullen was out with us this morning.  He doesn't know much about Directors work.   I got very wild with him telling me I didn't know much about it and, considering it is very like a theodolite and I was instructing him I didn't like it</p> \r\n <p>May 5<br> \r\n Nothing much has happened today.   A new man named Stevens is our the Duirector with us now making 5 of us.   Gunners, Burting, Bourke, Hilder, Stevens and myself.  Went round and saw Russ and Edric tonight and we had a supper at the Canteen consisting of tin peaches and biscuits.   We will probably be having a bit of a go at the Turks again in a few days as they are only 2 days march away ? I understand summer parade hours are coming in soon.</p> \r\n <p>May 6<br> \r\n A lot of troops have been going out to the trenches this morning so evidently something is brewing.   Lt Cullen has gone out with a couple of guns.  It will keep us here a little longer worse luck.   We should have been away by now to keep to the schedule.   A few boat loads of Chinese have gone through lately to France to work as labourers in the field.   Russian troops have also gone through towards Suez.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301038\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 38]<br> \r\n May 7<br> \r\n Today has been one of the worst in my experience so far.   I suppose I felt it more being on guard.   We do 24 hours 2 hours on and 4 hours off.  It is most trying.   Finished at 1800.   Went round and saw Russ and Ross.  They had some mail a couple of days ago.   I wish I could get some myself as I need something to buck me up.   A good change away from this place will do us all the world of good.</p> \r\n <p>May 8<br> \r\n Another scorcher.   They have made the 49th Battery into a Mobile Battery, and they are moving out to the trenches tomorrow.   They are taking all our Directors, and signalling instruments &c so I don't know what we will be doing.   Have raised a fine blister on my foot.   Went round and saw Bob tonight and got some photos from him.   The nights here are glorious fortunately in fact cold.   Got word of a big advance in France yesterday by the Allies and only hope it is true.</p> \r\n <p>May 9<br> \r\n Watched a Brigade of Infanty and Battery of Artillery move off this morning towards [indecipherable].   Had 6 letters tonight and by jove I must say I was glad to get them, one from Mother Feby 27th, Pater 13th Feby, Lou 16th Feby Moll Man 5th, Mill 28th Feby and Ethel 2nd Mar.   I spent a good deal of time reading and rereading them.  It is evidently only one mail as all the dates are within a week of one another practically</p> \r\n <p>May 10<br> \r\n We got a Corporal in charge of us today from details.   Went down for a swim this afternoon with Jack Burke and saw Russ for a few minutes.   A good many were inoculated today.   Tonight I went round to the opening of the Y.M.C.A. by General McCay in charge of our Division.   They gave a very good concert, and the General stated his opinion that we would all be in France very soon.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301039\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 39]<br> \r\n May 11<br> \r\n Sent letter home enclosing 22 photos also wrote Adelaide and Mrs Pryor.   Have been swimming mostly all day.   There is great talk of us moving off but we can't get any definite news.   Went to a concert in Y.M.C.A. and heard my name being called as soon as I got into Camp.   Three of us had to go into Ismailia as escort for a prisoner.</p> \r\n <p>May 12<br> \r\n Got back from Ismailia with our prisoner at 1 a.m.   Have a bad attack of influenza today.   Saw Russ at Canal today when I was having a swim.  Both he and Edric are Corporals now, but so far are only acting.</p> \r\n <p>May 13<br> \r\n Have been fairly sick all day with the influenza.  Bill Hilder was made a Bombardier today.   I was expecting it myself as I am more competent than he in every respect but he knows more about the actual gun work as I haven't had any at all.   However I don't begrudge him his stripe as he is a fine chap in every way.   All leave has been stopped even into Ismailia.</p> \r\n <p>May 14<br> \r\n We are having a very severe heat wave just now and it is about the hottest weather I have ever experienced.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301040\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 40]<br> \r\n May 15<br> \r\n We are having more shooting today.  40 rounds each Battery.   The Director men were supplied with a horse each.   The first time I have been on one since leaving Australia.   We put in some excellent shooting with indirect laying even better than our direct shooting, a few days ago   The weather is still fearfully hot.   One simply swelters during the daytime in tents.</p> \r\n <p>May 16<br> \r\n We have reveille at 4 a.m. now   Breakfast 4.30 Fall in 5 till 8.30 and then we are off until 5 p.m. but unfortunately one can't sleep during the day.   The flies and sand are simply awful.  I haven't taken any photos for ages.   The light here is splendid for photography too but no subjects</p> \r\n <p>May 17<br> \r\n The Howitzer Brigade have to be embarked by the 24th so I don't suppose we shall be long after.   11/6/16    What misleading rumours one gets.   According to the above the Howitzer Brigade should have been in France.   They are now to be embarked by the 15th so I will probably have another note to add later on.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301041\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 41]<br> \r\n May 19<br> \r\n Talking about \"stars and stripes\" an Irish friend of mine once said \"When a man is no good as a private they give him stripes.   When he is no good as a non-com they give him a Commission\"   All the stars have fallen over here now    As for me I would prefer to see a Crown fall (the Kaiser) the sooner the quicker<br> \r\n Our daily menu par excellence.   Breakfast 4.30 am Rush like mad with about 30 other fellows at two dixies one containing tea, the other \"pig\"   By </p> \r\n <p>May 20<br> \r\n by a miracle they are never capsized and I have given up expecting that to happen.   If one is lucky enough to be among the first 20 he might get something otherwise not   If \"not\" he is very lucky if some bread and marmalade happens to exist in the \"tucker\" box otherwise it exists only in his imagination and he has his fill.   Lunch ? 3 tremendous blasts by the Orderly Sergeant at 12 30 pm   Unnecessary blasts I can assure you as we are all waiting expectantly</p> \r\n <p>May 21<br> \r\n Two courses (tea and tea) bread and marmalade as a filler up.   Dinner 6.30 pm another ungodly rush for tea and stew cap it off with the remaining remnants of bread and marmalade left over from lunch.  This has been my daily routine in regard to the food problem for 29 days and nights.   The marmalade has never been varied except in the brand and dog biscuits sometimes substituted for bread.   On rare occasions</p> \r\n <p>May 22<br> \r\n we may get a little burnt rice. <br> \r\n In regard to all privates being prohibited from the high class \"Continental\" brothel it has lately transpired that the whole establishment has been arrested as spies after getting good information out of the officers.   They discovered a small wireless plant on top   I also heard Shepherds? is in the same predicament, and some officers have also been arrested there.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301042\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 42]<br> \r\n May 23<br> \r\n We had some more shooting today, with very good results.   Had letters from Lou and Miss Montague.   Charley has rejoined his Unit in France    My black Kit bag which has been at the base in Cairo seems to have gone astray as it has been sent for and reported as missing.   I am making up another one gradually.</p> \r\n <p>May 24<br> \r\n Had letter from home enclosing photo of Mater Lou and Helen.   They look awfully well and Helen seems a fine Kiddy.   The weather is keeping passably cool and if it continues we should soon be out of it.   Another Egyptian restaurant started here this morning and I spent my last 10 piastres on a feed this afternoon.   We have been too busy lately to get down for a swim. </p> \r\n <p>May 25<br> \r\n We are leaving here for Moaskar before Sunday.   It was mentioned on parade by Mr. Prior yesterday so it is the fair dinkum oil this time.   I don't suppose it will be long before we are on the water now.   A big inspection of the Division again this afternoon by General Murray.</p> \r\n <p>May 26<br> \r\n We had another shoot this morning and tomorrow I suppose we will be packing up as we move to Moascar on Sunday pending entrainment for Alexandria.   We have to get rid of all cameras in some way.   I am trying to sell mine as I am sorely in need of cash but so far have been unsuccessful.   They don't like buying as it will probably be confiscated in France. </p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301043\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 43]<br> \r\n May 27<br> \r\n Lieut Cullen, [indecipherable] Hilder, Gunners Burke, Gorman and myself went to Moascar today on horseback to mark out our new camp.   A Tommy Artillery Brigade was camped there and we arranged to exchange Camps which saved us making a Camp out.   We had a very enjoyable ride anyhow and had tea at the Ladies Canteen going back.</p> \r\n <p>May 28<br> \r\n Today the Brigade moved off to Moascar    The Spooks were left behind as rear guard and we had a pretty hard day of it.   Had some tea again at Ladies Canteen.   We are having another inspection on Thursday and will probably entrain next day.  I understand we have to be embarked by the 6th June.   Went for a swim after tea and Y.M.C.A. after</p> \r\n <p>May 29<br> \r\n We are going to do nothing but clean everything up preparatory to embarking   We were issued with our saddle equipment today and I was all day cleaning mine up and greasing.  Went for a swim after tea and spent a very pleasant hour in Y.M.C.A. after.   There are not many troops camped here but it is gradually filling up.   Sent letter home today.</p> \r\n <p>May 30<br> \r\n Cleaning harness still.   We have been offered a prize of 1&#163;  for the best turned out saddle so I am having a try for it.   However I don't stand much chance as my saddle is a very old one    We had an awfully good concert tonight in Y.M.C.A. given by New Zealand Hospital Glee Party.   Some wonderfully good artists among them.   This Camp has improved a good deal since our last camp here.   Plenty of water and much better tucker.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301044\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 44]<br> \r\n May 31<br> \r\n I am just suffering the torture of my last days in Egypt.   I am absolutely fed up with it and its dirty niggers   As full as the lamb that said \"I am so full I cannot pull another blade of grass Bah!  Bah!\"    We must really be leaving for France soon as witness the fact that after fully equipping us a few days ago they have now called in everything except that in which we stand meaning clothing of course    Our next issue I understand will be \"somewhere in France\" probably \"Ypres\" which means \"I look forward to\"   It is also stated as an excuse that on a/c of the large number of enemy vermin and such like crawling things contracted during transportation it is necessary that we should travel as lightly as possible.   Military again!   They issue an awful lot of unnecessary stuff for a place like Egypt and travel as lightly as possible to a cold place like France thereby making us the unwilling victim of frost</p> \r\n <p>June 1<br> \r\n bite and others!   By the way they have contrived some sort of arrangement like the following for the others.   One comes up to a long barn-like building containing fumigators, disrobes, walks naturally (after being told to pass on) down a sort of corridor I presume to the other end of the building dresses himself in new second-hand clothes fumigated for the chap before him and comes out smiling doubtfully (the next fellow gets mine)   He gives a few twitches to his</p> \r\n <p>June 2<br> \r\n neck not being sure you Know! but eventually comes to the conclusion that it is alright and thereby gains confidence and goes home in a brisk soldier like manner.  This performance takes place about once a week.   That's the way you get your new equipment in France.   Everything is done on a system in the military except promotions   These have been made indirectly by America having her \"stars and stripes\" torn up -   Had our final inspection <strike>today</strike> yesterday.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301045\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 45]<br> \r\n June 3<br> \r\n Wrote Lou and Will Thomas, today.   This morning we went out again for a route march and Battery manoeuvres with borrowed guns.   Found out where Bruce and Clive Elliott are and went across and saw them.   Clive is in the 14th and Bruce 15th Engineers   There is a rumour that we move off tomorrow and also that we are going to be formed into a Howitzer Battery.    Went over to 15th Fld. Amb for mail but nothing doing.   They forwarded me</p> \r\n <p>June 4<br> \r\n two parcels a couple of days ago which haven't yet reached me.   I am taking the Elliotts round to see Russ and Edric tonight. <br> \r\n Sunday ? Sent letter Home and PCs to Miss Montague and Ada Jones.   Church parade this morning.   Sang \"For those in perils on the Sea\" and also prayed for them which looks as though we go soon.   Another Khamseen blew up again this afternoon.   Going for a swim after tea.</p> \r\n <p>June 5<br> \r\n Very little doing today.   An awfully trying day, with plenty of sand   Got news of the North Sea Battle mostly in favour of Germans.  Went round and saw Edric for a few minutes tonight as we are supposed to be leaving tomorrow.   The 8th Brigade Infantry which we cover has all its stuff on the train ready for moving</p> \r\n <p>June 6<br> \r\n Our moving has been postponed again.   They called in our blankets this morning and had to give them out again.   The 8th Brigade had to unload all their stuff.   I think they must fear that German boats have got out.   We were paid today, fortunately and are not supposed to be leaving now until the 15th   We are all greatly disgusted naturally.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301046\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 46]<br> \r\n June 7<br> \r\n The Canteens were all raided again last night and are consequently now [indecipherable] again today.   On gun drill this morning and buzzer this afternoon.   Have put in for leave into Ismailia tonight.   Wandered round Ismailia for a couple of hours had some tea and cake at Empire Club and had a look through the native bazaar but didn't stay long as I was on my own and it isn't particularly safe</p> \r\n <p>June 8<br> \r\n All the Staff have to learn buzzer work thoroughly now so we are going to do nothing else at present.   Went into Ismailia again today on yesterdays pass with Jack Burke.   Had tea at Empire Club and wandered round town for a bit.   Went to pictures at night.   Russ and Edric were round to see me but I missed them.   There is also a letter for me at 15th Fld Amb.</p> \r\n <p>June 9<br> \r\n Kitchener's death has been a great shock to us all.  On Tuesday we are holding Divisional Sports it being a Holiday.   We held some preliminary ones this afternoon to pick out the most promising.   I saw Russ &amp; Edric tonight and also Bruce.   We are all going into Ismailia together on Sunday.   We are holding classes in the buzzer   I have advanced one class every day so far that is I am now in the 3rd class or 8 words a minute</p> \r\n <p>June 10<br> \r\n Held our usual \"buzzer\" class this morning.   Can just get 8 words a minute comfortably.   Another severe knock for the officers    A Russian cruiser picked up a wireless message which was later on discovered to come from Shepherds? Hotel as a small wireless plant has been discovered there.   The message gave information as to the personnel and whereabouts of the 4th Australian Division and its intended movements.   The men have been accused of letting out information</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301047\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 47]<br> \r\n June 11<br> \r\n and it appears now that it really comes from officers as men are not allowed in Shepherds. Went to usual Church parade again this morning.  Wrote letter home and saw Russ and Bruce.   Studied French all afternoon.   Bob Prior was round for a while this evening.   Lt. Prior is now Capt.     He is altogether too young in my opinion only 22 and not particularly smart either.   Sports on Tuesday.</p> \r\n <p>June 12<br> \r\n Had our usual buzzer parades from 6.30 to 10.30 am and 4 pm-6 pm.   Mr Prior announced that we have marching orders for Wednesday.   I wonder.    The Austrians are making wonderful progress on their fronts lately.    Packed my saddle away this afternoon preparatory to moving off.   Went for a swim to-night.    We have beautiful moonlight nights and it is perfect in the water</p> \r\n <p>June 13<br> \r\n Fearful day.   Dust and sand blowing about   We had a V.D. inspection today and are going to a Memorial Service for Earl Kitchener at 5.30 pm.    We handed our spare blankets and helmets in this morning.   The Sports have been postponed until tomorrow morning.    Am still learning French assiduously.</p> \r\n <p>June 14<br> \r\n Sergeant McMullen told me today that I was very foolish to join the Staff and should have been on the gun instead as I would have had a much better chance.  Saw Russ and Edric and also Bruce Elliott tonight and said good-bye to them</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301048\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 48]<br> \r\n June 15<br> \r\n Had an awfully busy day.   Packed up this morning also had a Kit inspection and an address by General Christian on our conduct in France.   Packing up most of the day but managed to get down for my last swim in Lake Timsah during the afternoon.   We leave at 11.50 tonight    Some of them have gone already   We left Camp about 10.30 and left Moasca about 11.30 p.m. </p> \r\n <p>June 16<br> \r\n Had a very uncomfortable and crowded trip in a cattle tuck.   Reached Alexandria about 8 a.m. and embarked almost immediately on \"Tunision\"   About 2800 troops on board very crowded so I'm afraid our trip won't be too pleasant.   Had a cup of tea and some iced coffee and cake at Y.W.C.A. on wharf.   We drew away from the wharf and anchored out in the Bay for the night   Very crowded on board but good food.   Very hard to get sleeping positions.</p> \r\n <p>June 17<br> \r\n Got under way about 8.30 a.m.   Scout cruiser of \"Arathusa\" class escorting us.   The escort is changed every few hours.   There are no baths unfortunately but plenty of washing dishes.  I played \"eucre\" most of the morning.   We also fell in for \"assembly\"   We had a medical inspection for measles this afternoon and have also been allotted boats in case of accident.   The \"Hororata\" and Rhesus are now in sight behind us.   We get any amount of bread and butter and jam.   Beautiful bread </p> \r\n <p>June 18<br> \r\n We held a Church parade this morning    Our old parson is rather monotonous and always has the same sermon and hymns it seems to me.   We have passed a good many boats during the day a good many of them being war boats.   We passed between two Islands about midday which is supposed to be a bad place of submarines as I understand several boats have been sunk in the same locality.   I wish I knew the names of the Islands for future reference.  I believe we are making for Malta.    Crete Island we passed.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301049\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 49]<br> \r\n June 19<br> \r\n Beautifully cool and calm today and we should be in Malta today or tomorrow.    I think I can go through without becoming sea-sick.   We only lost sight of Crete this morning.   I never imagined it was so big 45,000 inhabitants mostly Greek and Turks at present under the control of Greece formerly Turkey.   We have been passing numbers of boats and small Is.   The coast line of Greece was in sight this morning so we are not far from Salonika.   The Sunset was absolutely glorious today and the ocean like glass without a ripple.</p> \r\n <p>June 20<br> \r\n Nothing of any importance happened today.   We passed a good many boats but no land of any description    We only have one general assembly in the morning so we are enjoying a fairly good rest.  We held a very good concert on board tonight before dark.    Some very fair artists with 29th Battalion band as orchestra   We are in an awfully slow boat only averaging about 7 or 8 Knots.   A very large boat with 3 escorts passed about sundown.</p> \r\n <p>June 21<br> \r\n We passed by Malta about 2 a.m. this morning but of course we were all sleeping.   I will probably strike a guard of some sort tonight.   Passed Pentigos Is. off Sicily about 9 a.m. and also about half a dozen trawlers doing patrol work and several large vessels.   The band plays every morning on the officers deck to break the monotony.   The weather has become considerably cooler today in fact a little chilly.   We expect to reach Marseilles on Friday night or Saturday morning.</p> \r\n <p>June 22<br> \r\n I mounted main ship's guard last night at 6 p.m. and go on until 6 tonight.   It is the first time I have used a rifle on duty with 50 rounds of ammunition on my bandolier.   We are only about a day's sail from Marseilles now.   I thought we would see the coast of Sardinia but must have passed it during the night.   We passed another Island this afternoon which I fancy must have been Corsica.   I believe we are to go through Paris on our way as it was read out that it must be understood by all ranks that no leave will be granted there.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301050\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 50]<br> \r\n June 23<br> \r\n Arrived in Marseilles about 7 a.m. this morning.   It looks awfully pretty from the Harbour and I bought a set of PC's from a boy who came on board.   You can only see a small portion of the City from the Harbour as it is very hilly.   We disembarked at 4 p.m. and marched through the worst quarter of the City for about 1 \u00bd miles to the filthiest camp I have ever been in   The earth consists of burnt coal dust from factories which we have to sleep in and one can imaging the state we are in.   I have been put on lime piquet again tonight.   No leave being granted</p> \r\n <p>June 24<br> \r\n Had a fairly busy morning loading train.   Got away about midday in 2nd Class cars very comfortable.  We are pulled up now at Orange having lunch about 4 p.m.   The people are awfully nice to us.   We have passed through some awfully pretty country the garden of France   Avignon especially was a beautiful old town.   We have also passed through L?estaque, Miramas and Arles.    We have been travelling along the Rhone for a long time and the coastal scenery for a time from Marseilles was glorious.   Notre Dame shewed out well when we were leaving    See Jany 31st.</p> \r\n <p>June 25<br> \r\n We passed through Lyon last night and stayed about an hour but it was too dark to see anything.    We pulled up at a small siding about 6 am for breakfast   Passed through Chalon.   The country is still glorious but much flatter now.   We passed through a very pretty place named Beaumiere and also a village appropriately named Fleurville.   We are now at Dijon very fine town judging from our limited view of it.   The scenery after leaving Dijon   see Jany 31st &amp; 4 Feby 1st </p> \r\n <p>June 26 <br> \r\n We passed through Paris early this morning but of course couldn't see anything of it.   Now at Vernon    Had the slowest trip to Havre I have ever experienced landing here about 4 pm.   We have unloaded onto a wharf so it looks as though we are embarking for England.    We are just going to have something to eat as we have had nothing since last night.   About 9.30 p.m. we marched about 4 miles into the outskirts of Havre    The Camp is all slush and mud and we are all wet through.   We don't get our blankets until 1 a.m.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301051\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 51]<br> \r\n June 27<br> \r\n Very good war news this morning victories on all fronts.   We are leaving for the front in a few days.   This is called Sandwick Camp and is supposed to be a rest Camp   It is rotten being stuck here without money    I could have had leave into Havre tonight but hadn't a penny.   We have very good Y.M.C.A. and Canteens here.  It is a jolly shame to think we have been a fortnight without a change of clothing of any sort.</p> \r\n <p>June 28<br> \r\n Nothing much happened today   Had some tea and cake &c at Y.M.C.A. and we were all very surprised to get paid tonight 65 francs each at 28 fr to 1&#163;.   I was put on guard on Brigade stores tonight.</p> \r\n <p>June 29<br> \r\n I had leave into Havre this morning and had a very pleasant time.  It is a fine old city.   Bought one or two souvenirs.   At night I was put on town picquet in Saint Addresse a suburb, but our beat only consisted of one street near what they call the German Castle   Some kind French lady presented us with cigars and cigarettes and beer.   We were issued with another set of underclothing today.</p> \r\n <p>June 30</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301052\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 52]<br> \r\n July 1<br> \r\n We have been very busy again today packing up ready to move off again tonight.  I got my permanent horse this morning.   Not a bad mount by any means.   We have been equipped with everything new.   We loaded our Battery on to the train 7 minutes under record time and left Harve about 6.30 pm    We were all very sorry to lose Mr Wilson from the Battery.   He was the only one who attended to our comfort.   He has been sent into the trench mortar</p> \r\n <p>July 2<br> \r\n I was unlucky enough to get into the only 3rd class carriage on the train the others being 1st and 2nd.    Very stiff this morning    Passed through Rouen last night and Calais and St. Omer this morning.   Got to our destination at Steenling about 5 p.m. and went on with our guns about 5 miles to a place near Bleninghem.   We got billeted in subsections in farmhouses.   I am in a loft in a stable and slept very comfortably on straw.</p> \r\n <p>July 3<br> \r\n We are only about 12 miles behind the firing line here and are going into action any day now.   We could see a couple of aeroplanes over our lines this afternoon being shelled but nothing resulted    We have most of our time cut out attending the horses.   Mine has ringworms and greasy heals.  Every farm house seems to be a tavern in this country.   Plenty of wine &amp; beer</p> \r\n <p>July 4<br> \r\n There is a tremendous lot of dissatisfaction in the Battery and quite a number are getting transfers into a trench mortar battery.   We are to move off tomorrow into the firing line to relieve the 2nd Division .    on buzzer work this morning.   The left Section is playing the Right Section football today.   I am suffering a good deal from piles lately bleeding internally</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301053\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 53]<br> \r\n July 5<br> \r\n We are having a fairly busy time with our horses just now.   A good many are on the sick list including mine with ringworms.   Had a stray letter today from Ada Jones and wrote P.Cs. home and to Ada and Moll.   Went down into Blesingham Village tonight and bought some pork chops and had them fried with eggs by the woman in our billet and had it with champagne.</p> \r\n <p>July 6<br> \r\n Champagne is sold here at about 4/6 per large bottle.   We were issued with gas helmets this morning and some of the Battery were gased to see how they worked.    They also used some tear bombs.   The mail closes at 9 a.m. tomorrow so I must try and drop a line or two home.   Our boys are behaving wonderfully well over here.   One French woman informed me that we are too quiet, much quieter than the French and English whom they don't seem to like much, the latter I mean</p> \r\n <p>July 7<br> \r\n Nothing much doing today.   We are not allowed outside our billeting areas, so can't see much of the country.   Colonel Caddy addressed us today in regard to going into action.   We are taking over from the 5th Brigade and so long as our position is not located by the enemy we will have a picnic.    All work will be done at night and sleep in day time.</p> \r\n <p>July 8<br> \r\n Had tea tonight with Corporal Bosall, Bill Hilder and Jack Burk at a farmhouse.   Beautiful omelette containing 16 eggs.   Went into Blaringhem after tea with Bill Hilder for tobacco but could only get cigars at Peach but very good.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301054\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 54]<br> \r\n July 9<br> \r\n Had a church parade today out in a very pretty paddock among the trees.   One expression the parson used struck me as being worth recording  \"Lord if I forget thee, do not then forget me.    28 of us have orders to proceed to the firing line tomorrow at a moments notice.  Had tea again at our farmhouse of last night.   We are taking over from the 4th Division</p> \r\n <p>July 10<br> \r\n Got away from our Camp about 6 p.m. in motor omnibuses.   Passed through Haverskenm and Merville and got out at a place called Enquinghem and walked about 3 miles to Bois Grenier about 3 miles from Armentieres.    We have a splendid billet here in a farm house which for some reason hasn't been shelled for 18 months, and all other farm houses round about have.   There will be no range finding to do here as everything is done by accurate maps</p> \r\n <p>July 11A few shots came over this morning pieces of shell &c. but this place is nothing to Anzac in fact we are going to have a regular picnic.  They guns are very well concealed and well covered with earth reinforced concrete bricks and stone, sand? bags and more earth on top with grass growing on top.   I am on telephone duty for the time being, telephone attendant, linesman or anything that comes along.</p> \r\n <p>July 12<br> \r\n Had a very fatiguing day.    We took over finally from 48th Battery on duty telephones from 3 to 6 a.m.   After breakfast Bob and I went round some of our communications and up in the firing line 29th Batt.    This is called the Nursery.   We were shelled very heavily today and several batteries round us had to move.   They got very close to our guns.   The rest of our boys came along tonight and the left section moved round to their position near Armentieres.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301055\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 55]<br> \r\n July 13I am now at O.P. on telephone duties permanently.   There are only Bdr Hilder and Gunners Carr Wheeler, Burling and myself here.  We have an OK position in a fine old house.   Beds, tables chairs fireplaces &c and living in great style.  It is a young fortress but we are likely to get shelled out any day with coal boxes and whiz bangs.   It has been awfully quiet today   Hardly a shot fired</p> \r\n <p>July 14<br> \r\n We were up most of the night firing   There was an awful din all night.   This morning I walked about 3 \u00bd  m. into Enquinghem to get ourselves some supplies as we cook our own food.   No sleep again tonight as we have to stand to again   Had letter from home. Sunday ? This is a much hotter part of the front and we expect something big tonight so no more sleep.</p> \r\n <p>July 15<br> \r\n We have to move out again tonight to a new position.   We are very sorry to lose this Camp as it is so comfortable.   Had letter from home today and also wrote home.   A tremendous bombardment going on tonight on our right and that is where we are going.   This is the third night I have had without sleep and poor food.   I am beginning to feel the strain and my belt has shortened.</p> \r\n <p>July 16<br> \r\n We got away about midnight and landed in our camp about 7 a.m.   We have no cover whatever as it is only a temporary camp.  We are shooting away barb wire entanglements for our boys to charge tonight.   We have 77 guns on 1000 yds front   They shelled us badly this afternoon very close to us but so far no damage.  It is raining now and very uncomfortable.  No sleep for days.   We are near Fleurbaix.   Had another letter from home.   Our boys suffered a number of casualties last night.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301056\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 56]<br> \r\n July 17<br> \r\n Things have been very quiet today   The Germans haven't been shelling at all.   We did a fair amount and unfortunately killed a few of our own infantrymen with one of our shots.   I saw Bob Prior today.   He is only about 100yards away from me in another billet.   Should have a good sleep tonight as Billy Hilder and I have found an old barn.</p> \r\n <p>July 18<br> \r\n Very quiet again today.   We have shot away several thousand rounds of ammunition cutting barb-wire. Wednesday ? Gunner [indecipherable] wounded    It was pure luck that I was away as our telephone room was blown in.   Our Batty staff is now reduced from 16 to 7 as another man is suffering from shock.   We kept up a tremendous bombardment all day and the 8th Brig charged at night and took 3 trenches but had to retire again to the German first line.</p> \r\n <p>July 19<br> \r\n I am really writing this on Thursday as I hadn't any time to do so yesterday.  It was the most trying day of my life.  In the morning Cpl Bosell, Jack Burk and myself went up into the first line trenches and struck a perfect hell.  We got back about 1 p.m. and found our Battery had been badly shelled 7 killed and 2 wounded.   8 of them were the Bty Staff.   Gunners Carr, Le Brock, Wheeler Green, Stevens &amp; Builing and Everett killed and </p> \r\n <p>July 20<br> \r\n The boys have been driven back again to their original positions again.   We are kept very busy as we are so short handed.   All our guns are out of action so we can't shoot.    They haven't been hit at all but have been used too much and worn out.  Had the unpleasant experience of carrying some of the bodies away to the Cemetery   Poor Builing and Stevens were collected and never even made one man.  I carried poor Dennie Le Brock.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301057\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 57]<br> \r\n July 21<br> \r\n We will probably be moving away again tonight.   Our boys were terribly cut up in the last charge and hundreds of dead and wounded are lying between the trenches but are being collected today.  I will be glad to leave as the place holds nasty associations.   The Germans flooded our boys out of the trenches as soon as they took them and had no ammunition in any case.   We got away from Camp about dark and came on to Gris Pot     Posted letter home and to Moll.</p> \r\n <p>July 22<br> \r\n I am on duty today at the Headquarters of the Battalion whom we are to support.   Wye Farm it is called about 2 miles from the Battery.   We haven't fired a shot here so far and are moving back again to our last position tomorrow.   They won't allow us to get settled in one place more than a day or so and consequently we can't make ourselves comfortable and our rations are messed about   Bombardier Prior left us today for H.Qs. and has been relieved by Bombardier Connors</p> \r\n <p>July 23<br> \r\n Have been on duty on telephone all day at Wye Farm and expect to be on until we move off sometime tonight.   The Tommies left any amount of tucker behind them.   They are much better catered for than we are I don't know why.   Our troops are awfully badly fed and clothed.   The 56th Battalion are stationed here at present   We got away from Wye Farm about 9 p.m. and went round to the Battery and we all came round into Camp near Fleurbaix again.</p> \r\n <p>July 24<br> \r\n This morning Capt Prior sent 24 Gunners and 3 spooks back to the Horse lines for a weeks spell.  I was one of the Spooks.   We have nothing to do at all so we will have a good rest and plenty of tucker.   It will give me plenty of time to write letters anyhow.   I have had two from Dorrie lately and wrote to, Tom.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301058\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 58]<br> \r\n July 25<br> \r\n We are about 3 miles behind the firing line here and are comparatively safe except from an occasional shell.   I have been reading all day \"A Soldier of the Legion\" by CN Williamson and it is very good altho I have read it before.   There are one or two very fine girls here in this billet, but we have to be very careful with them as all these persons are suspected spies.   It is a noticeable fact that some billets are shelled and other not</p> \r\n <p>July 26<br> \r\n We were called out of bed late last night and had to report back to the Battery and this morning we had to go up to the first line on duty at F.O.   We had an easy day as we didn't fire.   Another Battery killed another of our own men in the trenches.  This unfortunately is a very common occurrence and might easily be avoided   Later on the O.C. of this particular Battery was wounded and I wasn't a bit sorry for him.</p> \r\n <p>July 27<br> \r\n We have two new reinforcements for our reduced staff.   Got back from F.O. about 9 a.m.   Nothing doing today.   On duty on telephone from 3 to 7 p.m.   Hardly a day goes bye without a gas alarm but nothing ever seems to come of it.   There is to be another stunt of some time tomorrow and I understand we are moving camp again.   They seem to like keeping us on the move   General Christian was round today.</p> \r\n <p>July 28<br> \r\n Lieutenant Cullen has proved an absolute failure and been sent back to waggon lines.   Lieut Gatcliffe has also applied for a week's leave which is pretty rotten considering he only left Sydney this year and only 10 days in action.   The week in trenches and week out published in papers is all a myth when one gets here, except that they put them in for a few days in one place and then move them to another.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301059\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 59]<br> \r\n July 29 Am up at forward observation post again today but had a very quiet day.    40&#163; and a month's furlough are offered for a German sniper dead or alive who is operating on our side of the trenches.    40&#163; is also offered any man who can capture a live German star shell.   They are much superior to ours and fired by compressed air.</p> \r\n <p>July 30<br> \r\n Got back this morning about 9 a.m. and found cablegram in regard to money waiting for me.   I was on duty tonight and managed to write some letters.   I understand we are in our winter quarters here now.   The position might be better and might be worse.  I daresay we will settle down comfortably though.   Our aeroplanes are very active here always one or two up.</p> \r\n <p>July 31<br> \r\n On Saturday the 29th the Germans blew down a large Church in Fleurbaix about a mile from here.   They had been after it for a long time but didn't seem able to get the range.   We fired about 40 shells into a German anti-aircraft battery this afternoon and forced them to move their position.   Posted letters home, Mrs Fountain Arthur Preston, Charley Montague and Dorrie. The Germans use some most peculiar shells sometimes, especially delayed action shell designed to penetrate dugouts or gun pits before exploding.   They caught quite a number of our coves at first as they would think they were duds and rush over to dig them out and get caught in the explosion.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301060\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 60]<br> \r\n August 1 <br> \r\n Just heard tonight that Bruce Elliott was simply blown to pieces during the last attack   I must try and look Clive up as they were very much attached to one another    Romania has declared war on Turkey and Russians have again taken Lemberg.   Our boys have also taken observations Hill on the Somme one of the most important positions on the whole front and the Tommies have tried for months in vain to take it.</p> \r\n <p>August 2<br> \r\n Posted long letter home.   Going into Fleurbaix this afternoon.    Jack Burke and I spent a very pleasant afternoon in town.   Had a good meal of eggs and chips.   I never saw such beautiful eggs as one gets here, much larger generally than any one sees in Australia.    Fleurbaix must have been a fine little town at one time and I can't understand why civilians remain the place as it is shelled severely every day.</p> \r\n <p>August 3I was on duty at 30th Batt H.Q. today at F.O.O.    So far the 8th Brigade has been disappointing.   Fritz has them bluffed.   They don't like us shooting at all as Fritz retaliates, but the moral effect of his shells is much greater than the actual damage he does.   They asked today for a certain number of men to volunteer for a raid in 3 weeks time but couldn't get them.   However I don't believe in this volunteer business at all as all the best men volunteer and the other don't.</p> \r\n <p>August 4Got back about 10 a.m. from F.O.O.   The boys managed to get some eggs for us for breakfast.   Slept all day as I never had a wink all night as I was on duty from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. and have to go on again tonight.   This continual night work plays on one so we will welcome reinforcements.   The last few days we have been preparing our winter's quarters about \u00bc mile down the road and will have everything ready before moving in this time</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301061\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 61]<br> \r\n August 5<br> \r\n Did nothing much today    Wrote home and to Iris.    On duty again tonight.   They are plenty of broad and French beans coming along fine in the fields now and I noticed some of the boys with some today.   The 8th Brigade Infantry to whom we are attached so far have proved a lamentable failure.   This is the Brigade claimed to be the best that has ever left Australia.</p> \r\n <p>August 6Had a cruise round on bicycle today looking for 15th Fld. Amb. but all the boys were away ? I also had a look for Bob Prior and Clive Elliott but they were both away.   There is some rumour of us going down to the Somme shortly.   Business is fairly warm in that quarter I understand.</p> \r\n <p>August 7<br> \r\n One or two aeroplanes have been brought down on either side lately, about two on either side I fancy.   It's a wonder we don't lose more as about 10 of our planes go over the German lines every day and German planes are seldom seen over our lines.   Acknowledged letter from Commonwealth Bank London in regard to money</p> \r\n <p>August 8<br> \r\n I was up at 7.oo again today but had a very easy day of it.   I have let the diary run down the last few days as it has been so quiet and nothing to mention.   Our boys did some good work lately in Egypt and also on the Somme.   I always seem to be in some part where nothing is doing but I suppose we shall all have a turn later    Got 3 champions today</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301062\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 62]<br> \r\n August 9  <br> \r\n The Guns have moved down again to another position about 300 yards down the road but we are remaining here until a strong position is built for us before we go down.   Had a good sleep tonight as I wasn't on duty.   Norm Tayt and I collected some fine stewing plums today which the Cook is stewing for us and they were beautiful.</p> \r\n <p>August 10<br> \r\n The boys at F.O.O. today had a lively time today.   We made a considerable bombardment and as usual Fritz retaliated and shells fell all round them. Bill Hilder and I were up in an O.P. near the front line and bits of stuff from 5.9 in shells fell all round us but did no damage   Gorizia has at last been taken by the Italians after a very long uphill struggle.</p> \r\n <p>August 11<br> \r\n I understand King George is going to make a statement in the course of a few days that will \"delight the Australians and surprise the whole world\".   I wonder what it is     Lloyd George has been advocating the withdrawal of all Australiana troops on the grounds that we are losing too many fine men for a young country and he is not far wrong.   I don't think we can make</p> \r\n <p>August 12<br> \r\n up more than one division out of the four that came over here originally   <br> \r\n Wrote to Lou, Iris, and Uncle Jim today and also F.S. card to Lorna.   It's a hard job even to keep these small sheets of diary filled up here.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a6301063\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 63]<br> \r\n August 13<br> \r\n I was on F.O.O. again today and had a very quiet day.  I picked and took a sack of pears up to the infantry headquarter's men as they always treat us well when we go up.   Sergeant Kennedy was hit by a machine gun bullet tonight at the Battery 3 inches from the spine so he was fairly lucky in some respects.    Mail in today but none \"pour moi\".</p> \r\n <p>August 14<br> \r\n I was down at waggon lines today and some of them reported having seen King George.   Had a good feed of steak and fried onions there for dinner.   We are going to try and send 3 at a time down for a week's holiday.   Called in at Engineers coming home to see Clive Elliott but he has been wounded by a bomb in the legs.   Came back through Fleurbaix and had fried eggs and chipped potatoes   On duty tonight so wrote home, and to Ada Jones from whom I had a pair of sox</p> \r\n <p>August 15<br> \r\n Evidently our objective on this Sector when we advance will be Lille.   At present I suppose we are about 5 miles from there and a fairly good ridge to cross in between which in my opinion will take some taking    We are able to get papers delivered here every day published only the day before so we are just as well off as you all at home.</p> \r\n <p>August 16<br>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p>[Page 30]<br><br />\n April 5 <br><br />\n Bob and I went into Ismailia today and had a good dinner at Hotel des Voyageurs   We had to tell the guard that we were going in for medical stores to get through.   We had a very acceptable swim in the public baths in the afternoon and afternoon tea at some Church Canteen run by English ladies.  It was a treat to talk to an English women again. Had to be back by 7 p.m. to dress Major Caddy's arm.</p>\n<p>April 6<br><br />\n Very busy sick parade this morning   Went for a swim in Lake Timsah this afternoon.   All the New Zealanders are moving off to France from here lately only a few left.  The few left their mark by burning all canteens to the ground tonight   It started by the proprietor of a wet canteen doubling the price of his beer.  He thought he could ask anything as they were leaving, but they had swift retaliation drinking all the beer first and then burning the Canteen.   Of course all other canteens</p>\n<p>April 7<br><br />\n had to go once they were started.   I dare say a good many Australians were mixed up in it too.  Nearly all these occurrences take place under some provocation.   The N.Z's left their Camps in filthy condition.   I must say all Australian lines are left scrupulously clean when leaving and our sanitary arrangements are always perfect.   I have an A.M.C. Cpl to take my place if I can arrange to get into a battery.    More canteens are being burnt tonight.</p>\n<p>April 8<br><br />\n I saw Major Cuddy today about getting into a Battery and he promised to let me in as a gunner if the A.D.M.S. will approve.  Today a man came on sick parade complaining of pains in the back, and got pack drill.   At lunch time he reported to me that he had done pack drill all the morning and had to do so again this afternoon - He was running a slight temp so I informed the Dr. and got a note exempting him.   I gave it into his orderly room and his Lieut. told me that he had only done this pack drill in the morn &amp; and wasn't going to do any more in the afternoon after my running round for him for an hour</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301031\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 31]<br><br />\n April 9<br><br />\n Bob Prior Wynne Arthur and myself are spending today in Ismailia.   Lunched at Hotel des Voyageurs after enjoying a very pleasant swim in the public baths.  We are sitting in the gardens at present and intend going for afternoon tea at the canteen run by English ladies which is the only place I have struck in Egypt where one can obtain home made cakes.    About 6 we intend visiting the cinema for about an hour and then dinner   The gardens here are simply [indecipherable] especially as they are made right on desert ground.</p>\n<p>April 10<br><br />\n Reveille at 5 a.m. this morning and we started packing up in preparation to moving off to Ferry's Post.  We had to pass through Ismailia on the way so I had some tea and cake at the Canteen run by N.Z. ladies.   We had our camp going fairly well by night.   I had to bustle round to make my arrangements for taking my sick parade.   The 14th Fld. Amb turned me down but Capt. Marshall has arranged to take it</p>\n<p>April 11<br><br />\n Had a very large sick parade this morning ? Poor old Crop. and Marshall are having tremendous rows and Crop has applied to go back to the Ambulance as a stretcher bearer.   I have my application ready to put in to go as a gunner and will be well pleased if it comes through.   Capt. Marshall asked me to go with him but I refused it.   My M.O. is expected any day now.</p>\n<p>April 12<br><br />\n My smallest sick parade this morning since being here, only 26.   Late this afternoon a tremendous dust storm blew up and lasted most of the night   The sand and grit were something awful.   I thought I had seen some storms in Australia but they were nothing to this one.   I had to be down for a while in the desert while it was blowing</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301032\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 32]<br><br />\n April 13<br><br />\n Inoculation report made out, to send to A.D.M.C.   The storm has continued today.   They say one becomes used to it in a week   It is supposed to last a fortnight so the second week should be fairly pleasant.   The natives call it by the name of Khamaeen.  I put my blankets outside this morning but I had to dig them out tonight.  I hear an old N.Z. lady (who is in charge of the Empire Club Canteen I mentioned run under the instigation of Lady Maxwell)</p>\n<p>April 14<br><br />\n expressing very strong views a few days ago.   She said it was a criminal shame in the first place to bring our boys to Egypt \"Can you wonder? she said \"at the number of chaps being sent back home in disgrace when they are longing for a sight of their own women folk and none to see except black women who throw themselves at them\"   Capt. Mapleston M.O. of the Howitzer Bdge took my sick parade today.   The storm seems to have blown away after a very heavy fall of rain</p>\n<p>April 15<br><br />\n Capt Mapleston is taking the Howitzer Bdge 13th Bdge and D.A.C. at present so Bob Jack and I are working the dispensary together   I was on duty last night.   Today the A.I.F. canteens are opening as the native's contracts have expired.  We might get our things a little cheaper now.   It has taken the Govt about 18 months to find out that we should have our own Canteens and I suppose we shall all move off as soon as they get properly going.  Had 2 letters today, one from Adelaide Smith and another from the lady who sent my Xmas [indecipherable] from S.A.</p>\n<p>April 16<br><br />\n I went round and saw Russ &amp; Edric today and went for a swim in the Canal with them.   We tried the new A.I.F. canteens and found them as dear as the natives and much harder to get near.   My transfer into the Battery has been recommended and sent on so I expect to be a gunner any day now.  I shall be very backward in regard to drill but should soon pick it up.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301033\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 33]<br><br />\n April 17<br><br />\n I was swimming and sitting on the banks of Lake Timsah alternately most of the morning.   Bob and I went over and saw the boys in the 15th Fld. Amb for a while tonight.   When I came back I got orders to report to 51st Battery tomorrow.   I was given a choice of 4 batteries and accepted this one.   all those who were on Anzac had their names taken today for bars.   Red and blue for those who were in the </p>\n<p>April 18<br><br />\n landing and plain blue for those who arrived after.    Anzac Day (25th) is a holiday and we are holding sports.  The Prince of Wales and all his entourage were round again this morning.   I reported to my Battery this afternoon and will start tomorrow.   I am in a tent with Bombardier Dunn (a friend of Bobs) a very nice chap out of C.S.R.   I am pretty nervous for a start but I daresay I will get along alright after a time.   Got 2 champions and a Sunday times a few days ago.</p>\n<p>April 19<br><br />\n Started in battery this morning.  Squad drill for 1 \u00bd hours before breakfast.   Fill in again at 8.30 and got orders to fall out with specialists.   I am on the range finding and observing staff and as far as I can see I am going to have an easy time of it.   This afternoon I got orders from the Adjutant to report back to the M.O. who arrived this morning and help him 'til another Corporal arrived.   I was very disappointed as I am very keen and every day lost makes it harder for me to make up.</p>\n<p>April 20<br><br />\n Have been trying to get a dispensary going today and also working my head to get a Corporal in quickly.   My officers are O.K. Lieut Prior in charge and Lieut Cullen (second in charge)   All the officers in this Brigade are good.   Capt Wilkinson is the new M.O. an awfully nice chap   Tomorrow is Good Friday and a holiday.  I daresay there will be another full dress parade for the Prince of Wales or some such celebrity.  It is an awful farce in my opinion.   Had a swim in the Canal this morning.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301034\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 34]<br><br />\n April 21<br><br />\n We had a whole holiday today.   Russ and I went down for a swim.  Edric couldn't get away as he was on duty.    I am in a tent with a good many R.C's, so I had a good old feed of meat for once.   I am trying to study artillery work every opportunity and if I see a chance will go into an officers school of instruction for a few weeks.   We are going to practice firing next week.  I'm afraid it will be an awful showing as very few know anything about the gun.</p>\n<p>April 22<br><br />\n I have been out with the directors all day.  I understand we have to do guards and fatigues on Sundays and holidays as they argue that we have an easy time through the week and it is only fair the others should have a spell.   Young Bunting a friend of the Daltons and also out of A.B.C. Bank, Forbes is with me on the instruments.   I don't go much on him, but it gives us a little to talk about</p>\n<p>April 23<br><br />\n I'm very lucky to have missed fatigues today as all the others got let in for something    There is a Church parade at 9 o'clock.   I went round and saw Russ &amp; Edric this afternoon.    They are coming round after tea and we are going to see if we can get something to eat at the Canteen.   A tin of pears or something.   It is too hot for chocolates and the beer is simply abominable.   I am as keen as mustard to learn this artillery work.   We will have a great day on Tuesday (Anzac Day)</p>\n<p>April 24<br><br />\n Have been out range firing again all day.  It is very interesting work and not too hard.   Two more canteens are being established quite close here which will be handy.  We had a medical inspection of our Brigade today.   Major Moseley conducted it.   We just marched by him naked.   I am just beginning to get a glimmering of the gun.   It seems disheartening at first but I suppose I will pick it up by and bye.   Church parade tomorrow.   If we have a good speaker he should be interesting.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301035\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 35]<br><br />\n April 25<br><br />\n Anzac Day ? We were presented with colours today on parade by the O.C. of the Battery Lt. Prior.   Plain blue for those who were on the Peninsula and red and blue for those at the landing.  I am mess orderly of all things.  I felt quite proud to be one of a dozen out of the whole Battery.   They are practically all \"deep thinkers\" as we call them.   I went to a splendid concert tonight given by the 8th Brigade.</p>\n<p>April 26<br><br />\n Today has been almost unbearable, and consequently nothing much of interest has occurred.   As a matter of fact it is too hot for one to do anything.   I don't know how the troops are going to stand the severe training they are having at present if this weather continues.</p>\n<p>April 27<br><br />\n Today we went to an awful lot of trouble and put in some hard work to be ready to be inspected by General Godley in charge of 2nd A. A. Corps.   He was in charge of the N Zealanders on Gallipoli.   We had to stand out in a baking sun for about an hour and a half and then he gave us about 3 minutes of his valuable time.   However we might get to France quicker if he sends in a good report.   Got two letters today from France, one each from Moll &amp; Liz.   Also box of chocolates from unknown address. </p>\n<p>April 28 <br><br />\n Today we are having another inspection by a Major General Long-Smyth or it may be just plain Smith.   I hope it is any rate as he will be more likely to put in a good word for us.</p>\n<p>[The following is a note added at the bottom of the diary entries for the 26 and 28 April]<br><br />\n A drunken soldier was travelling in the train from Cairo the other day and opposite him sat an Army Chaplain.   The soldier wished to start an argument so he said \"I don't there is a Heaven\"   The parson reading the \"Egyptian mail\" took no notice so the soldier repeated his remark.   Still no notice.   The soldier snatches paper away from Parson and repeats his question \"Well\" says the Parson \"go to Hell and be quick.\"</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301036\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 36]<br><br />\n April 29<br><br />\n We are going to try some practical work today with the guns and on Tuesday we will have some proper target practice.   Our ranging turned out fairly well but the signallers couldn't get our messages through.   The 14th Brigade had some target practice today but the shooting was abominable   I hope we can do better at any rate.   We will probably be leaving this Camp next Friday another stage towards France.   We will get there eventually.</p>\n<p>April 30<br><br />\n Just got official news through that General Townsend with 2000 Tommies and 6000 Indians have been captured by the Turks in Messopotamia ? another instance of British cocksureness and optimism.  Never enough men.  It was the same in S.A. and on Gallipoli.   Write to Mollie Messenger.   The 49rth Batty starts their shooting tomorrow and ours on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>May 1<br><br />\n We have been watching the shooting practice by the 49th Batty all the morning and it was jolly good shooting too.  We were also watching some bomb throwing by the Infantry.   The 50th Battery is shooting this afternoon.  We must try and beat them as we are the only two Batteries doing indirect laying.   The 49th and 52nd are doing direct laying.   Major-General Christian is in charge of our Division and is taking notes in connection with the shooting</p>\n<p>May 2<br><br />\n We have finished our firing and as far as I can judge we have come out best.   I haven't heard anything more about us moving this week although a few days ago our O.C. Mr. Prior told me himself that the latest orders were we were to move on Friday.   Am writing home today and also several other letters if I have time.  I don't think I will have much chance of advancement where I am unless several of the officers get knocked while on active service and I don't. </p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301037\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 37]<br><br />\n May 3<br><br />\n We are being paid tonight and it will come in handy as I am stony again in fact I never seem to be anything else lately.   It has been an awful day   Tons of dust seems to be flying round.   I have been doing practically nothing all day.   Took a few observations with one of our Subalterns this morning.   He doesn't know anything at all about Artillery work.</p>\n<p>May 4<br><br />\n Half holiday today.  Wrote long letter to Adelaide Smith in reply to one from her.<br><br />\n Also wrote Liz Williams yesterday.  The pay has been deferred until tonight    I understand I could easily get home as unfit with my deformed toes.   Lieut Cullen was out with us this morning.  He doesn't know much about Directors work.   I got very wild with him telling me I didn't know much about it and, considering it is very like a theodolite and I was instructing him I didn't like it</p>\n<p>May 5<br><br />\n Nothing much has happened today.   A new man named Stevens is our the Duirector with us now making 5 of us.   Gunners, Burting, Bourke, Hilder, Stevens and myself.  Went round and saw Russ and Edric tonight and we had a supper at the Canteen consisting of tin peaches and biscuits.   We will probably be having a bit of a go at the Turks again in a few days as they are only 2 days march away ? I understand summer parade hours are coming in soon.</p>\n<p>May 6<br><br />\n A lot of troops have been going out to the trenches this morning so evidently something is brewing.   Lt Cullen has gone out with a couple of guns.  It will keep us here a little longer worse luck.   We should have been away by now to keep to the schedule.   A few boat loads of Chinese have gone through lately to France to work as labourers in the field.   Russian troops have also gone through towards Suez.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301038\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 38]<br><br />\n May 7<br><br />\n Today has been one of the worst in my experience so far.   I suppose I felt it more being on guard.   We do 24 hours 2 hours on and 4 hours off.  It is most trying.   Finished at 1800.   Went round and saw Russ and Ross.  They had some mail a couple of days ago.   I wish I could get some myself as I need something to buck me up.   A good change away from this place will do us all the world of good.</p>\n<p>May 8<br><br />\n Another scorcher.   They have made the 49th Battery into a Mobile Battery, and they are moving out to the trenches tomorrow.   They are taking all our Directors, and signalling instruments &amp;c so I don't know what we will be doing.   Have raised a fine blister on my foot.   Went round and saw Bob tonight and got some photos from him.   The nights here are glorious fortunately in fact cold.   Got word of a big advance in France yesterday by the Allies and only hope it is true.</p>\n<p>May 9<br><br />\n Watched a Brigade of Infanty and Battery of Artillery move off this morning towards [indecipherable].   Had 6 letters tonight and by jove I must say I was glad to get them, one from Mother Feby 27th, Pater 13th Feby, Lou 16th Feby Moll Man 5th, Mill 28th Feby and Ethel 2nd Mar.   I spent a good deal of time reading and rereading them.  It is evidently only one mail as all the dates are within a week of one another practically</p>\n<p>May 10<br><br />\n We got a Corporal in charge of us today from details.   Went down for a swim this afternoon with Jack Burke and saw Russ for a few minutes.   A good many were inoculated today.   Tonight I went round to the opening of the Y.M.C.A. by General McCay in charge of our Division.   They gave a very good concert, and the General stated his opinion that we would all be in France very soon.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301039\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 39]<br><br />\n May 11<br><br />\n Sent letter home enclosing 22 photos also wrote Adelaide and Mrs Pryor.   Have been swimming mostly all day.   There is great talk of us moving off but we can't get any definite news.   Went to a concert in Y.M.C.A. and heard my name being called as soon as I got into Camp.   Three of us had to go into Ismailia as escort for a prisoner.</p>\n<p>May 12<br><br />\n Got back from Ismailia with our prisoner at 1 a.m.   Have a bad attack of influenza today.   Saw Russ at Canal today when I was having a swim.  Both he and Edric are Corporals now, but so far are only acting.</p>\n<p>May 13<br><br />\n Have been fairly sick all day with the influenza.  Bill Hilder was made a Bombardier today.   I was expecting it myself as I am more competent than he in every respect but he knows more about the actual gun work as I haven't had any at all.   However I don't begrudge him his stripe as he is a fine chap in every way.   All leave has been stopped even into Ismailia.</p>\n<p>May 14<br><br />\n We are having a very severe heat wave just now and it is about the hottest weather I have ever experienced.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301040\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 40]<br><br />\n May 15<br><br />\n We are having more shooting today.  40 rounds each Battery.   The Director men were supplied with a horse each.   The first time I have been on one since leaving Australia.   We put in some excellent shooting with indirect laying even better than our direct shooting, a few days ago   The weather is still fearfully hot.   One simply swelters during the daytime in tents.</p>\n<p>May 16<br><br />\n We have reveille at 4 a.m. now   Breakfast 4.30 Fall in 5 till 8.30 and then we are off until 5 p.m. but unfortunately one can't sleep during the day.   The flies and sand are simply awful.  I haven't taken any photos for ages.   The light here is splendid for photography too but no subjects</p>\n<p>May 17<br><br />\n The Howitzer Brigade have to be embarked by the 24th so I don't suppose we shall be long after.   11/6/16    What misleading rumours one gets.   According to the above the Howitzer Brigade should have been in France.   They are now to be embarked by the 15th so I will probably have another note to add later on.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301041\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 41]<br><br />\n May 19<br><br />\n Talking about \"stars and stripes\" an Irish friend of mine once said \"When a man is no good as a private they give him stripes.   When he is no good as a non-com they give him a Commission\"   All the stars have fallen over here now    As for me I would prefer to see a Crown fall (the Kaiser) the sooner the quicker<br><br />\n Our daily menu par excellence.   Breakfast 4.30 am Rush like mad with about 30 other fellows at two dixies one containing tea, the other \"pig\"   By </p>\n<p>May 20<br><br />\n by a miracle they are never capsized and I have given up expecting that to happen.   If one is lucky enough to be among the first 20 he might get something otherwise not   If \"not\" he is very lucky if some bread and marmalade happens to exist in the \"tucker\" box otherwise it exists only in his imagination and he has his fill.   Lunch ? 3 tremendous blasts by the Orderly Sergeant at 12 30 pm   Unnecessary blasts I can assure you as we are all waiting expectantly</p>\n<p>May 21<br><br />\n Two courses (tea and tea) bread and marmalade as a filler up.   Dinner 6.30 pm another ungodly rush for tea and stew cap it off with the remaining remnants of bread and marmalade left over from lunch.  This has been my daily routine in regard to the food problem for 29 days and nights.   The marmalade has never been varied except in the brand and dog biscuits sometimes substituted for bread.   On rare occasions</p>\n<p>May 22<br><br />\n we may get a little burnt rice. <br><br />\n In regard to all privates being prohibited from the high class \"Continental\" brothel it has lately transpired that the whole establishment has been arrested as spies after getting good information out of the officers.   They discovered a small wireless plant on top   I also heard Shepherds? is in the same predicament, and some officers have also been arrested there.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301042\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 42]<br><br />\n May 23<br><br />\n We had some more shooting today, with very good results.   Had letters from Lou and Miss Montague.   Charley has rejoined his Unit in France    My black Kit bag which has been at the base in Cairo seems to have gone astray as it has been sent for and reported as missing.   I am making up another one gradually.</p>\n<p>May 24<br><br />\n Had letter from home enclosing photo of Mater Lou and Helen.   They look awfully well and Helen seems a fine Kiddy.   The weather is keeping passably cool and if it continues we should soon be out of it.   Another Egyptian restaurant started here this morning and I spent my last 10 piastres on a feed this afternoon.   We have been too busy lately to get down for a swim. </p>\n<p>May 25<br><br />\n We are leaving here for Moaskar before Sunday.   It was mentioned on parade by Mr. Prior yesterday so it is the fair dinkum oil this time.   I don't suppose it will be long before we are on the water now.   A big inspection of the Division again this afternoon by General Murray.</p>\n<p>May 26<br><br />\n We had another shoot this morning and tomorrow I suppose we will be packing up as we move to Moascar on Sunday pending entrainment for Alexandria.   We have to get rid of all cameras in some way.   I am trying to sell mine as I am sorely in need of cash but so far have been unsuccessful.   They don't like buying as it will probably be confiscated in France. </p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301043\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 43]<br><br />\n May 27<br><br />\n Lieut Cullen, [indecipherable] Hilder, Gunners Burke, Gorman and myself went to Moascar today on horseback to mark out our new camp.   A Tommy Artillery Brigade was camped there and we arranged to exchange Camps which saved us making a Camp out.   We had a very enjoyable ride anyhow and had tea at the Ladies Canteen going back.</p>\n<p>May 28<br><br />\n Today the Brigade moved off to Moascar    The Spooks were left behind as rear guard and we had a pretty hard day of it.   Had some tea again at Ladies Canteen.   We are having another inspection on Thursday and will probably entrain next day.  I understand we have to be embarked by the 6th June.   Went for a swim after tea and Y.M.C.A. after</p>\n<p>May 29<br><br />\n We are going to do nothing but clean everything up preparatory to embarking   We were issued with our saddle equipment today and I was all day cleaning mine up and greasing.  Went for a swim after tea and spent a very pleasant hour in Y.M.C.A. after.   There are not many troops camped here but it is gradually filling up.   Sent letter home today.</p>\n<p>May 30<br><br />\n Cleaning harness still.   We have been offered a prize of 1&#163;  for the best turned out saddle so I am having a try for it.   However I don't stand much chance as my saddle is a very old one    We had an awfully good concert tonight in Y.M.C.A. given by New Zealand Hospital Glee Party.   Some wonderfully good artists among them.   This Camp has improved a good deal since our last camp here.   Plenty of water and much better tucker.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301044\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 44]<br><br />\n May 31<br><br />\n I am just suffering the torture of my last days in Egypt.   I am absolutely fed up with it and its dirty niggers   As full as the lamb that said \"I am so full I cannot pull another blade of grass Bah!  Bah!\"    We must really be leaving for France soon as witness the fact that after fully equipping us a few days ago they have now called in everything except that in which we stand meaning clothing of course    Our next issue I understand will be \"somewhere in France\" probably \"Ypres\" which means \"I look forward to\"   It is also stated as an excuse that on a/c of the large number of enemy vermin and such like crawling things contracted during transportation it is necessary that we should travel as lightly as possible.   Military again!   They issue an awful lot of unnecessary stuff for a place like Egypt and travel as lightly as possible to a cold place like France thereby making us the unwilling victim of frost</p>\n<p>June 1<br><br />\n bite and others!   By the way they have contrived some sort of arrangement like the following for the others.   One comes up to a long barn-like building containing fumigators, disrobes, walks naturally (after being told to pass on) down a sort of corridor I presume to the other end of the building dresses himself in new second-hand clothes fumigated for the chap before him and comes out smiling doubtfully (the next fellow gets mine)   He gives a few twitches to his</p>\n<p>June 2<br><br />\n neck not being sure you Know! but eventually comes to the conclusion that it is alright and thereby gains confidence and goes home in a brisk soldier like manner.  This performance takes place about once a week.   That's the way you get your new equipment in France.   Everything is done on a system in the military except promotions   These have been made indirectly by America having her \"stars and stripes\" torn up -   Had our final inspection <strike>today</strike> yesterday.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301045\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 45]<br><br />\n June 3<br><br />\n Wrote Lou and Will Thomas, today.   This morning we went out again for a route march and Battery manoeuvres with borrowed guns.   Found out where Bruce and Clive Elliott are and went across and saw them.   Clive is in the 14th and Bruce 15th Engineers   There is a rumour that we move off tomorrow and also that we are going to be formed into a Howitzer Battery.    Went over to 15th Fld. Amb for mail but nothing doing.   They forwarded me</p>\n<p>June 4<br><br />\n two parcels a couple of days ago which haven't yet reached me.   I am taking the Elliotts round to see Russ and Edric tonight. <br><br />\n Sunday ? Sent letter Home and PCs to Miss Montague and Ada Jones.   Church parade this morning.   Sang \"For those in perils on the Sea\" and also prayed for them which looks as though we go soon.   Another Khamseen blew up again this afternoon.   Going for a swim after tea.</p>\n<p>June 5<br><br />\n Very little doing today.   An awfully trying day, with plenty of sand   Got news of the North Sea Battle mostly in favour of Germans.  Went round and saw Edric for a few minutes tonight as we are supposed to be leaving tomorrow.   The 8th Brigade Infantry which we cover has all its stuff on the train ready for moving</p>\n<p>June 6<br><br />\n Our moving has been postponed again.   They called in our blankets this morning and had to give them out again.   The 8th Brigade had to unload all their stuff.   I think they must fear that German boats have got out.   We were paid today, fortunately and are not supposed to be leaving now until the 15th   We are all greatly disgusted naturally.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301046\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 46]<br><br />\n June 7<br><br />\n The Canteens were all raided again last night and are consequently now [indecipherable] again today.   On gun drill this morning and buzzer this afternoon.   Have put in for leave into Ismailia tonight.   Wandered round Ismailia for a couple of hours had some tea and cake at Empire Club and had a look through the native bazaar but didn't stay long as I was on my own and it isn't particularly safe</p>\n<p>June 8<br><br />\n All the Staff have to learn buzzer work thoroughly now so we are going to do nothing else at present.   Went into Ismailia again today on yesterdays pass with Jack Burke.   Had tea at Empire Club and wandered round town for a bit.   Went to pictures at night.   Russ and Edric were round to see me but I missed them.   There is also a letter for me at 15th Fld Amb.</p>\n<p>June 9<br><br />\n Kitchener's death has been a great shock to us all.  On Tuesday we are holding Divisional Sports it being a Holiday.   We held some preliminary ones this afternoon to pick out the most promising.   I saw Russ &amp; Edric tonight and also Bruce.   We are all going into Ismailia together on Sunday.   We are holding classes in the buzzer   I have advanced one class every day so far that is I am now in the 3rd class or 8 words a minute</p>\n<p>June 10<br><br />\n Held our usual \"buzzer\" class this morning.   Can just get 8 words a minute comfortably.   Another severe knock for the officers    A Russian cruiser picked up a wireless message which was later on discovered to come from Shepherds? Hotel as a small wireless plant has been discovered there.   The message gave information as to the personnel and whereabouts of the 4th Australian Division and its intended movements.   The men have been accused of letting out information</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301047\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 47]<br><br />\n June 11<br><br />\n and it appears now that it really comes from officers as men are not allowed in Shepherds. Went to usual Church parade again this morning.  Wrote letter home and saw Russ and Bruce.   Studied French all afternoon.   Bob Prior was round for a while this evening.   Lt. Prior is now Capt.     He is altogether too young in my opinion only 22 and not particularly smart either.   Sports on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>June 12<br><br />\n Had our usual buzzer parades from 6.30 to 10.30 am and 4 pm-6 pm.   Mr Prior announced that we have marching orders for Wednesday.   I wonder.    The Austrians are making wonderful progress on their fronts lately.    Packed my saddle away this afternoon preparatory to moving off.   Went for a swim to-night.    We have beautiful moonlight nights and it is perfect in the water</p>\n<p>June 13<br><br />\n Fearful day.   Dust and sand blowing about   We had a V.D. inspection today and are going to a Memorial Service for Earl Kitchener at 5.30 pm.    We handed our spare blankets and helmets in this morning.   The Sports have been postponed until tomorrow morning.    Am still learning French assiduously.</p>\n<p>June 14<br><br />\n Sergeant McMullen told me today that I was very foolish to join the Staff and should have been on the gun instead as I would have had a much better chance.  Saw Russ and Edric and also Bruce Elliott tonight and said good-bye to them</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301048\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 48]<br><br />\n June 15<br><br />\n Had an awfully busy day.   Packed up this morning also had a Kit inspection and an address by General Christian on our conduct in France.   Packing up most of the day but managed to get down for my last swim in Lake Timsah during the afternoon.   We leave at 11.50 tonight    Some of them have gone already   We left Camp about 10.30 and left Moasca about 11.30 p.m. </p>\n<p>June 16<br><br />\n Had a very uncomfortable and crowded trip in a cattle tuck.   Reached Alexandria about 8 a.m. and embarked almost immediately on \"Tunision\"   About 2800 troops on board very crowded so I'm afraid our trip won't be too pleasant.   Had a cup of tea and some iced coffee and cake at Y.W.C.A. on wharf.   We drew away from the wharf and anchored out in the Bay for the night   Very crowded on board but good food.   Very hard to get sleeping positions.</p>\n<p>June 17<br><br />\n Got under way about 8.30 a.m.   Scout cruiser of \"Arathusa\" class escorting us.   The escort is changed every few hours.   There are no baths unfortunately but plenty of washing dishes.  I played \"eucre\" most of the morning.   We also fell in for \"assembly\"   We had a medical inspection for measles this afternoon and have also been allotted boats in case of accident.   The \"Hororata\" and Rhesus are now in sight behind us.   We get any amount of bread and butter and jam.   Beautiful bread </p>\n<p>June 18<br><br />\n We held a Church parade this morning    Our old parson is rather monotonous and always has the same sermon and hymns it seems to me.   We have passed a good many boats during the day a good many of them being war boats.   We passed between two Islands about midday which is supposed to be a bad place of submarines as I understand several boats have been sunk in the same locality.   I wish I knew the names of the Islands for future reference.  I believe we are making for Malta.    Crete Island we passed.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301049\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 49]<br><br />\n June 19<br><br />\n Beautifully cool and calm today and we should be in Malta today or tomorrow.    I think I can go through without becoming sea-sick.   We only lost sight of Crete this morning.   I never imagined it was so big 45,000 inhabitants mostly Greek and Turks at present under the control of Greece formerly Turkey.   We have been passing numbers of boats and small Is.   The coast line of Greece was in sight this morning so we are not far from Salonika.   The Sunset was absolutely glorious today and the ocean like glass without a ripple.</p>\n<p>June 20<br><br />\n Nothing of any importance happened today.   We passed a good many boats but no land of any description    We only have one general assembly in the morning so we are enjoying a fairly good rest.  We held a very good concert on board tonight before dark.    Some very fair artists with 29th Battalion band as orchestra   We are in an awfully slow boat only averaging about 7 or 8 Knots.   A very large boat with 3 escorts passed about sundown.</p>\n<p>June 21<br><br />\n We passed by Malta about 2 a.m. this morning but of course we were all sleeping.   I will probably strike a guard of some sort tonight.   Passed Pentigos Is. off Sicily about 9 a.m. and also about half a dozen trawlers doing patrol work and several large vessels.   The band plays every morning on the officers deck to break the monotony.   The weather has become considerably cooler today in fact a little chilly.   We expect to reach Marseilles on Friday night or Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>June 22<br><br />\n I mounted main ship's guard last night at 6 p.m. and go on until 6 tonight.   It is the first time I have used a rifle on duty with 50 rounds of ammunition on my bandolier.   We are only about a day's sail from Marseilles now.   I thought we would see the coast of Sardinia but must have passed it during the night.   We passed another Island this afternoon which I fancy must have been Corsica.   I believe we are to go through Paris on our way as it was read out that it must be understood by all ranks that no leave will be granted there.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301050\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 50]<br><br />\n June 23<br><br />\n Arrived in Marseilles about 7 a.m. this morning.   It looks awfully pretty from the Harbour and I bought a set of PC's from a boy who came on board.   You can only see a small portion of the City from the Harbour as it is very hilly.   We disembarked at 4 p.m. and marched through the worst quarter of the City for about 1 \u00bd miles to the filthiest camp I have ever been in   The earth consists of burnt coal dust from factories which we have to sleep in and one can imaging the state we are in.   I have been put on lime piquet again tonight.   No leave being granted</p>\n<p>June 24<br><br />\n Had a fairly busy morning loading train.   Got away about midday in 2nd Class cars very comfortable.  We are pulled up now at Orange having lunch about 4 p.m.   The people are awfully nice to us.   We have passed through some awfully pretty country the garden of France   Avignon especially was a beautiful old town.   We have also passed through L?estaque, Miramas and Arles.    We have been travelling along the Rhone for a long time and the coastal scenery for a time from Marseilles was glorious.   Notre Dame shewed out well when we were leaving    See Jany 31st.</p>\n<p>June 25<br><br />\n We passed through Lyon last night and stayed about an hour but it was too dark to see anything.    We pulled up at a small siding about 6 am for breakfast   Passed through Chalon.   The country is still glorious but much flatter now.   We passed through a very pretty place named Beaumiere and also a village appropriately named Fleurville.   We are now at Dijon very fine town judging from our limited view of it.   The scenery after leaving Dijon   see Jany 31st &amp; 4 Feby 1st </p>\n<p>June 26 <br><br />\n We passed through Paris early this morning but of course couldn't see anything of it.   Now at Vernon    Had the slowest trip to Havre I have ever experienced landing here about 4 pm.   We have unloaded onto a wharf so it looks as though we are embarking for England.    We are just going to have something to eat as we have had nothing since last night.   About 9.30 p.m. we marched about 4 miles into the outskirts of Havre    The Camp is all slush and mud and we are all wet through.   We don't get our blankets until 1 a.m.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301051\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 51]<br><br />\n June 27<br><br />\n Very good war news this morning victories on all fronts.   We are leaving for the front in a few days.   This is called Sandwick Camp and is supposed to be a rest Camp   It is rotten being stuck here without money    I could have had leave into Havre tonight but hadn't a penny.   We have very good Y.M.C.A. and Canteens here.  It is a jolly shame to think we have been a fortnight without a change of clothing of any sort.</p>\n<p>June 28<br><br />\n Nothing much happened today   Had some tea and cake &amp;c at Y.M.C.A. and we were all very surprised to get paid tonight 65 francs each at 28 fr to 1&#163;.   I was put on guard on Brigade stores tonight.</p>\n<p>June 29<br><br />\n I had leave into Havre this morning and had a very pleasant time.  It is a fine old city.   Bought one or two souvenirs.   At night I was put on town picquet in Saint Addresse a suburb, but our beat only consisted of one street near what they call the German Castle   Some kind French lady presented us with cigars and cigarettes and beer.   We were issued with another set of underclothing today.</p>\n<p>June 30</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301052\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 52]<br><br />\n July 1<br><br />\n We have been very busy again today packing up ready to move off again tonight.  I got my permanent horse this morning.   Not a bad mount by any means.   We have been equipped with everything new.   We loaded our Battery on to the train 7 minutes under record time and left Harve about 6.30 pm    We were all very sorry to lose Mr Wilson from the Battery.   He was the only one who attended to our comfort.   He has been sent into the trench mortar</p>\n<p>July 2<br><br />\n I was unlucky enough to get into the only 3rd class carriage on the train the others being 1st and 2nd.    Very stiff this morning    Passed through Rouen last night and Calais and St. Omer this morning.   Got to our destination at Steenling about 5 p.m. and went on with our guns about 5 miles to a place near Bleninghem.   We got billeted in subsections in farmhouses.   I am in a loft in a stable and slept very comfortably on straw.</p>\n<p>July 3<br><br />\n We are only about 12 miles behind the firing line here and are going into action any day now.   We could see a couple of aeroplanes over our lines this afternoon being shelled but nothing resulted    We have most of our time cut out attending the horses.   Mine has ringworms and greasy heals.  Every farm house seems to be a tavern in this country.   Plenty of wine &amp; beer</p>\n<p>July 4<br><br />\n There is a tremendous lot of dissatisfaction in the Battery and quite a number are getting transfers into a trench mortar battery.   We are to move off tomorrow into the firing line to relieve the 2nd Division .    on buzzer work this morning.   The left Section is playing the Right Section football today.   I am suffering a good deal from piles lately bleeding internally</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301053\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 53]<br><br />\n July 5<br><br />\n We are having a fairly busy time with our horses just now.   A good many are on the sick list including mine with ringworms.   Had a stray letter today from Ada Jones and wrote P.Cs. home and to Ada and Moll.   Went down into Blesingham Village tonight and bought some pork chops and had them fried with eggs by the woman in our billet and had it with champagne.</p>\n<p>July 6<br><br />\n Champagne is sold here at about 4/6 per large bottle.   We were issued with gas helmets this morning and some of the Battery were gased to see how they worked.    They also used some tear bombs.   The mail closes at 9 a.m. tomorrow so I must try and drop a line or two home.   Our boys are behaving wonderfully well over here.   One French woman informed me that we are too quiet, much quieter than the French and English whom they don't seem to like much, the latter I mean</p>\n<p>July 7<br><br />\n Nothing much doing today.   We are not allowed outside our billeting areas, so can't see much of the country.   Colonel Caddy addressed us today in regard to going into action.   We are taking over from the 5th Brigade and so long as our position is not located by the enemy we will have a picnic.    All work will be done at night and sleep in day time.</p>\n<p>July 8<br><br />\n Had tea tonight with Corporal Bosall, Bill Hilder and Jack Burk at a farmhouse.   Beautiful omelette containing 16 eggs.   Went into Blaringhem after tea with Bill Hilder for tobacco but could only get cigars at Peach but very good.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301054\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 54]<br><br />\n July 9<br><br />\n Had a church parade today out in a very pretty paddock among the trees.   One expression the parson used struck me as being worth recording  \"Lord if I forget thee, do not then forget me.    28 of us have orders to proceed to the firing line tomorrow at a moments notice.  Had tea again at our farmhouse of last night.   We are taking over from the 4th Division</p>\n<p>July 10<br><br />\n Got away from our Camp about 6 p.m. in motor omnibuses.   Passed through Haverskenm and Merville and got out at a place called Enquinghem and walked about 3 miles to Bois Grenier about 3 miles from Armentieres.    We have a splendid billet here in a farm house which for some reason hasn't been shelled for 18 months, and all other farm houses round about have.   There will be no range finding to do here as everything is done by accurate maps</p>\n<p>July 11A few shots came over this morning pieces of shell &amp;c. but this place is nothing to Anzac in fact we are going to have a regular picnic.  They guns are very well concealed and well covered with earth reinforced concrete bricks and stone, sand? bags and more earth on top with grass growing on top.   I am on telephone duty for the time being, telephone attendant, linesman or anything that comes along.</p>\n<p>July 12<br><br />\n Had a very fatiguing day.    We took over finally from 48th Battery on duty telephones from 3 to 6 a.m.   After breakfast Bob and I went round some of our communications and up in the firing line 29th Batt.    This is called the Nursery.   We were shelled very heavily today and several batteries round us had to move.   They got very close to our guns.   The rest of our boys came along tonight and the left section moved round to their position near Armentieres.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301055\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 55]<br><br />\n July 13I am now at O.P. on telephone duties permanently.   There are only Bdr Hilder and Gunners Carr Wheeler, Burling and myself here.  We have an OK position in a fine old house.   Beds, tables chairs fireplaces &amp;c and living in great style.  It is a young fortress but we are likely to get shelled out any day with coal boxes and whiz bangs.   It has been awfully quiet today   Hardly a shot fired</p>\n<p>July 14<br><br />\n We were up most of the night firing   There was an awful din all night.   This morning I walked about 3 \u00bd  m. into Enquinghem to get ourselves some supplies as we cook our own food.   No sleep again tonight as we have to stand to again   Had letter from home. Sunday ? This is a much hotter part of the front and we expect something big tonight so no more sleep.</p>\n<p>July 15<br><br />\n We have to move out again tonight to a new position.   We are very sorry to lose this Camp as it is so comfortable.   Had letter from home today and also wrote home.   A tremendous bombardment going on tonight on our right and that is where we are going.   This is the third night I have had without sleep and poor food.   I am beginning to feel the strain and my belt has shortened.</p>\n<p>July 16<br><br />\n We got away about midnight and landed in our camp about 7 a.m.   We have no cover whatever as it is only a temporary camp.  We are shooting away barb wire entanglements for our boys to charge tonight.   We have 77 guns on 1000 yds front   They shelled us badly this afternoon very close to us but so far no damage.  It is raining now and very uncomfortable.  No sleep for days.   We are near Fleurbaix.   Had another letter from home.   Our boys suffered a number of casualties last night.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301056\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 56]<br><br />\n July 17<br><br />\n Things have been very quiet today   The Germans haven't been shelling at all.   We did a fair amount and unfortunately killed a few of our own infantrymen with one of our shots.   I saw Bob Prior today.   He is only about 100yards away from me in another billet.   Should have a good sleep tonight as Billy Hilder and I have found an old barn.</p>\n<p>July 18<br><br />\n Very quiet again today.   We have shot away several thousand rounds of ammunition cutting barb-wire. Wednesday ? Gunner [indecipherable] wounded    It was pure luck that I was away as our telephone room was blown in.   Our Batty staff is now reduced from 16 to 7 as another man is suffering from shock.   We kept up a tremendous bombardment all day and the 8th Brig charged at night and took 3 trenches but had to retire again to the German first line.</p>\n<p>July 19<br><br />\n I am really writing this on Thursday as I hadn't any time to do so yesterday.  It was the most trying day of my life.  In the morning Cpl Bosell, Jack Burk and myself went up into the first line trenches and struck a perfect hell.  We got back about 1 p.m. and found our Battery had been badly shelled 7 killed and 2 wounded.   8 of them were the Bty Staff.   Gunners Carr, Le Brock, Wheeler Green, Stevens &amp; Builing and Everett killed and </p>\n<p>July 20<br><br />\n The boys have been driven back again to their original positions again.   We are kept very busy as we are so short handed.   All our guns are out of action so we can't shoot.    They haven't been hit at all but have been used too much and worn out.  Had the unpleasant experience of carrying some of the bodies away to the Cemetery   Poor Builing and Stevens were collected and never even made one man.  I carried poor Dennie Le Brock.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301057\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 57]<br><br />\n July 21<br><br />\n We will probably be moving away again tonight.   Our boys were terribly cut up in the last charge and hundreds of dead and wounded are lying between the trenches but are being collected today.  I will be glad to leave as the place holds nasty associations.   The Germans flooded our boys out of the trenches as soon as they took them and had no ammunition in any case.   We got away from Camp about dark and came on to Gris Pot     Posted letter home and to Moll.</p>\n<p>July 22<br><br />\n I am on duty today at the Headquarters of the Battalion whom we are to support.   Wye Farm it is called about 2 miles from the Battery.   We haven't fired a shot here so far and are moving back again to our last position tomorrow.   They won't allow us to get settled in one place more than a day or so and consequently we can't make ourselves comfortable and our rations are messed about   Bombardier Prior left us today for H.Qs. and has been relieved by Bombardier Connors</p>\n<p>July 23<br><br />\n Have been on duty on telephone all day at Wye Farm and expect to be on until we move off sometime tonight.   The Tommies left any amount of tucker behind them.   They are much better catered for than we are I don't know why.   Our troops are awfully badly fed and clothed.   The 56th Battalion are stationed here at present   We got away from Wye Farm about 9 p.m. and went round to the Battery and we all came round into Camp near Fleurbaix again.</p>\n<p>July 24<br><br />\n This morning Capt Prior sent 24 Gunners and 3 spooks back to the Horse lines for a weeks spell.  I was one of the Spooks.   We have nothing to do at all so we will have a good rest and plenty of tucker.   It will give me plenty of time to write letters anyhow.   I have had two from Dorrie lately and wrote to, Tom.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301058\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 58]<br><br />\n July 25<br><br />\n We are about 3 miles behind the firing line here and are comparatively safe except from an occasional shell.   I have been reading all day \"A Soldier of the Legion\" by CN Williamson and it is very good altho I have read it before.   There are one or two very fine girls here in this billet, but we have to be very careful with them as all these persons are suspected spies.   It is a noticeable fact that some billets are shelled and other not</p>\n<p>July 26<br><br />\n We were called out of bed late last night and had to report back to the Battery and this morning we had to go up to the first line on duty at F.O.   We had an easy day as we didn't fire.   Another Battery killed another of our own men in the trenches.  This unfortunately is a very common occurrence and might easily be avoided   Later on the O.C. of this particular Battery was wounded and I wasn't a bit sorry for him.</p>\n<p>July 27<br><br />\n We have two new reinforcements for our reduced staff.   Got back from F.O. about 9 a.m.   Nothing doing today.   On duty on telephone from 3 to 7 p.m.   Hardly a day goes bye without a gas alarm but nothing ever seems to come of it.   There is to be another stunt of some time tomorrow and I understand we are moving camp again.   They seem to like keeping us on the move   General Christian was round today.</p>\n<p>July 28<br><br />\n Lieutenant Cullen has proved an absolute failure and been sent back to waggon lines.   Lieut Gatcliffe has also applied for a week's leave which is pretty rotten considering he only left Sydney this year and only 10 days in action.   The week in trenches and week out published in papers is all a myth when one gets here, except that they put them in for a few days in one place and then move them to another.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301059\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 59]<br><br />\n July 29 Am up at forward observation post again today but had a very quiet day.    40&#163; and a month's furlough are offered for a German sniper dead or alive who is operating on our side of the trenches.    40&#163; is also offered any man who can capture a live German star shell.   They are much superior to ours and fired by compressed air.</p>\n<p>July 30<br><br />\n Got back this morning about 9 a.m. and found cablegram in regard to money waiting for me.   I was on duty tonight and managed to write some letters.   I understand we are in our winter quarters here now.   The position might be better and might be worse.  I daresay we will settle down comfortably though.   Our aeroplanes are very active here always one or two up.</p>\n<p>July 31<br><br />\n On Saturday the 29th the Germans blew down a large Church in Fleurbaix about a mile from here.   They had been after it for a long time but didn't seem able to get the range.   We fired about 40 shells into a German anti-aircraft battery this afternoon and forced them to move their position.   Posted letters home, Mrs Fountain Arthur Preston, Charley Montague and Dorrie. The Germans use some most peculiar shells sometimes, especially delayed action shell designed to penetrate dugouts or gun pits before exploding.   They caught quite a number of our coves at first as they would think they were duds and rush over to dig them out and get caught in the explosion.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301060\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 60]<br><br />\n August 1 <br><br />\n Just heard tonight that Bruce Elliott was simply blown to pieces during the last attack   I must try and look Clive up as they were very much attached to one another    Romania has declared war on Turkey and Russians have again taken Lemberg.   Our boys have also taken observations Hill on the Somme one of the most important positions on the whole front and the Tommies have tried for months in vain to take it.</p>\n<p>August 2<br><br />\n Posted long letter home.   Going into Fleurbaix this afternoon.    Jack Burke and I spent a very pleasant afternoon in town.   Had a good meal of eggs and chips.   I never saw such beautiful eggs as one gets here, much larger generally than any one sees in Australia.    Fleurbaix must have been a fine little town at one time and I can't understand why civilians remain the place as it is shelled severely every day.</p>\n<p>August 3I was on duty at 30th Batt H.Q. today at F.O.O.    So far the 8th Brigade has been disappointing.   Fritz has them bluffed.   They don't like us shooting at all as Fritz retaliates, but the moral effect of his shells is much greater than the actual damage he does.   They asked today for a certain number of men to volunteer for a raid in 3 weeks time but couldn't get them.   However I don't believe in this volunteer business at all as all the best men volunteer and the other don't.</p>\n<p>August 4Got back about 10 a.m. from F.O.O.   The boys managed to get some eggs for us for breakfast.   Slept all day as I never had a wink all night as I was on duty from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. and have to go on again tonight.   This continual night work plays on one so we will welcome reinforcements.   The last few days we have been preparing our winter's quarters about \u00bc mile down the road and will have everything ready before moving in this time</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301061\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 61]<br><br />\n August 5<br><br />\n Did nothing much today    Wrote home and to Iris.    On duty again tonight.   They are plenty of broad and French beans coming along fine in the fields now and I noticed some of the boys with some today.   The 8th Brigade Infantry to whom we are attached so far have proved a lamentable failure.   This is the Brigade claimed to be the best that has ever left Australia.</p>\n<p>August 6Had a cruise round on bicycle today looking for 15th Fld. Amb. but all the boys were away ? I also had a look for Bob Prior and Clive Elliott but they were both away.   There is some rumour of us going down to the Somme shortly.   Business is fairly warm in that quarter I understand.</p>\n<p>August 7<br><br />\n One or two aeroplanes have been brought down on either side lately, about two on either side I fancy.   It's a wonder we don't lose more as about 10 of our planes go over the German lines every day and German planes are seldom seen over our lines.   Acknowledged letter from Commonwealth Bank London in regard to money</p>\n<p>August 8<br><br />\n I was up at 7.oo again today but had a very easy day of it.   I have let the diary run down the last few days as it has been so quiet and nothing to mention.   Our boys did some good work lately in Egypt and also on the Somme.   I always seem to be in some part where nothing is doing but I suppose we shall all have a turn later    Got 3 champions today</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301062\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 62]<br><br />\n August 9  <br><br />\n The Guns have moved down again to another position about 300 yards down the road but we are remaining here until a strong position is built for us before we go down.   Had a good sleep tonight as I wasn't on duty.   Norm Tayt and I collected some fine stewing plums today which the Cook is stewing for us and they were beautiful.</p>\n<p>August 10<br><br />\n The boys at F.O.O. today had a lively time today.   We made a considerable bombardment and as usual Fritz retaliated and shells fell all round them. Bill Hilder and I were up in an O.P. near the front line and bits of stuff from 5.9 in shells fell all round us but did no damage   Gorizia has at last been taken by the Italians after a very long uphill struggle.</p>\n<p>August 11<br><br />\n I understand King George is going to make a statement in the course of a few days that will \"delight the Australians and surprise the whole world\".   I wonder what it is     Lloyd George has been advocating the withdrawal of all Australiana troops on the grounds that we are losing too many fine men for a young country and he is not far wrong.   I don't think we can make</p>\n<p>August 12<br><br />\n up more than one division out of the four that came over here originally   <br><br />\n Wrote to Lou, Iris, and Uncle Jim today and also F.S. card to Lorna.   It's a hard job even to keep these small sheets of diary filled up here.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a6301063\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 63]<br><br />\n August 13<br><br />\n I was on F.O.O. again today and had a very quiet day.  I picked and took a sack of pears up to the infantry headquarter's men as they always treat us well when we go up.   Sergeant Kennedy was hit by a machine gun bullet tonight at the Battery 3 inches from the spine so he was fairly lucky in some respects.    Mail in today but none \"pour moi\".</p>\n<p>August 14<br><br />\n I was down at waggon lines today and some of them reported having seen King George.   Had a good feed of steak and fried onions there for dinner.   We are going to try and send 3 at a time down for a week's holiday.   Called in at Engineers coming home to see Clive Elliott but he has been wounded by a bomb in the legs.   Came back through Fleurbaix and had fried eggs and chipped potatoes   On duty tonight so wrote home, and to Ada Jones from whom I had a pair of sox</p>\n<p>August 15<br><br />\n Evidently our objective on this Sector when we advance will be Lille.   At present I suppose we are about 5 miles from there and a fairly good ridge to cross in between which in my opinion will take some taking    We are able to get papers delivered here every day published only the day before so we are just as well off as you all at home.</p>\n<p>August 16<br></p>\n"}]},"field_working_notes":[],"field_transcript_image":{"und":[{"fid":"102679","uid":"0","filename":"a6301001h.jpg","uri":"public://a6301001h.jpg","filemime":"image/jpeg","filesize":"566391","status":"1","timestamp":"1389062703","type":"image","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":1050,"width":684},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"field_diary_title":{"und":[{"value":"Norman Lee Pearce World War I diary, 1 January -
