<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Friday 8</p>
<p>Fatigue duties in camp.</p>
<p>Dissolved partnership with Hunter &amp; got a dug out for myself, to be independent &amp; save a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>A fair amount of free gift supplies ( chocolate etc.) arrived &amp; were brought up with rations in afternoon.</p>
<p>First rain since landing came after dark with a brisk wind <strike>right</strike> causing alterations to be necessary for the dugout.</p>
