He went to Sister Ursula a saintly woman & a poor recluse who lived on the side of a hill and ask her to turn the hour glass 6 times.  Once every hour and at the 7th hour to light a taper - this she did - now as the Devil was doing the evil work each time the hour glass turned it gave him sudden cramps which made him weak and handicapped his work than as the taper was lit he took it down threw his pick-axe down and fled and never resumed his labour so was he vanished by the Saint and the people ever after prayed in peace.  But the Devils work - the unfinished Dyke exists to the day.

 The Cathedral and Castle are the two prominent marks there - There is a moat
