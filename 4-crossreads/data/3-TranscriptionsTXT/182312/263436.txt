 the contestants are so hemmed in by the sides of the trench that the 
 bomb produces its maximum effect and soon has the trench or sap 
 choked with dead and wounded.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to enter into

 described in the papers from time to time and are really a repetition 
 of the same sort of thing which has been going on ever since this 
 summer&#39;s offensive started.&nbsp; Ground has to be gained foot by foot and

 more than average, time for a man to last in that inferno where you 
 were often cut off from food and ammunition supplies and had no means 
 of communicatiing with the outside world other than by pigeons.&nbsp; Not 
 only the front lines but the whole terrain in the rear lie under such
