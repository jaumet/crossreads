Sun Mon. May 14th During one of the Fritzs Barrages Stan Wright & about 6 others failed to get through.  After waiting about 3 hours, we almost decided to go & search for them, when they turned up.  It was a great relief to see them.  The 15th came & relieved us about 7 oclock & never was a body of men more welcome.  We arrived safely back at the A.C.S. in the sunken Road, where we found that instead of having a spell, we had to carry through to the Waggon loading Post.
There were a great many wounded coming through & we were kept busy.  About 9 oclock, 4 g.s. waggons came along the Sunken Road & commenced to unload Gas Cylinders.  Fritz was sending over a barrage of H.E & shrapnel.  Over in the Gully, near the village of Noreuil our Batteries were banging away & Fritz couldn't get 'em.  One of the Gas Waggons was standing just outside the A.C.S.  About 9 a shell landed right behind one of the Horses.  It didn't explode & we all thought it was a dud; till somebody shouted out "Gas".  Then it was a rush to get our Gas Helmets on.  Maj Bond kept his head well.  There were a good number of wounded lying about & these had to fixed up with Helmets.  The Heads reckon that about 5 thousand Gas shells came over during the night.
