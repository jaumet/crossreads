<p>Sunday 9 February 1919<br/>My throat &amp; cold is bad &amp; my hair is falling out.  I don't know whether from worry or what, but I am still fat &amp; should be thankful.  We are on the winning side.<br/>Had photo taken by official photographer yesterday for Records.  John Ayre who is on a job at A.I.F. Hd. Qts. now wants to come home with the Regt.  I am applying for him.  He sent me letters from Miss Ellie Stewart, Mrs. H.L.A., Percy Smith &amp; others with all the Hay news.  Sorry the fires have been so bad.</p>
