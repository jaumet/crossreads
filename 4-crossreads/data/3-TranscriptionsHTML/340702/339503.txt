Returned to  <strike>Limerick</strike>  Dublin in the evening very tired &amp; found out that Limerick was quite close to Killarney &amp; that I had let myself in for a lot of expence &amp;  trouble. There is a surprisingly good male Soprano singing here in the Soldiers home. Walking around Dublin today (Friday) with an old chap who called himself a guide. Got ripped oftener than ever I remember<br/>I forgot to mention that on Wednesday I visited the London Zoo &amp; also  <strike>the</strike>  Madame Tussaud's</p>
<p>Saturday 25th.8  I leave Dublin tonight chased out of it by Beggars, cheats, &amp; other wasters. I never bought an article but I was swindled in short change or some other way. I never walked 100 yds without being Bailed up" For the love of God". I never stood still without being surrounded by Kids, looking for Halfpence. I could'nt buy a registered envelope in one Post Office &amp; in</p>
