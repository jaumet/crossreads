<p>Saturday 30th Sept<br/>O.S. for the day with ordinary routine.  At 1 A.M. the clock is to be put back which brings time back to normal there being a difference of about 1 hour.</p>
<p>Thursday 5th October<br/>Plenty of rain the last few days which means mud everywhere, otherwise things much as usual.  We now have new A.D. Stations to look after but very little is doing anywhere on this front.  One night we gave a solid bombardment for 30 minutes quite like old time.  The flashes star shell red signal etc made a beautiful scene &amp; altogether 36 raids were made along this line each bringing back a prisoner or so to identify the troops in front of us.</p>
<p>Thursday 12th October<br/>A week of ordinary duties with very little variation.  Yesterday morning I went out early for a four of our positions in the trenches &amp; also for a view of the front line positions.  Two of us set out from the Advanced Dressing Station about 8.30 A.M. arriving back about 12 P.M. having walked about 8 miles mostly through saps.  Things were quiet so had a good look at "No mans land'&amp; the German trenches both through</p>
