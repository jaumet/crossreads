It was rather a little late to go looking for a hotel, especially as the bus strike was on, so I decided to stop at the War Chest for the night, which is next door to the Hd. Qrtrs. The War Chest is really a wonderful institution, it is open day & night a good bed, & meals can be obtained there, & the guides are always on hand if the soldier wants information, or a pleasant place to spend his Furlough etc. etc. I enjoy another hot meal, & I turn in between the sheets, (what a luxury). Arriving at Hd. Qrtrs. so late I was given an extra day's Leave, so I am up early in the following morning with the pleasant prospect, that I have 14 clear days holiday ahead of me. Of course the first item after breakfast was to visit the hairdressers, & enjoy a good shampoo etc.,   Being Sunday morning not many barbers were opened so naturally had a long wait, & it was close on midday before I was fixed up. Decided to go to East Sheen, which I did, & had dinner with cousin Lily.  My visit was unexpected so you can imagine her surprise. In the afternoon, she gave me a hand to parcel up all the souvenirs that I had brought over from France, & we got them all dispatched. Back again to London, to the Golden Cross Hotel, where I am staying for tea.  In the evening I attended an American Concert at the Palace Theatre, a big crowd of the leading Actors & Actresses of the London Theatres, give a free concert here, every Sunday evening to Soldiers & Sailors.
