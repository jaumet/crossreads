April 191712th   Last night we had a very heavy fall of snow last night which lasted about two hours.Yesterday &  To-day we have had large infantry parties working along the road between here & Bapaume.   I went into Bapaume to-night to the picture show with some of the lads & met some old friends in the 1st Field Company.13th   I had a company of infantry on repairing the road between the Sugar Mill & Le Transloy where it has been badly cut up by shell fire.The news from Arras front is to the effect that Vimy Ridge is being held, another 100 guns captured, & also that we have got 1500 machine guns 1800 trench mortars & large numbers of prisoners.   Fritz was shelling Bapaume nearly all day but did little damage.
