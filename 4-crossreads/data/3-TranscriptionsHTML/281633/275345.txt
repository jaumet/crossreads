<p>Crane for today at any rate giving us a lot of unnecessary work &amp; overtime.  They have notes here of all values from one Halfpenny upwards.  Some are issued by village Syndicates, these latter look like Bus tickets but are about 1&frac12;" x 1" in size.</p>
<p>Saturday, 21/12<br/>Had another afternoon as Crane Driver.  Our Tucker here is somewhat scanty even now.  It seems that Fritz blew up bridges, Railways &amp; Roads to such an extent that it is very difficult to get the food up.  The people here on the French side of the Frontier haven't a darn thing.  But if one walks up the street about a K.M. or 2 (on the Belgian side of the Frontier) one finds Estaminets open, Fair Beer at &frac12; the French price for <u>Bad</u> Beer.  Plenty of Lollies, mechanical Pianos &amp; Dancing in the Estaminets (Mdmlles too).  The French tell me they can't get even Bad Beer.  A Kgrmme. of coffee costs 38 Francs, no sugar, no anything.  But the Belgians seem to have plenty.  I'd like to know why I weighed 11 stone today.</p>
<p>Monday, 23/12<br/>Among the gear salvaged are a number of small Generators direct connected to what looks like a small mech. motor with an interrupting device in the Generator circuit.  I believe these are Dynamos for small wireless sets.  They are wound up by a crank &amp; then let go like a clockwork toy.  I will probably have more to say about them later on.  One fair sized Dynamo here has Graphite Brushes.<br/>Mac's letter.</p>
