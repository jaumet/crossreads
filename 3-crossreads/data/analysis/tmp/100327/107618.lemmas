 7/10/15 Dugout damp and unhealthi ? cannot lie down on a warm day without waterproof sheet and at least one blanket underneath to stop damp come up from floor . Quiet dure day . Went down mine and tunnel with Baze , wonder maze with charg all laid readi to blow up . Drive all timber by our expert miner , pitch dark , forward fire line just readi for break through . Right under them in mani case . They are on same game but we go deep to avoid meet . Differ level reach per rope down shaft Crouch right at end of each drive on their own are listen with light candl and fix bayonet . One hour shift ? a tedious job sit feet under ground just listen for the Turk . Occasion they blow us up ? we retali . Last occas the depth below was too great and their explos onli caus the floor of tunnel to lift like a wave and then subsid again . A wonder labyrinth ? quit a relief to get into daylight onc more . Quiet until after tea . Remark to state there has been no artilleri bombard today . A few usual sharp snipe until 2030 when first Divn made demonstr sent up parachut rocket , open heavi rifl and machin gun fire and torpedo boat start fire broadsid on to enemi 's trench . The enemi evid had a demonstr readi up too for they open veri heavili a second or two befor our folk start . Nois prodigi . So hot that our men had to stand to arm here but not a shot was fire although on our right " A" Co. they whip it in pretti thick . All of sudden they seem to get the jump ( perhap some of war ship shell land right up here ) and then the event of the even occur . I think the incid must have occur from some Turk who lost his block as they would not give show away otherwis
