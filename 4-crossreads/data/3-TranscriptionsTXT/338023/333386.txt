 BASE RECORDS OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE, MELBOURNE, 9th Dec., 1917. 
 Dear Sir, 
 I am in receipt of cable advice to the effect that No.379 Private H.W.Pryce, 23rd Machine Gun Company, is returning to Australia. 
 When the transport is nearing Australia, a list of names marked "A" will be published in the Press, beyond this no further information can be supplied. It is regreted that the movements or name of the transport on which he is arriving cannot be disclosed. 
 It is to be noted that owing to possible mutilations in the cabled advice and other causes this notification may not be correct pending verification from the roll on arrival of the Troopship. 
 Yours faithfully, J.M. LEAN, Major Officer in Charge, Base Records.
