at one time they knew our every movement but we have them now. 
This evening I went over to the picture show saw the pictures after this followed a concert by the 2nd Battalion, it was a pretty poor affair just before the "interval" they brought a Tommy on the first song he gave was alright he then followed this with a pretty smutty one, this was alright, but he followed with a dirty rotten thing but he never got far for the boys howled him down counted him out no one like the idea of treating a Tommy like this but it was absolutely necessary, for a Y.M.C.A. is no place for this class of singing, a pub might be right enough.
