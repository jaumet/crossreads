<p>Saturday 1 February 1919<br/>Arrived at Harfleur Halle at 2 pm. We were some tired too. Altho we slept warm &amp; had a good sleep. Marched to the camp &amp; went to the A.G.B.D. No body has any idea of what is going to happen to us yet. Our home is in a hut without a stove &amp; on the floor.</p>
<p>Sunday 2 February 1919<br/>Checked for orderly officer straight away. As usual very little to do. Managed to do the needful. Got a job at 9 pm tho &amp; had to go to the station &amp; wait till a train came in &amp; then guide the diggers to the camp. Got home at1 am. Still on the floor. Sleep in my valise tonight. Too cold otherwise.</p>
