I suppose I am a bit stand offish but I can't help it.
In the morning we done Battalion drill Lewis Gun the afternoon was spent in Consolidation of positions we are going out again tonight. It has been a beautiful day quite hot at times plenty of sun.
Marched my platoon down tonight reported at B.O.R. Capt White was in charge so I walks up to him says "look here Capt. how about letting us off this parade tonight as I have just come back from leave am expecting to go to France any day I am all behindhand with my packing. Capt. White looked at me laughed Oh I know your little game Sgt. you have got a tart to see somewhere I suppose, its not the packing that's trouble you I'll bet, "Yes, buzz off we will managed without you, you bet I did, he's a good chap is this Capt I have always got on well with him, he belongs to the 3rd Battn.
