Around the promenade there are laid out little gardens, there is also an aquarium & a band stand where on summer nights a band plays nightly great crowds usually throng this walk & it is very lively & especially of an evening.  From here we went down the town & into "Colliers" the best restaurant in Plymouth for tea.  As we were going to our seat I heard some one sing out "Arch, Arch" & on looking round got the shock of my life to see an old cobber of mine Lieut. Shannon, I thought he was back in Australia long ago.  The last time I saw him was in the Corner House in London & he then was going back to Aussie in a few days with a stiff leg.  It appears from what he told me that he was getting on board ship & slipped on the gangway & broke his leg & had been in hospital ever since, how stiff was Freddie, he has still got his leg in Plaster of Paris.  I am going down to see him first chance I get he is stopping at Durnforde Hotel.
