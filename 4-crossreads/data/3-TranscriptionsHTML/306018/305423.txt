Wood is very scarce but we managed to get some  as our patrols hadn't been over the same ground before.  There was no sign of any Turkish patrols so after travelling SE about 4 miles we came back &amp; had breakfast, watered &amp; went to Nuran for another days feed, rations &amp; again came out on outpost.  There was steady gunfire nearly all night north of us near Gaza.</p>

Sent out a fatigue party to get a fair supply of wood .  The day was terribly hot &amp; there was a lot of wind &amp; dust.  The only shade we had was made by hanging blankets on rifles.
