<p>Monday 21 August 1916<br/>Fine &amp; clear. Immediately after breakfast we moved back to Warloy Baillon. A motor lorry was attached to us to pick up sick men who fell out of the march, &amp; I rode in it. As we moved out of Albert 3 German planes flew over &amp; as we afterwards heard, dropped a bomb on some artillery positions doing some damage. Arrived in time for lunch, &amp; took things easy in the afternoon. Just after mess I spied Jocelyn riding along &amp; was so glad to have a yarn with him. He was looking splendid : heard that  Wes Wade was killed but that the others were all right.</p>
