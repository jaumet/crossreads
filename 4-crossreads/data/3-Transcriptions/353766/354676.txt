<p>&amp; destryrs under Elwell &amp; Hill. Bowra had a lucky escape. Had seized German wounded by faulty mine fuse. B. at point of revolver compelled him to call out "cease fire" to Germns. Two G. offrs. Came out, one captured. Bullet passed thro' Bowra's helmet, making scalp wound. Poor Elwell shot dead while leading his men in bayonet charge. Dr. Pockley attended wounded German, then one of his own men. Shot dead (10 a.m.) Had, I believe, just taken off Red Cross armlet &amp; lent it to someone, but am not certain of this. Warrego brought wounded alongside. Moffatt A.B. died next day. Impressive funeral on quarter deck. Fighting all night. Travers &amp; Bond alone rushed Kabacaul W/T, battered door in &amp; called on large body of German &amp; natives to Surrender. Yelled Signal "Berrima", nearly shot by own men. Desultory firing. Encounter made excellent practice with a few salvos, wh. cleared things up a bit. Rabaul harbour splendid quite hidden till quite close up. Every time we move at night natives light signal fires everywhere.</p>
