Wednesday 5 December 1917
Another S.O.S. message came from our rear last night about 5 miles away, our BAR Steward is very nervous as he has been torpedoed twice in PERSIA & MOOLTAN.  We arrived however in Malta at 6 p.m. after going 96 miles past & then circling back again - so tonight Dolly & I we came ashore & had dinner, but the Hotel tucker is not as good as on the boat. The Papers I want to read.
