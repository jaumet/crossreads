20/9/15 Gallipoli
Stand to arms 4.15 and as cold as can be. Pitch dark and star lit when I rose and as I put my head out of the blanket door a bullet went "phut" into the earth only a few inches off. From where I don't know but it was a narrow shave. A monitor putting shells into some position up Suvla way. The sound "bang, pause, plonk". This morning washed shaved and cleaned teeth in a cup or two of water. This is as per usual. A peculiar bomb affair in Lone Pine. A new man in the trenches lit a bomb but seemed to have no power to throw it gazing at it in a mesmerised sort of way. It burst and killed him and two others wounding several more. In the firing line this morning yarning to the "heads". All merry and profanely bright
