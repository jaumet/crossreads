<p>get the lads to go anywhere else &amp; on 26 Jan. Centenary Day we had a most hilarious dinner there &amp; a box at the Opera after.</p>
<p>I forget to say our party was eight that night, six of our own &amp; 2 others.</p>
<p>We saw also the most wonderful &amp; largest shop in the world, Nouveate Galeries.</p>
<p>We just arrived back in time to move, a heartrending business.</p>
<p>I may get a job in Paris but reports say I'm to be given a spell in England.  I'm not minding which.  I saw Bertie Macnamara the other day, he would come back to France.  He looks well but <strike>his</strike> of course his glass eye isn't an improvement.  He says he never received your letter.  I sent it to old Brian to send on to him.  I told you Brian was lying ill in the Hospital when it was shelled &amp; he was killed.  That's all I know.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry the fly has been so bad.  I loved Biggs trying to prune the snake, it gave me quite a lot of joy.  Your letters do somehow even when things are not too good with you &amp; I'm rather concerned, somehow you manage to dash a humorous spot in &amp; I giggle away &amp; chuckle, although the things themselves, such as Ireland saying he couldn't pull you any further up the river, &amp; the boggings of the car, they must have been rottenly annoying.</p>
<p>I hope you are getting my letters better now, I'm pretty rotten at times but I'm not a heaven born correspondent.  You can quote that to Mac, he'll recognise the phrase.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Miss Hilda &amp; an invitation to the wedding.  I hope it went off all right.</p>
