<p>no onions &ndash; no potatoes!!! We got 2 bucket fulls from the Elax &amp; they're the first we've had since Dec 14th. You couldn't buy a bottle of lime juice ashore for gold &ndash; I tried yesterday &ndash;<br/>I had a good walk up to the Governor's residence &amp; back by the Chinese quarter &ndash; My friend asked me if I'd like to see a Japanese House of ill fame &ndash; We went &amp; were warmly greeted with a hand shake from 3 nicely dressed &ndash; very clean looking Jap &ndash; girls &ndash; I inspected them &amp; their sitting room &amp; one bedroom. All was clean &amp; in good order &amp; so far as I know they were in good health. You buy one for 10 marks &ndash; Officer's price &ndash; 5 marks &ndash; Soldier or Sailor &ndash;<br/>They were dressed in Jap fashion, nice Kimonos &amp; Skirts &amp; Sandals &ndash; nothing</p>
