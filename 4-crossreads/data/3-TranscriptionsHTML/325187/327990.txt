<p>[Monday 4 September 1916]</p>
<p>Cold better one poor boy died last night, just one day from home!<br/>Sun very sickly, &amp; looks like rain in France.<br/>Expect to get to Southampton tomorrow at 4 pm &amp; unload tomorrow night.<br/>I have asked to be sent to a London Hospital, &amp; so I finish with Egypt for a while- &amp; when the years have rolled on the Oasis boys may remember the Australians who made glad the hearts of the donkey boys, made sore their (the donkeys) backs sometimes &amp; taught them some of the choicest swear words in the English language<br/>My future wanderings will be of interest to you little Mother alone till I start once more on the great adventure.</p>
