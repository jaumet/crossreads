<p>stunt &amp; had a long walk away through Querrieu, &amp; on the other side of Allonville, about 12 kilos. The gas officer explained the different sorts of gas the Germans send over, now classed as Blue Cross, Green Cross, &amp; Yellow Cross gas. We put on our respirators while gas shells were fired, &amp; then had a smell of the different gases, so that we'll know the smell the minute Fritz sends it over, &amp; get our respirators on quickly. Then they fired some projectors (empty), which flew through the air like big drums, so that we'll know them. We came back to Allonville &amp; had lunch, the field cookers made a drink of cocoa there. The 4th Machine Gun Coy were holding sports at Allonville, &amp; instead of being marched home, we were given leave to go to the sports. They had no attractions for anybody, especially as we were hampered with rifles &amp; equipment, Foster &amp; I waited wearily on the roadside for a lift; after an hour &amp; a half, we got a lift to Querrieu in an Aussie wagon, on which many more stragglers hopped as it went along. Then we sat down for a good while, &amp; finally got on a Tommy wagon which took us nearly to our 'pozzy', where we arrived about 6 p.m., very tired &amp; had a hot meal, stew &amp; tea. Had another letter from Bon this evening, he was just going on more leave &amp;</p>
