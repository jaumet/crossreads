<p>down to Lt. Hall, &amp; we were deepening the front line trench, the usual patrols were out, &amp; in the moonlight we were pretty visible. Knocked off work 3 a.m., had tea &amp; bacon, slept as usual. Monday 24 June On observation 1 to 2 p.m. Old Mitchell made some coffee &amp; milk as per usual, &amp; we ate our daily ration of bread &amp; jam; the chocolates Elsie sent went well today. Bitterly cold again considering it is midsummer. Dull &amp; rainy in evening, a Fritz 'plane flew low over our lines &amp; our machine guns rattled out on him, but didn't fetch him down. The usual party from our platoon went down to the left deepening the trench again tonight. Our side sent gas over tonight, &amp; after a while Fritz shelled us solidly for 1/4 hour, we sat huddled in the trench where we were digging while they fell all round us, it is a rotten feeling. About 3 a.m. we knocked off &amp; wearily returned to our own part of the trench. Tuesday 25 June The usual lot of fat bacon &amp; tea for breakfast. I issued my section with the day's ration of bread, cheese &amp; margarine, plum jam today, a change after apricot. A couple of little Tommy cookers &amp; tin of cocoa &amp; milk were also issued for the section. Very foggy this morning, &amp;</p>
