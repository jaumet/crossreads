<p>Christmas Eve appears at home.</p>
<p>25th Dec. (Saturday.) Christmas Day. A glorious day. Continued with dug-out. Col. Tivey, commanding the 8th Brigade came and announced the evacuation from Gallipoli. Plum Pudding, peaches, salmon, pineapple and cigarettes issued. The pudding tins had small paper slips inside with notes from various subscribers to the West. Aust. Red Cross Society. O.C. of the camp read a cable message from Mrs. Tivey sending Christmas Greetings. Desert Xmas never to be forgotten. Australians now being transported to the Suez Canal Infantry are busy</p>
