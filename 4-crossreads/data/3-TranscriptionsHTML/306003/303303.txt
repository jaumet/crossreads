<p>28.3.16<br/>Tues 28th<br/>This morning went to Major Smith to see if I could get the 6 new Sigs off patrols, guards, &amp; piquets, but with no success, so I rang up Sgt Nielson &amp; complained that the men were getting too much work to do; Murray decided to drop out of the Sigs &amp; Ford has taken his place &amp; has done a little of it before;</p>
<p>Last night one of the lads killed a snake about 18 inches long this is the second during the last week as one dropped out of Ibbots blankets a few nights ago when he was making his bed down;<br/>Sgt Todhunter &amp; Cpl Bigg returned from hospital today;  I have handed the class on New Sigs over to Les &amp; am putting in the whole time brushing Reid up for the School;</p>
