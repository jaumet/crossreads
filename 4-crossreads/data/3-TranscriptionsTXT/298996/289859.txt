 Notes of  the Run  trip to the front after leaving Liverpool Camp Australia 
 17- 3-15 We left Liverpool camp. 8.A.M. arrived Sydney R. Station 10. AM. After some trouble. Formed up and marched to No 1 Wharf, Woolloomooloo Bay arriving there at 11. AM. Embarked aboard T.SS. Shropshire. Moved from wharf to midstream 12.AM. Sailed from there 5 PM. As soon as we passed out of the heads some of the Lads began  to get sea sick  to feel funny about the inner man there being a good swell on.  9 PM  6 PM. All men alloted to their sleeping  points  positions. This is how they are alloted off.
