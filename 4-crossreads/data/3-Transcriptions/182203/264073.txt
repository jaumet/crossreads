We have expected to leave everyday but now think it may be to-day or to-morrow. The weather has not been so wet nor cold this week &amp; we have been out everyday.<br/>I wrote a long letter to you on 7th Sept so shall tell you what I've done since.<br/><u>Thursday</u> went to Kew Gardens, they are most perfect, of course we did not go all over them, they are huge. Anyhow we spent 3 or 4 hrs &amp; thoroughly enjoyed them. The flowers magnificent, the coloring so different from the Egyptian &ndash; the lovely soft pink, blue &amp; heliotrope &amp; the lawn the most beautiful soft, bright green &amp; the trees</p>
