 There is a cemetery in the making here fenced in with barbed wire.  It is filling up far too fast.  Every day I see fresh mounds.  One of my mates lies here a wooden cross on his  head  grave.  Poor Harry  I saw him alive & well just after we crossed the Jordan River.  This place is called [Rornar ?] and is about a mile outside Damascus.  150 Turkish officers are billeted in a house here with a Tommy guard.

    About 100 of us are taken to a small Rly Stn per motor ambulances.   Written  on a notice board on the platforms in chalk is the legend. "Captured by the 4th Regt ALH"  We are stacked in covered trucks (similar to  our C wagons) & we steam out about 10.30 am.  We are a mixed crowd. Auzzies Tommies
