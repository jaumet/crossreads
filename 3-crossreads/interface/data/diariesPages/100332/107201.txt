the narrow streets. Dunkirk is a large place, what so far I have seen of it, we kept going, passing here there houses shops which had been bombed hit by shells, we made towards the Docks passing over several swing bridges over Canal's, we came across the Ausie Supply Depot met several Ausie A.S.C. boys after a chat we were all invited to come back at 12 noon have Dinner with them. We promised them we would return having about 45? to spare we continued on until we came to another Wharf were we could see a number of Sea Planes on a Wharf. We stayed there watching the Tugs Steamers passing to fro sitting on a beam in the Sun which was nice warm we enjoyed it. At 11.45 am we started to trace our steps back to the Supply Depot after a chat we all adjourned in for a splendid dinner. The A.S.C. boys made us very welcome, their quarters are in a Tobbaco Factory which is not used now, on the ground floor were the Mess Tables are is rows of Sand Bags separating one portion from the other for to stop Bomb splinters in case one come through the building, their sleeping quarters are very comfortable they are all looking well happy. After staying there for about 1 hour we thanked them for their kindness left our Heavy Coats there we started on a tour of the Docks up towards the Pier,
