<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>Yesterday was my birthday. After a long hot ride by myself I joined up the Battalion delighted to be back with them.  On my arrival I got 2 cables, one from you approving my promotion &amp; one from home with birthday greetings. I was also informed that I had been mentioned in despatches. I don't know what it was for quite but it is very nice to know that someone thinks your job is being decently done.</p>
<p>The Bri is out of the line training again. Everyone is working hard. the weather is awfully hot. the night &ndash; the dark part of it &ndash; lasts from about 9.30 pm till 3.30 AM. It is a marvellous climate. The grass everywhere is up to your knees.</p>
<p>I am at present 2nd in Command &amp; find plenty to do. The Colonel is commdg Brigade temporarily.</p>
<p>What a poor letter, am very fit</p>
<p>Cheerio. Best Love</p>
<p>Yours affectionately<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
