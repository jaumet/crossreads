<p>Not quite so cold &ndash; Had a good sleep during the day &ndash; Very busy during the night &ndash; Fritz put up a very heavy barrage of shrapnel &amp; Gas shells over Needle &amp; Rose trenches &ndash; good many 32nd Batt were caught in the Gas &ndash; poor devils did suffer &ndash; an Officer died from effects during the night. Heavy bombardment all along the line.</p>
<p>Friday  16/2/17</p>
<p>Not quite so cold &ndash; a bit of a thaw set in &amp; it is getting a bit muddy. About daylight Fritz managed to bomb one of our ammunition dumps about 2 miles away &ndash; such a deafening noise of the shells exploding all day long I have never heard before &ndash; the sky was left black with clouds from the bursts &ndash; must have been a very big loss. Our planes got busy during the day &ndash; saw two Fritzs planes brought down, also two of ours, poor devils were burnt to death. A few more gassed cases came through, only a few wounded.</p>
