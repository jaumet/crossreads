<p>Amid new surroundings it is ever pleasing to feel that we take with us to all places much that is not altered by environment; the wind itself with all its memories, and - as we suggested the other day in a Caf&eacute;, - the stomach with its likes &amp; dislikes, are in Africa just what they were in Australia. And this morning brings with it that same feeling of sacredness, of quietness of soul, and of confident peace <strike>th</strike> as have been enjoyed in times past. It is Sunday, and the occasional intimation from shore of the bells ringing is quite sufficient to recall a whole mass of recollections. As we wait on deck for what the day will bring forth, our thoughts grow calm &amp; reflective, and we feel happy, intensely to think of the heritage that is <u>hours</u> ours.</p>
<p>We are fair dinkum soldiers now, strong and bright &amp; full of hope and eager for service and so whatever the Vol I may be, this Vol II is the diary of real soldier's life; a life set on one purpose, and that to resist the king's enemies at all cost. May it be used to good purpose.</p>
