 Xmas Day 
 Dear Mrs. Robertson 
 Today is Xmas and I have been thinking about people in Australia, including you and John &amp; little John Brindley. 
 We have got a few days off for Xmas, so I am writing from my head Quarters once more:  it becomes very hard to write decent letters when training, as if one tries to keep up with the book work at night, your head starts to buzz round in time:  however it is easier for me now that I am beginning to know a few facts to start on. 
 Stewart Bowman is at Lark Hill near Salisbury.  I have not seen him but he is in London just at present staying with the Whites, of Merton (which I believe is near Musswellbrook [Muswellbrook]). 
 I would like to have seen him but have been settled a bit today &amp; yesterday with a bad throat, which made turkey &amp; plum pudding so near yet so far, as it wouldn't go down. 
 I suppose you will leave Toganmain for the summer and make off somewhere during the hot weather:  if I remember rightly you always stayed at home over Xmas in order to avoid travelling among the mass or common herd during the holiday trips.
