<p>To see some of our friends about shortly &ndash; How I wish this cruel war was ended. It will be dreadful up here in the winter for the soldiers.</p>
<p>Fancy   <strike>in the four years</strike>  in the forth year of war. I did not think I would be so long away from home.<br/>So pleased to hear about the Dividend. Let me know how much money in the Bank. I should think  that would be a nice little sum for a holiday. Have plenty to go on with   &amp;  shall certainly spend all I want to but still the poor boys as privates cannot get money  so are glad to get a few cigs.</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  kisses<br/>Edith</p>
