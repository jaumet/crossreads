<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>At last another mail has come in; a real big one too; bringing eight letters from home with dates from 14th Sept to one from Father from Sydney on 10th October. It was rather funny. I was just reading the part of your letter where you were giving me Chris and Harolds address and telling me they had come over here, when I heard somebody asking for Wilson and I looked up and there was Harold Thomas. He had been sent here with gastritis (if thats how you spell it), but did not look too bad on it. Chris is up at Richon in the 3rd I think - C Sqdn of the 3rd is the Tasmanian unit here. I wonder what he will think of the rain up there - he&#39;ll see as much there in three months as he would in a year in Tassy and he&#39;ll have to learn to thieve pretty well, before he can get a decent bivvy together. It is very wonderful how you can pick new reinforcements, as man must change very quickly over here; because a new chap is as easy to pick as an emigrant on a station for the first time. They alwas look so fresh and soft but of course they soon loose that, especially if there is as stunt on. Of course we were all the same but a person does not realise what a new chum he was, till he sees other new chaps.</p>
