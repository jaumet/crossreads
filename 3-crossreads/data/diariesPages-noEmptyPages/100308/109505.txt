4/5/17  L?Homme Mort
The A/Staff Captain of the 22nd Bde. made a personal reconnaissance of the position in front and found very few of our people in the Bullecourt line. There can only be a few Boche there. Our fellows have established strong posts and are bombing down to meet the Devons who are supposed to be going along to them. The vague idea the H.Q. of these people possess of what is being done is wonderful contrast to the energy of the Australians. If they don't know at Bde HQ what is doing the Coys. must know damn all. Tonight a most elaborate mess. Dishes wonderfully cooked, cauliflower the like luxuries. Iced sweets. Port wine coffee bon bons etc. served by men who are waiters for all their khaki uniforms. Hunt came back from Q.M. with story that our ration strength is only 236. Griffen and others killed. There will soon be none of us old heads left alive if this keeps up Tonight our heavies will strafe the trench behind Bullecourt and obliterate it. Warm summer evening.
