to walk down one of London's streets, with names that we have always known to ride on a modern Bus, past Westminster Abbey, to feed the pigeons of St. Pauls, to look at Big Ben but not hear him for bells would be a sure guide to Zeppelins, the Tower of London, the Tower Bridge, & old Father Thames, slipping quietly under the piers carring his soiled waters out to ^be cleansed in the ocean.
   I walked in the Mall & saw the Grenadier Guards parade & relieve the Royal Guard passed Whitehall & opposite stood the Horse Guards with their Guard, two mounted men & one on foot, standing horses & men stiffly as marble but coloured most gorgeously.
   Hyde Park, Marlborough House, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Somerset House, Scotland Yard, The Bank of England The Inns of Court, Old Bailey & may another famous place was passed sometimes rapidly on top of a bus & sometimes more minutely, making as careful an inspection as time would allow.
