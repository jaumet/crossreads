<p>One can't write too much in letters but will tell you a lot when I come home.</p>
<p>I was very pleased to hear you got some rain down your way.  You have had a bad time lately, but this rain should ensure a good lambing.  How are those Jackaroos getting on.  I'm glad they are learning to dance, but can imagine the bad time your feet are getting.  Old Mac seems to be having a bad time with all those designing females persuing him.  I had a long yarn with Dr. Norman Robertson the other day.  He is with the 1st L.H. Field Ambulance.  Whisky Dawson has just joined our F.A.  I have just managed to land a case of beer &amp; streams of 'low boys' are on the way to my tent.  There'll be dirty work at the crossroads tonight.</p>
<p>Best love to  you, John, Graham, Mr. Mack</p>
