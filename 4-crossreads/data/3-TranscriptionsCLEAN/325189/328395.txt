 a communication trench all day & a dug out for a cobber & myself.  Relieved men in the firing line at night & stayed there till 8 a.m. next morning.  During night Turks played our bugle calls & advanced with cries of 'Allah' .  We heard we did much slaughter.  I was alongside one of our guns & when it went off it  through  threw earth all over us & nearly deafened us.  I thought at first a shell had dropped in front of us.
