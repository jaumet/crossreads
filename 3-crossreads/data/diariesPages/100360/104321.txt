Thur. 7. Last night we had a fire in the Tent which made things much warmer. Break. was very light. The M.O. came round about 11.30. Told him I was well enough to rejoin my unit, if only I could get a pair of Boots & a few other articles of attire, so he told the Orderly to attend to it. After Dinner went to Q.M.
