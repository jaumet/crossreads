<p>new landing was effected higher up the Peninsular.</p>
<p>Friday 13th August<br/>I was feeling bad again to-day I was not too well yesterday. Last night it was very oppressive and added to this was the odour of the dead blowing over from the trenches on our front. Heaps of dead men are visible all over the Country Side to the left of our position. I felt very weak coming to and from the stores back to our line.</p>
<p>Saturday 14th August<br/>Still oppressive weather. It was quiet up till fairly late. A few shells were poured on to our beach by Baechy Bill who we thought had forgotten our existence by his attention having attracted by the attack on the left. It has been a few days since we heard from him. I was a little better today after some cornflower and milk</p>
