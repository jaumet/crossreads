"Niagara falls; also "fleas" Jack Lees. Divisional Order at noon gave all the new Battalion commanders right up to the 60th. After lunch walked right round the outposts with Curnow, very warm in the sun. The view from the groups of No. 1 picquet is remarkable embracing about 10 miles, - as far as the eye can see are sandhills and sand like a great sea. This group has a telescope and commands the whole scene. Observed here that the small parralel tracks thought to be caused by lizards are in reality those of black beetles whose legs lie almost flat on the sand so they can get along easily. A disposition of Providence that enables them to cover far more ground than the ordinary beetle could with its feet.
Proposed in view of the big success of last sports to have others the officers donating one days pay to provide the prize money. Spiller introduced to mess for the first time, we are a happy family. Plenty of rag time music down the lines with the harmonium Peart brought out. Our band now at Staging Camp and waiting removal so shall make them march out tomorrow and collect their instruments. A small mail today - two or three papers and letters.
27/2/16Being Sunday slept in, church parade at 0930 with rifles. A windy unpleasant day, developed a temperature so missed lunch and slept during the afternoon. Later with Bert Curnow watched a few sports events and then a football march. Went round outposts and found all quiet except for reported movement on 24th front and which an Indian patrol went out after. The groups withdrawn to their night positions too early it was quite daylight they should wait until dark. Reported tonight 2nd Div. is off to France inside a fortnight.
