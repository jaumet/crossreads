I saw for the first time in France, the old fashioned windmill, with its enormous wings, I discovered afterwards, that it was in reality a flour mill, quite a novel affair. A large number of these peculiar windmills together makes it a curious and interesting sight.
The peasants in France do not treat their dogs like pets, not exactly; they are pet and worker combined!. To see a number of these large dogs of a shaggy nature harnessed up to a queer liliputian kind of rough waggon, containing the French peasant is novel.
Another queer sight I saw was a large rough dog standing in the rim of a large revolving wheel, propelled by the dog itself. As the dog propelled this wheel by "his feet" movements, the wheel slowly turned, that wheel was a part of the machinery of a churning implement.
The French farmers do not prepare their land as the farmers in Australia do, their methods are ancient & of a crude nature Their fields are small, it is a common sight
