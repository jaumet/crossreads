Friday 10 Nov. 1916Again a perfect day with a clear cloudless sky & warm sunshine, which, like yesterday was most appreciated by all. The mud was still very bad but is slowly drying up : if only the weather continues good the ground will enable a fresh push to be made. Was up at 4 a.m. to go up the line with the General, & as the moon was full & the sky clear going was quite good. Only went to Bn. H.Q. & reached home abt. 6.30. Much aerial activity  during the day, at least 1 German being brought down in flames.
