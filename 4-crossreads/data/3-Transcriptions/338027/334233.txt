<p>Monday, 30 August, 1915<br/>Suffering a good deal through the poisoning, every morn one stretcher squad has to go to the beach to bring up rations &amp; water by means of Indian mule convoys.</p>
<p>The Turks must have a new gun for they simply poured shrapnel on to the beach and into the sap all day with the result that in our convoy five mules were killed &amp; a lot wounded as well as two of the Indians our men escaped it is remarkable the intelligence these mules show, the remainder of the convoy immediately took cover under the bank of the sap but we lost our stores till evening &amp; about dusk eleven more mules were killed as they were tethered on the lines.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 31 August, 1915<br/>Well, I have joined the long list of dysentery patients, it has a fair grip on me now I felt very weak all day but managed to get through the days work.</p>
<p>We rec another bag of mail part of our last mail &amp; I got three letters.</p>
<p>There was another attack during the night on the left flank &ndash; the gun that is putting the shrapnel over us cannot be located yet it is surmised that it is a disappearing one run on wheels.  An order has come that we have to evacuate our position here &amp; take up another somewhere else, this is what we might have expected as soon as we were comfortable.</p>
