<p>Tuesday Aug 21<br/>Moving baggage to Camp some 2 miles from Railway. Built our Bivvy Tom &amp; I went to bed tired out. During evening heard Artillery in action. My first experience of hearing the guns.<br/>Wednesday Aug22<br/>Luck was in today. Four men told off for duty at Marakat Rest Camp while unit resting out of the line.<br/>Bert F. A Mc [indecipherable] &amp; myself the lucky four. Rode from Sheik Naran to Marakat on our Camels a distance of about 6 miles across sand principally with occasional orchards on route. Marakat rest camp is facing Mediterranean. On arrival we were to take the place of four Scottish Horse chaps who were to return to their unit. They left a good bivvy facing the water in nice clean sand &amp; sheltered from wind.</p>
