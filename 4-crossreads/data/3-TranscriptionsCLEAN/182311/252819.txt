My Dear People,
   Again we've been into the trenches, and again too am I out in billets, this time staying in a house in the main street of a town near the trenches - the house is a nice one, previously occupied by a doctor and now bare of most of its furniture, but there are a few deep spring mattresses and on one of them I have spread my valise and sleep warm at nights, it is a rest after the eventful days in the trenches, and this time it has been particularly eventful.  I'm absolutely itching to tell you the whole story of an exciting time that we had, but unfortunately cannot, honour bright, you know.  However, I spent three nights in succession in N.M.L.No Mans Land, the first reconnoitering Fritz's wire and the space between trenches, the second on a ^raiding job with some men, whom I brought safely home after trouble-some times and dangerous too - though not achieving the whole of the purpose for which sent out I did a good job and was told that my work was best of eight ^parties.  The following night I again went out, this time under the General's instructions, to try and aid a party which had come to grief.  I could only find one wounded man, nearly dead too from exposure but the Brigadier was very pleased and said nice things to the C.O. about me next day.  I felt rewarded too, for all that I had done, just by the sigh of relief when we picked this poor lad
