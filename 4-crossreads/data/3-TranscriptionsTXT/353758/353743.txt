 7/6/15 Arrived at Alexandria and was sent to Egyptian Government hospital there. 
 Above is a copy of short notes I made in my notebook from time to time but I have had to leave out a bit here and there. I got your letter with &pound;1 thanks very much. Also letters from Agnes Mirian [Miriam]. I expect to be out of there in a few days back in fighting again inside of a fortnight. 
 I have been remarkably lucky so far having had very close shaves times out of number. There is a lot of luck in it chaps have been shot dead right alongside of me but I have escaped so far. However there is a very long way to go yet. The Australian and New Zealand troops have done very well. Tell them all to write to me and let me know the news. 
 With love to all 
 Letter from Pvt Frank Makinson A Coy 13th Batt to his mother Mrs J. F. Makinson Neutral Bay
