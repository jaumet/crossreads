Ypres where we went into billets in the Cellars under the Hospital near the big town square on the opposite side of the square to where we were was the ruins of the Cloth Hall Cathedral I went had a look next day I don't think there was a complete House in the whole town Thousands of shells must have been thrown into the place to do such a lot of damage I also noticed signs up that so many men of different Battalions were buried under the ruins of different houses where men had gone into cellars for shelter from the shells then the Houses would get hit all be buried, 
The place where we went into the Trenches after a long march up was quite near to the Germans about 40 yards only that it was very wet we had not much shell fire as we were too near the Hans for shell fire as they might easily have put the shells into their own trenches as ours, so we did not loose many men there only from "Rum jars" which were fired at us about a 150 yards off came down with an awful noise, then there were the mininwerfer which buried itself about 14 feet then exploded with a terrific roar, one had to keep your eyes ears open there to escape certain death, one poor chaps head was split open with concussion like as if he had been chopped into with an axe, (a man named Wallace), 
After we got out of there we went back to Ypres into the Cavalry Barracks after a few days spell we again came into the trenches but this time we went into another lot of trenches (the supports) our job there was to carry up rations etc at night time as it was very wet muddy we had an awful job each night from when it grew dark to about 4 am in the morning as after we had done about 8 journeys with rations we had to dig trenches out where they had been blown in with shell fire do repairs generally to the duck board tracks, it was while we were there that I was sent with 4 men to bring in the rum for the Battalion, so as soon as it was dark, we set off for Ypres to the Head Quarters
