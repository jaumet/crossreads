 Are making hay while the sun shines. 
 Sid Moss, a chap from the 13  th   M.G. have chummed up. We left the Sailors home at 7.45 a.m. had a breakfast & went & played billiards & drank beer till lunch time. We then went & sent a wire to Sids people at Gibraltar for 5. 
 After that we took a ride on hired bikes about 3 miles out, at a wayside pub we patronised with the Maltese. 
 I took photos of the mob & gave out "picture cards" to a lot of school kiddies. On the way back all went well till we were nearly home, then Sid ran into a donkey & almost immediately after, into am[?] 
 There was a terrible mix up. The police took a whole host of names. It cost us a stollar[?] between us to square matters. 
 Slept at "Hotel De France" Valletta.
