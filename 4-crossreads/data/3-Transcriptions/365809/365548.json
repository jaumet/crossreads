<p>Cowardice, when men hop out the night before an attack, and stay away a week or a month till their money goes, and then come back. I am afraid I must bore you, but I should like to tell you of three cases which came through my hands together. X was just such a case as the one I have mentioned &ndash; always a bad soldier and shirker and cleared out on the evening of the 6th June, an hour before his company went up to the trenches. X and Y were both through the Messines stunt one of them was buried, and the other stunned, by shells</p>
