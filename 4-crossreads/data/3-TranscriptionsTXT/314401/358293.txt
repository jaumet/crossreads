To dive &amp; then to find the lifting gear wont work, with refreshments &amp; air to last several hours with no prospect of release wd. surely be the utmost refinement of torture that even hell itself could find. Kipling wrote "If blood be the price of admirally good God, we ha' paid in full", and I am realising the truth of it now. We are taking in 1200 tons of coal but this we finish by midnight putting it away at the magnificent rate of 210 tons an hour. We have not had a single quarter deck Sunday service since we left Sydney. It has not been possible, &amp; up here in this torrid heat without awnings we cannot possibly keep the men for more than five minutes. I have  suggested to the Admiral that we might have the service just in the half hour of twilight in the evening. He seemed to like the idea.

The Berrima is astern of us with about 600 troops, followed by the Encounter.
