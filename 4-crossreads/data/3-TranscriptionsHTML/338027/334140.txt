<p>Thursday, 25 February, 1915<br/>Exercised horses in the morning riding one &amp; leading one, over all sorts of rough country, on one occasion we had to dismount and lead our horses over a 3 feet bridge without a rail, if we are not all good rough riders by the time we get back it is not our fault.</p>
<p>I was vaccinated again to-day it is the 3rd time without [indecipherable].</p>
<p>Cleaned and [indecipherable] saddlery in the p.m.</p>
<p>According to newspapers sent the Austs. Have had bad reports  circulated about them it is greatly exaggerated although there are a few blk sheep among 50,000 men.</p>
<p>Friday, 26 February, 1915<br/>Our big day in the week with divisional all day sham fight.  The NZ Mounted Rifles had been out bivouacking for 4 days and were returning to the camp &amp; we had to stop them from crossing the canal at [indecipherable].  We erected our clearing hospital near the canal, &amp; the horses were picketed and feeding with their saddles off, whilst we were at dinner, when an alarm came to retreat and we had every thing packed in the waggon, tent &amp; all &amp; horses harnessed and saddled in 11 mins, 9 mins faster than regulation time.  When we returned to camp, the Col. Complimented us on our days work.</p>
<p>Pay night &amp; badly needed.  I got paid 97 &frac12; piastres.</p>
