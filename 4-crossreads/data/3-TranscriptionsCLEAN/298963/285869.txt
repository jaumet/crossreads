to move in bed a nurse comes flying up with a lecture against making beds untidy.  I'll be glad to get away from here if ever a man was glad to get away from anywhere.
This morning there was a big O.C's inspection, orderlies grafted like trojans, nurses flew about excitedly & while we wondered what was doing.  Before long we found out "Ward - atten-shun!" roaded a voice then the Sgt. Mjor. stepped inside - polished up to the nines.
Then came a procession which I shall never forget, if I live to be 1000 years old.
