<p>This afternoon I went up a little further with the I.O. and a small party of men to look over the new position we are taking over tonight.  We lost our way slightly and had an exciting run over shell holes to avoid the shells hurled at us by the thoughtful Fritz.  Noone was injured though and we reached our position safely.</p>
