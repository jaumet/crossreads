<p>This was the place you will remember where the Ambulance was billeted before the big Advance.  Our packs were stored there, &amp; I had a few necessary articles in mine that I required. I had a good many miles to walk, &amp; the souvenirs that I was carrying with me (three German Gas Helmets, two water bottles &amp; a Fritz Haversack) soon became heavy, but, the thought of what was in front of me - fourteen days of cleanliness &amp; comfort, kept me in good spirits &amp; I did not notice the long walk. Now &amp; again I obtained a lift in a lorry or ambulance car, part of the journey was done in a staff car. Eventually I arrived at the Wood at 11 p.m., looking very disreputable after the long dusty trip, &amp; after living in dugouts for the last 10 days.  Slept in a lorry for the night, &amp; naturally I slept very little, excitement I suppose was the cause of this. Very shortly after daybreak I secured my pack etc., &amp; then looked round for some breakfast. An American aerodrome was situated nearby &amp; at 6 a.m. I butted my frame in there &amp; obtained some breakfast. Felt much better after a good hot drink etc. then I started off on the road again. This time for the Leave train, in &amp; out of lorries again, &amp; luckily I arrived at the station five minutes before the train started.  It was relief to be in the train &amp; to know, that I was well on my way at last.</p>
