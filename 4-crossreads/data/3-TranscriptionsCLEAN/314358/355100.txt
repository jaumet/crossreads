  
 My regret at being prisoned in this camp during Xmas holidays is greater than I care to tell, for I had so counted on freedom I had hoped to be a giant for a few days However matters could be worse that is a lesson one learns at the front Often I pull myself up with that 'it could be worse' Yes indeed, and what a hairs-breadth of a difference would have made it worse It is food to even be spending Xmas in a chilly depressing camp. It could have been a great deal worse. I was pleased the other day to get Jacks cable saying all were well. What a long time it was in reaching me. It was good of him to be so splendid for the news has cheered me up; especially as I have had no letters Dont think I allow myself to get depressed. That would be foolish. I have great faith in coming out right someday in spite of a peculiar nature which needs much control. The awful waste of time annoys me most in this game
