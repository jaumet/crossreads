Then the process would be repeated, only this time the turning would be to the left; and so on, with many stops, we finally reached the bottom, and a fair road, but not before the pole of the Water Cart had been broken, one Sand cart dislodged from its bed, and the coupling work of our rear limber broken and the limber and its contents launched almost into the Wadi, alongside the road.
