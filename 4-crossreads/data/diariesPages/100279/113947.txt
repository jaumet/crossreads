A most peculiar thing happened this afternoon in full view of us all Lieut Rowbottom of D.Coy hopped out of the trench and deliberately walked towards the German trenches they were only 80 yards apart, when he got half way over he stopped picked up a German rifle, then the expected happened for a rifle crack rang out but he missed him Rowbottom signalled a washout, then another crack Rowbottom spun round like a top collapsed, by this time nearly every man in the trenches was looking on, the next thing we saw was 2 of our stretcher bearers hop out with a stretcher 2 little white flags go over towards Rowbottom, we all held our breaths for it was a very daring thing to do for you all know what a rotten name the Germans
