The Quest of LoveMy sleeping comrades never stirred,For there had been no call to arms.Still round the heights the battle rangYet not that woke me, but a birdThat somewhere sang.
To hear him sing made me forgetWhy I lay here and all such things.Straightway I felt the wind that blew.I saw the scattered clouds that letThe stars shine through.
A flame felled all the sky!    &amp;  then,As swift, died out.  But I had seenThe low black bushes on the hill.The men that stirred in pain, the menThat lay so still.
At last the gun crashed.  Then for longThe night was vivid with the light,And shaken with the roar of guns.And yet I heard a bird's clear songRing through it once
I saw he moving on the slope.At each form fearfully she kneltAnd looked intently on the face.Then on she went again, and hopeMade swift her pace.
