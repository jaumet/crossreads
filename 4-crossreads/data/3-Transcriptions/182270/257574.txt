<p>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Lopped in Top paddock &amp;</p>
<p>Mountain, and then rode round</p>
<p>Boundary &amp; Wheelers. Cut my foot</p>
<p>a bit with the tomahawk in Mountain</p>
<p>Tickle drawing water for the bore.</p>
<p>Darby started work but his tools</p>
<p>were all done up wrong &amp; he had</p>
<p>to send one bit back again.</p>
