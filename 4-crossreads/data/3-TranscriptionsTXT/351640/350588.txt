just looking comfortable.  Jerrom the heaviest of all rode a small donkey. I did not think that the little beast could carry the weight but he did, & came home quite friskily.  The guide & one of the girls, sometimes two of the girls rode the camels.  We went past the great pyramids, posing for a group photograph alongside the Sphynx.  Should it come out well you will receive a copy.The donkeys heads were turned eastward along the line where the sands of the Libyian [Lybian] dessert, (just beneath the plateau of the same dessert), and the fertile lands meet; at times we got on to the lucern patches.
