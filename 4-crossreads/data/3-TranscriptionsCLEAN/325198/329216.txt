Had a good time in town and got home very much after hours. J Woods Stevens and Hughes returned on [indecipherable]  Joe & Steve are in the troop but Hughes is [indecipherable] it hard to get in.  It is all drill & there is a great getting together of gear & a route march on Tuesday.  I think we must be getting away very soon.Later  I took a walk up to Maadi & went into the Soldiers Club. It was run by the folk of Maadi. One can get a cup of tea & two pieces of bread & butter for 1 Piastre - They are good folk; give all their time & just run it for the benefit of the Soldiers
