1916   SUNDAY 13   FEB.
Fine. We all went out for a launch picnic in afternoon up the Lane Cove river. Mr Lloyd hired a launch & we left about 2 oclock, picking up about a dozen more people between here & Milson's Point. We had tea just above Fig Tree bridge &  went up about a couple of miles further after tea. Linda, Jo, Miss Nichol & Self sat on roof coming home. Went back to camp at night.
