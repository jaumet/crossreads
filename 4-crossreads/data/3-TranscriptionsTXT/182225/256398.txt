 1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 6 &nbsp; OCTOBER 
 Raining all day and its very miserable weather altogether. With the signalers&nbsp;in the morning. The signalers race was run off in the aftrenoon &amp; the 27 th &nbsp;Battery won it. We were the only ones that got the message through. Poss, Bill &amp; I went to the pictures in evening &amp; they were about the worst show I have seen here. Got a pair of socks from Coomoo Coomoo &amp; a letter from Linda.
