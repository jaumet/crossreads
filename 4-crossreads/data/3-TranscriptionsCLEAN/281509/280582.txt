We are all let off fatigue as a great concession.  Get dinner of mince & carrot, with plum pudding & custard.  We supplement with tin fruit, tin plum pudding & cream.  Called up for duty at 5p.m. on evacuation.  Several wounded brought down, extra activity to celebrate the day, No less than 4 poor fellows die within hour in dressing room.  Thus was Xmas spent.
