  
 I have not received your Xmas parcel yet. Hope it comes before I get another move. 
 Think I told you in my last that I heard from Fred   &  he is well. 
 Have not heard anything of J.C. so am not thinking any more about it. Have decided that >u>that  little Affair is  ended. Tell people it is all over   &  that I made a mistake.  Such is life . 
 Fondest love   &  kisses to you all. I must get my report written now. How sad poor Sarah's death was, still she did not suffer long   &  that is a blessing. Hope you are all well   &  happy   &  having a good time. 
 From Edith
