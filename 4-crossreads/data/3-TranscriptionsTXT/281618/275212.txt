Every sort of jabber imaginable until a couple of leopards started a sing song in the gully just behind us. The silence broken only by the hurried departure of various monkeys. There are three dreaded man eaters on this mountain  the mamba &ndash; a poisonous tree snake, very ferocious, the Cameroon Ape, a grey side whiskered party who is harmless enough by day but a terror by night &amp; the black leopard. The latter are numerous &amp; with the muskcat are the only dangerous felines nearer than Koro. Lincoln refloated. 2nd  Returned to ship to remove baggage. M Gr's commandeered to handle cargo. Ship leaking badly &amp; no good as troopship. She is to run to Gib to repair &amp; we know her no more. 3rd  Finally abandon the Lincoln &amp; returned to the Mountain.  Used my nut this time &amp; gave nigger 9d to carry my worldly goods. [indecipherable] Brit. W. I Regt Mt Aureol [indecipherable] Freetown
