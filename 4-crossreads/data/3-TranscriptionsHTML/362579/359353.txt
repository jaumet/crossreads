<p>awfully  quiet for us after being with all our friends fo so long. We are getting on alright with these Sisters too, so am rather lucky again to meet such a nice crowd.</p>
<p>Had a game of Tennis this week. The C.C.C. next door has one, so were were invited. Had a rather good game too, played fairly well.</p>
<p>The weather is really perfect   &amp;  the country beautiful.</p>
<p>The work here is very easy so we are having a good rest. Yesterday we had a glorious trip, quite unexpected pleasure</p>
