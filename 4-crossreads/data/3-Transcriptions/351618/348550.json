<p>Lieut Archie Raymondo is now posted to our Battery and looks well. He was previously acting as transport officer. Lieut Richards is officer in charge of one of our guns &ndash; a real good sort. Capt Crisp of the 9th Battery was transferred to gun Battery in place of Capt Leslie dead. Lieut Urquhart has gone back to Alexandria &ndash; a wreck &ndash; enough said. Lieut Hodgens has come over from Alexandria &amp; Lieut Ross is still at No 3 gun. Our Major (Gus Hughes) is not well and looks as if he wants a good rest from his responsibilities. Sergt Major Handsford is still the same old customer.</p>
<p>Capt Dr Marks is much thinner than when we left Mena.</p>
<p>Weary Willie the name we call one of the guns of the enemy commenced to shell the beach again to-day. The shells have a weary kind of shrieking sound &ndash; hence the name</p>
