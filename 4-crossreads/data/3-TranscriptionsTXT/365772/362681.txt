I am quite recovered from my slight illness, only had a few days in hosp.We are having terribly cold weather here now the wind freezes a man when it whistles down the trench. You should see my dugout, I share it with another Sergt, it is right under the firing line, only one fault it is too dark only have a thin shaft up to the top for air
