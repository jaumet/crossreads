The school was split up into three squads A -B & C. The A squad being the highest. Hop chose B squad but transferred later on to A Squad. The work was very tiresome & began at 6.00 get up &get up it was as we soon found out. Parade till 7.45 wagging flags on elementary signals. Parade. 9.15 to 12 noon more flag wagging & an occasional lecture that dealt with Regimental Signallers only - Divisional Signallers evidently did not require instruction there.
