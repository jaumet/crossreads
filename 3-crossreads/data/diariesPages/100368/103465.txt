duck in a pond is no more. During the recent storm she got stranded. One felt that they had lost a friend in losing little "Gabe".

Nov 2nd Tues.
Sea very calm. Evacuated early this morning. Mellow autumn is at hand. Even a wintry touch is in the air, enhanced by the appearance and chirping of little robin red breast. I took some interest in this little bird as it flitted about the scrub on the hillside. There were so few birds to be seen here. Pointing the little bird out to another chap I had no sooner done so than he made a dive for a stone and threw it at the bird. Here was I mentally picturing a little pleasure in seeing little robin red breast, and the other, he seemed to see nothing else but to throw a stone at it. A contrast in the point of view of looking at one and the same thing, by different individuals.

Nov 3rd Wed.
Sea calm. Sun hot during the day.

No 1 Stationary Hospital arrived during the night time. One of the members got knocked by a bullet in the eye as he was coming ashore. No 1 Stationary are putting up a hospital just below us. Owing to the sun being so hot and the enticing appearance of the calm blue sea a number of men took it into their heads to have a dip in the briny. They had not long entered when Johnny Turk must have seen them, for he dropped a few shrapnel perilously near. Luckily none of the men were injured
