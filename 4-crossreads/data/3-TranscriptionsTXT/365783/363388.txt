No. 2 General HospitalMena CairoEgypt.   7.3.15.Dearest old Mrs,Since writing last nothing very much has happened.  I have not yet had any letters either from you or from the Coolabah folk.  I have been wondering how you have been fixed up since your arrival in London - whether you have gone to the Miss Ford sort of establishment, a hotel or whether you are comfortably ensconsed in a nice little out of town cottage.   I hope it is the latter - I know it is what I would prefer more especially as it will be so much nicer for the children.   We get very little news of the outside world here, I have seen nothing about what short of a winter they have had in England - I hope it has not been too cold & that you have not had any of those beastly chilblains - I can tell you it is pretty [indecipherable] chill here at night time I think I told you some time ago that my new watch had gone bung on me - well I could not get it to go & didn't like to trust it with any of the nigger watchmakers so put it by.    I came across it to day & was agreeably surprised to find that it was on the move again.
