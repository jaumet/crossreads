No. 21 Camp, Larkhill,18th. October 1916.
My dear Parents.Just a short line to let you know I am well and still in England. I received your cable three days ago and had a few day previously Cabled for ten pounds to be sent to theCommonwealth Bank in London.I was very glad to hear that you received the snaps and thought them good. Unfortunately I will not be able to take my camera to France with me so I will probably have to post it to you shortly. I succeeded a few days ago in securing some rather good pictures of an aeroplane and will enclose them with my next letter.Half of our Battalion have already had their final King's leave and I am to go with the remainder in a few days. We got four days in all and before we leave each man is required to show at least four pounds. Unfortunately I hadn't succeeded in saving any of my pay so I sent the cable.I received a pair of gloves yesterday addressed in Kits inimitable style and they were more than welcome. The cold here now is intense and my hands were beginning to chap. I received a letter from mother yesterday. Excuse brevity - have just heard that mail closes at 1 O'clock but as there will be another on the 21st Inst. I will write again shortly.With love, Eugene.
