<p>Tuesday Nov 27<br/>All troops when on leave in Towns to be armed. Numerous spies still about. Several have been caught signalling &amp; directing enemy Artillery from roofs of houses. Air raid through night.<br/>Wednesday Nov 28<br/>Jacko bombed Jaffa today No Anti Air Craft guns here yet. Jacko knew this &amp; flew low. He bombed the town systematically killing Jews &amp; Bedouins &amp; by some strange coincidence did not get one soldier although the Town was full. Jaffa is situated on the coast of the Mediterranean &amp; built right down to the Waters edge. It has a fine beach for surfing</p>
