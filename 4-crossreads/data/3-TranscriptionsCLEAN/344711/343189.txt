  
 we watched the Sunday evening traffic over the bridge.  There were carriages and pairs, dog-carts with fine looking horses, motor cars, taxi cabs, donkeys, camels, and now & then a native bus, drawn by three sorry-looking mules.  There would come a donkey-cart driven by an Arab, who generally had five or six women perched up behind him, generally his wives or some-one else's.  It all seems very quaint to Australian eyes. 
 On duty at Wassaa Caracol 10-7. 
 28th In Gardens most of day.  On duty at Wassaa Caracol 6 p.m.-10 p.m. 
 29th Town patrol 6 a.m.-9 a.m.  Gardens all day.  Town patrol 6 p.m., and had a very busy time, over 90 men being arrested.  As each man was brought in he was searched, and his boots were taken away, and put up on shelves in the guard room, which looked like a second-hand boot shop.  Got home about 3 a.m. dead tired. 
 30th Town patrol 1.30 p.m. till 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. till dismiss.  Pretty strenuous night.  Got home at 2 a.m.
