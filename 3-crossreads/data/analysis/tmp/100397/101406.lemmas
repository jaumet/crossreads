 But all along the line on the farm , one featur that was most notic was the absenc of men . There were a few but they were most old men , or lad too young to join the Armi . The women do the Farm work now . Some of the old farmhous are veri picturesqu with their moss cover thatch roof , some have tile roof and do not look near so nice allthough they are pretti . Befor I left Egypt I saw some of the Old hand , in the 1st Batt . but could not find out anyth about Cyril Horton , except that he was kill , I was also talk to one of the men who was in the fight at Lone Pine . From him I learn that Jack Harri was kill instantan by a shell "he was in the same station " as the I saw Alf Phillip befor I left Heliopoli , to join this Unit . I dont know whether his Regmt will come across here or not somehow I dont think they will , I dont know whether the weather is just the ordinari everyday articl or whether it has been special prepar for us , yesterday was a nice sunni spring day , Today is a dull grey winter one , cold enough for snow , Which , by the way , we saw on the hill , when come along in the Train . The first show that I have seen for mani year . After Egypt , the cold here is no joke one allmost get warm " Shiver "
