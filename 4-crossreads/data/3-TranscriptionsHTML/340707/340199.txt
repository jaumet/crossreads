<p>71<br/>&amp; to night at Restaurant Dieppe the only one I can find open. It is next to Au Petit Riche. Here I make friends with a Bank clerk from Lloyds Bank. Two French soldiers of the visiting contingent are being entertained by French party &amp; the restaurateurs. In return the soldiers sing songs &amp; one of them has an exceptionally fine voice which makes the evening pass very agreeably until <strike>1 pm</strike> 1 am when I start for last tube</p>
<p>19-7-19<br/>This is the English date for the official celebrations of the Peace There is to be a procession similar to that at Paris but this of course will be mainly English &ndash; a tribute by the British nation to the victorious heroes. For this reason, Foch would not come across thinking he might detract from Haig's triumph a thoughtful &amp; kindly act I think but is prevailed upon to come.</p>
<p>At Paris procession started 8-20 here at 10 am. At both cases it took about 2 hrs to pass. I have wonderful luck at 9 am I am in bed &amp; at 10.15 am I am looking at procession from a position that many who have waited several hours cannot better</p>
