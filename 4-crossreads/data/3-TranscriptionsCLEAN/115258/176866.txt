  
 23rd June 1918 
 Mr dear Fred 
 I'm afraid I have left it a bit late but this letter is to wish you many happy returnes of your birthday, and if the cake has not all been eaten please have another slice for me. I had to look at the watch to know what date to put on this letter, but it is the 23rd because its just a quarter after midnight. Afternoon. The mosquitoes hunted me away from the candle there, so I left this and went and sat in the moonlight where it was cooler. We are still just stopping here, not doing 'nuffink' so there is not much news to tell you. I walked round to Hqrs this morning and found a P.F.A. magazine waiting for me there but the Pastoral Review, which Mother said she posted the same day did not arrive and I was disappointed as it is the one  I  with the photographs of home in it. However in the past I have always lent my Review to Major Weir each month and he told me the other day that he was expecting one himself this mail so I'll go over and see him in a day
