 While scribbling these notes little curls of yellow smoke from Bursting Turks shells are above the Palms- All day we have been at it-  The 6th lost an officer & 2 men & we a few  but  (and) we are keeping them back. I only hope they come on & make a good fight- this endless watching gets on our nerves. Anniversary of outbreak of War, How long will it last? Had to dig fresh Wells today to water our Horses as Johnny Turk had our old ones.
