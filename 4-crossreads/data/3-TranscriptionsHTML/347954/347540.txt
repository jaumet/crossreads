<p>so that when the water covers the ground it does not wash the seed away.  We had a Kodak day at the zoo on Saturday at Gizeh.  It is a beautiful place.  Hippos, Rhinos, giraffes, lions, elephants, gamels, a great variety of deer, goat, cats, leopards, monkeys, birds, &amp; plenty of snakes.  The collection is typical African.  Also to be seen a fine collection of trees, nice green lawns, an island tea room, &amp; everything beautifully sweet &amp; clean.  I have never seen animals look better.  The cages were all as clean as it was possible for them to be kept.  In the grounds were fancy walks, grottoes, lakes &amp; bridges.  One could go every day for a week &amp; not tire of it.  I have seen some beautiful horses here;  their coats are like satin.  We have plenty of music in camp.  There is a bugle band, a Scotch bag pipe, &amp; 12 brass bands.  There is a great noise when the bugles sound the last post at night.  About 500 of them in about five minutes representing the bugles of the different companies.</p>
<p>Our stay here is to be for two months &amp; I believe by all accounts our time</p>
