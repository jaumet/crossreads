<p>Replied 4-5-17</p>
<p>Public School<br/>Lindfield<br/>1.5.1917.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Fry,<br/>It was with feelings of the deepest regret, that I read in the paper this morning of the death in action of your eldest son, Dene.</p>
<p>It seems just a few weeks ago that Dene came to wish me "Good-bye" at the School, &amp; little did I dream that it would be a "last good-bye".</p>
<p>I always had a warm affection for both your lads Dene &amp; Allan. They were so manly straightforward &amp; natural. Both have died as they lived &ndash; noble boys, "Heroes both".</p>
<p>Accept my heartfelt sympathy for you, Mrs. Fry &amp; the family in your very sad &amp; double bereavement.</p>
<p>May God in his mercy give you both strength &amp; courage to bear up against the sad blows you have received of late.</p>
<p>"Two noble lives &ndash; nobly ended". for God, King &amp; Country.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours &amp;<br/>in deepest sympathy,<br/>James Gilbert</p>
