Nickoll received a bullet through his cap &amp; the bullet grazed his head;  a good many of the lads have been scratched but not bad enough to put them out of action.  Cameron was scratched down the shin by a piece of shrapnel.  The sniper that got Lovett slightly wounded 5 men in a few minutes but they found out where he was hidden &amp; poured in a pretty warm fire where he was, &amp; we have heard nothing of him since.  I still have a rather bad cold &amp; can get no medicine for it.  Wylie Woods died this morning.
