in front of us. Passed several steamers, windjammers & small schooners. Good many birds & porpoises about. The latter look strangely weird as they slip through the water in the deepening twilight & one can only liken them to ghost like serpents. The effect is accentuated by the glittering phosphorescence of their foam splashed wake. Passed 2 cruisers & possibly a submarine during the night14th  Hot as usual rather strong undercurrents from 1 pm on. Washed towel etc. Spoke Wandilla last night. Heat abated a little Passed suddenly from disturbed to smooth glass like sea covered with an apparently oily scum.
