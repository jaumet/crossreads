  
 (Commence J.E.W.) happened no lives were lost.  Also of the peace terms held Between the Allies & Germany & full details re the Mutuny at Kiel on the German fleet.  It appears to two hospital ships we passed yesterday were the Kanowna & Karoola bound for Turkey having returned with a load of prisnors of war & by what the Port doctor told us today our prisnors of war in Constantinople had a very rough time of it & those returned were very poorly clad & were very poorly fed at Turkey.  Food beyond a bare existance was unobtainable for any money.  We hear today of the 52nd Division going to the Dardenelles & Constantinople to take over the forts & that the H.M.T. Indarra & Canberra are likely to go there in the course of a few days.  A good many restrictions are taken off here at Alexandria now, the City being formally in total darkness is now fairly well lit.  Very few ships here as the transports during the last few months did not have Alexandria as a base.  The Troops are still on board & are leaving in the morning by train to Palastine. 
 10.11.18 All troops disembarked into Lighters & left.  Discharging the remains of the cargo we shipped food stuff at Barra for Salonika.  The harbor is full of hospital ships taking prisoners of war to & from Turkey also Prisnors of war ship painted white with a blue broad band without a red cross. 
 11.11.18 News this day re the unconditionally surrender of Germany.
