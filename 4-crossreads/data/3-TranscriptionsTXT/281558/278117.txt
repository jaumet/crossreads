 Voices From Home. 
 Though I hear but tongues of a foreign people &amp; I list to sounds that are strange &amp; new Clear as a silver bell in a steeple Come voices from home so fond &amp; true I sit at times when the leaves are falling Alone with my thoughts as I sit today &amp; listen to voices from homeland calling Calling so sweetly Ah! Could I but obey 
 &amp; so there is no sting to death &amp; grave has lost its victory Tis but a crossing &ndash; with bated breath &amp; white set face &ndash; a little strip of sea To find our loved ones waiting on the shore More beautiful more precious than before
