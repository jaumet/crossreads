<p>I went to a Fancy Dress Ball last Thursday given by the W.A.A.C's.  All the Girls were in Fancy Dress but only about 40 men.  I went as a <u>Soldier</u> considering that enough as I only had 2 days notice.  I was invited by one who goes under the name of "Johnnie" Walker.  I had the opening waltz with Her &amp; No. 2 &amp; No. 3 I booked with two Girls that I knew slightly.  I only booked the three preferring to take a partner</p>
