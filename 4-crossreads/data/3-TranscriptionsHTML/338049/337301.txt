<p>Monday 1 April<br/>After comfortable trip arrived London about 8.20 a.m. Had breakfast, obtained seats for Opera. Finished morning at tailors getting tunic altered.</p>
<p>Afternoon with Bert to Hampstead Heath where the Cockneys had their Easter Monday 'alf 'oliday. Very funny &amp; peculiar. Weather wet &amp;amp. many of the holiday makers returned early.</p>
<p>Tea at Central Hall, Then to Opera Aida. Simply glorious. Absolutely the best I have ever heard.</p>
<p>Home late.</p>
