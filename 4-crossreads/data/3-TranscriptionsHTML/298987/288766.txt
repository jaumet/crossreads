<p>to Nelsons Monument &amp; back. It seems a fine busy place The beggars are a nuisance but certainly they pray for you soul while praying on your pocket Kingston looks a pretty place. Quite a hilly coast line Had a very smoth passage. The only excitement being a few pracice shots with the antsubmarine gun. Arrived London about 6 A M &amp; walked along the Embankment passed Cleopatras Neadle which has been hit by pieces from a bomb in one of the Air Raids &ndash; wonder what the men who made the Neadle would have thought of an Air Raid &ndash; There are some holes in one of the bronze <strike>Lions</strike> Sphinx from the same cause. Had breckfast Bath etc at War Chest &amp; caught train about 10 a m for Harwich. Mate met me at the Station &amp; had a motor launch from the Ganqus &amp; several Saylons in attendance so we crossed to Shotley in style. That afternoon we cycled to Penmill had tea &amp; went boateing on the muddy river for an hour or so</p>
