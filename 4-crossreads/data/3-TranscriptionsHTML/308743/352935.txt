<p>11 March 1915<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Revielle at 6.<br/>After stables the C.O. &amp; myself proceeded into Cairo &amp; had a most unenjoyable ride for it was the most unpleasant day we have had yet. We had to go to the Gov workshops whilst there I struck up an acquaintanship with a young chap who in turn invited me to tea which of course I promptly accepted. We went up into Cairo thence on to the Citidel where we picked up stores. I had a look at the Triumph &amp; superintended the alterations to same. We got back at 2 pm. Pay arrived &amp; we duly got it at 6. Another mail &amp; I got [indecipherable] 2 from Nell &amp; beauty's too. One states that she gave T Freeman a message for me so I intend to look him up. I left camp at 5.30 for Cairo to go to this Johnny's place for tea had a real tiptop time with plenty of music. Arrived back at 10.00 Bed at 11.</p>
