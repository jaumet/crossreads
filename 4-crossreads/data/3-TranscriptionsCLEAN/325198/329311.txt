  
 28 May, 1916 Hill 70 We got the stuff on the trucks yesterday & had it landed here at dinner time.  There was a great dishing out of goods during the afternoon - I was glad when I got it all fixed up, every one seemed pretty well satisfied.  Perce left for the School of instruction last night - I hope he gets on alright.  I am on guard on some timber & mats, have fixed up a bit of shade & would be fairly comfortable except for the flees whose name is Legion - Asked a Scotsman what he was doing out here, he said "altering the contour of the desert mate"
