 Here it appears that Brit rule teaches the nig that his crimes are not  1 / 8   th  as bad as the same acts of a white. A white man gets no shout at all in a judgement. This encourages the nigs to be independent & keeps all but the worst stamp of whites out of the country. Only the French & Portugese are not under the shadow of the English administration & as a consequence these two countries do all the trade & have the goodwill of the tribes, while the Briton merely keeps the lid on from the forts & sends long reports to London every so often.                                          These Aureal barracks are a credit to the black troops. Each hut has its rockery garden (& its family of snakes) Lurid jungle plants mingle with black-red french roses
