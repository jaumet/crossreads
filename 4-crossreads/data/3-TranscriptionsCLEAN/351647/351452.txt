  
 rather more than I should but its not a bad town, very quaint & old fashioned.  There are nice shops & tea places & I have a great friend in a music shop who likes me to go in & play his piano, he has a beauty, one simply can't leave off on it.  Saturday we had a great treat there, the Garde Republican Bande were there & they gave a concert so we stayed (we're supposed to be out of town by 7-30 p.m. but we got permission).  It was a great concert, I never heard anything better, just like an absolutely magnificient organ playing. 
 Weather here has been a bit cooler lately, about a week back it was very hot & close, then we had about the worst thunderstorms I've seen & then a couple of wet days.  Now its not too bad but I have been a bit off colour.  Always did hate these lulls.  Plenty of fruit in Amiens, we get a bit round here too. 
 I'm glad to know you were pleased to be back home & that Mac welcomed you nicely.  I'm simply dying to see Grahame & the garden (nobody & nothing else of course).  But I've been so cranky & homesick & restless lately & can't settle to anything, not even write a decent letter, I'm owing stacks.
