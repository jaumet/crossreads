<p>our little Baggage Pile. We got some Tarpaulins &amp; it kept the rain off but as the ground was so flat the water hung around. We had to dig trenches to carry the water off. I slept in a tin shed in the yard in the evening to escape the wet ground.</p>
<p>Wednesday 22nd December<br/>It was fine to-day &amp; things were a little more comfortable. I recvd my first Xmas Hamper to-day &ndash; one from dear Mrs Attwater &amp; a bundle of papers from others. It was a bit cold.</p>
<p>Thursday 23rd Dec<br/>It was bitterly cold. I went across to Camp &amp; got some Pay &amp; also an Xmas Billy Can sent by<br/>Miss Bailey<br/>57 Taronga Road<br/>E. Malvern<br/>Victoria</p>
