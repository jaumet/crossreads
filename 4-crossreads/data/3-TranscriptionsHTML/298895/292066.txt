<p>to get ready to move off at an hours notice so we packed our wagons that night.  It came as an absolute tonic &amp; I was as happy as a King until I had an argument with the Q.M. over a water tester he saying it belonged to A Section when I knew it belonged to my section, even his crawl down an hour later did not quite square me up.

We decided to turn in about 2 A M, but before doing so decided to let the S.M's tent down.
