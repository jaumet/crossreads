Worgret Camp Wareham 3rd.1.17
Dear Betty
I am still here in camp as you will see by top of letter so far I have not been re classified since I returned from my Xmas Holidays. I dont think I will be here much longer though I have not heard from H. since he came down here to see me. he went up to London and stayed for a couple of days with Mrs. Horton. I suppose he will tell you just what he thought of London. I think that I thanked you for the letter with the Flanell flowers enclosed when I wrote to Mother Last. I am sending one of the Flowers to Elsie She is very interested in the Australian wildflowers that you sent across has some of them still. The lowlands here are still frozen over some of the ice is thick enough to Skate one but I have not tried yet. dont think I will either it is nearly 3 weeks now since we had any rain, here but the wind has been bitterly cold and a lot of the water supply pipes here are frozen solid. The last 3 or 4 days
