Dear Sir or Madam,
In view of the fact that knitting-wool is becoming more difficult to obtain and is very expensive my Committee would be glad to know, after Conference with your members, whether they would care to undertake spinning, if assistance were given to buy wheels and an instructor visited your Branch.  My Committee are anxious to obtain definite information on the subject at once in order that they may go more thoroughly into the matter and they would be obliged if you answer the enclosed list of queries at your earliest convenience.
Yours faithfullyThea Milner Stephen
