<p>Feb.  Friday 2 1917</p>
<p>My old back give me pie especially at nights.  Showed it to M.O. again McLelland from Homebush 3rd F.A. "Merely superficial bruise"  Little cad!  I'd like to have the satisfaction of meeting some of these upstart officers in civil life, just to tell 'em off --- the bounders.<br/>Perishingly cold.  Heavy frosts each night.  Snow still covers the ground.</p>
