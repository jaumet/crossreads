  
 Col Cade came up & spoke a few kindly words of encouragement & appreciation when I arrived there, & after a dressing of the eyes, a cup of soup, & a chat with several of the boys, away the motor went to Main D.S. at Kemmel.  A little formality there & then on  th  to C.C.S. (No. 2 British) at Ostersteene. We spent the night at that hospital, & the following morning were put on an ambulance train & sped along to Bologne which we reached at dusk.
