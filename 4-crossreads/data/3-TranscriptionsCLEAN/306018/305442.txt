  
 July 1917 unpleasant enough.  Go for a ride occasionally through & round Ismailia  It is very nice of an afternoon riding through the avenues of trees.  Also visited the town baths.  They consist only of a row of boxes built on a jetty.  Most of the European residents have their private boxes along the front of the lake.  Later in the afternoon it presents quite a continental picture with all the different costumes  There are crowds of Tommies here now  They seem a pretty good lot & have just come from Salonica & are having a few weeks spell here.  The Lake is full of them in the afternoons.  They march down in Battalions, The aerodrome is alongside our camp.  They get busy very early in the morning & it sounds like 20 chaff cutters going.  An Australian mail, letters & papers arrived during the week   Got 3 letters 2 from home!  Answered them all 
 Wednesday July 4th to Tuesday 10th Have sent a number of men out to the Regt during the week.  Numbers of Tommies are still going through here  Went into Ismailia 2 or 3 times & called
