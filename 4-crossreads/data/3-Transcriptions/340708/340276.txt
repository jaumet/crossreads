<p>August 1917<br/>Saturday 11th<br/>More rain today but it cleared up this afternoon so activity in the air was resumed &amp; bombing carried on through<br/>Sunday 12th<br/>Had a trip down the line a bit in a motor wagon we passed through some fine hop fields    The country looks grand.   Went to Baillieul this evening it is a large town with a pre war population of 70,000 the usual French style of winding cobble streets.  There is not much to see &amp; there is allways a chance of a shell dropping here so it wont see much of me<br/>Monday 13th<br/>I have a great crop of boils on me so I had to see the quack he gave me a few days spell.
