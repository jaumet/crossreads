<p>come off.</p>
<p>As I was writing this note I heard the report of two shells bursting. Going outside I saw two flames in the sky and a few minutes afterwards two Balloon Observers were to be seen descending from their damaged balloon, in parachutes.</p>
<p>It was interesting and exciting to watch them descend, from a distance, as they dangled in the air swinging backwards and forwards gradually bringing themselves down to the ground.</p>
<p>May 31st. Thurs.<br/>Walked out to Mont Des Cats. A pretty stiff climb up to the top of the Mont.</p>
<p>There is a large college and monastery at the top of this hill. At present the college part of this monastery is used as R.A.M.C. Hospital for Skin Diseases</p>
<p>One gets a beautiful view of the surrounding country, much the same as from Mont Noir. The windmill at the top of this hill is made of brick, a different type of windmill it is from the others.</p>
<p>Troops were being instructed in Machine Gunnery.</p>
<p>Witnessed an Aviator doing some marvellous turns and twists in his machine. <br/>There was also a hospital for Officers here and it was said that he was giving an exhibition for their benefit. One of the turns was a complete somersault on his side.</p>
<p>Returned back to hospital covered</p>
