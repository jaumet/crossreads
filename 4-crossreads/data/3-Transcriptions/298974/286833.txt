<p>4<br/>Tell Hazel I liked the poetry on her card, the one in her parcel, very much. Quite unusually sensible for these days. I must say tho', I did hope there was some <u>fudge</u>in the girls' parcels while I was undoing them!</p>
<p>The 13th Bat. is rarely "out" while we are. I will not forget to go and see Patten tho' when I meet them. I will wrote to him soon. It was a very nice letter of his. A 13th Sgt. Major whom I met at Etaples told me Alan had to get special permission to go "in" with the boys, he was a/ Orderly Room Cpl. He said he must have a bit of Fritz, he missed Johnny Burke. Poor chap. I think I can manage a photo of his grave, but dont want to raise your hopes. General Anderson wrote and told me he was forwarding Alan's private belonging's home. So my worrying him bore fruit at last. I wrote him twice about them. I'm awfully glad these are going back.</p>
<p>The letter of Harrison's was from the Mesopotamia front, dated Sep, in reply to a letter of mine dated May. He is over there</p>
