flat roof of the house, one had a fine view over Mount Zion and along the Bethlehem Road up to the Jaffa gate. The site was indeed the pick of the surroundings. The run home in the evening through the Mountains gorges was glorious. The sun was just setting, and the tints which spread over the valleys away to Jaffa, and the sea in the far distance, were ineffably beautiful and delicate. Truly our Saviour had chosen the most beautiful part of all the world for his mission to mankind. We arrive at Desert Corp (Dieran) at 7 pm.
