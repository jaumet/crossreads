<p>Wednesday 5 March 1919<br/>Busy buying games &ndash; Concertina, Banjo, Picolo, Tucker etc. for voyage.  Very cold &amp; wet for a wonder in Cairo &ndash; Dolly &amp; Babe well.<br/>Had lunch at Shepheards with former costs 150 pt. equal to &pound;1:10:- for a meal!!  I <strike>bought</strike> bought &frac12; lb. ham for Dolly, it costs 8/-s, eight shillings a pound!!!<br/>While on Tucker, will you get a ham cooked at Jagos also fowls &amp; ducks say twice a week when you want them cold &amp; leave the bill for me, if Dolly goes first.  I don't want Joe to go to any expense for her in any way &amp; as she now thinks another Babe is coming &ndash; naturally the Mother must eat more.</p>
