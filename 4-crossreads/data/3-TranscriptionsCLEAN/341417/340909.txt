  
 and brave as a man could go and it was not long before we had Fritz on the run. Well Miss King it is getting near Xmas so we do not know where we will be spending it but we have something to do before then. I have not time to write much more as we are only out for a couple of days resting and I have a terrible lot of writing to do. I hope you are in the best of health as it leaves me at present with Kind Regards to self, Miss Robinson & Miss Owen
