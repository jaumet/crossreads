July 1915
Thursday 1
Reached Brisbane & had tea at [indecipherable] with Fothergill & Johnson [late of R.N.] whom we picked up at Murwillumbah.
Met De Lacey & Saunders & had a glass of port wine with them.
De Lacey informed me that promotions are out. Thinks I am good for a corporal & raises my spirits, only for a time however.
Arrived at camp I find Clarke will probable be last Corporal & I have been passed over
Depressed & dreary
