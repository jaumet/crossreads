<p>Wed, Jan 30th<br/>Good old Lill. Got 2 more Letters from her today and one from Mrs Pudmey. Mr P. has been in Bed for some weeks with a Broken Ankle. Lill's Letters ate the first I have received from her to say anything about my being wounded. Poor old Girl, <u>she</u> <u>would</u> be worried.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went up for classification but was told that my card was not there and I wouldn't be wanted. Today I was up before "the Beak" for missing classification, but after my explanation the case was dismissed.</p>
<p>At night went up to the Kitchen and wrote some Letters. It is much warmer there than in our Hut.</p>
<p>Thur 31st</p>
<p>Another busy day. These formal dinners keep things humming. To see the Menu one would never imagine there was a Food Shortage in England.</p>
<p>Fri. FEB 1st</p>
<p>Big Air Raid over Paris; and a lot of damage done. I thought Paris was invulnerable to plane attacks, but was evidently mistaken. <u>Wrote Letter No 5 to M.S.</u> Got another Letter from her tonight dated Nov 21st. They are the only Letters I have received since being in this Camp, and they were jolly welcome.</p>
<p>Sat. 2<br/>Bill Beards and I were on this afternoon, but we shall be "off" tomorrow. The weather is good.</p>
