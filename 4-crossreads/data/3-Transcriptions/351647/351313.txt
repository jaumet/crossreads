<p>what can accumulate in 5 hours.</p>
<p>I bought a post card which I enclose separately.  I hope you got the book of views of the other place we were near to, so you'll see we shift about some.  Things are very uncertain, we dunno where we'll be going next day or what is going to happen.  (That blessed 'phone will play things that make me dead homesick, Girl in the Train is the last.)</p>
<p>So Peter &amp; Miss Hilda's engagement is out.  I am writing by this mail.  I hope they'll get married soon.  Old Stuart Bowman wrote me the other day, he is still chairing it.  I have asked my brother to go &amp; see him.  Hefty Lasham also wrote me, she is really is a good sort to bother, I'm afraid I didn't appreciate her in Australia as I should have done.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish you were a fly on the wall here</p>
