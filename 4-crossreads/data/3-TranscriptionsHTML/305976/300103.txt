<p>Wednesday Jan 1 &ndash; 1919<br/>The old year passed quietly and another year has commenced. It is said that all the Troops from this front will be home in Ausy for Easter.<br/>Jan 20 &ndash; 1919<br/>We have made ourselves comfortable at Rafa. It is getting monotonous waiting for the time to go home.<br/>There is very little doing.<br/>Three times a week we have lectures under the Educational scheme. We have Race meetings twice a week, Football &amp; sports to fill in the time of waiting.</p>
