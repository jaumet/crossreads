<p>The Squadron was warmly congratulated upon its per-formance. The opinion of the G.O.C. Palestine Brigade, Royal Air Force, (Brigadier General A.E. Borton, D.S.O. ) was recorded in a congratulatory letter received from him. Referring to the photographs taken on this occasion he wrote:- "They form a very fine achievement, and probably mark the highest point which has yet been reached in map making photography. They have been completed in a very short time and during a period of unsettled weather, and they reflect the greatest credit on the part of the Pilots, and perseverance in filling the gaps in spite of the high wind. In this connection I should especially like to congratulate Lieut. Taplin on his work. The photographic Sections<br/>have done splendid work in dealing with the large numbers of plates and prints involved, and in turning out the copies without delay."</p>
<p>"Maps like these are of such great value for the Army when operating in a difficult mountainous country like that of Central Palestine, that the 40th Wing may justly be proud of having contributed in such a real and tangible way to the success of the campaign."<br/>In addition to the above, 18 photographic reconnaissances were carried out during February and approximately 194 square miles of country covered. The plates exposed number 507, from which 5,112 prints were produced. A considerable number of Aspect photographs of important enemy town, railway stations, aerodromes, etc. were also taken. The Pilots engaged on this work from time to time were:-  Capt. S.W. Addison, Capt. R.M. Smith, M.C., Lieutenants E.K. Spragg, J.H. Butler, A.R. Brown, L.W. Taplin, H.S.R. Maughan, E.P. Kenny, H.L. Fraser, F.W. Haig, L.M. Potts, C.N. Watt, C.S. Paul, E.S. Headlam, C.C. Cameron and C.C. Peters. Observers:- Col. A.E. Borton, D.S.O. Lieutenants H.B. Fletcher, W.A. Kirk, R.T. Challinor, C.J. Vyner and E.A. Mustard.</p>
<p>For the three days following our occupation of JERICHO reconnaissance of this area was rendered impossible owing to dense low lying clouds, as a result of which the enemy was able to carry out his retirement, without molestation from the air. On the 24th JERICHO, SHUNET NUMRIN the JORDON BRIDGE and NEBI MUSA were reconnoitred by Lieut. A.B. Brown, (Pilot) and Lieut. O.M. Lee (Observer) escorted by Lieut. E.L. Spragg (Pilot) and Lieut. C.J. Vyner (Observer) when the Turk was found to be in full retreat. By the close of the month he had been driven across the JORDON. He there concentrated his forces in the foothills, his main defence system being established at SHUNET NUMRIN</p>
