fire a fine church in Fleurbaix, which burnt to the ground. 
Have packed our goods in readiness for a further move. Late in the evening Fritz put a great deal of shrapnel over into the town wounded a number on the streets.
Voluntarily went down on duty bent, but fortunately found none who required attention, while there had a look around the ruins of the church which was still burning. Buildings on both sides of the street burning fiercely.
Sunday 30.7.16
