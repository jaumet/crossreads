<p>We have been busy all day sending our heavy baggage into EL Minia to be entrained for our new Camping place somewhere up the Nile. All tents are struck and once again we are out under the blue canopy of heaven. We start tomorrow sometime and the first Camping place is Nazlet-El-Abid where our 'B' Sqd has been Camped since we came down these parts. There is a cold wind blowing tonight but I shall not take much notice of it, as I Camp out in the open each night close to the <u>telephone</u> box. I say "box" advisedly The said "box" is simply a post with one telephone on each side and a blanket spread over the top on four flag poles to keep the heat and dew off the instruments. Only one man is on duty at a time and when the bell rings the question arises Which bell? He has to try first one and then the other till he finds out which one <u>did</u> ring. The fun commences when <u>both</u> bells ring simultaneously. or in the middle of a message when the other bell rings which does not too often happen. Shall be sorry to lose my</p>
