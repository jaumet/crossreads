<p>heavily shelled the road used by our transports when coming into Armentieres.<br/>Last night I got another letter from my wife written at Merrigum dated Feb 18 and numbered 50.  I was very glad to get these last two letters, for I lost a lot of her letters through being away.<br/>[Shorthand entry not transcribed]</p>
<p>Friday April 13.1917<br/>A nice morning early but it soon got cloudy and cold.  I swept out the office and the back yard and made things tidy.  Also took some letters to Battalion Headquarters.<br/>The Quarter Masters stores are in a big building on the corner of Rue De Moulin and another street.  It is 4 stories high with another store underground.<br/>The sign board bears this inscription<br/>Dancoisne Freres<br/>Tissage<br/>de Linge de Table<br/>Damasse et Ouvre<br/>Genres Panissieres<br/>Forchons en tous Genres.<br/>Every day now we hear good news of further victories on the somme &amp; at Arras.  I was down at the railway station this afternoon to load some firewood.</p>
