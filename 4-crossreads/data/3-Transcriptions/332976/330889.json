<p>July 1917<br/>4th   Last night we had a very heavy rain storm, but excepting for a shower this morning the day was fairly fine.   We are all very tired after yesterday's turnout &amp; did not feel much inclined for work.   We went down to the canal this morning &amp; after a lecture on venereal disease by a Colonel of the 1st Div. A.M.C. at which Captain (Archdeacon) Ward &amp; General Hobbs were present, we started to dismantle the structures we had made for the sports.   Gen. Hobbs was not present yesterday having had to attend the funeral of Gen Holmes (late of Rabaul etc) who was killed whilst showing Mr. Holman around the trenches.</p>
