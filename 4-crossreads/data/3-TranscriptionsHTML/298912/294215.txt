<p>scoring board, Here we used to spend many a pleasant hour,<br/> It is no use trying to keep out of trouble whilst hanging around the camp. Get away from it as far as possible &amp; run risks &ndash; they are well worth it because on an average a soldier only gets punished for one hundredth of his sins.<br/>Concerts were given in the Recreation Room at Moore Park &amp; some talented artists gave interesting amusements that broke the monotony of camplife.<br/>Out of two months in Moore  Park I only spent three nights in camp &amp; was always out somewhere making a nuisance of myself. Church parades were always held on Sunday morning. The C.of England section left at 10.30am for St. Mathias Church Paddington &amp; returned at 12.45 pm. The Nonconformists left at 10 am &amp; returned at 10.30am &ndash; their service being short &amp; sweet &amp; held in the Show Ground.<br/>We soon took a tumble &amp; went to the Nonconformist's section &amp; on return</p>
