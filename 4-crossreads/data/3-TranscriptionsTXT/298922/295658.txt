 Tuesday 25 December 1917 
 I spent the day with my little wife &amp; had lunch at Continental Hotel. Could not get Permit for Dolly to go Ismalia &amp; I got a wire on arrival in Cairo to rejoin my Regiment so goodbye to dreams of Moascar Base for a while, but I am quite happy about it as feel I've had a long holiday &ndash; so get on board the train tonight at 6 p.m. &amp; have my dinner on a Troop train &ndash; Dolly stays at Heliopolis for a bit now.
