  
 1918 Sat. 13 Apl. Whitworth of the Sherwood Forresters, and his pilot are in our barrack. (The two flying chaps who got 10 years in a fortress for dropping propaganda papers over the German trenches.   They did 4 months.)   Ordered to prepare to leave today for the officer's camp at Furstenberg in Mecklenburg. 
 Rotten luck as Bob & the crowd are at Heidelberg, I believe. 
 50 of us assembled in the mess-room at 10 a.m., including 3 Lt. Colonels (Smith;  and Sloggelt & Bury of the K.R.R.), 1 Major, a few Captains (including Newstead and Wallace of the West Yorks.), some R.N.D. lieut., Clarke, (a Canadian pilot) and other assorted one and two-pippers. 
 We marched out through the double lines of barbed wire into the town;  past the "Europaischer" and the Stadt Garten (now in full leaf & looking beautiful) to the Bahnhof, where the party was assigned two first-class carriages.
