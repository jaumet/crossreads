  
 Thursday March 20. 1919.   130 Occasional showers throughout the day. I did not go on parade this morning at 9.a.m. because the previous 3 mornings I was warned for guard and had difficulty each time in getting out it. By absenting myself I escaped being warned. I was at a very good concert tonight in the  Y.M.C.A.. 
 Friday March 21. 1919.   131 A fine day. Last night I heard that I was marked A.W.L. in the Guard Room, but today I have heard nothing about it. I was again detailed for guard this morning, but did not go on parade this afternoon , as I was very busy in the work shop. The Educational Officer asked me if I heard any more about guard, & told me not to go out. 
 Saturday March 22. 1919.   132 Dull & cloudy. There were a few light flakes of snow this morning & again in the evening. 
 This being the usual half holiday, I went into Weymouth for the afternoon had tea at the Soldiers & Sailors club opposite the Railway station & was back about 9.20 
 Sunday March 23. 1919  133 The wind is bitterly cold to day.  Light snow fell  in the morning for a little while.
