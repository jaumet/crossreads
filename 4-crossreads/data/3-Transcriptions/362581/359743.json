<p>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>I have just received two letters No 20   &amp;  No 21, with your lovely little letters enclosed. The pictures are beautiful   &amp;  you are quite clever at drawing. I wrote to Aunty Etta yesterday   &amp;  find the mail does not close until today. I have not time to write one to them, so you tell them I am better   &amp;  had a very nice outing yesterday. Sister Martin, Craig, Hart   &amp;   I had afternoon tea in Cairo, then drove along the Avenue beside the River Nile . We had a glorious afternoon. The Nile River is at its  highest tide now &ndash; looks like a rough dirty sea &ndash; The Bull-rushes are beautiful just now. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses From Auntie Eadle</p>
