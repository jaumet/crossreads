Went to the Railway Institute at Septieh after tea - a club for English railway employees & friends - A rather pleasant evening was brought to an abrupt close by half a dozen  drunk Australians  of the A.I.F. "kicking up a shindy". A chap feels jolly well ashamed  sometimes to think he belongs to the Australian Forces. Secured a Trooper's spur as a souvenir.
