<p>6<br/>Has that chicken been smiling" at Bill any more? Earl&pound; with the cats must have been a scream. I like Bills picture of the train, it was something like a "tank".

<p>Well, I'd like to be able to tell you where we are, and describe some of the things around us. We are not far from a place called [apparently censored] but I cant tell you more. [apparently censored] everything. All water is frozen as is the ground &amp; the dreadful mud, so altho' conditions are better in one way, it is dreadfully cold. Our feet are very painful. To me this kind of thing is quite new. Things are <strike>quite</strike> quiet but of course casualties are occurring always from intermittent shell fire.

<p>Your loving son<br/>Dene</p>
