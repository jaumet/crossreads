Paris
9/3/17
back by Metro to the Bourse and after poking round the streets there made for home via the Rue du quartre Septembre. Around the hotel was very busy with taxis. At 6.45 Ella came in having been detained at Ciros for her tea and we had a good talk and she presented me to her Mother. Then to Arrigonis for dinner of Chianti fish etc and found many of the same people there. Taking the place of the club of the English the French allow cafe life to form their chief relaxation and pleasure. It is made the occasion of the day and the talk, bustle and chatter are as good as a play. There is no hurry and all dally over the meal and devote great attention to their male companions. The streets on the dark side and quite slippery so feeling tired returned to the hotel and stayed in the reading room.
