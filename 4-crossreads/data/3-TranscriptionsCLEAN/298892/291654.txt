deeply struck by the number of women in mourning. The church was packed with women swathed in long black veils completely obscuring the face.The chairs one kneels on are very uncomfortable. One kneels on the seat and leans on the back which is made high for the purpose and when the time comes this causes a most distracting din. An old sexton decked out most gorgeously paces up and down the church and keeps the chairs in some sort of order. He is got up exactly like the beafeaters in the Tower of London even down to the war medals and his distaff is exactly like their spears halberts). Otherwise of course it was exactly the same as if I was attending mass in Australia.We were billetted in the front room of a very fine house. It was a very small room but very cosy and light, as it had two large windows - true french style opening on to the street.
