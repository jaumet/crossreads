<p>We went from Locre to Bailleul and in the centre of town turned off to the left &amp; went on to Steenwerk. Two or three kilometres further on we arrived at the CCS. It is beside the railway line (for evacuation purposes) &amp; has been there about 18 months.</p>

<p>To-day is the third anniversary of my sailing from Sydney on the old "Kyarra's"  [H.M.A.T. Kyarra] first trip. As in the case of birthdays &amp; enlistment anniversaries, I spent the first in Egypt, second in France and now third in Belgium. We are behind the Messiness front where things are very quiet. Only a few wounded &amp; gassed cases are coming through although the sick are giving us plenty of work. We are unfortunate in having a lot of British "tommies" around us who are on the whole a most ignorant and useless lot. There are always plenty of them parading sick.</p>
<p>I have been carrying on a correspondence with a friend living at Marseilles who has just spent several months in Corsica, and have learnt quite a lot about this French island possession.</p>
