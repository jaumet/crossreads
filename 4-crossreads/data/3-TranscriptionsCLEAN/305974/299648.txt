  
 18 Monday The town of Dickebusch is fairly large but is in ruins now through shell fire.  We are about 300 yds out of the town.  I got the job as clerk in the dressing station, it is a very easy job, we only had three patients all day. I have to enter down all their details including their wound or disease, & again enter them when they are going out; It rained continuously all day. 
 19 Tuesday We are on the right hand side of the salient [?] here.  Things seem to be rather quiet, as we hear very little firing.  We never get any shells over this far.  There are plenty of rats here, some are a tremendous size as large as a fair size cat.  We were a bit rushed this morning, with sic parade, but it was very quiet during the afternoon.  Very cloudy & rainy weather. 
 20 Wednesday Still very wet. I have four blankets now & 2 overcoats so you can guess I don't like getting up early of a morning (we have to get up at 8 am)  There was a German Major brought in this afternoon he was shot through the leg & also had another wound, he seemed cheerful after we gave him a feed, but couldn't speak English.  It was pay day here but as I had some money left, I didnt draw any.
