" They put 7 over all at equal distanc between our trench the German 's , they were for the men to take cover in between the rush on the way across , the men got in them alright but they had great difficulti in climb out for the next rush , no wonder for the averag crater from these monster measur someth like 30 ft across is easili 12 or 15 ft in depth . One of our offic Capt Price has a batteri of 6 rifl grenad he is fire them all day long , he give them no rest from them 7th . yesterday even Captain McKenzi Jack Price I reconnoitr a piec of open ground at the rear of our fire
