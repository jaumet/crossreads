Destination at present strike>unknown  uncertain, but think it is  uncertain  Halifax Nova Scotia. Wherever it is I hope we have better luck & have a chance  to stretch our legs ashore, but on reflection I do not think for a moment we will as there are now six boats, where there was only one before, so if they would not let us go when there was only one it is not likely now there are six. Sunday 9th  Very quiet day the sea here is much rougher than the other side of the continent. Only did 257 miles. We are continually zig zagging from one side to the other. Monday 10th not quite so rough  today.Did 245 mjiles. We although so far away from the active portion of the world's war are now in the danger zone. All precautions are being taken. Portholes, doors, etc are closed. A canvas shelter is put completely round the main deck. No matches after dark allowed to be struck and of course no smoking
