<p>This time we came to St Sylvester Cappel a quaint hamlet midway between Cassel and Hazebrouck</p>
<p>Here we are still in action and having rather an exciting time as yesterday Fritz warned the civilians to clear out before today as he was going to shell the place and to tell you the plain unvarnished truth Fritz did not by any means break his promise as shells very soon made wreckage of several of the houses and part of the church. One shell dropped about 10 yards away from this house where we are billeted</p>
<p>Needless to say were soon</p>
