<p>2/1/16<br/>Cold and bleak morning. Church parade 0900 fell in, sized and equalized coys marched to gully &amp; formed up as Bde. Arrangements mixed up. Strong wind prevented Padre Stewarts voice being heard. Our chaps smart in greatcoats with sidearms on outside. Inspected them afterwards and found most of them very clean; a few razors are very dull and shaving is agony. Hope for a new issue soon. Blasson "A" Co was said to have shaved until he nearly cried but, knowing it would not pass, had the razor in his pocket and duly produced it.</p>
<p>At 1130 left with Davis &amp; Roberts for Kastro and returned at 1930 a walk of 20 miles in all. Passed through Kondia and past a guard on stony mule tracks very similar to that in Imbros. Big row of windmills here grinding. Pushed on getting occasional glimpses of the sea and half way reached a very neat house with grounds enclosed by stone walls and kitchen garden &amp; other cultivation alround. From one wall gushed a rippling spring and we passed several others of good water along the road. After long walking caught a sight of a high peak with sea beyond on upon it a tower, in point of fact a castle. Considerable mule and donkey traffic along road, from this on, the men frequently wore the red fez and appeared more than half Turk.</p>
<p>Coming into the town we chanced upon what was evidently the low quarter but an officer directed us to the best French cafe for a meal. Passed along cobblestoned and twisting streets and turned down a side street and entered a little low dining room full of English &amp; other officers. Menu Omelette (very good) Fish Steak Rissoles Potatoes Cheese</p>
