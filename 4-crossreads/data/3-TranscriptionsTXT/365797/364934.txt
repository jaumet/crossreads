 &amp; hears all the gossip of the place. 
 Last Sunday he went to tea at Mrs. Barker's, where some other small boys were &amp; had a lovely time. Wilga is growing so fast &amp; will soon be quite a fine young lady 
 Dorothy has done the lovliest picture for Hazel for a wedding present. She has a good-deal of colour about it &amp; a lot of gilt, &amp; really the effect is perfectly beautiful. She illustrated a quotation of Tennyson's &amp; the picture represents a girl going off with her lover knight to a castle in the distance. It is of course very fanciful &amp; as I said before perfectly beautiful. 
 I am afraid Mrs. Fry misses Hazel very much, she was always so bright &amp; had lots to talk about. Perhaps when Ollie goes she will come back home. It is so hard for Mrs. Fry that she should be separated from Hazel too just now. 
 Well Alan I must end with love, &amp; sincere wishes for the best of good-luck. 
 Yours very sincerely Marion Boehme
