  
 The Campaigner 
 There's a heavy hearted laddie Weary and worn to-day, Now in his third year battle Biding the grim fate's sway. 
 Two years since the proclamation When impulse led him through Conventions hard unto a heart Discipline never knew. Only one's heart, and not the world Know of the drill squad's test, When youth revolts at harsh commands, Recruits may know the rest. 
 An April day the palid dawn Found heroes all in rank, Sickly grins hid fluttering hearts Facing the unknown blank, Some were maddened by blood's desire, Scorning the hail of Death Some remained to succour mates Watching their final breath. 
 Strong men recoiled at sight of blood, And weak turned into strong, And nerves beat drill & heart beat brawn When days just crawled along. Sickness and strain sent many to A shell free other land. Some saw it through but only few Obeyed Retreat's command.
