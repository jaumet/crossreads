<p>covered in all different tints of green, autumn shade &ndash; with lots of Holly bushes, with berries. Oh, I simply love England &ndash; the little country lanes are delightful. Lots of gardens &amp; Parks about even in the city &ndash; one's ideas of English children not seeing any sky nor green grass or trees is quite wrong. The children here are delightful, lovely, bonny, little pets, such rosy cheeks    &amp; bright sparkling eyes.<br/>Had a good afternoon tea there amongst the flowers, left there &amp; went to the City to buy a few necessities, had dinner in town &amp; returned to Quarters about 9. p.m. <br/><u>Friday</u>, had a delightful day. Met Capt. Hay-Lawson (my beloved's pal) at 12 o'clock in London &amp; we had a great chat. He is a charming &amp; interesting man, quite safe, a married man, expecting his wife to come from Aust. any day</p>
