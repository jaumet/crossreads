<p>30 September 1918 Monday<br/>10 000 prisoners surrendered to our Division &amp; we had to help protect them from the Arabs.  These were cut off <u>south</u> of Amman-  A strange phenomenon happened about noon, a distinct earth tremor, I thought at first it must be my head going round with fever- till others spoke about it.  We celebrated our victory with a grand dinner-   Fish killed with gun cotton-  Fowls from village, Blackberries from the Wadi- game is plentiful, gazelle, Hare partridge, curlew, &amp; CANARIES a few snipe &amp; duck in Wadi, but have no gun.</p>
