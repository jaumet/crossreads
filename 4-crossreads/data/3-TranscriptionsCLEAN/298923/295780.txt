General C. said I had been away too much!!!-  after 3 1/2  years !! & on duty  at that.    However the war can't last for ever- Had a swim in  Jordan  swift current hard water from  Mica  sulphur gypsum sand it runs through.  Not as big as the Edwards but plenty scrub along bank, X don't think I'll have to pay for those troughs & reservoirs I had stolen now- the Bill 52/-/- was too stiff altogether.X
