rain nor snow. A little frost   &  a little sunshine. Fritz has made two or three attempts but not succeeded in doing much damage. Everybody expected him last night but he did not visit us.
I hope to leave about the end of next month. May take (2) two months to get out. Travel very slowly   &  around Africa, I think.
hope Norman is having a good time   &  is getting better. It looks as if Conscription will be turned down again. Isn't it dreadful. Of course it is a difficult question   &  should have been at the first.
I went to H.C. yesterday morn   &   it was a very sacred service. Shall tell you all about it another time. Poor one legged patients   &  only one sister (yours truly). Hope you all had a jolly Xmas. Heaps of love   &  kisses to you all.
FromYours lovinglyEdith
