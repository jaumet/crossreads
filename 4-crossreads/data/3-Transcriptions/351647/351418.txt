<p>France<br/>8 December</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Just a few lines to let you know I am still alive &amp; not too bad.  I really am very well except my feet are very sore.  Its so wet underfoot, sloppy mud &amp; it is also bitterly cold, a raw sort of cold not a hard freezy cold.  Our feet are all bad, some worse than others.  Some poor beggars can't get their boots on so I am pretty lucky.</p>
<p>And I have practically no news to relate, day after day goes by &amp; they are all the same, grey &amp; dull &amp; raw &amp; cold.  Its dark at 4-30.  We are still resting ? but are still in our old possy.</p>
