 We are now revelling in a beautiful cool change.  Yesterday Will took Margaret & me down to the Barrage on the Nile Delta.  It is a wonderful place.  We went by train & then for some miles on a trolley hand pushed by two perspiring natives.  Left here at 3.30 & got back at 7.15.  Best love to you both from all of us, always yours Rene
