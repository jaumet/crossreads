 Am in good "nick" &ndash; and there is an undercurrent of excitement running all through the Camp just now. Everyone is wondering, expecting, and pretending to be perfectly calm, when all the time they can hardly keep still &ndash; itching to be on the move. That accounts for this waiting probably. Much love from Alan.
