I was a bitter cold night, with wind and rain. Busy settling down into camp routine. The camp commandant was to inspect us but the move fell through.
8/4/16.
The inspection came off today, and he said the usual things when it was over. Then we went through a general medical inspection. An Aeroplane and and two Parseval Airships passed over the camp in company today.
9/4/16.
The Australian units are ordered to be ready to move off to pitch a camp for themselves across the Railway line on the sand dunes. We were issued with a blanket and woollen underclothing against the cold which was very severe last night.
