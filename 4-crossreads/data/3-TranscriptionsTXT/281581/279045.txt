Capt. Addison did a series of manoeuvres, Looping, diving and rolling etc, which showed the admirable control of the Pilot with modern machines. At 4.30 a spiral nose dive dropped us from 5,000 to 2,500 feet in a few seconds. We returned to the aerodrome without mishap, after a delightful run, which I can only compare with the ride of old Elijah when he went up in his heavenly chariot.
