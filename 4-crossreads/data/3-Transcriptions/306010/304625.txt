<p>cases. A couple of hours later ambulances arrived again &ndash; empty this time. There was a hospital ship in the harbour waiting to take 70 on to England. The great British offensive was in full swing and every hospital must be kept clear &ndash; evacuating their patients across the Channel as fast as possible. Further patients arrived during the night and early morning and altogether we admitted 130 of which the first 70 we sent to Dover a couple of hours after being taken in. Everyone was kept pretty busy as we are short staffed and I was glad to turn in about 2.30 a.m. The British offensive commenced on 1st July &amp; the same night we arrived at Boulogne from the south. The next day the unpacking of the equipment commenced and the following evening patients were being admitted &amp; evacuated again. Not half bad going I can tell you. Wounded are still coming in today but in fairly small numbers.</p>
