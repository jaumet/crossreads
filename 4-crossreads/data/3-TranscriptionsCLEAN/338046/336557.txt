I talked to the man in the office who was rather interested in the way we did things at the State Brickworks. Thye pay here was very miserable. Before the war the rate was about 4&fras- to 5&frasl;- per day as against our 10&frasl;-. The cost of coal however was high. They had to pay about 23&frasl;- per ton for it as against our 10&frasl;4. Their finished brick cost about the same as ours 35&frasl;- at that time. they used the plastic process. He had a brother, in NSW he told me who had a "sheep ranch". I told him about our locusts and he wanted to know if they could bite or sting. I had  a look at the church" St Marys, a fairly modern structure and returned to the sports grounds. In one tent were some curios from France. German gas helmets, waterproof sheet, steel helmet pickelhauben, shell cases, revolvers, kukri etc.our train left at 9 pm and the station
