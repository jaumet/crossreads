 stunt without a doubt,  Rumours about Arras stunt being a failure if so old Fritz has put the wind up us again 
 3/2/17 Glorious sunset last night red ball  waves across ball beautiful red colour all around sun  Last night our people sent over a few shells etc to Fritz.  Yet he did give us a few returns he has without a doubt fine artillery.  Our people were bombarding all day more so on the extreme left about Arras way.  Also about where we are &amp; of course Fritz gives us it all back hot &amp; strong. We are to hop over tomorrow night &amp; try to take the trench which was taken but lost the other night. We have quite a lot of help from other Battalions on our left &amp; right but I think things are going to be warm as the arrangements about same do not appear to me to be OK of course I may be wrong. 
 4/2/17 Aeroplanes fight 2 [indecipherable] to 8.  Another glorious sunset yesterday evening wavy clouds just like silver. fine   all day long there has been one incessant raw of guns firing &amp; shells bursting  we are to hop it to night
