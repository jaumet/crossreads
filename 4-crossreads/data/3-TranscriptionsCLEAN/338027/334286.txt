 Wednesday, 16th December, 1914 Had saddlery inspection on horses.  I mounted Sammy he never even moved, the boat quietened him.  Our camp is now in full swing.  On picquet at night bad night dense fogs, horses getting loose all night owing to pulling their ropes out of sand.  We have a splendid canteen run cheaply by Lipton.  Yesterday was the opening of Turkish Parliament at which the Khedive was present.  Something important may come out of it.  Newspaper reports state that German Cruisers have bombarded English Coasts.
