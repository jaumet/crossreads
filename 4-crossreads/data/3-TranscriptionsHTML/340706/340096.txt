<p>142<br/>am Captain of the day but try to get leave for France &amp; at leave office find an old Cpl of the Fieldmarshall &amp; everything is fixed up but I must call for pass to morrow.</p>
<p>11-5-19 (Sun)<br/>Collect pass &ndash; big robberies of officers gear discovered this morning. My hat was stolen &amp; then replaced. Otherwise I am intact. I pick up my pass &amp; sail off with Thompson by afternoon train arriving in London at 7.45 pm after waiting nearly 2 hours at Westbury.</p>
<p>At Carlton Gardens find that leave officer has moved &amp; we inquire at Regent Palace. These have no rooms for 3 mos but send us to a place Park House 16 &amp; 17 Bayswater Tce, overlooking the Kensington Gardens &amp; kept by an Austrian (once) named Hardy</p>
<p>The search for this place involves some effort as houses here are divided into sections &amp; each section is numbered on its own. So that numbers may be running down &amp; suddenly you get a heavy throwback &amp; as usual London people are too stupid to explain anything &amp; police we could not find. People are too respectable here perhaps. We find light refreshments nearby &amp; then to bed.</p>
<p>12-5-19 (Mon)<br/>As we are both going to France we set off for Horseferry road for our passports</p>
