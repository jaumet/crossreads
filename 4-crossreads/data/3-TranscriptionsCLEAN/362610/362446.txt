  
 Friday 18 August 1916 Again inclined to be showery. Up at 1/4 to 3 & with Cuthbert went up the line with the General to spy out the land. The morning mist was fairly heavy & underfoot things were wet & slippery. The shelling was fairly quiet & we reached the old stronghold in Posieres without trouble : it is now named "Gibraltar" & above ground had been a good deal battered since I last saw it, the Germans knowing full well that we must be making use of it. Trenches had been dug round about making communication a good deal safer : the ground round about was more torn up than ever by shell fire, but burying & salvage parties had been at work. We worked right up to the front, the guides really losing us &landing us in a forward sap in No Man's Land, but fortunately the mist obscured us. With little shellfire we made our way back thro' the mucky trenches, arriving just abt. breakfast time. Immediately afterwards had to again go up the line to reconnoitre, getting back abt. 4 p.m. At night at C.E.R. during the attack by us on positions close to Mouquet Farm.
