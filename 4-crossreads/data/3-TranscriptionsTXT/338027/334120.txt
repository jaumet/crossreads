 Had a half holiday &amp; went to Mena &amp; saw the Pyramids &amp; Sphinx then went to Mena Camp where all the infantry, Artillery &amp; Vic LH are.  I do not like the camp.  I prefer Maadi much better, the sand at Mena is as Nile delta &amp; must be heavy on the infantry.  All the men out there are sick of it and anxious to be on the move.  I saw a lot of my Melbourne mates, they are all well. 
 Whilst we spend our recreation time in talking horses the infantry spend theirs in boxing.  They have a fine stadium &amp; fight every night.  I spent an enjoyable day &amp; returned late at night. 
 Sunday 17 January, 1915 Usual Sunday routine, in the p.m.  I wrote all day &amp; night and set a lot of views &amp; few home truth &ndash; E &ndash;.  And Ess. 
 More talk about going, Heliopolos &amp; Zeitoun this time.  The infantry at Mena had a last march a couple of days ago. 
 We all turn out &amp; feed our horses with lucerne at retreat now, they are doing better now.
