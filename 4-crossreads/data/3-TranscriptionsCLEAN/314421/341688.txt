 I was on picquet this morning from 3 to 6. - the first time for about a fortnight. 
 Early last night enemy aeroplanes were hovering around and dropping bombs. He kept it up for some hours and our archies were quite busy. Luckily no bombs fell in our camp, but I hear that many were killed a few nights ago in an adjoining camp. The country for miles around is one mass of camps. It is said that a quarter of a million men went over the top last Saturday night. 
 The enemy put over a lot of big shells to the N of us this morning; but the most of them were duds, evidently in quest of guns. 
 While I was on picquet it was showery most of the time, and there is light misty rain today. Pat Ryan and I are in a camp together. We made it secure this morning against the rain. It is in a hole about 2 ft deep and about 8 ft. square. We covered it over with a limbre cover & old sheets of iron, and put some sand bags around the top. It is "Tres bon". 
 We found some tins of jam and bully beef in a ditch so are well provided with food. We also get an extra supply of rations at the front. This morning
