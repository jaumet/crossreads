<p>Wednesday 8 May<br/>Fairly quiet to-day except for the usual number of whiz bangs. Beautiful day.<br/>Fritz is shelling Caestre again.  Rumour has it that we go out with the Division to-morrow for a bit of a spell. Wild rumours are current about landings at Ostend, usual furffies of which this is typical.</p>
<p>Thursday 9 May<br/>To-day Fritz has been shelling all round the country, including Mont des Cats, obtaining direct hits on the Monastry. We are to be relieved to-night. Relieved to-night by Yorks &amp; Lancs. &amp; we got out without a casualty.  Now back to Hazebrouck outskirts.</p>
