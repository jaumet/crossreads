 Troops did not wake till nearly 10. a.m this morning. Hunt roared up Sergt. Flynn & sent him up to next aid post, bringing Sergt. Clifton here - a welcome change  Bright clear day & considerable aerial activity.  another frost makes the snow dry & crisp like fine salt. Get back treated with liniment for first time  Not much better yet. Receive May's parcel of sweets & find them so good. So do the other boys. Also "Sun" from Mary.
