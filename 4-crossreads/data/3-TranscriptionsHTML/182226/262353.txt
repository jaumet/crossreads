<p>Saturday 27 November, 1915</p>
<p>Met Sid at the Olympia Club at about 10.45. He beat me at billiards for the first time.</p>
<p>Money being short I had dinner &amp; came back to camp &amp; left Sid to look up some friends etc as he still had a few bob left.</p>
<p>I called into St Georges hospital &amp; gave the nurses some prints of some photos I had taken a few days before.</p>
<p>I came back to camp just in time as I had been wanted &amp; was told to report so I did &amp; was told to hold myself ready to go to Goza [Gozo]&nbsp;an island a few miles from Malta. I will try &amp; get out of it.</p>
