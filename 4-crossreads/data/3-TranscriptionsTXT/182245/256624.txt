 APRIL 1917 
 19 THURSDAY 
 Fine, but dull &amp; cloudy all 
 day. Cleaning harness ect in 
 morning &amp; at dinner time 
 we were told we were moving 
 again. We packed up &amp; moved 
 off from Quesques about 3 pm 
 &amp; went about six kilometers 
 on through Selles to a place 
 called Brunembert where we 
 picketed our horses under 
 cover in an old brick kiln 
 Its not a bad joint but not 
 as good as some I have been 
 in. I was on picket at 
 night.
