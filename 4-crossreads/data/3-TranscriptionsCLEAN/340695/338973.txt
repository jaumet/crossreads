  
 The little girl Blanche was a darling about 6 years old, jove we had some games with her. She spoke English very well so did her mother both having spent 18 months in England. The father couldn't speak a word & it was funny to hear the little kid interpreting she was a wonder. Would come in every morning & try to pull us out of bed. She could recite small pieces of poetry in English her favourite was "my letter". She would make us imaginary morning & afternoon tea with her toy set & sometimes would do us a dinner. We taught her how to play grab with the cards & several other games.
