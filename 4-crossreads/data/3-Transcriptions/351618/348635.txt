<p>in the Field Ambulance near Ordnance &amp; we had a long talk &amp; I promised to try &amp; get along &amp; have tea with him some afternoon if things were quiet. Coming back I had to run the gauntlet of shell fire and my assistants and I had to take refuge for some little time.</p>
<p>Thursday 14th Oct<br/>The morning again opened up keen and looked as if it would continue so. The breeze got strong and it made one find the warm spots. In the afternoon I saw Garth Billington of the 5th Light Horse and had a good yarn &amp; then went over the 5th Trenches with Capt Wright. It was wonderful the networks of cuttings &amp; dugouts &ndash; all splendidly arranged.</p>
<p>Friday 15th Oct<br/>A little cool and very like</p>
