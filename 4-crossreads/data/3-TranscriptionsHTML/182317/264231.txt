<p>If you have anything to do with training syllabi take my advice and have tons of practice in passing of messages. It is very difficult to get the simplest message along when there is any firing and of course it is of paramount importance. We are at present in a keep-down-and-I-won't-touch-you sort of place with trenches on our left 10 (ten) yards apart and on our right about 30 yds. During the daytime there is practically nothing doing at all. The trenches are very deep (which is just as well for me) and you <u>never</u> put your head over the top. You use periscopes &ndash; so does Johnny Burke. Just occasionally you let him have a bomb or two just to let him know you are still here. All our trenches are covered with sloping wire netting to keep out the bombs but not many come along. At night time there is a general sprinkling of shots all along the line &amp; plenty of bombing with an occasional wakening up of rapid (very rapid) fire. You have no idea the amount of sapping that has been done in this wonderful place. Wherever you go you move through deep saps &amp; spend the greater part of your time underground. The only time you are above the surface is when you happen to be under cover in rear of the hills. Some of the trenches are a source of wonder to me. I am writing this in a bombproof about 8 feet in rear of the centre of that portion of the firing line of which I am O.C. The bomb proof is 6 feet deep has a seat along both sides has 4 entrances &amp; a window. The</p>
