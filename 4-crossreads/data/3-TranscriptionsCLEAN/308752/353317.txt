& Arthur Lang, who has spent the last three or four months in Gallipoli. What a great experience I do envy them. Our camp is struck & all medical stores etc., are at the railway station. We are sleeping in some old buildings which I can assure you are not too clean. Some of my mates found bugs crawling on their blankets during the night, but I managed to evade this luxury as I had a few tins of insecticide with me. We are ready to move off at a minute's notice. It will be quite a change to get away from Serapeum. I believe our destination will be Tel-el-Kebir which is situated about forty miles from the canal.
Saturday 12th February to Thursday 24th FebruarySame monotonous routine, squad,  drill (don't you think I have seen enough of this) stretcher drill, & lectures etc. This life is becoming very monotonous every one sick to death of the whole affair, even the officers themselves (who live in comfort) under the conditions).
