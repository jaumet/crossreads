ward isn't it?!
Made out an application for leave this afternoon think I will go down into Wales for a change.
7th. Very hot sultry today looks like more rain brewing, the hot weather over here is much worse to put up with I think than our Australian heat but the reason may be why we feel it so much is on account of the heavy close clothing we wear, there is practically no air circulate through our clothes I often wonder how on earth we are going to take to work when when this war is over. As you know my hands are as white as snow as soft as a womans I have done no manual work these last 2 years to speak of for a Sgt lives the life of a gentleman is generally waited
