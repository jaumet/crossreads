 everybodi say is veri pretti . A littl while ago the 35 mump case were sent off . Veri hard luck for the lad who in some case have brother remain on board . Coal is in full swing we are no doubt go out to day . We left Fremantl yesterday Wed 30th at 5 p.m. The peopl along the street all cheer us and all the ship cock-a-doodle-doo . A young girl has been semaphor signal from the wharf all day . She signal with veri clear angl and the lad are send messag back from three or four part of the boat at onc . Just what she see in spend her day signal to men on troop ship I cant see , but she is a well known ident here , and was at the same game when the " Orsova " A67 was in this part 13 month ago . She give her name as Dulci , and by jove she wont stand ani nonsens . She conclud with " God speed , look out for me when you return . I 'm alway here " . This is one of the most perfect day ( Sunday 3rd Sep. 16 ) I have ever experienc at sea . We are of cours well south of the cours we took last time when we made for Suez , and onli an occasion Albatro and Fli fish is seen . The big lazi roll of the ocean , and the Indian Ocean is a beauti ocean to me , give us all a dread lazi feel . It make me think of Leigh Hunt 's " A Now " where he so brilliant put on paper the littl peculiar of the "great vulgar " on a hot enerv day . This is not a hot day , it is a real Man Autumn day , but there is a balanc forc in the effect of this great ocean weari swell . The Sergeant have a deck to themselv and I wish you could see them all now . Some are fast asleep ( it 3.30 p.m. ) in the most fantast posit , for the deck is Oh so hard , and sleep was ever a great level . The Provost Sergeant ( Bennett ) was in such a beauti attitud that Lockrey I photograph him . I wish I could develop it .
