I hope to go up to Ghezireh in a week or so, if we have not by then been sent to some other front afaire. - I was very sorry to hear that Will had been so poorly & trust he is quite himself once more. 
 This camp is on the old battle field of . Some days after duty I explore the very old trenches looking for Curios. The weather here is very lovely here just now. When I get to Cairo I mean to look up Mrs Robinson, if I can find her. From where I  am  sit I can see a sort of tower like monument which they say was erected in memory of the men who fell near the spot. Thank you very much for having sent me Xmas gifts by Beatrice Hasson
