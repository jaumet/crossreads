<p>Mon 3rd Sep. (cont.)<br/>We bluffed through &ndash; it may have been minutes or it may have been hours later when the torpedo doors were lifted and the tension slackened.</p>
<p>The chief doctor was quite green in the face (he is a fine chap really but his heart is weak and goes back on him at moments like this.)</p>
<p>The young doc. with the round tortoise-shell spectacles and the face like a benevolent, educated old sow was, however, as cool as if doing his usual morning rounds!</p>
<p>Hans Biester, our boastful fat orderly, was an arrant coward.</p>
<p>This morning I asked to be allowed aft again when the Doc. came to see me.   "Na, my leetle English friend, how did you like the cruiser?" he asked.<br/>"Oh, that!" I replied indifferently, "that is nothing".</p>
<p>"Nothing!" he queried, with a twinkle in his eye.   And then he winked!</p>
<p>The old boy has a sense of humour.</p>
