<p>Yesterday  being rather cold was nine or less a slack day but today we went through the usual routine of route march lecture &amp; physical jerks<br/>Ye Gods. How many more lectures on physical jerks am I going to hear. That today by Corporal Pollock (<strike>late of</strike> who was at Anjone) was a good one &amp; strange to say he had several bits of information I did not know before. Too often it is a dreary repetition  of the old old story.<br/>Then the interminable route marches. Today I was thinking of the huge number of them &amp; wondering how it is they are as bearable as they are.</p>
