 Dear Sir, 
 I am desired by Their Excellencies the Governor-General and Lady Helen Munro Ferguson to forward to you, under separate cover, a framed photograph of themselves which they would like you to accept with their best wishes. 
 Their Excellencies wish me to thank you for the kind assistance which you gave them during the visit of His Royal Highness to New South Wales, and to say the little incident of getting Her Excellency&#39;s Car through the traffic in Macquarie Street, was very much apprciated. 
 Yours faithfully, 
 H.H. Killy.&nbsp; Captain 
 Aide-de-Camp.
