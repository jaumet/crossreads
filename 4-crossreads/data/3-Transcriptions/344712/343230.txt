<p>This note book was given to me on the 27th of June 1915 at sea, by the Purser on board the transport "Berrima", and is a diary containing my impressions &amp; experiences from that date.  Having been written originally in pencil, it was almost unreadable, and for that reason I have been to compelled to copy it over with ink.</p>
