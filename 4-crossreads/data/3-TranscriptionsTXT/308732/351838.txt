Suddenly we heard "Pip, Pip, Pip" of a machine gun up in the sky, we looked up just in time to see a Fritz plane dive out of a cloud, going straight for the baloon, with his machine gun going, the baloon has no means of defence, so the observer just hopped out over the side with his parachute (they always have one in case of accidents) and almost at once the baloon burst into flames, and in about 25 sec's was no more, the observer drifted slowly down to earth and Fritz dived back into the cloud again, followed by sundry shots from the earth.
