Parody . Do they want us
to Lose the War.
-   -   -
The 4th command depot
is one of the best
Where war weary soldiers
get a much needed rest
And plump Canteen Corporals
all hearty & hale
Laugh & grow fat while
they guzzle brown Ale
Chorus
Do they want us to lose the War
To spread the sad tidings
to Camps near and far
Up soldiers together give
one hearty cheer
Shout death to the traitors
who water our beer
