Tues Mar 26
Fierce fighting continues. The war news is very serious, but everyone seems confident.
Wed March 27th
Germans capture Albert. This time last year we were there, at Bellevue Farm, and it is hard to realise that Fritz has it again.
Thurs 28
Bill Beards and the Cook went on Leave. Flanagan cooked the dinner and it went off fairly well. Very wild night.
The Battle is still raging in France, but our chaps are holding. Fritz back a bit now.

Friday 29 Good Friday
"Titch" Freeman went away today on a Farming stunt, for a month. Carr took over the Corporals Job at No 3 Mess, and "Sunny" got a stripe at No 1 Mess.
