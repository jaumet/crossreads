<p>Tuesday 24 October 1916<br/>A cold miserable day with MUD everywhere, &amp; a good deal of drizzling rain. Left Fricourt abt. 9 o'c. &amp; very slowly &amp; with many blocks made our way along crowded roads, indescribably muddy, to a hillside close to where Mametz once stood. Here was another sort of camp capable of giving shelter to abt. 50&percnt; of our brigade. We reached it abt. 2 o'clock &amp; found the mud simply awful. 5 of us had a tent pitched in the mud, &amp; were fortunate to have that much. Although within distant shell fire, here was a brigade massed together, but no shells came over. In spite of all the hardship &amp; discomfort the men were cheerful &amp; in a remarkably short time made some sort of shelter for themselves, some digging dug-outs in a bank, others covering shell-holes with waterproof sheets, &amp; so on. After some hot tea turned in &amp; slept well.</p>
