<p>Not a handmade  very useful. Wish some letters from home would come before I leave.</p>
<p>Wonder if I shall see you before this reaches you. Hope Mother is quite better   &amp;  Ethel had a delightful holiday. Oh, I received one letter from Jane from Talbot. Trust Eddy is keeping well   &amp;  getting stronger. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
