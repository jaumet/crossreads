<p>is simply charming.  Am more than ever in love with this old, dirty place.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is so clear &amp; the sunsets &amp; sunrise are too grand for me to explain.  Dorothy &amp; I have a lovely view from our window of the Pyramids &amp; The Citadel and an eminence camp on the Desert.  The whole place is simply packed with Military people.</p>
<p>No doubt you will be surprised to know that George &amp; Norman called to see me last night.  It was a great surprise, but I was on duty until 8 p.m. and then I had another engagement.</p>
<p>Anyhow we talked for a few minutes poor old Norman, looked very tired he had travelled a long way to come to see George &amp; I, and was returning this morning by the 7 a.m. train, he does not know when he will be able to get up again.  He brought me a lovely present, a nice little camera a No. 2 <u>Brownie</u></p>
