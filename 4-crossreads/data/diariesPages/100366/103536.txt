Today is really the worst day on record and to cap all I have very sever pains in my tummie, which give me gip. It is absolutely impossible to keep dry and warm. The wind goes right through us and the rain beats into every corner. This is one of the many hardships which we have to contend with and I honestly admit that it is fairly breaking my heart. God, what a country, Egypt was hot without any rain but this dam place has never been dry since we arrived here, and cold well I don’t think I will ever get warm again. Wet blankets to sleep in – consequently I am in a mad rage.

There is a very fierce battle going on which does not improve matters by any means and the Germans are tearing the shells in like fury. Of course they are not having it their own way by any means. The Bavarians are attacking the Australian 4th Division and so far they have not done much more than get themselves slaughtered. There is an unofficial rumour of another naval battle also Germans declared on Roumania.
