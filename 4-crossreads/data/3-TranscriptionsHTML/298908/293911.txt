<p>Well I am satisfied that I have not lost all my nerve yet, after this afternoon, ever since I came on board this boat one of my big back teeth has been aching mad, a perfect brute, &amp; my face had swollen badly, I could get no enjoyment neither could I eat nor sleep, so I decided to see a dentist Sgt. &amp; see if he could do anything for me so after dinner I asks him about it &amp; he took me into the dispensary &amp; had a look at the brute, well he said Sgt. we have not got a syringe on board so I can't give you any cocaine, but if you are game enough to have it out without anything I'll do my best for you.  This put the wind up me properly for I had never taken such a thing as this into consideration &amp; I am a regular coward even with cocaine.  I began to turn things over in my mind, &amp; I came to the conclusion that it had to come out &amp; it would be better to put up with perhaps 3 minutes</p>
