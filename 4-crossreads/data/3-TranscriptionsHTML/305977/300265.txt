<p>&amp; the chief medical officer inspected us to see if we were still fit.  There is some talk of us having a spell.  The Genl I heard describing his experiences.  The boat he was on was torpedoed.  It was bringing to Lemnos some of the 6th Inf Brigade.  He said there was no confusion whatever.  Col Linton &amp; a few others were drowned.  The Turkish artillery have been very quiet lately.  This afternoon our artillery sent a good few rounds across, but the Turkish reply was very weak.</p>
<p>Monday 13th [Sept]<br/>The navy bombarded in the south again this morning, but I don't think it was followed by any infantry attack.  Our Squadron was relieved in the afternoon &amp; we came over to the supports behind the firing line.  Dick Farley &amp; Jock Reid went away sick today.  Our troop is still about the strongest.  We have 20 men in it now.</p>
<p>Tuesday 14th<br/>Artillery on both sides were active</p>
