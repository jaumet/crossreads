Wednesday 9thUsual early morning pilgrimage to the stables and then we were put on mending cables This lasted all day & is not too bad work. Walked to Haynes in evening.
Thursday 10thRepairing cables again. Worked seriously interupted by arrival of mail. There were 9 letters for me and we were all very glad to receive them. They make up all the letters which I should have received & none now appear missing Spent evening in writing
Friday 11thSpent morning on air line work and received good tips from an officer who was a sergt. in the Royal Engrs. & was 11 months at the front. Repairing cable again in afternoon and spent evening on parade ground on Fire alarm practice. Just when I was going to settle down to write we had to go on parade & say there 1 1/2 hours. Received 3 Australian letters today
Saturday 12thWent out with wagon as No. 7 which is generally easy. The hedges on the side of the road made it very hard and I worked harder this morning than I have ever worked I think. That say a very great lot indeed.
