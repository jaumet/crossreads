  
 Wed. 24.  What an exciting day.  About 2 am the doctor came round & flashed his torch on each Bed.  I wondered what was up.  Later on the Nurses came & read out a list of names of men who were marked out.  Almost everybody was going.  Only Smithy (K.R.R.) & McLean (Niagara Falls) & myself were left in our ward.  The Q.M. & her assistants were flying around with Blue suits & Pyjamas & the place was in an uproar.  Smithy & I went out on to the verandah.  I was just settling down to write to B.E. when Nurse Wilson came along & said "Come on Moore, you're next".  Gee! I did get a shock.  There were no blue suits left so they dressed me up in a suit of pyjamas & a long blue coat.  I look like Chu-Chin-Chow.  Just after dinner they put us aboard the Cars & we came away to the 2nd Eastern Gen Hosp. [Brighton] 
 Queen Mary Ward We came right along the Sea Front & got a good view of the town, which is very fine.  After a few hours messing around they brought us along to the Queen Mary Ward & we went to Bed again.  It was visiting day & quite a number of Ladies came around & had a yarn.  One of 'em gave me a Bunch of very sweet grapes & a Girl gave me a Bun (After a thorough search I found 2 currants in it)  At Tea Time they brought around a big lump of cake which one of the Nurses had made so we had quite a good feed. 
 Thur. 25.  This morning the Doctor came round & had a look at us.  Then one of the Nurses dressed my Leg.  She was quite sore because I told her the wound was nearly healed.  She probed it, & said it was not at all healed. Then she put about 2 ft of packing in it, so it looks as though I'm not going to walk on it yet for a few days.  Com. Letter 41
