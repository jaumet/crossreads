16/2/19 Bonn
smaller than Cologne. The streets were full of a Sunday crowd and many shops were open. Crowds of fine looking healthy young men many in partly military attire and bearing the army stamp. The girls fresh natural looking ? many very pretty. The buildings very fine and solidly picturesque ? little difference between here and England. The usual number of squares and all the shops well stocked. Clothes seem shoddy shabby and cheap while boots have cloth tops wood soles. Some excitement was caused by an armed guard marching up a squad of arrested civilians some of whole looked very surly. To us everyone was servilely civil and much saluting and crawling. Noticed a church 1692 and could not but be struck with the prosperous solid look of Beethoven's home town
