His description of the journey begins in the northern part of the Indian Ocean, the ship’s arrival in Fremantle, then Adelaide and finally Melbourne where he disembarked and travelled by train through to Sydney Central Station. He writes of being met by family friends, arriving home and the Peace Celebrations in Sydney. He gains employment in September in the painting trade with Wintle & Wintle, contractors at Mosman Bay.]
