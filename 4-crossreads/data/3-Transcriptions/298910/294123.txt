<p>or perhaps a spy as 3 were caught to day. Partys on excavating &ndash; several got out alive &ndash; Two French M.P.s are missing as they slept in the cellars.</p>

<p>Dull &ndash; very cold &ndash; several snow storms. Very quiet day &amp; few casualtys. About all the missing have been recovered from the Town Hall, which is now hard to recognize as once being a fine building. I visited the Bapaume Cemetery &ndash; which is very fine &amp; some beautiful Tombs &amp; Headstones of marble &amp; granite are to be seen. The Huns here have further outraged the French people &amp; civilization by tearing up French graves &amp; burying some 1000 odd soldiers &ndash; also obliterated head stones &amp; re painted. The French have erected a monument in honour of her fallen soldiers also to commemorate the Recapture of Bapaume in 1871 &ndash; The Huns have erected a monument some 50 yards away as a set off against this to the memory of their dead, also to celebrate his taking of Bapaume 1914-1915. No doubt</p>
