My dearest Father,By last nights mail I received your very welcome letter of 3rd Sept. also Ols of same date.  Thank you both for news & letters they are very eagerly looked for I can assure you.As I write the rain is pouring down, & has done so on & off for the past 48 hours.  As a result the ground & roads are very sloppy & wetA very pretty picture presents itself as I write here for we have only been here a few days.  Looking away over cultivation paddocks in the distance is the village church with its big square tower looking very grand & imposing.  A white, (though at present muddy) road winds from the church past my billet, on one side of which is a combined hedge of holly, hawthorn, & blackberries which by the way are quite ripe now, & many a feed  I've had in this country during the past few weeks of ripe blackberries.  Dotted among the paddocks which are green with horse-radishes, & a kind of very coarse turnips, are the red-roofed farm houses   In one corner of a paddock, now lying fallow
