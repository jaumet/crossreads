Saturday 1 JuneGlorious weather still prevails. The Boshe has been shelling heavily with very heavy stuff on our left in direction of Caestre.  He caused a couple of big fires. To-morrow night a stunt is expected, an attack on Mont de Merris, the post from where the Germans can observe very well the flat country below Strazeele.  We most likely will go up. News from South is a little reassuring.
