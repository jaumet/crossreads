<p>Diary No 2</p>
<p>Written 28/11/1916 in France at Steenwick near Bailleul. <br/>While keeping my first diary dealing with out voyage to England and our sojourn there at Lark Hill Wiltshire I was able to send home fully detailed letters, and consequently the diary was merely a rough outline of our experiences. But now that we are at last on real active service here in France will endeavour to give a fuller account as we will in all certainty be able only to send scensored letters limited in number and length.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have had little chance of late of writing up a diary and am obliged to look back to the events of the closing days of Oct 1916. As I explained in my letters of that time it was arranged amongst us by the Captain , for our mutual benefit that I should exchange permanent positions with a young chap of the Ninth Field Ambulance who had been temporarily attached to our detail during the absence in hospital of one of the detail <br/>Ste Bie.</p>
