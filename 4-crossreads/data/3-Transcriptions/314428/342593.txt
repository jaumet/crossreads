<p>Mr Beer, a report concerning the Progress of my shorthand class.<br/>[lines written in shorthand]<br/>At noon today we were in latitude 40&deg;24' S., longitude 87&deg; 44' south east, course S. 88 E., distance 303 miles.  Steaming time 23 hours, 3 minutes.  Average speed 12.8 miles.  Distance to Adelaide 2409 miles.  Temperature 6o, wind west north west.</p>
<p>There is a marked difference between this voyage and the voyage coming over. One of the most noticeable is that lights are shining brilliantly on deck and below, with the port holes open. Coming over all was in darkness and the Port holes had to be kept shut when the lights were on.</p>
<p>On this ship gambling goes on unheeded and discipline is very lax, while on the Persic gambling was rigorously suppressed, while discipline, though it was not severe, was observed. Again there were a few parades and physical jerks nearly every morning and occasionally during the day with lectures on military subjects. On this boat all that is absent, except a very rare fire alarm which is carried out in a desulatory way. There are a very few fatigues, which amounts to answering the roll, taking their stations</p>
