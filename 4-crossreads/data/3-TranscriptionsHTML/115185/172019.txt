<p>4 &ndash; I am grateful to you my sweetest Mother for keeping me so well posted in news of Bill. I am very thankful to hear about his getting a job &ndash; and will write to him now to Leeton &ndash; short letters to himself &ndash; short letters to himself &ndash; you have been wonderfully patient to him. I do hope you will have the satisfaction now of seeing his life one that will cause respect from his wife and children and him a useful member of society.<br/>Father indeed has had great &amp; bitter trials and no one realizes more his blessed patience and unselfishness and cheerfulness than his squibby little daughter here. How I wish anything I could do could alter some of his terrible disappointments. I know it is because of my mothers failures and selfish weaknesses that Father is not at present able to give his valuable council and judgement and help to our country in this eventful time. They should themselves have been able to be very useful men and have at this time, both of them in these days of great opportunities, careers of which Father could be proud. It almost seems extraordinary that they are so useless</p>
