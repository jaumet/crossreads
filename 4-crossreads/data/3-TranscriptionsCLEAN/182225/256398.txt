 1916   FRIDAY 6   OCTOBER 
 Raining all day and its very miserable weather altogether. With the signalers in the morning. The signalers race was run off in the aftrenoon & the 27 th  Battery won it. We were the only ones that got the message through. Poss, Bill & I went to the pictures in evening & they were about the worst show I have seen here. Got a pair of socks from Coomoo Coomoo & a letter from Linda.
