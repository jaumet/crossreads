<p>about a week at a time and the men have been able to resume duties little the worse for their experience.<br/>It was the Major's intention to leave for Finsch Hafen tonight at midnight in the "Davapia", but  when I told him of the sea that was running (we had a lovely time in the "Lili") he decided to wait till daylight. On our run back our dinghy broke adrift &amp; things were pretty rapid for a while trying to pick it up again. It was the biggest sea I had been in in the "Lili", &amp; she behaved very well, albeit she jumped about "considerable". (re Commd. Beresford)<br/>Sun 22nd 10 am : We had Divisions at 9.30 this morning a-la-Navy. Just prior to this I had a visit from Mr. Penn, who was accompanied by his wife &amp; two children. He had come to ask our help in quietening the natives on the island of Malamal, who are getting out of hand. I promised to go down in the "Lili" this afternoon. Mr. Penn, who is Dutch, has a plantation about two miles from here.<br/>7 pm : The best afternoon I have put in since leaving Sydney, a combination  of business &amp; pleasure. We went to Mr Penn's plantation in the "Lili" where he and Dr Kloster came aboard &amp; we then proceeded to Malamal. The natives were in full warpaint, but the Tul-tul (chief) was away ("gone along bush"). We ordered them to being him back; this they proceeded to do by beating on the tom-tom. While awaiting his arrival we visited his house &amp; also entered the devil house where the natives carried out a few of their sorceries for our benefit. Growing impatient of the Tul tul's tardiness we harangued such of the natives as were present &amp; threatened to cook (set fire to) their devil's house unless they quietened down, &amp; ordered the Tul tul to visit me at Alexis Hafen. We then returned to the plantation; on our way we passed the Tul tul making all haste to return</p>
