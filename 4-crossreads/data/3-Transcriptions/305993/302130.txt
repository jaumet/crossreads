Thousands of soldiers were in front &amp; following with bugles &amp; empty kerosene tins slung around their necks making a terrible noise &amp; sad to say, some drunks amongst them rushed off &amp; smashed up shop windows even pulling glass cases &amp; glass doors &amp; breaking things up in general to the disgust of the majority of the soldiers &amp; civilians.  The police native &amp; patrols were not sufficient to deal with the disturbance.  Consequently at 8.30 p.m. all hotels &amp; shops were closed yet it still went on.  Also marching through each picture show with flags flying as they the mob passed.

All the hotels &amp; the shops closed this day.  The City paraded by a very strong patrol composed of troops &amp; blue jackets each patrol in charge of a officer, so that no damage was done this day everything quiet &amp; peaceful.  We are still being under a overhaul having our troop decks fitted out for white troops</p>
