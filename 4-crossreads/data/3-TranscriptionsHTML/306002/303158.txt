<p>22.5.15<br/>Sat. 22nd.  I believe the Turkish Field Marshall was at the beach yesterday having a consultation with Sir Ian Hamilton.  Rain commenced to fall soon after sunrise this morning.  We tied two waterproof sheets over our dug-out &amp; managed to keep dry:  a lovely afternoon although clouds are still hanging about.  Sergeant Paul was sniped to-day while in his dug-out, it is said he is dying &amp; was shot through the head;  practically no fighting to-day although the Turks have been busy all the afternoon with shrapnel on the beach.  We are getting very good food here &amp; plenty of it, quite a change from Heliopolis.  To-day is the first that our aeroplace [aeroplane?] has not been seen or heard by us since we arrived here.  The weather here has been perfect &amp; we are having a good holiday with just enough danger to make it interesting.</p>
