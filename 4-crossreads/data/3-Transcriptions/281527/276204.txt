<p>13/3/18  La Basse Ville</p>
<p>Kennedy. A fairly heavy gun duel now sprang up on both sides and there was plenty of ironmongery flying round. Kennedy was ill with trench fever. Got a runner here to take us to No 9 post but soon found that he was quite at sea and made for 'B' Co headquarters. Here picked up another runner and went out to Nos 1 &amp; 2 posts overlooking the river and had a talk with the men there, They can hear the Hun transport coming up and the drivers speaking to their horses. Very few flares were going up on the front tonight. Walked round a new sap to No. 3 post and then along through 4, 5 &amp; 6. The men were at work building little possies of sandbags to ward off  blowbacks</p>
