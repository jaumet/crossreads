<p>Monday 12 March 1917 [11 March 1918]<br/>Feeling very anxious re home affairs these days &amp; no work to help cloak the anxiety &amp; worry.<br/>Life is a sad thing with poor Eva's affairs in such chaos &amp; to think that she could be treated so by the very two people one thought would have been best to her.<br/>Truly one feels glad that our dear Father was spared this last most awful blow that has ever fallen on our family &ndash; disgrace never attacked us before though fire, flood, drought, rabbits, &amp; long years of toiling under a burden of debt robbed our parents &amp;, in a way, ourselves, of much of the pleasure of life.  Still this is a cruel blow &amp; one that our little mother little deserved in the last lonely years of her life.</p>
