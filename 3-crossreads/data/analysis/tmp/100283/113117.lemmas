 Thing have clear up it is a glorious sunni morn like a Spring morn in Tasmania not a cloud in the sky bird sing everywher , you would scarc know that a war was on save for the incess never end growl rumbl of the gun in the distanc , the stream of traffic on the road the steadi hum of the plane overhead , everyth els seem so peac calm quiet .
