<p>1 December 1914<br/>Tuesday Reached Suez at 9<br/>Sailed 6 weeks Vic</p>
<p>Revielle at 6<br/>Entered the Suez Bay proper at 9 this morning &amp; found some of the other division fleet but during the afternoon they moved into the canal. Each boat is equipped with a huge searchlight fitted to the bow of the vessel &amp; steams only 4 knots. Suez is divided into 3 ports British French &amp; Arab all round the coast guards are constantly on the watch for gun running. Two more British gunboats in port. Arabs come round &amp; fruit is better than Colombo the mouth of the canal is hardly noticable only marked by a buoy. On the left of Suez is a huge slate &amp; granite quarry with a railway attached to same. News comes to hand that Russia has surrounded the main German army &amp; is now starving it into submission also that British officers are home on leave. Toby has his automatic pinched. Search ship on trace of it</p>
<p>2 December 1914<br/>Wednesday Indian fleet arrives<br/>14 weeks of soldiering</p>
<p>Revielle at 6<br/>The first thing that greeted us while drawing feed was a huge line of ships on the horizon in about an hours time they turned out to be an Indian contingent of 21 ships escorted by a French dreadnought cruiser. The [indecipherable] are mainly regiments returning home &amp; Indian reinforcements for the fist army. Our lamp arrives &amp; is fitted by two French engineers &amp; now are only awaiting the Pilot &amp; our turn is next for the "Geelong" left last. We got our extra dose of inoculation this afternoon &amp; is likely to prove troublesome. Boat leaves for [indecipherable] for further medicine. Corp Reid held a demonstration of hypotism &amp; among one of his items was trying to find Toby's [indecipherable] by the aid of hypotism &amp; he nearly did for he found a strange one. Horses are looking splendid &amp; are now on heavy feed again expect to be unloading day after tomorrow.</p>
