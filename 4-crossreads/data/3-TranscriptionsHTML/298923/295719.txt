<p>22 February 1918 Friday<br/><strike>On Outpost Jordan Valley</strike><br/>Five Taubes flew over, but did not bomb us, clouds too low-   Jacko kept his Field guns going last night but seems to have gone this morning-  <strike>The Infantry are now up &amp; we withdraw towards Jerusalem </strike>-  The Turks cut the tendons of an Arab's hand, who would not fight against us-  we found him in <strike>Jericho</strike><br/>Curlew were heard last night &amp; this morning some Native companions flew over-  Did not see anything of Jacko's launches which were reported on the Dead Sea- the scenery all round is very grand &amp; impressive-  I send you photo of the Cave Cell Monastery on the Mt of Temptation.</p>
