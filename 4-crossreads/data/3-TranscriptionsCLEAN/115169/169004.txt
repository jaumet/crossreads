  
 May 24th  At 6 PM Melbourne "Yarra" and "Huon" left for Port Melbourne May 26th  At 10 am we three arrived at Port Phillip and a similar welcome as at Sydney awaited us and a most enjoyable time was spent by all and at the conclusion of which the ships companies proceeded on extended leave and so ended a glorious and historical career in the Pioneer Australian man-o-war and though bloodless she had done her duty nobly and well, - for whether you be at grips with the enemy or patrolling the sea communications it is all a duty in war During hostilities the ship had travelled approximately 145,000 nautical miles not too bad a record and previously to war approximately 25,000 nautical miles
