but she seems a nice girl   &  will be able to tell you how I am.
My two patients may go to Southwell Gardens on Tuesday, what will become of me, I know not. No more Sisters for operation so far.
Had a letter from Dorothy the other day   &  they fearfully busy. She is silly staying there so long. She was looking very old, one the girls said   but don't say anything to her people. Poor Doth. has had another love disappointment, Some men are too wicked, they make desperate love   &  make the woman fond of his, then throw her aside like a broken toy. They are spoilt here, the English girls simply ruin our boys. Best to just have good pals   &  don't expect too much.
Have been busy sending a few cards etc to friends in France, now shall send my English   &  Scottish ones
