It is good job for me for I do nothing only make arrangements for the mens food & etc. & detail the parties off as wanted.
It was freezing cold last night but this morning is a beauty nice & sunny.
Through some mistake of the Q.M. we were not taken on to-days rations strength & so that meant that we had no tucker to go on with but I done a bit of scouting & got bread, tea, sugar, salt, jam & a box of "pork & beans & the cook bandicooted some potatoes from a neighbouring field so we did very well.
