  
 forenoon going through gass. Walked all told about 6 miles.  Had lectures. Gass Drill etc . Had to walk about 1/2 a mile with the Masks on  When we thought everything was finished & we had fallen in ready to move off there was a shout of Gass several smoke bombs were let off to windward & before we could get our masks on we were covered with very smellie smoke.  Harmless of course.  Got back to camp by 1 oclock & were warned that we were  on  to move up the line that night Started at 6 PM & marched to Le Harve about 4 miles
