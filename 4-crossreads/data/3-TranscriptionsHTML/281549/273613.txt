<p>the Battallion. During the day there were a large number of Aeroplanes overhead of both our own &amp; of the enemy.</p>
<p>Thursday the 15-2-17 The enemy exploded one of our ammunition &amp; shell dumps. They dropped a bomb on to it from an aeroplane flying about 2,000 ft above it, The shock of the explosion was very severe &amp; was felt quite plainly for miles away. I was inspected by the Doctor to-day &amp; afterwards I was given a little more practice at Bomb throwing. <br/>On the 16th there was very heavy bombardments at the front all night long, In the morning I had some more Bomb throwing practice.</p>
<p>On Sunday 18-2-17 I walked to the town of Albert &amp; over the battlefields surrounding, to have a look at what the Hun had done.</p>
<p>The town of Albert is for the most part utterly ruined, The beautiful Cathedral which stands in the centre of the town is absolutely in ruins &amp; past repair. The statue of the Maddona at the top of the spire is in the act of falling owing to the supports being shot away in places. French</p>
