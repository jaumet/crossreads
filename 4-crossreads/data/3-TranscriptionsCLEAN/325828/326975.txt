My dearest Father,There has been no Australian mail to hand since I last wrote on 3rd inst.  Haven't seen anything of Wal since his birthday a week ago.  Suppose you know he is a 2 star artist now.  The days are gradually closing in now, & it won't be long before winter is on us again.I am keeping well, & trust this finds all at "Cairnleith" in good health.No word from Rid since he first informed me he was wounded, so must take it for granted he is getting on alright.  Very cold nights here now,Love from Leo.
