September, 1915Friday 24My muscles are not working too well & I am going under Cholorform to have my leg stitched tomorrow so have to go without BreakFast. I go to Sulphur Baths daily I described these baths when we camped here at Heloman last March - A big buck nigger wraps a towel around you & then massages - Beautiful baths, with Electrical treatment & every form of Turkish Bath. In the visitors book can be seen the name of the Kaiser & most of the crowned heads of Europe. Maimed soldiers are the clients now.
