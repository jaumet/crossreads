<p>8.11.1916   4.15 P.M. bombardment on our left.  Heavy stuff coming over.  The 101st Howitzer Bty had one man killed and 2 wounded.  A shell landed in our horse lines last night, no damage done.  Corp Ansell arrived from base details, when we arrived in France he was left with kit bag at La Valentine.  Weather still wet and cold.  Gr Williams died of wounds.  This is a terrible hole, men and horses covered from head to foot in mud.  Hundreds going sick, I am suffering from a slight attack of dysentry.  40 officers short in Division.  Lieut George who was killed a few days ago, the biggest part found was a hand with a wristlet watch attached.  He was absolutely blown to particles.  One Bty in our Brigade has only 30 horses in action</p>
