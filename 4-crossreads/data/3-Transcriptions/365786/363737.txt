Britain has not been invaded, but she has none the lest to fight for her existence on foreign soil as Australia is fighting for <strike>ours</strike> hers.  To defend a coast of 9000 miles with our small population simply by a few ships (not even up to date ships) &amp; by a Home Defence Force is entirely impossible.  We can only <strike>secure</strike> preserve Australia's security by strengthening the hands of Britain in the peace negotiations &amp; in the bargainings which will come after.</p>
