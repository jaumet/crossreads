<p>Early morning parade is from 7 till 8.30 &amp; seemed rather long: we get a cup of tea, but the men get nothing before their breakfast at 8.30. forenoon parade is from 9.45 till 12.30 &amp; the afternoon on from 2 till 4.30.</p>
<p>The morning was dull with a light sprinkle of rain: we were inspected on the forenoon parade by Brigadier General Spencer Brown commanding the brigade, this taking all the morning. After lunch a smart shower of rain fell &amp; as we were about to fall in the "no parade" sounded, so that we had the afternoon off. The rain came thro the thatch (?) roof of the huts in all directions &amp; the men had to rig up their waterproof sheets to keep the rain off their gear, for there was a steady fall during the afternoon.</p>
<p>Just before dinner Lloyd Jones came along: he was about to leave with another detachment for Tel el Kebir, a further batch from our battalion also leaving very early the next morning. Another lecture by the adjutant at night.</p>
<p>Wednesday 16 February 1916</p>
<p>A bright clear day but rather cool: I found the breeze cold at times. Our Company was for duty &amp; had to supply guard &amp; all duties &amp; fatigues so that there were no men for parade &amp; I spent the day in chasing round looking after fatigue parties, &amp; in writing.</p>
