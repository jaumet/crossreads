I was just about to sit down write & growl at not having heard from you when into my tent steps an orderly bearing your two letters.   You seem to have had a nice day at Ealing with your Aunt Elizabeth - from the little I saw of Annette I should say that she will prove a very great friend to you while you are in England.   I was pleased to hear that you were thinking of settling in Ealing - I think it would be much nicer for you all & more especially for the children.  I have never liked the idea of those awful flights of stairs in Leinster Sq. - Sorry to hear of your Aunts Bella & Jessie's break up but they must both be very old ladies.I think a good high class boarding house would be most comfortable for you;   if you took either a house or a flat you would have all the worries of housekeeping.
