<p>in Le Barque off Blue-Cut Road just where "Fritz" has put an immense mine-crater to stop road transport.</p>
<p>Fri. Mar. 2nd.<br/>"Fritz" came at us early this morning with a strong force.<br/>He caught some posts napping but was driven off with far greater losses than our own.<br/>Our rate of going forward must be too rapid to suit his falling back for he attacked right along the 1st &amp; 2nd Brigade front.<br/>Big fog was on this morning &amp; "Fritz" actually got to the entrance of the underground dugout of "C" Company's Hqrs. &amp; put some bombs down.<br/>Losses on our side must be expected but we have lost some of our best men.<br/>Peter Tyson, Corp Hacker. Leiut Lane, Leake, Witheridge, Mount Stephens, Bach, Kinnard, Mallard, Skinner, Anderson, Wilson, Huckle &amp; Jim Moore were killed or wounded &ndash; mostly killed &amp;  four machine gunners are supposed to be prisoners.<br/>We captured 45 "Jerries" &amp; "imshied" many more off the planet.</p>
<p>Sun. Mar. 4th: -<br/>Relieved tonight by "A" Coy. &amp; went back to tunnel behind Guerre Trenches.</p>
