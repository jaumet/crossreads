10/5/16  Wednesday
Had the day off - but all leave was stopped couldn't leave the Camp - Got a letter from Bill Bedsor, said he was at Telekebar Camp & didn't like it after Cairo. All the Boys were issued with shorts - helmets - puttees - so as to be all uniformly dressed - as I have been wearing puttees & shorts for some time & I am as brown as a berry. All sorts of rumours going around, as to moving off & yet there are other rumours that 30,000 Turks are near our outposts looking for us - As far as the 15th F.A. are concerned, we have now all hands well trained & equipped to move off at an hours notice - also have rigged 5 - E.P. Tents for any casualtys & the transport is also 18 Carat - also 20 Camels with ambulance stretchers attached.
