Coy the worst.<br/>You can see quite plainly our observation balloon's up from here especially of an evening<br/>Out again this afternoon, the boys were in a bad humour  &amp; so was the Captain so things were anything but pleasant the boy's don't like the idea of the two parade's daily &amp; are kicking a bit over it, I can see some fun shortly if the parades are continued<br/>Our Colonel has gone to the trenches today to have a look at things<br/>This evening 2 other chaps &amp; myself went over to the Flying Corp's</p>
