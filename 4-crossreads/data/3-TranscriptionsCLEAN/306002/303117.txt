Awoke this morning at 5.30 feeling fit for anything, had a good breakfast & were on the road to Helouan at 9 oclock, had a very good trip & a nice breeze was blowing, the boats on the Canal were busy & were sailing along the Nile in great style.  We arrived at our destination at 2.30 & were soon settled, with the horses lined up facing the Tewfik Palace Hotel, we were off duty by 3.30 & then strolled to the Canteen & tested the Ice-creams & cakes, after tea we went to the Winter Palace Hotel & had supper for 10 pt. each & then played billiards till it was time to return to Camp.
