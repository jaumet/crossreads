<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Have not recieved any mail since last writing you. It is likely to arrive any time now. I am getting this letter away on the quiet. Everything is going well with me &amp; I am feeling tip top. I expect everything is hard in Sydney now. Never mind it may all be over this year Let us hope so. It is fine weather again so we are very thankful for that. My word I would like to be going on leave again.<br/>Don't get knocking those curious or trying to unscrew them. Did you recieve that photograph I had taken while at Tel-el-Kebir. I hope so. I had one taken while in London. I hope you recieve that also. I would like to be home for a feed of Chokos. They would be great.<br/>Hoping you are all well, best wishes &amp; love<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
