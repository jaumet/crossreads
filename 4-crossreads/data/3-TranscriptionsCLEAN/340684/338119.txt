  
 419 like the idea of a glass eye , its such an uncanny thing, looks so real and yet isn't. 
 Mrs Watson and Mrs Scott paid me a visit last Thursday. I had never met Mrs. Scott before. She is about the smallest person I have ever sen. I enjoyed their visit immensely they are both so amusing - Dr. Munro came this morning, he looks about 10 years younger than when I saw him last. He is working at Guy's Hospital. 
 The girls are coming up tomorrow. It is a lucky time for me their being in England just at this time. I wrote to Sir G Reid yesterday about my transfer and hope to hear something definite shortly , Of course if it should happen that I have to lose my eye everything will be up a tree  as regards further active service - kindest love hoping you are well Your affectionate nephew Gibson McMillan
