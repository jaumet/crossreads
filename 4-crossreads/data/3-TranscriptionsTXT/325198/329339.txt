[Contd. from page 154]Our arguments continue till tea timeOn subjects we all know aboutAnd during the noise amidst all the boysOld Pippo starts yelling [indecipherable]
But although we argue & argueAnd that to only one thing all agreeWhich is of course & that I think you'll endorseThat we'll soon be "civvies" & free
So here health to Australia & EnglandAnd a curse to the bumper of warAnd that Mothers & sisters & sweethearts are happyIs the wish of the Permanent Four
