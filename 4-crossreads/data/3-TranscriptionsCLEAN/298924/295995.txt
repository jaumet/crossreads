Monday 13 January 1919Squadron drill & building Cookhouses - out of mud.  100 more Horses shot today, no one wants them when they are old & their eyes have grown hollow.  Wood is very scarce & we are now issued with a cotton oil seed cap & fine coal neither very serviceable.  At Neby Musa near Jordan there is a shale depos. that burns very well when once lighted but the powers that be do not appear to realize it.
