<p>May 14th<br/>Up at 3am 18 miles today.  The track very dusty &amp; weather extremely hot.  A party of nomads were sighted a few miles ahead when we started &amp; and after going a couple of hours, a group of Kurds rushed them from a sheltered valley.  Our advance guard hopped in &amp; and the Kurds soon got tho about 20 remained on the road &amp; cooly watched us pass.  The Nomad outfit was a scream, about 30 people in all, driving a flock of sheep, a few cows &amp; carrying all their paraphanalia, fowls tied by the legs in pairs slung over the backs of quiet sheep.  The shelters strapped to the cows.  The men riding small pack donkeys &amp; the women walking carrying spare gear.  We escorted them as far as our camp.</p>
