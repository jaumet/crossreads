<p>Wednesday 19 April 1916<br/>A cold &amp; showery morning &amp; as I was not feeling too good did not get up early. As orderly officer stayed in the lines instead of going out to the Training Ground. Not very much to do during the morning &amp; stayed in tent most of time. In the afternoon went up to Ordnance with Prescott to get some clothing &amp; on the way back called at Etaples for afternoon tea &amp; going home we were caught in a very heavy storm of rain. Glad of a hot bath in a wash basin of water.</p>
