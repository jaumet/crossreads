<p>in the town hall which had a fine floor where we slept comfortably<br/>14.10.16 Next morning after some preliminary wandering about started on the way through Abneke and with a strong wind we finally started at about 11 o'clock and arrived at about 3.30 at Watten just through the town and are camped in a farm where there are 8 Belgian refugees. Before entering the town we climbed a high hill from which we obtained a fine view of the surrounding town and on the top was an old chateau guarded by two forts with sentries over them. The town also has a trench system protecting it. The view was very beautiful with winding canals, railways, houses and farms. in the evening after obtaining a leave pass we went into Watten although supposed to be out of bounds and had a good look round at the fair sized town. We struck a brewery and had on inspection and were offered a drink of gin, rum, whiskey, brandy, <strike>rum</strike> or wine and had a brandy which was very good and on the way home some beer and "malagher". This seems to be our permanent training place.<br/>15.10 16 Parade at 9.30 to 11.30 for rifle inspection and drill and also at 2 to &ndash; 4 and in the evening I went early to bed. it was very cold and looked frosty.<br/>16.10.16 Very cold last night and it rained a bit Dare &amp; Kernot came in very "boozed".
