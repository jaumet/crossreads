<p>Tuesday 9th April 1917 [1918]<br/>How shall I fill in this quiet day?  Still I feel like a piece of busy timber on life's ocean that a quiet firm hand has pulled gently to one side for a few weeks in the still water &amp; here I lie letting all the rush &amp; toil of life go by &amp; obliged, for once, to think &amp; see whether am tending on the stream.<br/>S. Moore, true Scot that she is, points the way today by bringing a bible for me to study &amp; I realize again part of the purpose for which this little quiet space came into my life.  10.30 a.m. comes the C.O. &amp; tells me I look better, do they know we are really human beings these pts. of theirs I wonder?</p>
