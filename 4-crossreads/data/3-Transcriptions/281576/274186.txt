<p>Poor old McDougall was evacuated with piles just before I left.  Stan Wright is working in the Orderly Room &amp; is quite well again. This Rest Camp is quite a big concern, carry well over a thousand patients.  I quiet expected to be sent back to the Line again, but Major Bond informed me that he had a Job for me here, for which I am not sorry.  We are arranging another Concert &amp; tonight we held the first meeting.  The last Concert was not too successful as most of the crowd had bad colds (especially Bobby Roberts) &amp; they took strong doses of Mist. Tussi, which made them feel a bit "off colour".  Hock Douch arrived back from Blighty just in time to take part in the Concert.</p>
<p>Fri. FEB. 9.  Lill's Mother's Birthday.<br/>This morning Serg. Fry put me in charge of the Blanket Store, which is a sweet Job.  I'm hoping to get time to write a few Letters now.  Last Thursday I got a lovely parcel from Lill, containing just the blooming things I most wanted.  Good for you L.A.  It's a treat to get a bit of decent tobacco again.  I made a Table &amp; fixed up the Store, making it as snug as possible as I have to sleep there &amp; also take my meals.  Jimmy Whip is going to sleep here also to keep me company.  After Tea we had a rehearsal &amp; things went off fairly well.  Commenced a Letter to M.S.  The weather is fine &amp; clear, but very cold.  The nights are almost as light as day &amp; a Fritz plane comes over every night &amp; drops a few bombs.  They call him "Midnight Charlie".</p>
