<p>(74)<br/>26th July 1917. The last few days I had been mess room orderly for my daily job. Now at 6pm I went on guard that is gas picket and question answerer at the gate. During  the evening Fritz came over and dropped some bombs before reaching us, but  kept the remainder till he reached the aerodrome where he dropped them causing a little damage to some planes and much excitement in our horse lines near the drome.<br/>27th July 1917 Coming off guard at 6pm I walked into Bailleur and had my photo taken by a woman there. I was wearing the green band issued to us as a distinguishing armlet for a coming stunt.<br/>28th July On fatigue emptying water carts into tanks with buckets<br/>In the late afternoon Norman Rosenthal and I walked through St Jans Cappel to Mont des C&atilde;ts. This hill standing about 100 metres high affords a very fine and extensive view in all directions.</p>
