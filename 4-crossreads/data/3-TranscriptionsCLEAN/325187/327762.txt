  
 [Monday  January 17 1916] Capt of Day. Sand 2 ft deep Tent pegs won't hold, Camel Corps passed & frightened all the Horses which pulled up the Lines   Could hardly see for dust   The Tucker saved from Xmas parcels &  Billies came in most handy, as no fires could be lit.  A regular Darling Show only worse It is all Desert here a few Hares & Gazelles & plenty of Camels.  Scorpions are fairly numerous but few men get bitten. The Horses are small & wiry & are accustomed to go for 2 days without WATER.
