<p>to wait a move.</p>
<p>On the 26th of Jany we got word to get our Rifles and equipment cleaned as we were leaving shortly and never shall I forget the sight they looked when we took them off the wall. Everything was covered in Soot and as black as the ace of Spades, Long whiskers of soot hung from our gas helmets and water bottles while the inside of our rifles was choked up.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 29th of January we entrained at Samer and pulled out once more for Daylight Corner and our old Camp at Dranoutre where we arrived about 8-30 pm.</p>
<p>On the 31st of January I left Dranoutre with Frank Wright and Fred Hanser for a station at Ravine Wood on the left of our old position where we stopped for 4 days. The photo on the next page was taken by Fred Hanser soon after our arrival but is very dull</p>
