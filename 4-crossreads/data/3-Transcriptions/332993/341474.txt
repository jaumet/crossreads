<p>towards morning. It was mostly by guns in action. The bombardment is being continued today. The noise of the big mines at Messines exploding was heard in the S.E. of England. Mr. Lloyd George rose at 3. a.m. on Thursday at Walton Heath near London to hear the great British mines explode in Flanders. The distance is approximately 140 miles The sound would travel that distance in about 12 minutes. The French are delighted with the great success. No series counter attack has come from the enemy as yet, but it is expected, for this is a blow at the vitals of the enemy. The papers give fuller details of the battle but report no fresh fighting &amp;amp say nothing about Ostend, or other fronts.<br/>Yesterday we had an issue of tobacco, matches &amp;amp cigarettes. I have yet 2 tins of Australian tobacco that I received in a parcel from my wife about a fortnight ago.<br/>Our rations lately have been poor, and short. This is the first time that I have had cause to complain since I have been in France. The big push is no doubt the cause of it, coupled with a very poor cook in the Transport section.<br/>Our Battalion <strike>again goes into</strike> does not  [go into] the trenches to night. They deserve a longer rest after the strenuous time they had a few days ago.<br/>This past five days there have been scarsely any enemy aeroplanes about. They have lost a lot lately, &amp;amp get a very hot reception every time they come over here.<br/>It is reported here that the enemy out of spite is shelling Armentieres. It is of no military value to him, &amp;amp endangers the lives</p>
