made us seek shelter but fortunately no one was hurt. Then returned home via Blangy Tronville. Today is a midsummers day with a cool breeze and warm hot sun. Heard today that General Paton goes home and General Robertson comes back here. After dinner walked down to Blangy Tronville a pleasantly situated little place but getting warworn and ill used owing to constant traffic and clouds of dust. Found Col. James and spent a good long evening yarning with him. On the front darkness fell quietly except for the dull boom of heavy guns and long flashes of fire leaping out from their muzzles. Home at 11 pm and got word that Harricks was awarded the M.C.
