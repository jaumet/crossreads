<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">famous battle field regions of the Somme.&nbsp; After a very hard and fatiguing march, made all the worse by the excessive weight of our packs, consequent upon the additional load they were made to carry in the shape of the rations,with which we provided ourselves yesternight.&nbsp; We felt like unloading the stuff many times on the road, so as to lighten our loads, but we had to learn what a godsend this extra rationing was to us at supper time on many a night after we joined our company.&nbsp; We arrived at Mametz about 2.&nbsp; Detailed to hut, taken on ration strength, company strength, and all the rest of the things that a soldier does when he joins his company, including the sewing on his sleev-es of the colors which designate the brigade, company or division, and nature of the regiment to which he is attached.&nbsp; Larsen and I went for a stroll over the fields whereon our Australian soldiers had proved to the world their invincibility as soldiers, but a few weeks before our arrival there.&nbsp; Returned to camp for tea and attended a concert in the YMCA after given by Fifth Divisional Concert Co.</td>

<p>Time spent in training, fatigues for Sports and Show, which are to be held on the Recreation Grounds below the camp.</p>
<p>Sports turned out to be a very tame affair.&nbsp; In the morning of the day which these were held, we had our first experience of witnessing a visit of a Fritz plane coming over and being bombarbed by anti-guns.&nbsp; Found it rather thrilling and fascinating.</p>
