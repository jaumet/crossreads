<p>digging holes for those that get blown out &ndash; We had none hit yesterday &ndash; a record thank goodness &ndash; owing to a little more care being taken &amp; the sniping not quite so accurate. &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
<p>Yesterday I handed over the Regt. for a time to Major Reid &amp; went with Capt Lawry &amp; Clark down to the beach for a swim. Met several friends in several garbs on the way down &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
<p>The beach is [indecipherable] wonderful &ndash; although every day they are shelled &amp; men get killed, the place is alive with men carrying stores, sorting out equipment &amp; arms gathered in the hills &amp; gullies from the dead, sailors off the ships, Indians with mules going to &amp; fro, Turkish prisoners allowed to bathe as a necessity &ndash; just like Manly with the exception of the feminine side. There is only a narrow strip some 40 ft wide of stones &amp; then the hills.</p>
<p>We had a splendid swim &ndash; no fear of sharks, sandy bottom, &amp; felt much cleaner. As we are short of water here we are not allowed to wash &ndash; but have sufficient for shaving &amp; teeth: there should be more after this rain.</p>
<p>The valley is not echoing today with the crack &amp; rattle of rifle fire &amp; bombs &amp; we are going deaf with the stillness &ndash; its so funny &amp; we still shout at each other to cover up the tragedies with the extreme of mirth.</p>
<p>The next two Brigades, (the same arm as ourselves) have just arrived, &amp; their worst shock while dojding from barricade to barricade up our valley, is the mortuary which is at the bottom of poor B Sqdn Lines.</p>
