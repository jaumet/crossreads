<p>November 1916<br/>14th   We are still on the drain job &amp; have the same party as we had yesterday.  I have two other sappers to help me, &amp; have started on a bridge which is to be made on a road where the drain goes under.  One of Fritzs planes flew over &amp; dropped four bombs near us, wounding two of the Tommies, but he was brought down in flames about ten minutes later, a few miles away, near Mametz Wood.  We have heard that successful attacks have been made by our boys on the morning of the 12th &amp; also at night, &amp; another yesterday morning.  Over 3000 German</p>
