 Dear George, Will answer your letter later on. Have just a few minutes to get into bed before Lights Out. I am going to play Hockey this year instead of Football. It is a good game. I still  ride the Bike to Salisbury. It is O.K. as long as it does not rain or snow. I would not attempt it then. Had a letter from Fitzhough last mail. I have answered it. Give regards to all the Boys & Remember me to OJ, Jim Ryan etc & Mr Love.  Best wishes to all The Miles. Lily & Her Mother & boy & yourself.   Harry
