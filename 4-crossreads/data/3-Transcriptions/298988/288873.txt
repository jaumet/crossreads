<p>11.30 p.m.  Have had several Australian Soldiers on board this evening.  They mostly come for cigarettes &amp; tobacco as none of the ships here except us have any.  They told us some great tales of deeds done ashore.  We suffered a bit of a reverse last night.  Our men first of all took two rows of trenches &amp; they tried to get some more, but mysteriously the Turks were reinforced &amp; drove them back &amp; they lost the two rows of Trenches they had taken &amp; it is said that we had 2,000 casualties.  Other reports say that our losses were not so heavy &amp; that both the wings advanced whilst only the centre was driven back.  It is agreed however that we lost fairly heavily.  I believe they are not going to try &amp; advance again until heavy reinforcements arrive.  A big batch of Kitcheners new army is expected here within two or three days.  Our men tell some stirring tales.  One Irishman (Paddy Ryan) of the 3rd Aust Infantry Brigade, had a big sward, bent like a scythe &amp; on board the ship he had been sharpening it up every day, the whole while swearing vengeance on the Turks.  When they were landing on the first day in the first attack at dawn, they lost all their Officers, &amp; this chap threw his rifle away &amp; yelled to the rest "Come on boys," at em." &amp; they charged the hill with fixed bayonets,</p>
