a bad cold. Reached Paris at 7.45 pm and had a great hunt for taxi a small boy contemptuous of 2c tip found a taxi at last. Drove to Hotel Continental and secured a room. Many places decorated with flags ready for the visit of King George V tomorrow. Streets brightly alight and electric signs in evidence – a great change. Left Continental and walked out to dinner. Noticed Vendome Column sandbagged at base. Went to Arrigones in Boullevardde Italiens for dinner – a good one soup de poisson, fish and a pint of Chianti 9 fr 35. Amusing to watch the gesticulations of diners. Returning to hotel noticed nice little girls plying their trade and many [indecipherable] Parissienes with escorts. All daintly charming with a chicness that is all their own & which the miss of England lacks. Bed 10.30 – a long day.
