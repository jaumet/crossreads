Lately I'm beginning to remember some items very faintly, like impressions of a dreams  -- or are they dreams?  Falling for a year through a black cloud full of hard things & red flames --- laughing & swearing at the fool that shoved me in a hole & tipped rubbish on me --- Crawling or trying to do same over people that wouldn't get out of the road & using some malevolent language --- Then being picked up by an M. O. -- where that idea comes from how knows for it couldnt be ---                                                                  Worrying over eighteen pounders and feeling relieved when told they were OK
