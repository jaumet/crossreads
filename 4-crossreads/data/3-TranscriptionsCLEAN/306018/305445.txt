July 1917friends.  We put in a couple of hours together & talked Dorrigo for some time.  Also visited Mrs Warner & had morning tea with her & quite a long talk.  Promised to return another day. Went to see a friend of Arthur Gurney's at the Nazrich Hospital.  She is a VAD Nurse there & is a nice girl.  We did not stay long as she was busy, but promised to return.  In the afternoon we had a bit of a sleep & later got our passes altered to allow us to visit Alexandria.
We caught the 11.30 train Friday night & got to Alex shortly after daylight Saturday morning & went to the Windsor Hotel overlooking the sea.  Got in another couple of hours rest before breakfast & after we went out to Chatby les Bains for a swim.  The water was very heavy & the surf dangerous, so we didn't stay long in the water.  After our swim we called on Mrs Avgerinos & promised to call again after dinner & take the girls to the races.  We got a car & had a nice drive out to the Sporting Clubs grounds & had a great afternoon.  We picked  several winners
