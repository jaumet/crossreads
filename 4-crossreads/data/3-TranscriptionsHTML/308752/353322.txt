<p>to see the Hedger boys.  We were all very glad to meet again.  The beauty &amp; splendour of some of the Tombs &amp; Mosques it is an impossibility to state in writing, they must be seen before one can form any idea of their magnificence. We drove through Old Cairo in a garry, in some places there was just enough room to pass along without the carriage bumping each side of the streets. The filth &amp; dirt in this part of Cairo is unmentionable, I swear that most of the natives we passed have never had a wash in their lives. Hundreds of kiddies we passed, it made one almost sick to see them grovelling in the dirt, &amp; with swarms of flies all over them. No sanitary arrangements at all, the stink of the dwellings is terrible;  they contain very little furniture but plenty of vermin. It was a great eye-opener, no one who has never seen these native quarters can form any idea of the filth of these places. It is not advisable for an Australian soldier to visit these native slums alone, as you cannot trust the inhabitants, they would stick a knife into you, if they got half a chance. Sydney slums are palaces when compared with Old Cairo. I have been told that Cairo, since the war began is the most immoral city in the world, I firmly believe it. It has been a great eye opener to all us boys. We had a glorious dinner at "Saults" one of the best restaurants in Cairo, fully enjoyed it. Caught</p>
