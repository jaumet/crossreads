Dear Mr. Horsefield -I am sending Mrs. Cheeseman whose husband and son are both at the Front. At present she is receiving the [indecipherable] pension & owing to some trouble now being investigated her allowance is suspended. Her husband made over an allotment to his sister but it will be altered later on.
Mrs. Cheeseman has a debt pressing. I am enquiring at the Pay Office tomorrow & will let you know the result later.
Yours faithfullyB. Booth.
