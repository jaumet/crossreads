MARCH 1917
12 MONDAY
Raining off & on all day.
I rode into Stenwerck with
Cyril Ruhu in morning. The
C.R.A (Gen. Grimwade)
inspected the billets ect
in morning & he was so
pleased with them that he
granted us a half holiday
so we did not have to
fall in till 3.30 pm stables.
We heard that Bagdad
had fallen.
