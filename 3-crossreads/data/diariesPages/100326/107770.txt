23/9/15 Bitterly cold right up on these heights looking down Braunds Hill others lying right beneath us. The hillsides getting quite denuded of firewood. The sea very pretty to look at in the distance Imbros and the sister island towering with their high peaks out of the water. Warships signalling by flash with electric helios. Siege battery smashing Turks trenches up this morning. Dropping shells in, that send sandbags earth up 50 feet into air. Very good shooting as they have to be careful not to hit us and the shells are landing only 100 yds in front of us ? we are so close to the enemy. Piercingly cold wind and cloudy. Went up into fire trench and watched effect of siege battery's fire ? ripping their trenches to pieces. Not a Turk in sight ? as one gentleman remarked "It frightened C--- out of them". Another declared they could be heard crying "Allah! Allah!" At 1900 Abdul's artillery got to work and our warships had to push out further out of range, Suvla Bay being quite deserted At 2035 went to bed ? lovely moonlight night the view from these heights being magnificent. Below the deep ravines and the tops of smaller hills only an occasional bomb rifle shot lets one know a war is on. Turks repairing trenches
