Heavens how miserable rotten ashamed I feel of my country I was always so proud of Australia all she has done in this war now our name is mud, we all feel as how we can scarce look any one of the other colonies in the face, oh how I wish that we could lay our hands on the B--------- swine it would be some consolation to punch their lousy heads to a pulp, then jump their guts out for them, I would do it with pleasure myself. Australia can't be much of a place to live in at the present time, its pretty evident that all the best have gone from our one time beautiful land, oh how proud we all were of her, we used to hold our head so high look the whole world in the face, now its all a thing of the past, seems like a bad dream to me for we can't accept the facts of the Australian people turning us down so badly, it is as much as to say, serve you right for going away good enough for you if you get killed
