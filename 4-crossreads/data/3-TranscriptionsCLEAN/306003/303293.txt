  
 19.3.16 Sun 19th It was cloudy this morning went to Tukh-El-Khail with Ahearn to see where they were camped.  had a good day & thoroughly enjoyed the ride  Harvesting is in full swing with some of the crops & most of the cockies were busy carting in the sheaves on camels; 
 A pontoon bridge has been erected across the canal opposite the camp at Tukh-El-Khail & it was there that the Queenslander fell into the canal with all his gear on a few weeks ago & drowned;  we had to do some skillfull manouvering through some irrigated plots to get to the camp as we did not know the track;  All the natives in all the villages we passed through & those working in the fields are as friendly as it is possible to be & all want to give us "Backsheesh" for ourselves & horses
