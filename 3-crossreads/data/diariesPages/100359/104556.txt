Saturday 3rd
Washed my drill pants had a bath. The waggons are all packed ready to move off. "Murph" paid me a visit this morning. He is looking very well. Our tents all came down this morning now we are camped in a big Mess Hut, which is very cool. Mail came in, I got 4 letters 3 from Lill and 1 from Nell, also 2 table talks from France, which were very welcome. 
Sunday 4th
Wrote letter No. 4 to Lill. Very hot day. Sand storm got up after tea and smothered everything in dust. There is a big water tank up the road a bit and today it overflowed, we rushed up under it and had a glorious shower.

Monday 5th 
Scrubbed my tunic and put my few things together ready for the great day, when we say "Goodbye for ever" to this fly and flea infested land called Egypt. The Egyptian Mail" contained news of a Big Naval Battle in the North Sea. Must have been a lively scrap while it lasted. Reveille at 4.30 Then all hands hard at work clearing up the camp for inspection by the G.O.C. Breakfast at 5 at 6.30 we all fell in, S.Ps, Cooks fatigue and picquet with full packs up, Gen. Tivey and C.O.C and A.D.M.S. arrived just after they inspected us. After it was over the Col. informed us that the Gen.Said "It was the best show he?d seen in Egypt". Then the Col. thanked us for making such a good show and we were dismissed. Just as we were settling down in the Mess Hut, the orderly Sergeant broke the news to us that we had to get rid of the mats, on which we have been sleeping the past week. Now we have to sleep on the bare ground with only one blanket, just to show the Col's appreciation. 

Wednesday 7th
This is the great day we have been looking forward to for a long time, being the date we were to leave Egypt, but yesterday (curse it) we were informed that our departure was postponed indefinitely.
