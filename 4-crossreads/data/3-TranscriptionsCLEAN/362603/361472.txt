Bullford24.6.17Dear Mum,I haven't much news at any time but by answering Your letters I'll be able to fill up a couple of pages & let you know that I am still well & having a lovely time.  I have to work hard nearly always but I always take two afternoons off every week & go to Salisbury.  My Friends there are of the best & I go in & make myself at Home just as I did at Bess' place & You know that English People are very reserved.  My Best plan to follow is to tell You how I spent my last two afternoons.  I went to Amesbury this Thursday instead of Salisbury.  I first set off in the Pouring rain & alone.  It rained all the way in, - it is 3 1/2 miles- & then I walked round the River Walk till I thought I have afternoon Tea at 4 p.m.  After Tea I went for a walk in another direction & called at a Friend's House but everyone was out.  So I came back & went to the Army Hut near the Bridge for something to eat.  After that I went for another short stroll & met My Friends walking down the village Street.  I went Home with them & had dinner.  I stayed for about an Hour chatting away & then set out for Camp at 8.45 pm.  It is over 3 1/2 miles from Camp & I was in my room at 9.30 pm.  Ellis was out but I knew where to find Him.  Ern. Thomas
