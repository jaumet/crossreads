Dear Mother
Since last letter, Business has been somewhat brisker than usual and, we have altered the shape of the front line again, and we also met our old friends again, the Prussians, They are not in the same street as the first lot though some of these jokers were game to the last, but a very big majority were all ready to start on long distance sprints, or to surrender I wish they were all like that, we would soon clear this country. The Sammys we hear have done good work and I fancy that before very long fritz will want to discuss peace terms again. If he insists on fighting to a finish I think that we can easily meet him half way, and give him all the fight that he wants, Jim Elder is camped quite close and is fairly well. I have seen him a couple of times lately, I suppose you have heard that Eric is back on this side, he is with one of the M.G. Coys. and is full Corporal ? has a good safe job into the bargain
