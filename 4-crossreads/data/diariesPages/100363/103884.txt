hauled up their anchors and proceeded through the channelway to the open sea. We are made up of twenty merchantmen, averaging from 4,000 tons upward. Our escort is a large auxiliary cruiser (The Armadale Castle) and six destroyers. All the merchant vessels are armed with guns varying from 4.2 up to 6 inch.

It thrilled one to see old England's might still proudly ploughing the seas in dignified defiance, and one's admiration warmed for these skippers and men, who play their great share in their country's work.
