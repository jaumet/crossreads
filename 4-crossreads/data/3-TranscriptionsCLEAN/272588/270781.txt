  
 Sunday 6 October Church, Dr. Jowat.  Richmond for the afternoon & evening. Once back in London one feels that one has never left it so completely does it banish France from the mind. Of course rationing is in force, but there is no shortage of food. 
 Monday 7 October Windsor all day. "The Boy" at night. Windsor &  Eato  Eton is a fine & scrupulously clean town.  The Castle is fine & the view therefrom, of the river & the country for miles is glorious.  Eton College stands out well.
