  
 1918 Wed 3rd Apl. We passed through St Pauli again, it's slatternly, kimona-clad and rouged inhabitants looking by no means fascinating as they waddled to the bakers for their allowanced loaf. 
 Hamburg itself is a beautiful city, some of the canal scenes being quite Venetian. 
 The Inner Alster in particular is very beautiful. 
 From the main Bahnhof we left in the Overhead for Altona, boarding a train there bound for Hannover.   When the Hannover train reached Hamburg it was commandeered for troops by a shrieking brass-hatted Hun & everybody (including us) was bundled out on to the platform, the train being then packed with troops en route to strengthen the line at Metz.
