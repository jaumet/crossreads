<p>of British fair Play "&amp; Promisses" that I hawe lost personally all faith in the British Governement of any sort.  From January 1916 we Internees wher permitted to recieve the daily "Newspaper" but only one choosen for us by the Military.  Allthough it wher not of much use to our interess, owing the faked reports in same, however it wher better than nothing.  It assistet in helping us pass away the time, &amp; we wher enabled to learn a "little bit" of the outside World.  The "better Class" made themselves two Tennis Curts on wich they also passed away many idle hour in this healthy sport &amp; exercise.<br/><u>Amusements</u>  Our amusements consisted of 2 Theathers.  The German &amp; the Austrian Theater errected by Pris. of War.  The admittance to "plays" ranged from 1d. to 1s. acording to seats.  Middle 1916 the military errected also a Cinema to show wich showed between 8-9000 feet of Picture Film twice a Week to a big audience.  The screen wher build in the "Open" as it dependet on the weather condition if a full patronage "or none" at all.  We also could boast of "Gymnastics" of all sort.  Their wher 3 Atheletic Clubs in our midst wich keept Rivalery &amp; Competitiones at "Breaking Point".</p>
