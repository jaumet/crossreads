the Final (run in 55 Seconds) I was unable to win on account of a bad position & I was not going to over do it for second or 3rd place.  Ellis & I ran in the Teams Race afterwards, 220 yds each but only got second.  We got a small Trophy each.  We'll be sending them Home as curios, won on the English Playing Fields, later on.  We are expecting a move to France but don't worry.  It is only to another Hospital & even big Bertha, the huge German Gun can't shoot within 30 or 40 miles of our Hospital.  Of course, it is all a rumour as yet & Ellis may not mention.
