<p><strike>Agean</strike> Sea once more en route for <strike><u>Salonika</u></strike><br/>Last night another heavy sea arose &amp; the ship registered 41&deg; list- about midnight a very heavy sea struck us- I jumped up &amp; put on life belt, quite sure we had been torpedoed but she is still going strong.  Our escort keeps dodging about in front &amp; I think we can trust the NAVY to look after us.  Nearly all the troops are for <strike><u>Salonika</u></strike> &amp; many Officers only for <strike>Egypt.</strike><br/>We are among the Archipelago islands now, not far off <strike>Lemnos &amp; Mudros again expect to reach <strike>Salonika</strike> midday tomorrow, no use posting letters there -<br/>Sea calmer, weather colder.</p>
