  
 July, 1915 Wednesday 28 Tell Mother I'm really off on Sunday next - so if I have any luck I'll be in the advance. Staying behind as  Adjutant  I might have got promotion quicker, but it is not altogether what I came over for. Poor old Colonel has to wait again for another draft it cuts him up staying behind -  He is typical Irishman & we get on well together, but have Sundry small rows of course - even at War men do not change & in the trenches sometimes have a fight with pots among themselves.
