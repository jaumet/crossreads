<p>so it was at least that age.  After having some tea in the village we went to the Durrington Church which was not so old, only about 100 years old.  You can't imagine what an old place England is untill you see it.  We expect to go on leave next week, our long looked for leave &amp; then what a time we will have for 6 whole days.  The weather is beginning to get cold now although not uncomfortable so we miss the winds</p>
