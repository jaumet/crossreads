From Brigadier to Flag
The Wireless Station having been captured our objective in that direction has been attained.  Recommend Beresford reinforce troops now at Wireless and hold the station.  Have instructed Col. Watson to send two companies infantry at once to Beresfords assistance.  Suggest also that Garrison be left at Herbertshohe with one months supplies which have now been partially landed.  Withdraw and that balance of force move direct as early as possible on Rabaul.
If approved please instruct Beresford accordingly I will advise Watson
