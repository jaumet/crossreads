<p>29th September 1915.</p>
<p>My dear old Jack,<br/>Got a couple of letters from you lately the last dated July 19 the other July 6th.</p>
<p>Well Jack I am glad to see you are getting along fairly well considering the war though I must sympathise with you regarding your own &amp; Clare's illnesses. However I hope by this time that you are both OK &amp; that the children are doing well too.</p>
<p>Very glad to hear that the works are hanging on &amp; that you are still busy there. Also that you got word from me alright. Give my love to all hands &amp; let them know I'm doing fine. This has filled me out wonderful. You can guess how when I say my weight is over fourteen stone. Have not had a day's illness all through and am one out of about eight of this regiment that has not been away for a spell yet. However you can bet when the chance comes I'm taking a real good spell.</p>
<p>I think I told you in my last that I was going alright regarding promotions. After serving in every N.C.O. rank in the Regiment you will be very pleased that I have got my commission. A pretty good performance right off my own bat &amp; considering that I had no previous experience.</p>
