<p>Piquigny, where we crossed the "Somme".  Continued on through Amiens to Dernancourt, a couple of Kilos outside Albert.  Marched the last couple of miles owing to the enormous amount of traffic on the roads.  Billet in an old barn fitted up with beds made of wire-netting. Very cold night.</p>
<p>Saturday 21.10.16<br/>No occasion for reveille at 5.30, could not sleep on account of the cold; practically in agony, cold so severe.  Marched off at 8.30 glad to get moving.  Thousands of troops of all description moving on the roads.  Hundreds of German prisoners used in making &amp; repairing roads.  Arrived at Mametz wood about 3.30.  Passed the remains of a few old villages; hardly able to find traces of them</p>
