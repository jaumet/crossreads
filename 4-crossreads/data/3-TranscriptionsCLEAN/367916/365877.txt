 Dear Mother & Father Tomorrow I go back to duty I tried hard to be allowed to go straight back to France but could not manage it & shall now have to go through the horrible process of working my way round the depots in England. It is a horrible business & I am looking forward to it with great disgust 
 Saw Beiers & his wife yesterday & am going to have lunch with them today I think Beiers will be sent back to Australia He is far from well now & will be pretty certainly unfit for further service in France. I will extract a promise from him to come & see you if he does get back. Of course his little wife will go with him - I think you will both love her. 
 By the way Col Oatley who followed Simpson at the B/W is going to Australia I gave him fathers address & he has promised to call so keep a look out for him. There seems to be a good number of chaps going home nowadays - London is full of them all waiting for ships. 
 Best Love Your affte Son C R Lucas
