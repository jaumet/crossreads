 We remained in this camp only a couple of days.  Early one morning we packed up again, and through all the mud and slush imaginable, we trudged on, and on gaining the road had to "march", or get along as best we could owing to the enormous amount of traffic on the road. 
 I've seen some traffic on the roads in France and Belgium, but never have I seen such a stream as on this Bapaume Road.  The enemy had only moved out a few days previously, and the torn up railway line, the damaged lorries, and other material scattered about, was evidence that "time was the essence of the contract", so far as he was concerned.
