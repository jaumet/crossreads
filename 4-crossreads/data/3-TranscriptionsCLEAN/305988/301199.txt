  
 trench & went for their lives; some came running down the trench yelling out "mercy cumarado", but there were no prisoners for us that night. Now comes the funny part. We took that trench, & occupied it  alright  all night without any ammunition & they did not bring any up to us. The next morning we were preparing just before daybreak to get back to our own trench to get some sleep & leave a strong point at both ends of the trench to hold it, when over came his barrage & it was a beaut. Concentrated intense fire on to this bit of trench & and then the Huns came over loaded up with bombs & us with none to knock them back with, the consequence was we had to hop out & go for our lives. It was broad daylight then & he got into us with his machine guns. We got back into B Coy's end of the trench & advanced up the trench bombing as we went, but had to retire again owing to shortage of bombs. After dinner we advanced again with tons of ammunition but Fritz had "vanisheed" leaving us the trench. We towelled him. On the 13th he retired further still & we advanced & occupied villages Biefvillers & Grevillers.
