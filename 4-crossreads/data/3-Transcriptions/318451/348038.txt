<p>Monday Dec. 4th<br/>Some of our men went into the Trenches today.  It has been raining slightly today.  Went to the Baths this afternoon &amp; had a hot bath.  It was very refreshing.  An old Brewery has been utilized.  The Vats are filled with water &amp; then steam is used to heat it up.  The men go in leave their old underclothes &amp; get a set of clean underclothes after their bath.  After six days in the trenches you can imagine how this is appreciated.</p>
<p>Tuesday Dec. 5th<br/>I went out to the Trenches today visited D &amp; B Coy. &amp; went into the Front trenches for the first time &amp; had a peep at the German trenches through a periscope.  It was quiet on the front <strike>yesterday</strike> today.  Tonight there were 2 gas alarms but it didn't reach the town.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6th<br/>Went to the Trenches again this morning, took a few papers.  I had lunch in Major Sneddons</p>
