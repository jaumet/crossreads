 Sunday 11 Juli 1915 Rose at 4.30 a.m. The star shone white as dawn broke across placid surfac of the ocean , I felt a new self aris in me ? the morn was so peac majest , the sun as it rose through threw a golden glori over the distant horizon , final appear in a great white disc in all it glitter heat . A rag edg of cloud , low down , turn like red hot coal , the sea between the ship the distant flame orb becam a molten mass , magnific in it grandeur at which the eye could gaze but for a glimps second , so power was the sheen . A new self ? yes , like dead scale the superfici , the falsiti , the habit of life of the world I have left behind seem for the instant , whilst I gaze upon that awe-inspir scene , to drop from me . Romanc a keen observ of beauteous natur engend foster in me from that moment a feel of love for all thing beauti seren , and I offer a silent prayer to heaven that I was aliv to appreci the signific of the mighti splendour of that glorious sunris . Posit of ship about 15 degre south of equat ? 15 by 80 north .
