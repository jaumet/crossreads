 The flies are the dizzy, stick like glew to a blanket. The mess tables are just black with them before we have our meals its a wonder we don't get Barcoo. 
 We do not mess with the 14th Coy. now as we are some distance away from them, at the Main Supply Depot. The cook here is first class, we are living well theres no doubt. The tea is one good point about it, he knows how to make it alright. 
 This is a very busy Depot
