Square, its an expensive place but great to stop at, I always give all these clubs etc for soldiers a wide berth when on leave, I like something a little more tasty than those, we went saw "Going Up" Fair " Warmer" "Box o Tricks" the Naughty Wife" while in London this time, I liked the former very much, we had a jolly good time I was sorry when his time was up he had to go back to Camp, its rotten knocking about without a mate, one night I saw an awful sight we were having dinner in the Corner House at the table next to us was a lady entertaining 4 blind soldiers, it seemed awful to me for that is my one fear I know if ever I lose my sight I shall do away with myself for life would be no good to me
