<p>Lark Hill Camp<br/>Salisbury Plains<br/>England</p>
<p>Sunday 23-7-16</p>
<p>Dear Mother, Father &amp; all,<br/>We have at last reached England and are once more in camp.</p>
<p>We arrived in Devonport on the 18th. and this camp on the 19th. Amesbury is our Rly station &amp; is about 12 miles north of Salisbury. This is a fine place here and the weather excellent. All the fields are covered with wild flowers some of which I am enclosing. The larger ones are observed casually but the smaller ones require a little looking for.</p>
<p>This camp is one of many camps scattered all over the plain and I understand there <strike>are</strike> is accommodation for 30,000 troops easily here. All here are Australians and also at 4 or 5 adjacent camps. Conditions here are great, fairly large huts taking 30 men. The food is good. The Govt. supply bacon meat bread tea etc &amp; <strike>each</strike> an allowance is paid into the company</p>
