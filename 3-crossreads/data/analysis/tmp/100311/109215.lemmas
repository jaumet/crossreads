 8/10/17 Broodseind Ridg The even was veri quiet except for a rattl of musketri and some bomb on our right . Again as on the 4th my nerv broke out ? a trembl set in ? quit involuntari . The rain has made condit terribl . It is like flog a dead hors to get anyth done by runner or other . They take the messag and soon turn up say they cannot find the place or some other lie . The men are done , absolut done finish . Poor Bun tonight was well out to it . There were a few shell veri close here we had our candl put out more than onc . The even was quiet except for a rifl and bomb stunt on the right evid a German raid of some kind . Just befor midnight Stewart Rodda and Savag went forward to lay out the J.O.Ts a riski job . As our barrag commenc behind our own front line it will be necessari to bring all our men well back to jump them off . My task is to make two strong post and attack with a battalion 90 strong on a 500 ? front ! ! !
