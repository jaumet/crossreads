<p>had a jolly morning &amp; send off. Left at 1.15. p.m. Had a glorious trip to Malta and to our surprise &amp; delight were allowed to go ashore for 2 &frac12; hrs.<br/>Well, it is a most wonderful place  &amp; really a sight I shall never forget. I have bought some post cards but they give a very poor idea of the beauty. <br/>We put into St. Paul's Bay</p>
