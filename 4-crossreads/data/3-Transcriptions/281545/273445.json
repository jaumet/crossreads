<p>Wednesday April 24th.    I was called at 3.30 am to sign on at 4.30 am to prepare an Engine to proceed to work for the 277 Coy, Railway Construction, on the St Omer Berguette Section &amp; at  6 am I left with a Guard, Engine only.   I was blocked Arques Stop Signal which is alongside of the Canal where the Locks are for nearly an hour, so my Guard &amp; myself went &amp; had a good look at the Locks also we climbed the Bank &amp; saw the Canal &amp; the Bridge over the Line.   As my Guard could speak French fairly good, the Sentry explained the working of the Hydraulic Lift.   The bridge over head is in two portions connecting with two movable Basins, when one is up, the other is down</p>
