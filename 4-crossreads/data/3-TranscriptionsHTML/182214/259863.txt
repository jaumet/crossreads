<p>Lyons is another big city &amp; rather pretty but we did not stay there, but a place just outside for tea &amp; rations From Lyons the weather was not too warm &amp; the further North we went the colder it got. here we saw our first hospital train going south &amp; we felt sorry to the wounded who seemed cheerful enough &amp; waved their hands to us, the French red cross gave us bread &amp; cakes &amp; would take no money for same but pointed to the red cross collection boxes &amp; the boys put in fair contributions The scenery from here to the outskirts of Paris was still very lovely &amp; we passed a large estate where the people came out for the day from Paris as they seemed Holiday making they waved &amp; the children cheered.</p>
