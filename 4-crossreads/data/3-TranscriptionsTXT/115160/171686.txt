 [Printed Programme] 
 [Handwritten note] 
 I was at a vaudeville entertainment t&#39;other night which had this as its second half. &nbsp;It was the first entertainment of any sort (except a few concerts) I&#39;ve been at since I left Home. 
 The big town where this programme is performed nightly is often reminded of Fritz&#39;s proximity and its state at different parts show how well he keeps track of it.
