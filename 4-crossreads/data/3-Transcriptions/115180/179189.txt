<p>mind, so long, as you call this &quot;Home&quot;</p>
<p>I am delighted that you get away from the Hospital, you must have a change, so take all you can, but Harry dear, you must really take care, you know you are only human, and nasty colds in England, are not pleasant, you must have been very ill, poor laddie, if only we were nearer; fancy you walking, all those miles, I do trust, you are really better now.</p>
<p>Harry dearie, only 40 left, you say, out of 200, oh how I pray you boys will remain, I dread that awful Front, and the dreadful results of the contemplated &quot;Spring push&quot; poor noble boys, those &quot;New Zealanders&quot; going to what? and the tens of thousands who have already gone and are still going. What a fearful time it is, and yet, we say &quot;God is love&quot; whilst men are slaying each other in thousands, &amp; women &amp; children as well all the Christian people are each determined to kill one another. oh, how horrible it is, yet the soldiers are so brave and keep on smiling. &nbsp;I would be a sloper I am afraid, and would slip into the first hole I came to, but I would as soon face a German, I think</p>
