<p>There is a good canteen, a YMCA &amp; down the road a little there is a cinema. Last night I went to the cinema, they were very good pictures, but it was very cold. I spend a lot of my time reading in the YMCA, they have some very nice books there, that you can borrow. It is very cold the taps have been frozen for about a fortnight now, the ink on my pen even is freezing as I write. My toes have been frostbitten these last three days, &amp; slightly in my finger tips, at night when under the blankets they get very sore, &amp; if I should sit near the fire in the YMCA my toes get very painful. I drew another ten francs last Saturday<br/>Australian Base<br/>Etaples Feb. 9th 17<br/>We left our camp at Rouen shortly after the mid day meal, marched to the Station, there we were put into horse boxes 35 in each. We did not leave until about 6 pm, there was a canteen at the stn. &amp; after a while they gave out tea &amp; cake free, it was very good of them. We got a brazier going in the train, which made things more comfortable for it was very cold</p>
