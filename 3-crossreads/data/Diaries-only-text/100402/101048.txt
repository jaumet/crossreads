Friday 29 March
Good Friday. Wet. Last night Fritz shelled about here fairly heavily catching a battery. We had two trips out much gas was in evidence.
Saturday 30 March
Wet miserable to-day but still very quiet on the front. A German airman very daringly came very low over our lines escaped scot free. News from the Somme still disconcerting the advance is in one place 25 miles deep in another 15 miles from Amiens.
