<p>9-10-1916<br/>Terrific gale lasting all night. Two large trees uprooted near our lines. In fact our officers had a tent near these trees, fortunately the tree fell in the opposite direction. Could not advance with our guns, ground too boggy. Liuet Black wounded seriously. W.O. Hendly granted a commission in the field. Engineers erecting elephant hut in our lines. A big stunt on our left, good work done, over 1,000 prisoners, also the last ridge, we now have the Huns out of their last line of defence and on to a plain. Hundreds of our plane over, Horses feeling the cold, 4 more sent to Mobile</p>
<p>10-10-1917<br/>Still wet, Sgt Muddle died from wounds recieved in action. One of the best. A married man with one child. Only the other day he showed me a letter from his son, saying how well he was getting on at school. 7 or 8 years old. Hun aeroplanes over this morning</p>
