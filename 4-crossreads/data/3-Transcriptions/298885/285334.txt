<p>get through in time.</p>
<p>June 7th &ndash; 19<br/>Just as the clock timed 6.30 this morning we entered between the breakwaters into the Port of Colombo.</p>
<p>This port is not very large but is laid out in a manner to enable a great quantity of shipping to berth as such was the case on our arrival</p>
<p>It is for mostly for coaling purposes that ships call here and the little harbour presents quite a busy spectacle with its numerous tugs and barges of coal.</p>
