8It is extraordinarily difficult to get information about men who may be within a few miles away.
It is now definitely settled that we leave here on the 22nd and I expect we shall be in our quarters in France about a week afterwards, when we can settle down and make ourselves comfortable for a long stay.
This letter has become too long for a busy man like yourself, but its length is directly proportionate to my gratitude for you.
Yours sincerelyE M Brissenden
