<p>Ba<em>ck from the F</em>ront</p>
<p>George Reidy, the well-kno<em>wn clever middle-</em> weight boxer who fought a 20 rounds battle with Dave Smith in 1909, when our twice-retired heavyweight champion was a power in the land as a clever exponent, returned from the front last week.&nbsp; George is partially para-lysed. He was laid up in an English hospital for quite a long while, and in a much worse condition than he is now.&nbsp; Reidy&#39;s pictorial reply to a Referee question - &quot;Where is George Reidy now?&quot; - was published in a recent issue of this journal. George saw the question, and sent along a photograph of himself stretched out in bed, and wearing tresses of such length that he looked more like a woman than a man.&nbsp; Alongside of him was a good correspondent of mine and a real fighter, in the person of Larry Lassen&mdash;Lashin we used to call him.&nbsp; Despite his trouble, George Reidy is not down-hearted.&nbsp; While there&#39;s life there&#39;s hope, he says, par-ticuarly as his affliction is growing less. I might mention that after the photo. referred to appeared in The Referee, Reidy&#39;s sister (Mrs. Donald) called in to see the note addressed to me.&nbsp; At first George had been unable to write, but his fist was readily recognised, and Mrs. Donald went away highly pleased and in <em>pos-</em>session of the pictorial reply afor<em>ementioned.</em></p>
