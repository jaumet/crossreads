 tradesmen  &amp;  talent amongst the Internees. On the 17/3 The Comittee informed the Internees generallly of the following: Those during Srtrikeweek distributed Cigars  &amp;  Cigarettes, are a gift, send to the "Manila Gentleman, of wich are 6 in our Camp to 20 in the Trial Bay Compound, who kindly have given the whole bulk of the gift to our Camp,  &amp;  for wich the Comittee expresses its thanks, in the Name of the Camp.
