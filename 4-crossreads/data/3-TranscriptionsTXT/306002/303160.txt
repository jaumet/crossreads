 24.5.15 Mon. 24th.  This morning we were hauled out at 3.30 this morning to stand to arms.  The Japanese bombs were speaking fairly constant when we retired last night.  An Armistace has been arranged for to-day from 8 o'clock till 4.30 to allow the Turks to get their dead away.  The Australians have to take all the dead bodies half way where they are taken over by the Turks, so as the Turks can be kept away from our trenches.  Rain commenced at 7.30 but we are quite dry here with a couple of water-proofs sheets over our dug-out.  After dinner Stan &amp; I went to the 4 Btn. to see Morgan Welch &amp; Bolden.  Morgan was wounded through the shoulder on the 19th.  The Australians &amp; Turks have been changing coins, cigarettes &amp; biscuits this afternoon &amp; been having friendly yarns while shifting the dead Turks.  We saw Bolden &amp; had a long talk with him.
