<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 7.9.16<br/>24th July 1916.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I know you will be <strike>be</strike> very disappointed at not hearing from me by last mail, but it <strike>is</strike> has been absolutely impossible for me to get a line <u>posted</u> until two days ago when I sent off a Field Post Card with this letter to follow it.  Since I last wrote which was about a fortnight ago if I remember rightly we have been constantly on the move &amp; are hundreds of miles from my last writing place.  An army on the move entails a tremendous lot of work, &amp; we had our hands absolutely full.  Never for more than a day &amp; a half at one place not so much the writing as the dispatching of letters was out of the question.  We are settling down again &amp; our incoming mail has of course been delayed.  This morning, however, I received a big budget of Australian mail, &amp; I am very glad to have a number of your letters among them.  These letters are as follows  7th, 11th, 15th, 21st, 23rd, and 29th of May.  It was glorious to get such an interesting budget from you Father dear &amp; I thank you so much for your very interesting news<br/>So far I have received all your letters &amp; I have been keeping a list of dates etc rec'd for revision.<br/>I have only once heard from Perce Linin, &amp; it was through Walter when he was at Etaples in which he said Perce was there in Hospital (sick).<br/>You should have heard long before this reaches you that I received notification from the Commonwealth</p>
