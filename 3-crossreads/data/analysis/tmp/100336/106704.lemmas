 never forget how we enjoy that meal although the bread was black and full of straw , it was absolut delici . The Greek said they were go toth Railway and we could accompani them if we wish and they would show us where the English live . We glad accept the invit . After about 2 hour walk along a veri rough track we came to the first villag on the railway . They were stop there , but they said if we went anoth mile and a half on we would come to anoth villag and there we would find some English work . We said goodby to our friend the Greek and thank him for his kind in help us along . We walk along by ourselv without meet anybodi and just befor dusk we came to the villag of Boudjak ( Dorak ? ) and in the distanc we saw a row of tent , and guess them to be where our peopl were camp . On near them we saw a number of Indian but no English . We spoke to one man who turn out to be an English speak Armenian in charg of a gang of Indian . We ask him where the English were camp and he point to a small hut on a hill about a mile distant and told us that there were 6 English sergeant camp there , so we set off for the hut , arriv there just at dusk . The Sergeant would hard believ that we were English in our disguis , red fezz etc . Howev they made us veri welcom . The first thing they did was give us a loaf of bread each and a plate of stew . ( They were just have their tea we did not speak till we had eaten all this and then we told them what we had been do . What a glorious meal that was . There were no sentri over these prison as the German Engineer trust them not to attempt to escap , as they were just captur and be in a veri weak state just after come out of a sieg and know noth about the lay of the countri . After we spent a coupl of hour talk dure which time they told us all about the terribl sieg of Kut-el-amara ( these were the first prison from that front that ani of us had met ) . We lay down to sleep the frist time for 19 day with a full stomach and a content mind . In the morn we turn out and went down to a creek and had a good bath , after which we felt much refresh . We had a good breakfast and dinner and in the afternoon we decid that in the even we would push on to our own camp about seven mile distant and give ourselv up . About 6 p.m. we said goodby to our friend and start off . All went well till within half a mile from the camp when we had to pass a sentri on the road . We were challeng and did not evid satisfi the sentri . He took us into the villag where our camp was and took us befor the Command . He was sit on the verandah talk to the offic of polic . He immedi recognis us and flew into such a temper that he could hard speak . Both he and the Polic Officer were curs us which we had to stand without say a word . Then he ask us where we had been . I repli that we had been with our friend a littl further down the line . I said that he would not give us permiss to go so we went without . He enquir how long had we been away .
