<p>Wednesday 22 May<br/>Kingcups, daisies and the "Bosom white of the hawthorn bud" are now making this district look simply glorious. Very hot &amp; fine all day. Johno came back to-day looking well.</p>
<p>Thursday 23 May<br/>Windy &amp; gusty to-day.<br/>An attack seems imminent on this front soon &amp; it cannot be delayed much longer.  I have an idea the high ground of Cassel-Mont-des-Cats-Mont Noir ridge will be the objective. Troops are coming up this evening. Still morning runs, baths &amp; cricket, all day. The Bosch has been shelling about here a little to-day but Hazebrouck has been left alone.</p>
