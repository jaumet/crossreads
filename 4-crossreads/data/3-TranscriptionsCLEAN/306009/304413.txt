1915Aug. 17 Tue.The Skating Rink & Theatre in the Esbekieh Gardens have been taken over by the Aust. Red Cross & Y.M.C.A. to be run as a Soldiers' Club. I attended the opening of the Club at 6.30. p.m. by General Sir John & Lady Maxwell. Gen. Spens & Gen. Legge also spoke on the object of the opening. There is no doubt that such clubs are very useful.
