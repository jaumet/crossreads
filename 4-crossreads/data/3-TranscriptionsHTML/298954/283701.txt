<p>The "Primula" and the "Ficaria", two fast but obsolete arks of the Skandanavic-Amerika line, were waiting for us with steam up.   In the crush in the big waiting rooms on the wharf Ted &amp; I lost the others, &amp; we two boarded the "Ficaria" while Geo. &amp; Co took the ""Primula".</p>
<p>They are sister-ships and are now fitted up in troopship style with bunks and mess-room.   A home-like touch has been attempted by putting palms, flowers, &amp; tiny silk flags, on the tables.   There is not room in the cabins for even all the women, so we needs must take a bunk somewhere in the depths of the forward hold.</p>
<p>The thoughts of mines under such circs. are not pleasant.</p>
<p>However, the food is equally as good as that on the "Kong Haakon";  though we would like to continue to England on that dandy ship.</p>
<p>At 9 pm the two vessels left for England, crowds lining the wharves and cheering.</p>
