 Tue 23rd With A Sq again to-day & went out on the desert & the troops were trench digging  this afternoon  We had a lot of signalling to do to-day & everything went along swimmingly;  We were near no water & the horses had neither food nor water for dinner & did not arrive back in camp until after sundown;  went nowhere after tea; which was a good one & some underclothing was issued to the troops to-night;  I bayonetted a snake this morning going out; (first blood)
