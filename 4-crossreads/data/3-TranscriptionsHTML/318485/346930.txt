<p>On the eve of our journey we made merry to some tune, swapping yarns with our hosts &amp; partaking liberally of the unwonted but excellent refreshment more than generously provided and it was with some misgivings that I faced the journey next morning in the full blaze of the sun &amp; shifting heat;  but my early training as a horseman in Australia &amp; my experience of celebrations at the Chelsea Arts Club stood me in good stead and I arrived <strike>that</strike> the same evening at Magdhaba fit &amp; full of enthusiasm for work.  My guide officer, a major of one of the Light Horse Brigades fared not so well.  He was a teetotaller, had a large if not stout body that overflowed the camel's saddle, he hated camel riding, he disliked scenery, he had a contempt for artists almost charactaristic of the perfect soldier and he landed in a <strike>disgr</strike> sore disgruntled pessimist.</p>
