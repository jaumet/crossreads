this charge made the 5th one that I have been in thats a pretty good record not many can beat it I surely can't go any further without getting a smack of some sort or other, it seems impossible I saw Harry Kelly here, he is the Battalion bombers of the 26th Batt. had a good long yarn with him he looks alright, they were on their way up to Pozieres" to have a smack at our friends, one German when he came in wanted to know who we were for he said he knew we were not English, for he said English bombard, then charge but we bombard charge at the same time, so we did;
