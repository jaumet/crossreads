 14/6/18 The enemy kept up pretty incessant harassing fire all night and there was an almost constant barrage between us and the supports. There was also some gas. About dawn things slackened off. Colonel Scanlon 59th came in to arrange our relief. Hoad rang up to tell me Jack was awarded M.C. Spent the day quietly but was busy preparing orders etc. finally it was decided for one raid only of the 21st. Issued all the necessary orders and at 10pm moved up to Battle H.Q. with Reid and our American major. Things were quiet until a feeble barrage opened on our right and the 24th hopped out. They got 2 machine guns &amp; 7 prisoners &ndash; normal identification. Everything is ready for the 21st to hop over an hour later and they are going to try &amp; get one prisoner extra to beat Elwood
