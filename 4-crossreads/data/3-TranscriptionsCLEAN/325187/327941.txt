 Battle Taube over this morning & our Aeroplane chased him he went for his life followed by a few hundred rounds from our Machine Guns. Received Illustrated Papers from England, don't know who sent em but very acceptable.  Could not recognise writing   Our patrol is in touch with Turks today mounted on Camels.
