Fierce Artillery work.  Last night 280 prisoners captured, including some Artillerymen.  Very seldom are Artillerymen captured.  I note that tomorrow is the King's birthday.  Sports this evening I was in two tug of war teams, one on horse back, the other on foot, winners in both events.  A concert was held in the evening.
3-6-1918Our Capt. (Staley) is laid up.  In thanking the concert party last night, he sprained his ankle stepping off the platform.  Lieut. Irwin back from school.
4-6-1918Further particulars to hand about the last stunt.  We captured a number of machine guns, trench mortars, and 2 77 mm. guns, also an Artillery officer.  The prisoners were Saxons and Prussians.  It appears that they were changing over.  Birthday honours Major Byrne D.S.O.  Weather fine but cloudy.  456 rounds of ammunition to Bty.
