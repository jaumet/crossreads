 December 25, 26 50. Mail, "Songs Before Sunrise" and a charming little edit. also T.L.S. and letter from Mrs. Hadley. 
 December 26 51. Last night's dinner the most successful and enjoyed of a year's dinners, a full swinging success and a goodly company.  A starting at 4.30 and an ending at 8, then down to D.R.S. and a challenge snow fight with the officers, A. Section alone remaining in the field, vanquishing all comers. 
 Today the snow heavy on the ground, and a full sun shining.  We look out from the D. Room over a low valley.  Yesterday in the afternoon when only a thin layer of snow had fallen, the scene was of soft pale apple green and the veiled pink of red roof tiles, today it's a scene from the primitives, farm houses and trees grouped as fine tapestries and open spaces of pure gleaming white, lovely in the sun. 
 Today dressings, all sprained ankles, black eyes and bruises. 
 December 27 52. Pater's "Renaissance" and Swinburne's "Songs before Sunrise", jove what loveliness of writings. 
 53. Twenty of A. Bearers up, Blue H. up where Francis should have gone.  F. at first rather attracted me &ndash; a masculine Daisy Jerome Type in build and colouring, but his personality and manner not too prepossessing. 
 54. Decided upon, if the Paying O. will stand it, a drawing of 80 F. this coming pay &ndash; to get Dowson's "Decorations in Prose and Verse", 1899, 30/-, the 1st edition of the cover design of gold, probably by Ricketts or Shannon. 
 Another cold grey day, and a long morning of dressings.  The Tommies have at last discovered us, and they arrive with all the ills of the Military world. 
 55. Write tonight to Export Manager, T.B.C., to procure Dowson's "Decorations" and Beerbohm's "More".  And to Gerald, and to Harold N., replying to R. letter of last Oct. or early November.
