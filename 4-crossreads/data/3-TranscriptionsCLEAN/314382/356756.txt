September 15th: -Fine and cool all day. Working in ward E5 & 6 under Sister Morphett. Slept on deck again.

September 17th: -Completed the preliminary work early and at 4 pm an inspection of the ship was made by the O.C. who expressed much pleasure and satisfaction at the way things were. After tea a first class concert was held on the well deck.
