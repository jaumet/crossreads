A current rumour throughout the regts. now is that we are going back to Jericho &amp; there the 1914 men &amp; unfit horses are going to be sorted out.  The fit horses &amp; men are then going up north Damascus way &amp; the 1914 men are going to Australia.  I see in the Kia-ora News that the Furlough has been granted.

Still I suppose a man had best "get in while the goings good".
