<p>Monday 25 Sept. 1916<br/>Misty early but otherwise glorious. Had to attend a Gas Conference in the morning, &amp; the rest of the day was attending to odd hobs at brigade including a bike ride to the A.M.C. for a bottle of formalin. The General came back from leave to England in the early morning. At night 2 battalions went up into the line.</p>
