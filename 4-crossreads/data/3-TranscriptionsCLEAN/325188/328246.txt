No tents tonight, under the stars again May 14th 1st Light Horse arrives 10 AM - Busy fixing camp area & more than 120&#176; inside tents last week but better than the cold - We can carry very little kit & it pays to have a few articles of the very best quality only i.e. good pants. Saw young Allanson today & many men that I have not seen for a long time - Captain of the day today
