<p>This afternoon I was looking at pictures of Zepplins and aeroplanes in one of the illustrated journals. Are they not bot truly wonderful? It is remarkable how the great baloons can set out from Europe, cross the North Sea, and return in safety to their home, having not only the elements of the air to contend against, but also those wonderful birds of prey the sea planes and land planes which are ever on the lookout for them with the purpose of rising into the atmosphere bent upon their destruction.<br/>A new German air machine was figured which had engines marked at 150 horse power each, two of them forming the motive power for the one machine, the expanse of whose wings measure 100 feet. This said to be the largest of the class, and giving to the Teuton the command of the air, until the allies have invented some flier that wil have more speed and greater striking power, as also a capacity for staying aloft for more than six hours. How intrepid must be the men who give to these great birds their vitality? Heroes every one brave beyond measurement by the standards so far set, exceeding, not rivaling, in its swiftness, power, and duration, the greatest performance that any eagle ever possessed. The mastery of the air has been handed over from the birds to man. Given stability, the mastery will be complete. Mind you the bird has not absolute stability, he must be moving that he may keep afloat, but he can approach more nearly than is within the capacity of the man made machine. Every one expects that the difficulty will be overcome. The war has given a great fillip to flying by man, because of the dominance which it gives to the side whic can possess it to the highest degree. A great race it has been for superiority.<br/>I must to bed good night, good night, good night.<br/>[A line of Xs and Os]<br/>Caggie Joseph Kitty</p>
<p>11.9.15. Saturday. A fairly busy day. Once again this evening have trains rolled into Cairo filled with wounded. A quota have come to my place. Hot from Anzac Cove and Sulva Bay. Each man looked the worse for ware [wear]. Some of them belong to Brigadier General Holmes brigade, having been ther but a few days. The men told me that when they left Holmes, Watson, Monash, Macglynn [McGlinn], and many others of my acquaintance were all right. I hope to see them soon. We here would much prefer the trains to be loaded with Turkish prisoners than with our wounded men. For two reasons: 1st. It would mean that the Allied troops were making prog[ress]</p>
