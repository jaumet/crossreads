  
 becomes very tiresome 
 Wednesday 10 Letter from Col Green today, he is in the hospital & has broken down in health: (Calais) 
 Thursday I left for Calais this morning. Picked up motor lorry to Poperhinge but missed the train However having the day to spare, I determined to try & get to Calais, & in a spirit of adventure set off. I was very soon on board a Motor Lorry, bound for Steenvoorde about 10 miles I stayed here for lunch & set out again walking along the Hazelmick Rd It was pleasant walking. I had gone about 3/4 of a mile when a car came along & I got a lift in a fine motor car right to Hazelmick about 12 miles. From here I expected to get a train
