<p>Leave to the city was granted at 1pm. We did not get such a good welcome here as we did at Durban, The Boor population are in the majority here &amp; they are a very sullen &amp; surly lot.</p>
<p>I visited Government House &amp; Grounds, The Gardens &amp; fernery &amp; also the Pier &amp; Promenade. From the tip of the tower at the end of the Pier you can get a very good view of the City, Mountain &amp; Bay.  The city is built in the shadow of the Table mountain which rears itself upwards to a height of from 800 to 1,000 ft above sea level , At times the top portion of the Mountain which is flat like a table is covered with white mists which give it an appearance of a huge table covered with a white cloth, I was fortunate enough to see it when it was at its best, It was very pretty</p>
<p>The Harbour which is named Table Bay derives its name from the table mountain also. There is another mountain close to the table mountain which is called the "Lion's head". It has a wonderful resemblance to the head of a sleeping line &amp; is very pretty.</p>
