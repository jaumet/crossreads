 Friday 6 October 1916 A dull grey day, but with little rain. In the forenoon went round the line with Col. Heane going into the most forward positions &amp; practically everywhere. In the afternoon fitted &amp; tested half the mobile machine gunners with the new respirator &amp; as soon as this was over went up the line with Cuthbert, being very interested in the arrangements for the private raids intended to capture a prisoner or two for identification purposes.
