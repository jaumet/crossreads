<p>We had no piano aboard when we left Brisbane so at Fremantle we put in two shillings each (most of us) and bought a piano.  We placed it on the main top deck, strapping it down, and it afterwards gave us much pleasure.</p>
<p>Early next morning we sailed out of Fremantle Harbour and land was soon out of sight.  Now commenced our long run across to Africa.  We were hoping to go via the Suez Canal, but our instructions proved to be via the Cape.</p>
<p>Every night we had sing songs or dances on deck.  I was one of the pianists and the dances were all "buck" ones &ndash; sometimes one of the nurses might be off duty, in which case she joined us.  Every Friday was Sports Day and we had some very good deck races and games.  Every Saturday night we had a big concert.  We used to print the programmes of our concerts on our printing press which we had aboard.  There were 22 men from the Clarence River aboard the "Kyarra" so we got our names printed on a card and sent it home as a souvenir.  A newspaper was also printed at intervals &ndash; the "Dryarra Wail" &ndash; all troopships were "dry" (no liquor aboard).  Wireless news was posted up on deck every morning so we knew how the war was progressing.  Church was held on Sundays as usual as we had three Chaplains aboard.  The food wasn't as good as we had been used to in the camps in Australia, and on one occasion when rabbit was served to us, we refused to eat it and threw it overboard.  Thereafter no more rabbit was issued to us.  The canteen was open every day but it soon ran out of biscuits, chocolates, tinned fruits &amp;c.</p>
<p>Meningitis broke out and we were fumigated and had our throats sprayed.  Three died and were buried at sea.  A burial at sea is very sad.  A board is attached to the side of the steamer on which rests the body sewn in canvas, weighted, and covered with the Union Jack.  The steamer is stopped, the chaplain reads the prayers, the body is thrown overboard, the steamer resumes her journey and life aboard ship goes on as usual.  That night we had a memorial service on deck and most of us wrote letters of sympathy to the boys' parents in Australia.  Luckily the outbreak was quelled and no more deaths occurred.</p>
<p>After being eighteen days without seeing land, at daylight on 15th December we sighted the African coast and soon afterwards entered Port Natal and tied up at Durban.  Miss Ethel Campbell &ndash; "The Angel of Durban" &ndash; welcomed us with her flags as we entered the Harbour.  We stayed a week here and had a very happy time indeed.  We marched to the Town Hall and were welcomed by the Mayor.  Durban is a beautiful city and is the most loyal part of South Africa and the people couldn't do enough for us.  The trams were free to soldiers, free meals were provided for us every day, the people were always inviting us to their homes.</p>
<p>The niggers coaled the steamer here &ndash; no machinery &ndash; every bit of coal was carried aboard in baskets.  Had several visits to the</p>
