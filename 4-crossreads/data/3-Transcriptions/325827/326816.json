<p>If it gets me  down I shall have to chuck it and come home. I shall have many regrets at leaving the mob but I shall think of the earlier reunion with you all and the earlier settling down to regular circuit work again. Don't mention this to Ol at all as it might arouse false impatient hopes.</p>
<p>I shall be delighted to do some sermon tasting with you. I rather love swapping and discussing ideas. Here is some for you to chew over and improve on. i think the heading could be made alliterative or euphonic. But I haven't got a book of synonyms with me and preached it as below (Matt 12:20)</p>
<p>The Masters Tenderness &ndash; Abused need. He shall not break</p>
<p>The Masters Hope &ndash; Smoking flax. He will not quench</p>
<p>The Masters Power &ndash; Judgement unto Victory.</p>
<p>I quite forgot I said anything about the Call of Stouch you mention. The Ginger Mickfalls short of the Bloke for one reason that the subject itself doesn't lend itself to such fine sentiment. However it is good and typical. I didn't think your description fitted Dennis. It does Lawson.</p>
