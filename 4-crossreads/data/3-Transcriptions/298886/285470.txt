<p>23rd March. Thursday 1916</p>
<p>The whole Regiment went out today and bivouacked under the shade of clumps of palm-trees. The idea was to get the horses away to shelter to during the worst heat of the day.

<p>After being on trek we have no inclinations to remain in one place too long and especially in such a dusty place as this with about a mile to water. The horse go out under the shade of the palm trees each day from 9.45 to 4 p.m. Seven bags of mail came in today and that took</p>
