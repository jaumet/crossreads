 Tuesday 26 June 1917 
 I quote news cabled to Egyptian Papers for benefit !!! of Troops or better I cut it out &amp; enclose herewith &ndash; this is cabled mind you!!  I hope the Chinamans garden is now above Water  EGYPTIAN MAIL 24 June 1917 . This afternoon my ambition to Fly was achieved. I went up 2000 ft. &amp; saw the Minarets &amp; Domes of GAZA, then over the Sea &amp; back around the Sand dunes &amp; Camps. I felt no "Mal de Aeroplane" &amp; enjoyed it muchly - only for a Cricket that was on the TOE of my top Boot, which started to visit about when sitting still, all sorts of animals from Scorpions to Centipedes flitted [indecipherable].
