<p>Manor Park<br/>nr. London<br/>7.4.18</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>Many thanks for your l.c. of Jan 8th from Cooma, and your letter of Feb. 3-18 from Albury and Sydney. The latter reached me by the last incoming mail a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>By the same mail I had a letter from George Edwards in which he spoke of being over here before long. I am looking forward to seeing him in London <strike>before long</strike> soon provided I have not been sent back to France before the date of his arrival.</p>
<p>You seem to have had a more extensive and enjoyable trip down into Victoria during the summer vacation. I would give a good deal for a similar break in the responsibilities and monotony of the military existence over here.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear that Keith was well even though his progress was necessarily slow. I have seen several cases over here where certain 'shocked' and strained nerves or nerve-centres have taken a long time to return to the normal. But there is a good deal of satisfaction in the assurance of medical experts that it is only a matter of rest and time. And no doubt Keith will be happier at the "varsity" with some definite work to do than if he were simply taking an extended holiday.</p>
<p>Two months have passed since my last letter to you and in that time I have been moved about not a little. Though I expected a Medical Board on Feb 9th, it did not take place, and after one application for a Board and the lapse of 8 weeks the authorities tell me that I became automatically fit for General Service on Feb. 9th without the necessity for another Board. I'm not quite sure that they are right, but as I feel quite fit for G.S. I am certainly not going to raise obstacles in the way of my returning to the front. This may happen any time now at about a week's notice, and at the outside I don't expect to be here after the 9th May.</p>
<p>The wing to which I belong at present is engaged on the defence of London against attacks of hostile air-craft and as a general rule no G.S. officer remains in it more than three months.</p>
<p>The work is interesting and, during "air-raid" periods, quite strenuous. Sleep &amp; meals are irregular, not a little of the former being taken during the day-time. Luckily, for about a month we have had no actual raids though on several nights the Hun was expected and a keen look out had to be kept for him.</p>
