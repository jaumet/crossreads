<p>This morning the Ninth Corps reported that the 30th Bde on extreme left held a position from 135.0.0 to beach Mark to along crest to T of Tepe thence to S. A Bn of the 11th Divn rushed house in 105W2 with success but were pushed out again by counter attack. Went for usual swim this morning &amp; got quite a bath of shrapnel from Beachy Bill. Cruisers were bombarding Chunuk Bair for all they were worth this morning &amp; our guns were asked to co-operate. The men that gave the news to the enemy were one from a mounted reg &amp; one from an Ausn bn, everything from our departure to our landing here had been fully stated &amp; our strength at different times were accurately stated Evidently the U.C.H.Q know who it is as they are very reticent on the matter. Mail arrived but no letters only a parcel of chocolate from Dunk &amp; Ada. Two of our planes drove off a German at 1800 Snipers fairly active during day &amp; evening.</p>
<p>18 August 1915<br/>Wednesday 53 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Nothing of much importance happened last night, excepting for a few bursts of fire things were normal, the enemy in front of Quinns appeared to be using periscope rifles. A Vice-admiral reported this morning that a seaplane has sunk a six thousand ton steamer in Ak Bashi Liman &amp; one large tug further up, it is understood that this was done by a fourteen inch torpedo lifted by aeroplane &amp; released a few feet above water. Beachy Bill was very active during the night &amp; all day through. Our troops on the left again took that house but were unable to hold it on account of the severe counter attack by the enemy. Ammunition is again arriving by the boatload &amp; guns also which are to go to the Left. At 1400 a series of mines were exploded opposite Quinns with the maximum amount of damage. After tea the enemy let go a few Jack J into Steeles &amp; Courtneys but they were not as effective as usual, although their "75" was bursting well. Germans retreating from Warsaw confirmed</p>
