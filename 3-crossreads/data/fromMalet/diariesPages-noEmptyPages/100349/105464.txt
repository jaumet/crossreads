The order to proceed to the forward area was cancelled. Spent another week in training. Lieut Smith was killed by a bomb from an aeroplane guess my promotion will hang fire again. Went over to La Motte. Reconnoitered the Chateau La Motte where General Birdwood is. Saw some peaches growing on a wall; swam the canal that separated me from them, and sampled them, for they are a novelty. They were good.
