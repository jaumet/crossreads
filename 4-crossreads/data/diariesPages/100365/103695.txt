could not find a single trace of any of them after.The enemy are persistently shelling our Convoy road in the hope of both catching a convoy destroying the road.To this end the Authorities gave us a different route an hour after we had commenced using the new road they started to pour them in on us again. This led to a search, as a result 6 spies were marched off this morning. They had been hiding in cellars in Bosancourt.They gave us a liberal dose of smoke Bombs last night but beyond making our eyes smart they did no military damage.We have had 6 more waggons smashed 3 horses killed as a result of further shelling, so I am going out to Acheuse directly to draw more Horses.So far my little pony has not been touched, although when a shell explodes near himor a big gun fires he gives me some trouble.
