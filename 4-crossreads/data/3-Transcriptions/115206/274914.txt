<p>Wembley and Southall.<br/>Left home early and reported back to Hospital after meeting Roy and Eve up town. Went with Eve to the Prince  of Wales, and saw Fair and Warmer. Not a bad style of show, but very little music at all.<br/>Today I have been through several examinations and inspections. Boat leaves tomorrow. <br/>The [indecipherable] " The Naughty Wife" with Eve and O et Roy.</p>
