<p>Australian Imperial Force, Administrative Headquarters, A.I.F. 130, Horseferry Road, London, S.W. 30th October, 1916<br/>Lieutenant K. Ferguson, Australian Training Camp, Rollestone, Salisbury Plain.<br/>My dear Ferguson, I congratulate you on your letter of the 28th instant, it shows exactly the right spirit. I shall see how matters stand about your going to the front, but remember this, that if you are kept for training purposes, it will only be because you are suited better than other people would, and it is an exceedingly important job. I fear in the past we have rather suffered sometimes for want of the right men doing this work, which we are now realising is of such great importance. Do not, therefore, chafe if you find that you are kept behind, there will be good reason for it, and it will have nothing to do with the personal influence to which you refer. With best wishes, Truly yours, Richd. McC. Anderson</p>
