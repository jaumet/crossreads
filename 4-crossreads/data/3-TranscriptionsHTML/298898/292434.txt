<p>Wednesday 17th Jan.<br/>The day of my return. Called at Cloak Room Charing Cross for a tunic &amp; waterproof cape given me by Ramsay &amp; later left mine there for him to pick up &amp; keep for me. Saw my friends off to Winchester &amp; went out with Mrs. Furber as she wanted <strike> me</strike> to buy me a scarff for a present as I had lost mine. After that I picked up my gear at the Hotel &amp; went to Waterloo to catch the 4 P.M.</p>
