 Friday Jan 29-15  We filled up with coal - our 4th coaling - We pushed off by 9 am - I got Rawdon some shells - They were given me by a native whose leg & foot I dressed - One is a fine one - We got back to Rabaul & anchored well out - I went off to the Yarra & sent one man to Hospital - In the Aftn in our ship we had a little turmoil -
