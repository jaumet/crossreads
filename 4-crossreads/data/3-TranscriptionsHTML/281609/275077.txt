<p>profound secret.<br/>13th Still cool but misty. More troops leave. About 4 pm the Ordnance Depot was thrown open and the troops were allowed to take anything they liked. There certainly is some big move afoot. Rumor has it that the Peninsular is to be evacuated.<br/>14th Cool with light showers of rain. "Johnny Turk" sends over plenty of high explosive &amp; shrapnel. Received orders to be ready to move off at half an hours notice. All over the place ammunition is being destroyed and millions of rounds are being thrown into the sea. At the supply depots, rum &amp; spirits are also being smashed up.<br/>15th Cool. No move yet but expecting to move off at any moment. There is only one answer now, which is Evacuation.<br/>16th Still cool. "Beachy Bill" still active. At 6 pm all hands left "B" Depot</p>
