<p>Saturday<br/>Dec 12-14  It's Saturday aftn about 2.30 &ndash; Forward the deck is covered with sleeping men &ndash; lying asleep on the decking &ndash; One man alone is reading &ndash; He's a cook &ndash; Another is using a sewing machine &amp; using it handily &ndash; Curious to see such a home loving machine just below a 12 pounder &amp; alongside a Maxim &ndash; We are all anxious to hear about the last fight of the Scharnhorst &amp; Gneisenau &amp; who took part in it &amp; we keep the wireless man on duty with his ear pads on to catch the aerial messages &ndash; Probably we shant get anything &ndash; Our last two messages were between Brisbane &amp; Noumea &amp; in French &ndash; The word 'coule' bothered us but it means sunk &ndash; "Un exadre Anglais coule Scharnhorst &ndash; Gneisu Dresden aux les isles  Falkland et pourinet Leipzig et Nurnberg". That was our text &ndash;<br/>It's a lovely day &ndash; No prayers, no quarters &ndash; We <u>holy</u>stone &ndash; the decks instead &amp; then wash down &ndash; Clean up for inspection &amp; prayers on Sunday. Most of the officers are asleep &ndash; I've lent 'Bernhardi' to one &amp; marked the naval chapters for him &ndash; Gradually I'm understanding the navy &amp; naval things.</p>
