<p>Thursday, 22 April, 1915<br/>Up before the Major again for forgetting to report  when I came in last night escaped with a lecture.</p>
<p>I am having a great time here with all the others away I dont care how long they stay away, we are living like fighting cocks on the best of everything and as much leave as we like.</p>
<p>Great news of a big Allied victory reached us it is in Flanders it seems now as if the allies have the enemy on the [indecipherable] offensive.  Have not heard anything concerning the Army that went away, save that the Bombardment of the Dard [Dardanelles] is progressing &amp; the Turks are in full retreat in Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Friday, 23 April, 1915<br/>Bought a fine ostrich boa which I sent to Mother I have written a lot of letters in the past few days.</p>
<p>Two sergeants returned from Helouan at night and went back later.  They say that they are not having too good a time and envy us for the fine time we are having.  C. B. &amp; I went to O'Rs at night he was delighted to be able to speak to English people, it is reported that Cholera has broken out in some parts of Egypt if so it will be disastrous to us.</p>
