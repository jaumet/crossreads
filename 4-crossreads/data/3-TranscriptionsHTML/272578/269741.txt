<p>14th January 1917. Got up at 7 &amp; had breakfast. Reported at 8 o'clock for ration fatigues on the HQrs stores. A hard job.  Unloaded 7 lorries of oats &amp; 5 of hay and loaded up all the Divisional G S wagons. This was solid going from 1 till 6 tonight. Somewhat tired on it. Walked back to billets &amp; went to bed.</p>
<p>15th January 1917. Early morning stables. Shifted our billets &amp; lines to Strazelle. We are now billeted in an old mill, and a very rough concern after the billets we have had in the 25th. We hope to move up to the line tomorrow. I am wishing this comes to pass. Ha d a feed at Mlle Madeline's &amp; had a few drinks. Went to bed in our new "doss".</p>
<p>16th January 1917. Early morning stables. Spent a cold night in our new billets. Didn't move up to the line. Fooled about the lines all day. Issued with our [indecipherable] rations today. Went down to the village for a bath. We leave for the line tomorrow sometime. At last our turn has come. I am rather glad it has. Hope I sleep warmer tonight.</p>
