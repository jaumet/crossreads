 Eriquinghem 1/4/16 We left Roquefort at 0900 meet the Brigad Staff and start off seat upon two motor buse . We pick up the Division Staff and Gener Holm and Watson . It was a delight morn and veri pleasant ride upon the top od the bus , the countri was much the same as we had known alreadi but as we progress toward the fire line it becam veri much more marshi and flat and uninterest compar speak . We pass through the Forest de Steenbecqu and also through a long avenu of elm tree . Such church as we pass had there churchyard close pack with cross c. They evid buri the dead one upon the top of the other . Near everi tomb has it headston shape as a crucifix and we pass mani imag , one was veri lifelik the cross be sculptur to resembl an elm tree and the figur upon it lifes . Glass case contain wreath are common in the churchyard . Just past Melvill we struck a militari burial ground full of grave and wooden cross and here about we saw trench and entangl , all quit rudimentari compar with our Dardanell one . Revet with brushwood they were veri shallow full of water . The appear of the whole place hereabout is that of where a heavi bog has been ? all satur and muddi . Plenti of motor transport plug along . An aeroplan did a veri fine land in a field close by and we saw 6 high up follow one anoth . Further on we saw a ?plane be bombard surround by fleeci burst German shell which seem veri thick round it . Intermitt report of gun all the time . Right up to the fire line the commonfolk carri on their daili avoc and most of them are undesir and distrust veri much by our peopl as treacher . In the event of a retreat the fate of these folk must be hideous .
