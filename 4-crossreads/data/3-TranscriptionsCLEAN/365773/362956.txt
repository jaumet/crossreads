  
 especially with the French people. I only left the Bn. this month so had a bit of it. I had 9 days at a seaside resort Paris-Plage on a court-martial & had quite a good time - visited the Hospital I was in after Pozieres. It is nearly 4 years since we left now by gad I have changed since then I feel about 30 & I believe look it. Am glad poor old Owen is having better treatment - it must be awful to be a prisoner. Am very sorry indeed my dear sister that you have such rotten luck in the health line - we boys Dad & Mother are all so infernally healthy. Fondest love to self R & B. From Ken
