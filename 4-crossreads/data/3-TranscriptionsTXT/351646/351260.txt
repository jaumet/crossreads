 (N.B. This letter contains similar, but more detailed, information to that contained in the "Unofficial Record". A.P.D. 1985) " Dear Just a line to let you know something of our extroardinary behaviour. I can&acute;t very well send it to you while we are still at &acute;War&acute;, so I am leaving this addressed to you in case I don&acute;t get a chance to see you after. As the Australian Navy is bound to get any discredit there may be flying about, don&acute;t forget that we passed directly under Admiralty control on the outbreak of War, and in any case were commanded by R.N. officers and have so far done all that they would let us. At the time that war broke out, or rather, three days before, August 3rd. "Australia", "Melbourne", "Encounter", &amp; "Parramatta" were in Sydney with submarines. "Sydney", "Warrego", and "Yarra" were up the North Queensland coast. At the same time there were five or six German merchant ships in each of the ports of Melbourne, Sydney, and Newcastle. All these ships were allowed to get clear away and doubtless supply the German cruisers with coal aand stores. It would surely have been easy to detain these ships, none of which cleared the ports more than 48 hours before the declaration of war, or at anyrate to wait and catch them by following them up, and so deal a severe blow to the enemy by cutting off one source of supplies at once. It would have been so easy too, as we did nothing else in the time that would have been needed. But, as I say, we did nothing. "Sydney", "Warrego", and "Yarra" were sent up to defend Thursday Island. Why anyone should want to attack it I cannot understand. The German cruiser "Gieir" was up that way, but I can hear of no attempt they made to catch her. "Parramatta" was the first ship to leave Sydney. She left on August 3rd. and arrived at Townsville on 5th. and lay there till 7th (while all German shipping got clear away.) "Melbourne" I believe was the next to leave and she rushed away to Fremantle but only got halfway when she was recalled and finally caught up the rest of the fleet at Rossell Island after the attack on Rabaul on August th when, it will be remembered, it was confidently expected that most if not all the German ships would have been encountered. "Australia" came along without waiting for "Encounter", our lame duck, and also apparently without troubling to get any information the shipping companys could give her about the departures and arrivals due along the coast or about the place they were going to attack. Ultimately "Australia", "Sydney" and the three Destroyers met at a rendezvous and proceeded North to attack Rabaul. This was done by the Destroyers on the night of th, Sydney waiting outside the harbour to support them in case of neccessity. This first time we seem to have really made a serious attack with every hope of forcing a fight. The Flagship ceased using her wireless when over a thousand miles away, and the ships who actually attacked did a big run the evening of the attack so as to avoid coming near the harbour in daylight.
