This inactivity in Camp no good. 8 1/2d allowance ceases today - the system of rebates immoral but a product of the way of doing business here. 4/- per man per month at Heliopolis, 2/- here. 
 21/1/16 Reveille 0530 and at 0700 left for the rifle range. Pontoon bridge rigged up by Engineers swayed a good deal from side to side. Did some good shooting out in the desert. Machine guns hard at it spurting up the dirt. Irrigation brings out white deposit on ground like salt. Cotton in one plot in ear. Plenty of bird life among crops snipe quail and king fishers. 
 Returned for lunch, had to hurry across bridge as some sailed vessels came bearing down canal. Sand makes rapid fire a problem as the bolts sweat with oil and collect the sand. "Tucker" Vienna applied for leave for a "beer up".  A good worker but too fond of beer to be reliable. Emanuel is his Christian name and he was run over by a gharry at Heliopolis while drunk but later joined us in trenches and did good work. Before mess received definite order we leave for the Canal on Monday. 
 22/1/16 A lovely day. Tried NCO'S at early class on artillery formations the centre sections of each platoon getting on an irregular frontage by doubling out. Rumoured Mackay will not be second in command but Groves is in the running. Major Smith in Cairo. In afternoon our m.g. section had contest with 7th Battn. The 7th won by 97 points and I lost P.T. 50 by backing ours. They have a smart section and a smart little officer is wearing the D.C.M  - a first here. A few months ago he was Lance Corporal and at Lone Pine kept his gun going under great difficulties. His gun was blown out by shells time and again but by patching up he kept going until he had the party of about 7 other guns in his. One man mounted gun in 30 sec alone. Crew time 40 sec Carragher (wounded) in guard tent with D.T.'s.
