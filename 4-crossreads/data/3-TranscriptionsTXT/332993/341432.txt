Tuesday May 22. 1917.There was a lot of rain last night and it continued showery all the morning.Our Battalion is now out of the trenches.I am to go down to the Transports this evening.D. Company had all their rations carried on pack mules today, this is the first time that rations for our Battalion have been so carried.It is 6 months today since we left Lark Hill Salisbury Plains.The German casualties according to their own published statements is nearly 41/4 millions.I arrived at the Transports A. L'Epinette about 4.30 this evening.I cleansed out an old wash house, put a stretcher in and made a bed there, as all the huts are full. It is handy and convenient and much better than in the tents.There is some very heavy artillery activity this afternoon, between Armentieres & P'loegsteert.Wednesday May 23. 1917.It is bright and fine to day. All the rain is gone, and the mud is quickly drying up.This is the 1024 day of the war. When the war runs 1099 days, if it does run that long, it will be going exactly 3 years, the estimated duration attributed to the late Lord Kitchener.To day it is 6 months
