19.7.15Mon. 19th.  We went on duty at midday, after putting in a quiet morning reading.  Our aeroplane flew over us for a considerable time & laid an egg on the Turks before she retired off the scene.  Two Monitors took up positions opposite us this afternoon & there was a good deal of shelling from both sides.  Some large shells also feel uncomfortably close to a battery of our Artillery.
20.7.15Tue. 20th.  Last night the Turks seemed to be affected with nerves, as they we [were] doing a good deal more firing than usual & were throwing bombs all night, some of which came right over us & exploded half way down the hill but neither the shooting or bomb throwing did any damage.  At 10 oclock a message came through that we were to have a gas alarm before daylight.  This happened at 4 oclock this morning & we had to knock about for half an hour in helmets, a fair amount of shelling, but nothing out of the ordinary to-day.
