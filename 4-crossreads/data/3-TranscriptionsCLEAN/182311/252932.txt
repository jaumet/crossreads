 Headquarters, 3rd.Australian Division. 
   
    Lieut Peters, M.C., is returning to his Battalion today, and I should like to express my great thanks to his Battalion and Brigade Commander and to your for having spared his services to us for so long.  He has worked extremely hard and with great keenness, and all our Raiding parties have benefited from his instruction. 
   
    It has been of the very greatest help to us to have had an experienced man who has been able to give us first-hand knowledge on the subject of Raids, and no better xxx selection could have been made so far as we were concerned that that of Lieut.Peters.
