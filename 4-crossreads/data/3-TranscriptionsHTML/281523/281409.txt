<p>30/7/17 Campagne<br/>Marched out early to a parade ground about 45 minutes away and there got on to drill and general training.  Generals Paton &amp; Smythe were round and General Birdwood also.  The latter was in good form and had much to say.  Two Armies jumped over this morning and Genl Birdwood says that 35000 tons of shells were used in the bombardment.  Later we heard that between 3 &amp; 4000 prisoners are taken &ndash; it will be a busy night in Hell!  After lunch carried on with specialist training.  A splendid view from here in all directions.  In the distance are the towers of St Bertin &amp; Notre Dame of St Omer looking out as they have done now for hundreds of years.  Nearer are pleasant fields and old little red brick &amp; thatched hamlets.  The ground hereabouts is damp and peaty and part of a marsh system.  Marched back with the band in full swing and passed a busy evening.  an excellent mess here &ndash; very homelike.  Told Penna I am superseding him for his Captaincy.</p>
