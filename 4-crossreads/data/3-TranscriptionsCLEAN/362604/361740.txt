  
 I think we gave Valentine one of those Photos.  We are not pally with Him.  He is an impossible sort of chap & we only tolerate Him for the sake of your Friendship with Mrs. Val & because He is a Manlyite.  But keep this all to yourself.  We took the money for running but Soldiers & Sailors are able to do that without losing the Amateur Statis so it is all O.K.  My leg has not troubled me since & I've done miles & miles of cycling & have never felt the leg again.  I rode to Sarum yesterday & it was a nice ride for it was a perfect day.  I visited both of my Friends & took the "Close" Girls on the river for a row.  I do no rowing.  I taught them last year & they can feather with an Australian Champion
