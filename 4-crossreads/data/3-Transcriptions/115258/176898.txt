<p>My dear Father</p>
<p>A big mail came in last night with two letters from you and two from Mother and also the photos taken by Mr Pearce, so everything in the garden is lovely, and I have just met a man from Mudgee - Randal is his name and he remembered me from seeing me at Crossing &amp; Cox&#39;s sales. he seems a very decent chap and gave me all the Mudgee news. Bill West is a Lance Corporal now and Randal has gone into his section, so I expect will be one of the family. I was awfully pleased to hear of the good results of the show. Our sheep, like Bushell&#39;s tea, speak for themselves, dont they? and My Word you did hit it right with those ewes of Reg Lowes. Randal was telling me about Clark of Lue buyin Eumaralah - I suppose he had to pay pretty high for it. Was jolly glad to hear Fred got his land OK - we will have some estate now alright and Fred will have to have</p>
