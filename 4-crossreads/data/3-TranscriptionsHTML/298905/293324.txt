<p>sleep in a few minutes.<br/>11th. Breakfast at 9.30 this morning &amp; quite early enough after the stiff time of the last 24 hours.<br/>This morning is very dull &amp; cloudy hope it don't rain, we are not so very far from Amiens here according to the map.<br/>The country we are now in is mostly chalk &amp; very picturesque, it is fairly hilly &amp; well wooded, while the roads are the best I have seen in France<br/>Have just been round the village Dombart she is rather a nice little place &amp; very pretty  I don't think they have ever seen Australians before, for we attract a fair bit of attention, I notice the officers are having a job to get quarters for they are running about all over the place, &amp; I notice our Brigadier is on the same job, our boy's are already making the old village</p>
