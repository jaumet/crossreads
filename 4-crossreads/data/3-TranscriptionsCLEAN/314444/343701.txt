 Dearest Mother & Father, Did not recieve any letters from you by the last mail, but hope they come during the week. Stan recieved one from Dorothy. Well I got through my raid alright but it was rough I can tell you. I brought one prisoner back. We sneaked over to their trench and jumped in. They are not the stuff for fighting up the hands go quick. We only had orders for four prisoners and any others well whip it in I will tell you all about it when I can get a letter through from England. The weather is great at present I am feeling well & in excellent health. I hope you recieve my last photograph. give my love to all friends & tell them I will write latter on as I am very busy at present. We have got them as nervous as anything along this line, as we are having raids every night. I do believe it will end this year. I do hope it does. Hoping you are all well best love & wishes
