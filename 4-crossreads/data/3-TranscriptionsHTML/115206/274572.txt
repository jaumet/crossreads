<p>January 1918<br/>Wednesday 2</p>
<p>At Beutin<br/>Last night &ndash; the weather changed bringing a  transformation of scenery to meet our awakening eye. Beautiful white snow was draped on every natural object, erasing here an ugly mark and softening the dull aspect of our billet.<br/>The morning sun's radiance however soon melted the work of the Clerk, and dirtied the footpaths and roads. We worked the usual routine today, and I had a game of footer during the afternoon. Smith and James were very "sore" this morning.</p>
