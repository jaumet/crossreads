<p>17<br/>a very good seat compartment all to myself &amp; stretch out. A sleeper would have cost me 25 fr. &amp; this is as good, I spend all the night travelling</p>
<p>8-6-19<br/>Arrived in Paris Gare du Nord &amp; set out for Hotel Windsor &amp; have a bath &amp; breakfast &ndash; meet Miss Andrews from Leura &amp; Miss Wilson who is in charge</p>
<p>I take room &amp; go for a walk down city to fill in time as I have made arrangements to go with this party <strike>to</strike> on the river up as far as the Maine to down as far as St Cloud. The river is not pretty being spurned by numerous bridges &amp; lined on the bank by historic buildings. However near St Cloud its forest clad hill in which scarcely a house can be see is beautiful.</p>
<p>We land at St Cloud &amp; take refreshment, &amp; then return to Hotel where after dinner I help Miss Wilson to make Orangeade.</p>
<p>9-6-19<br/>I get up too late to have breakfast &ndash; &amp; all the ringing in the world seems unable to rouse the girl so I miss my bath. I report in accordance with my orders &amp; find no one there as this is Whitsunday</p>
