<p>up on deck at 4 am to See entrance into the Sound. We dropped anchor at 6.35.<br/>There are a few Small islands at mouth of Sound, one of which is Breaksea. There is a lighthouse on it, and is situated to the right as you enter the Sound. I have not seen any beaches like we have in Sydney yet; though I am told there is a nice one near the township. One of the Engineers caught a small shark about two feet long and the men started to cut it up alive. After they had ripped it up &amp; taken its tail off, they threw it back into the water.<br/>1 pm. The Shropshire has just come into the Sound. There is another one following. Supposed to be the "Saldanha".<br/>There are now about 14 troopships in the Sound.<br/>Officers went ashore &amp; returned to ship about 6.30. Rumours of march through Albany. I hope it comes off. The H.M.A.S. Melbourne arrived about 8 pm.<br/>26.<br/>Heavy wind blowing. Sea rough. Orvieto and Geelong arrived about 8 am. There are other boats continually coming</p>
