1916   THURSDAY 20   JULY
Another nice warm day. Helio signalling all day. I got a couple of letters from Mother to say she would come down to Salisbury if I wanted her too, but as I get leave on Monday I did not as wired her not to come. The 27th Battery went on duty. I was detailed as incinerator man.
