Bapaume
5/4/17
A lovely sunny morning with skylarks singing and the fields looking nice and green.
Far more pleasant country this to rest in than at Memetz. Out in front all the time the sound of guns continues and has its accompaniment of wicked machine gun rattle. On the door of the Hospice were a few old posters nearly indecipherable. They are in French and German. "Le Maniere Anglais de faire la guerre" deals with the use of dum-dum ammunition which is alleged to have been found on British prisoners. Bullets with the ends filed off "C?est la manier de guerre la plus brutale" and practiced only by savages of Africa and Asia. "A nation guilty of practices such as these cannot be accorded a place among those civilised".
Another poster was evidently one issued just after the taking of Warsaw and stated the the totals of prisoners in German hands was about 600,000. In the main illegible but some of the following were the details
French 3459 Officers 7 Generals 215905 Other ranks
Russian 3575 Officers 18 Generals (Illegible)
Other posters were ?curfew? orders and cautions re drinking water that had not been sterilized
