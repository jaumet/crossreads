<p>Gallipoli Peninsula<br/>11th September 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>Since writing last week, I have only received one letter from home, that from Father dated 11th July, and one from Ted dated 29th July which should have reached me weeks ago. I am absolutely too fed up with the mail service to give my views on their system, at any rate in a letter.<br/>There is little or no news since last week. We just go on from day to day hoping that every hour will bring us word that we are to make some move towards bringing this Turkish business to a finish but nothing comes.<br/>All the troops who have been here from the start are being relieved in batches and given a spell at Mudros Harbour, Lemnos. I am to go tomorrow with 20 men from the Battery for a fortnight. It is not an exceptionally lively place, but it will give us a chance of getting in some decent tucker etc. and will break the monotony. I am glad of the opportunity of paying Ken Smith a visit and also some other fellows I know in the Hospitals</p>
