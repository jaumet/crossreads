<p>1916<br/>December<br/>something wrong with it.  We walked to the nearest tram and someone said that Camps Bay was a good place to go to.   We hopped into a tram (<u>not</u> free by the way) and paid 3d each for a ride that ought have cost 1d.   Changed trams into the Camps Bay variety (I think another company must run it).  These are something like the Dulwich Hill trams but not so big.   The fare is about 9d but ought to be 3d but when the conductor came for the fare we flourished 10/- notes at him, and he walked on and forgot to return.   Needless to say, we did not race after him.   [Inserted a photo of "Camps Bay"]   Camps Bay is a rather dopey place.   Things didnt seem to go with the same swing as Durban and for general get up one couldn't compare the two places.   The tram ride however is well worth taking as it goes right round the mountain.   The people here are a very mixed lot.  I</p>
