Our horses objected to the camels but we passed so many they became quite used to them. The country was delightfully green (all irrigated) cotton sugarcane datepalms flourishing. The obelisk prettily situated in a small grove of trees and looking as fresh as if erected yesterday. Returning we called at the Church of the Holy Family where they rested and to the Virgins tree where she rested. I wonder if they found this resting hard work.
All these places green and fresh, nice gardens and so on ? a change from sand sun and 'sorrow?. We came out on a road near Abbassia and reached camp again at lunch time.
2.30 To the hospitals and saw Green and some other of our sick men. Green rather downhearted. He gets no better of the septic poisoning and is getting thinner; although I swore to him he was looking well and putting on weight.
Remainder of afternoon evening in camp. In orders tonight, no leave for Cairo at all. The City is out of bounds. The result of last nights conduct of the troops.
