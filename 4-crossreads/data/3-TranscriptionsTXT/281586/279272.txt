3Swiftly and dauntlesslySoaring and climbingCapably, vauntlesslyTreading the airUp where the clouds aboundMound upon snowy moundDrawing their robes aroundHiding her there.
L MorrisBeni Selah19-7-17
A Hymn1Jehovah, with a lavish handHath made the world so fairHow blind indeed the eye which failsTo find His imprint there.
2Each flower that on her slender stalkUplifts her starry faceShows in her own sweet lovelinessThe wonders of His Grace
3The dews, the rains the seas, the skiesThe humblest life that CreepsProclaims His presence in the WorldWho slumbers not or sleeps
4No life ere fails no sparrow fallsWithout He knows and cares
