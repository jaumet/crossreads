While at the N.Zealand Canteen the other night Cpl. Foulkes - Medical Student friend of Mony's - came to Jack Molloy & I with the information that 3 Corporals each with four men were wanted as regimental details.He had been chosen & of his four men 3 had been chosen.  Mony of course was the best as fourth for I decided not to leave Molloy.  There remained the chance with the other Corporals.  Molloy & I dashed back & found Corpl. Weir.
