<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we&#39;ve been allotted our colours, purple above, red below, eliptical in shape, three inches longer diameter and 1&frac12;&quot; the shorter, worn on the sleeve one inch from the shoulder.&nbsp; It is nice to have our colours or rather to know them, for we haven&#39;t yet been issued with them, perhaps next week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For my future address please add in 10th Brigade so that you will now address it -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lieut.C.H.Peters,</p>
<p>38th Battalion,</p>
<p>10th Brigade, A.I.F.,</p>
<p>On Active Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This spot does remind me of some of our bayside places such as Mordialloc, fine homes are standing back among ancient trees, the hotels and boarding houses line the shore and the summer girl is everywhere.&nbsp; The weather has been most changeable, almost every day we have much rain alternating with bursts of glorious sunshine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The course in Range-Taking is most interest-ing, and by no means hard work, although it leaves very little spare time if a fellow is consientious about his notes.&nbsp; I&#39;m trying hard for a distinction and am keeping a very fine systematic system of notes.&nbsp; In our practical work today I had the least error of our squad so hope to do well in the test.</p>

<p><u>7. 9. 16.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Lark Hill, Salisbury Plain.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I am back on the plain, back where we have a thousand worries instead of one, where Reveille is 6 a.m. and not 7 a.m. as it was at the school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Have been back a couple of days but &#39;tis the first opportunity to put pencil to paper, this morn we have received our second dose of para-typhoid innoculation and have the afternoon off preparatory to marching off at 6 o&#39;clock to occupy trenches (in practice only) for a couple of days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I must tell you how I spend last week-end,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
