  
 Septembre 21 Things are much more quiet today. There is great activity consolidating new lines of communication & a great many Batteries are being shifted up into new positions. It is reported that here are 1000 dead Germans at least on our front in one Brigade area. 
 Septembre 22 Coy are shifting closer up to the new lines - taking up H.Q. at Zillebeke Lake. I have a party employed making hot food containers. Fritz made another counter attack this morning but was beaten off again. Sgt Baldwin & Cpl Hamilton both of the 1st F. Coy & original men have been killed. I think it was this morning. Sgt Baldwin was a particular friend of mine.
