<p>May 21<br/>In shorts, in the sun burning the last of the white away.  Yesterday H.Q. Canteen sold a batch of Khaki shorts &ndash; shorts that cover <strike>quite</strike> down six inches from the loins.</p>
<p>155.<br/>p.m.<br/>Tonight coming into D.R. a long yarning of an hour with Roland K.  Somehow the talking turned to Limehouse Nights and so to a long arguing on "The Chink and the Child", it was an enjoyed argument &ndash; the first of its kind since the old nightly ones of the Nelson St. verandah with Harry.</p>
<p>An arguing roughly terminated by sudden salvoes from the Boche, and a rapid retreating to the trench by the Brewery.</p>
<p>Payed today, drew 270 Francs, 150 down to Tommy for &pound;5 order for T.B.C.  No mail.</p>
<p>May 22<br/>156.<br/>Early afternoon.  A whole morning spent in the field by the tall tree flanking, full in the sun deep in the grass with Les.  Then an hour sleeping in the tangled shade:  looking up into the trees from under their shade they are green &amp; luxuriant growth of maiden hair fern:  each leaf lies flat, each stem and branching is black, and the light of a clear sky lends a shining brilliance to the green.  White dryads bathing in the green leaf flecked pool would be the most natural happening in the world.</p>
<p>The next field to us is livid with the yellow gold of high buttercups:  here are daisies, last night's shelling has left broken black in the colour, and in the field of gold are two machine gun positions.</p>
<p>Just from lazy habit the guns are firing.</p>
<p>[Drawings of building.]<br/>157.<br/>10 p.m.<br/>Mail, from Commonwealth Bank, notification of money arriving.  Gently they break the good tidings &ndash;</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<br/>We beg to advise having received a cablegram from Australia, in which your name appears to be mentioned.</p>
<p>A letter written asking for a holding of money.</p>
