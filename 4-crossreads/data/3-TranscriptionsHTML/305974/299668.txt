<p>27 Monday<br/>Fritz is still shelling all round here.  He put over a good few shrapnel shells this evening but did no damage. I saw 2 airoplanes come down in flames today, one landed all right (one of ours) but the other was burned completely (? Who's it was).  We now have to carry about 400 yds &amp; then wheel the patient to Brigade Hqrts (about 800 yds) it is much better than the other carry.  It was very misty this morning but wasn't so cold as it was previously.  There were 4 officers (Tommies) killed at B. Hqrts &amp; 9 men wounded about dinner time</p>
<p>28 Tuesday<br/>It was a bitterly cold morning.  We don't get any news up this way at all, so it will be a treat to get a paper when we get out.  We were relieved about 10 am &amp; went per light railway train to Delville Wood &amp; then walked to Longueval.  Pretty near as soon as we arrived W.O. Baber had all of us carting the makings of three huts over here from the Engineers Depot.  I am living in a tent</p>
<p>29 Wednesday<br/>The first four squads of A Section were detailed for duty as stretcher bearers for the next 24 hours.  I am in No 4 squad.  We had three trips to do, most of the patients are suffering from trench feet &amp; influenza of course there are<br/>a good few wounded too.  There are a good few go through here daily.  We have to wheel the patients for about three hundred yds, carry about 200 yds then wheel trolly for about 1&frac12; miles, &amp; then carry about 200 yds where they are entrained.</p>
