Your letters sent on 28th of May reached me safely a few days ago, also Two from M. and one from West Australia, of which I will speak later on. I hope Mother Dear that you have received my letters by now. They have been posted each mail I suppose they will eventually reach you my letters seem to be coming along, all except papers which only arrive at intervals, I have not received many. I told you in my last letter that we were seeing a little of lush country, some parts are very pretty here the country is hilly and, there are some very pretty spots, that I would like to go over, the trouble is that we have not been near any of these beauty spots long enough to see any thing of them, we just see them and pass on, You would love to see the wheat fields etc. here poppies and cornflowers a few pretty blue Larkspurs and numerous other flowers grow in wild profusion through the crops. I have not seen any Hop plantations down here, so if you know the parts of France that go in for Hops and wet weather you will be able to guess where I have been, in F here things are better; but the country though not quite so good, is I think prettier. I expect to be in one of the machine Gun sections very shortly, so if I get through all right, I will have a chance of doing something. I have not heard of Alf Phillips since I left Egypt and so far have not heard anything of Bruce Rae yet It is just a chance whether I meet him or not, Tell John that I met Ted Mackinson a couple of days ago, he asked to be remembered to J. have not seen any of the others that J ? gave me the names of, we do not have a great deal of time to run round, looking
