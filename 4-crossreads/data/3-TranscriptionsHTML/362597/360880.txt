<p>the trip, in the place where we should be travelling the slowest.</p>
<p>We had a mock trial on a Breach-of-Promise case last night. I was right at the back &amp; could not hear very much. I had a feed of chocolate &amp; nuts &amp; sultanas any way. I ducked out about half-way through the show &amp; went to bed.</p>
