He will understand.
Give Annie Howard my fond love   &  tell her I shall write to her soon. Did she get my little note I sent her. Suppose you have (Belle) had your holiday with her.
Seem to be spending a fair amount of clothing etc. My clothes are (under garments) needing replenishing. So my extra money is being spent. Still have heaps to go on with.
Fondest love   &  kisses to you all. Heaps of Good Luck
