<p>though naturally the parents do not think so. Am glad to see them both so happy.</p>
<p>Monday<br/>Pouring with rain, ankle deep in mud everywhere, it is nearly a mile to the shower bath, slip down several times en route. Return from bath dirtier than before I went; very little water to use. Tired of being filthy.</p>
<p>Dec:<br/>Day's leave to get teeth seen to. Time spent on teeth, ten minutes. Meet Waterhouse damsel, take her out to tea &ndash; very nice. Meet Dick, who thinks it was all pre-arranged.</p>
<p>Dec:<br/>Drill. Writing</p>
<p>Dec:<br/> Day's leave for teeth again. Meet Waterhouse lady by accident; also Dick; he is now confident that it was all prearranged &ndash; gets quite rude about it. 6 p.m. tea with Dick. 8 p.m. Dick is out, Waterhouse lady arrives , not by accident . 11 p.m. return to camp</p>
<p>Dec: - 3 a.m.<br/>Reveille, 6 a.m. entrain for Williamstown &ndash; ranges all day firing.</p>
<p>Dec: Saturday<br/>Visit Melbourne, meet Waterhouse girl. 11 p.m. return to camp.</p>
<p>Dec: 7 a.m. Holy Communion, most unusual for me. Tear off to Melbourne, visit Waterhouse lady &ndash; am asked, will I have dinner or would I like a bath; the usual question put to anybody coming from Broadmeadows Camp. Return to camp.</p>
