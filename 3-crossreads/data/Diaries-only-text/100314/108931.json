12/3/18 La Basse Ville
Braithwaite Co. Ordered certain changes in dispositions with a view to getting my reserves further forward. Gas was to have been put over on our right by the next Bde. but the wind evidently was unfavourable because the thing was postponed frequently and eventually cancelled. The evening was quiet and there was nothing doing. Left with McCartin at about 10.30 for a tour of the front line and got a whiff of gas when going up the C.T. His flares were conspicuous by their absence on our front so we concluded that he has either patrols or wiring parties out. It is a long and weary trudge right up to the line round the traverses of the Communications Trench and the night was very dark and moonless.
