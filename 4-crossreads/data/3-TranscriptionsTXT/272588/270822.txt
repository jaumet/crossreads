 Wednesday 25 December Xmas day passed quietly.  We had much to eat &amp; a little to drink, but everything was very orderly. As a matter of act, I have a touch of flu. 
 Thursday 26 December Joy! A return has been asked of all men who left Australia in 1915 &amp; C.O.'s have been warned to be prepared to lose these men at any moment. Admitted to Rest Station with flu.
