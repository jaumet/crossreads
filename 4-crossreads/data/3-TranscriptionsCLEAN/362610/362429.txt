  
 Tuesday 1 August 1916 Another hot summer's day. Parade in the morning & immediately afterwards I had to take the company down to the banks of the river Nievre where a pit had been dug & covered with tarpaulins to render watertight, & water pumped into it. The men greatly enjoyed a bath in it, but were late getting back for their lunch : on this a/c the afternoon parade was cut down, my time being spent principally at censoring. In the evening had to report to the Bde. H.Q. to take over the job of Gas Officer, but was allowed off until the next morning. Glad to have dinner with the company once again & to afterwards turn in between the clean sheets.
