<p>Monday 25th March 1918<br/>Off Monday evening 8 p.m.  Went first to town to ask for Cpl. Shaw, then Heliopolis in "brown" car &amp; exchanged stockings.<br/>A gloomy day for all who hear a report that we are driven back 17 miles on the Western front &amp; though contradicted yet one feels very anxious.  All lights shaded in trams etc. &amp; Cairo more or less dark as regards lights but so pretty in the moonlight.</p>
