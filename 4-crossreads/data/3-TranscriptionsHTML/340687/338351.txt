<p>February, 1917. Friday 16<br/>Up after dinner. Cloudy in morning, sunny in afternoon and fairly warm. Big explosion at Ammun. dump at about 7 and another hour after which shook the earth. Presumably our dump near Fricourt or perhaps more to right. Fritz getting very active. Our bombardment heavy in front all morning. Inoculated at 3 and felt very sick at work. Got lost under Daves guidance and spent a rotten night. Carried pickets all night and home via Railway line dead tired and ill.  Rained in evening but cleared later and didn't get wet.</p>
