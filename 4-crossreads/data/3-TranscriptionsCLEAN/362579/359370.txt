in Blighty for next winter. Dorothy is well but rather fed-up like the rest sof us. She   &  Annie Bell have not gone for leave yet, so may be able to get ourselves together.
Wonder if Edmund has arrived safely   &  been to see  you. Hope he has more happiness now   &  that things will work all right for him.
Hope you are all very well   &  happy - Go out as much as you can to visit friends.
Fondest love   &  kisses to you all
FromYours lovinglyEdith
