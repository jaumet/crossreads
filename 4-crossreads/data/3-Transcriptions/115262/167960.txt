<p>With C.B.F.A. once more and attending the parades which are same as before. All supers. were on the mules this morning.</p>
<p>Those 50 AMC. details mentioned previous marched in today &amp; they are real <s>wasters</s> not up to the standard of Amb. men.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Rumors</u> at to where we move &quot;shortly&quot; are started &amp; the no of &quot;furphies&quot; are nearly as bad as Seyr.&nbsp;camp between Jan. &amp; May this year.</p>
