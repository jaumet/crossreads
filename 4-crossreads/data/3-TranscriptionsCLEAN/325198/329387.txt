What a weary trip it was down here - We left camp yesterday morning at about six & we got here at 5 in the evening.  Right along the line the sight was one of green fields & water & perhaps one would have enjoyed it more had the seating accomadation been better but we were cramped up uncomfortably on the hard seats in dirty carriages & it was not until we got near Sidi Gaber that the boys showed any enthusiasm in their surroundings - Along here every thing looked to be greener & in greater profusion.  Banana plantations palm maize, etc every where 
 The Nile is swollen with the flood - I heard some one remark that the waters had reached a higher point than since the year 1889 so its some flood & a muddy swirling old stream it was, the glimpse I had of part of it.  We had orders read to us, they were lengthy & some caused some rude remarks & a deal of snickering from the Aussies - While the Tommies looked at us like so many Mother Grundy's.  Here is a sample --- "When going to bed at night the rifle bolt must be removed & the sling loosened one end & tied either to the arm or leg"  The limit
