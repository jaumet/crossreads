 Clive Weston is my Quarter-master Sergeant  it is hard to keep him sober &amp; the day will come when he will be broken. I have wet-nursed him for his family's sake. The old REG. arrived here.   Enemy bombed our arrival. 
 Left the sand &amp; the Desert. Country here good. Barley crops &amp; wild RYE, CROWFOOT, OAT GRASS LAMBS TONGUE, MUSTARD, COUCH GRASS, &amp; VETCHES, with QUAIL among it.
