<p>France,<br/>26th Sept. 1917.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Hill,</p>
<p>I take this opportunity of conveying my deepest sympathy at the death of your son, Tom. We were sergeants together and intimate friends always, and I have never met a person whom I respected more both as a soldier and a gentleman than Tom, and I am sure all those who knew him had the same opinion.</p>
<p>He died bravely and had already been recommended for another decoration for his invaluable work and example set to his men. Your son is buried in a military cemetery in Belgium not far behind the line, where his grave will be well cared for.</p>
<p>I only wish that I could express on paper my deep sympathy to you, for one whom I loved and honoured so much.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>Roy A. Smith Lt.<br/>19th Batt. A.I.F.</p>
