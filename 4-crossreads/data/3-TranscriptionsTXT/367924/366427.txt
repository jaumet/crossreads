Out in the Desert15th Oct 1917
Dear AuntJust a few lines to let you know that I am quite well &amp; hope you are all the same. I have just recieved two letters from you dated July 31st &amp; Aug 6th &amp; one from Birts Wife dated 9th Aug so this is the mail that was missing. I am sorry to say that I have not recieved the last parcels that you mention in your letters yet, but they may come later. I am pleased to hear that you have Lassie over there with you now, as she will have a good home I know &amp; I hope that she turns out well, the only things against her is that she is a very timid dog.
Do you know that I am always pleased to hear from Birts Wife, as she writes a very nice letter always. I am pleased to hear both of Jims &amp; Charlie's promotion &amp; fancy Charlie getting the D.S.O. he is getting on alright. I am very sorry to hear that George [indecipherable] is so bad, he must of broke up all of a sudden as he seemed all right when I left.
I am afraid that you are not getting near all the letters that I write to you. Mr. Ross must be a very healthy &amp; strong man to recover has quickly as he has done after such an operation, remember me to both of them. You can tell if you are getting all my letters by the date, as you should get about one a week, as I write as regular as I can.
I do wish Nell would go &amp; stay with you for a while. I am sure Alie would be better off there. My word Denny has had a run of bad luck. What bad luck Treasures had loosing there little Girl. I feel very sorry for them.
