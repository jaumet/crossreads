<p>Raining lightly this afternoon &amp; we have done scarcely anything<br/>31st. There was a fine concert here last night, one of the best I have seen round the Camps so far.<br/>By tonights paper I see that the long expected smash in Flanders has started, she will be some go I'll bet.<br/>1st. August. Lectures all this morning for it is raining again. We have a new Coy. Commander a 4th Batt. officer, &amp; there promises to be some fun if he carries on like he has started the sooner McGregor comes back the better, he had an accident down Bournemouth way, fell off his motorbike &amp; broke one of his arms or something &amp; now he's in Hospital</p>
