I am going to Cairo with John & Gwen & from there to Alexandria, that is the best way but will send Rid a wire as soon as we get to Port Said.  It will all depend on what time of day we get in whether I can go right there the same day.  Rid has sent me a list of trains. I am amazed to find myself almost here the time has not been too long and I shall be so pleased when I can send you a cable from my final destination. You will know I am all right & safe won't you, whatever you may hear from papers &c.
