but of Toulon. The coast was rather mountainous clothed in dense pine thickets, which appeared very beautiful after the sands we had just left. Entering the harbour we found it practically deserted with the exception of several troop-ships. Everywhere seemed strangely quiet peaceful. The city, lying at the foot of the steep pine-clad hills seemed from where we were to be dead, scarcely any life was visible on the foreshores or in the beautiful parks surrounding the red houses which were nestled at intervals among the groves round the water. A few ferry boats containing mostly women passengers went by us with the usual cheering but beyond this we saw nothing of the inhabitants.
