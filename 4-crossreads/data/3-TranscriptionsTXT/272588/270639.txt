Friday 4 JanuaryWalk to Ballieul see Verner en route & was pulled up by the A P M for not saluting.  However he was very decent and nothing was said.
Saturday 5 JanuaryStill fine weather.  The snow has again and the roads are like glass & vehicles slipping all over the place. Front still quiet. Our bread ration has been cut down and the shortage has been made up with biscuits.  Our unit canteen is now very profitable and from the profits we have money expended on us & food bought to make up rations.
