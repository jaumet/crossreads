Hindenburg Line in front of Bullecourt
Last night slept on a hard duckboard with fits and starts although very dead beat. Aroused to a sudden gas alarm and wasted no time donning gas mask. Our mornings fighting appeared satisfactory against the flower of Germany and the numbers killed were high. German has been the only language talked in hell today! After breakfast settled down to the luxury of a wash and a shave. Finer weather but still a good deal of mud ? Spent morning fixing up details of supplies for stunting - always a trouble this unless one keeps pushing hard. General Birdwood round after lunch looking at the show. Guns busy cutting the wire in front. A few men wounded at Dressing station. Very heavy bombardments all day on the wire and in late afternoon some large ones got very close to the road and burst loudly. The Padre returned from hospital
