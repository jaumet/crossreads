<p>Colonel Williams [Writer of letter]<br/>France<br/>April 10th 1918</p>
<p>W. Garling Esq.<br/>I wish to offer you my sincere sympathy on the loss of your son Terence by enemy action on the 5th April last.  He was commanding his battery during violent enemy attack on the above date and was struck by a shell splinter and died a few hours later at a casualty Clearing Station near where he was buried.<br/>I knew your son when in Militia in Australia and was associated with him as a Battery Commander for over 20 months.  He was a man of great personality and was highly thought of by all who knew him.<br/>Speaking as his Brigade Commander I lost a very valuable and trustworthy Battery Commander who will be extremely hard to replace, and I am sure that there was not a truer, nobler or braver man on the Western Front when he fell.<br/>Believe me to be<br/>Yours faithfully<br/>T Williams</p>
