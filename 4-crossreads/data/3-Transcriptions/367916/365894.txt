<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I have several lots of thanks to offer you &ndash; for a letter I received a few days ago enclosing some very interesting cuttings from Sydney papers, for several issues of the "Current History" &amp; several parcels of chocolate that have arrived since I last wrote.</p>
<p>I should have written before to ask you to refrain from sending any more chocolate as the Summer is too much for even the air tight tins &amp; it is arriving melted. It will harden as a matter of fact on ice of which I get a supply for "medical comforts" but it is to a large extent wasted in this climate.</p>
<p>[Gullet] has left us now &ndash; permanently I think. He has taken on a job as War Correspondent &amp; becomes a Civilian again, I understand. He is now at GHQ and will probably remain there or at least make that his headquarters.</p>
<p>You have I expect heard about the show over here a week or so ago. The enemy put up a stunt which resulted in his losing 600 prisoners &amp; a proportionate number killed. We lost somewhere about 60 altogether. It was a very neat bit of work on the part of the Light Horse.</p>
<p>The prisoners were done to the world when I saw them</p>
