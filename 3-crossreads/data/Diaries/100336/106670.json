We have since found out that they were making 2 and 300 &percnt; on every article they sold.  The canteen was run by the Commandants brother in law.  Of course there was a great swindle being worked, the Commandant and Officers taking a good percentage of the profits.  All they sold in the canteen was sugar coffee, some while sour tasting cheese, ulver, a sweet mixture which can be cut like cheese and eaten with bread, and a few onions.  The canteen was a small room in the Russians building.  We were not allowed near it so a Turkish boy came round with a basket each day.  He in turn tried to make his little bit of profit from the prisoners.  On 15th May we were joined by two Australian soldiers who had just come from the Dardanelles.  They gave us very little news as our troops had not been fighting long enough to make any decided progress.  There was a Turkish bath in the same grounds as our building, so once a week we were allowed the privilege of going for a bath provided we could pay the 2 piastres which they charged.  The correct price should have been half a piastre.  This was another case where we were robbed.  After a lot of trouble our Captain was allowed to send us &#163; 6:0:0.  With this we bought tea, sugar, and charcoal to boil the water.  After this we had tea twice a day.  For some time this was a great luxury.  We had a Turkish Naval Lieutenant Commander in charge of us and under him four lieutenants.  The Commander was a stout man with a most awful temper.  On two or three occasions we had reason to know that he had such a bad temper.
