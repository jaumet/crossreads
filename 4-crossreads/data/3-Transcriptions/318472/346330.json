<p>15 April 1918<br/>Monday<br/>A very uneventful day. The weather continues cold and damp. Smith and I went to Albany Wards Show at night fairly good show. Getting tired of Camp life</p>
<p>1918 April 16<br/>Tuesday<br/>We are having miserable wet weather and it is very cold. There is nothing of interest to note. - Just the same old routine.</p>
