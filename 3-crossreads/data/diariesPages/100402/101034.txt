Friday 1 March
"March comes in like a lion", snowing, raining etc. We moved to-day to Kemmell, Main Dressing Station. The village is certainly knocked about, but nothing in comparison to villages on the Somme. We move up to the line to-morrow but I think things will be quiet.
Saturday 2 March
Move up to a cross roads, locally known as the Brasserie, on the Ypres road camp in dugouts in the brewery. We are a little north of Wycheate. The A.D.S. is about 1 miles further on I believe very comfy. The weather is cold, wet miserable, snowing off on. We go to the A.D.S. tomorrow on fatigue work. Heavy bombardment last night in consequence of a raid by Fritz in which we lost many men killed, etc. "he" was successful.
