  
 I make my bunk up close to the wall they make me form a bridge as they go to & fro you can imagine the feeling as these creatures run across your blanket. It takes a lot to get to sleep once you have felt them about. 
 Today I am sorry to have to note a Naval gun 4 point 5 which is on a ridge behind our guns & the trenches had a premature burst. The early explosion of the shell wounded four Light Horse men just rear of my store. 
 Tuesday 19th Oct It was overcast again to-day and very cool. We were Subjected to a lot of shelling early in the day. 
 Wednesday 20th Oct Quiet - except the usual daily shower of Bullets & shells.
