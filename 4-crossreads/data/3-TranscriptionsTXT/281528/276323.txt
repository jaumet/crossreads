 17/4/18 - Lavieville Went across and saw Brazenor &amp; Jack.  A great deal of heavy stuff has been going over all day soaring up high in the air, humming steadily.  About dusk two of our planes flew up and down behind our lines &ndash; fairly low certainly.  Their job it would seem is to see if the enemy is massing.  They omitted to do the two things necessary, (1) go over the enemy lines (2) fly down very low over it.  Doubtless they return to the aerodrome and report all correct another triumph for the air men.  Have had the Q.M's staff making tommy cookers out of sawdust, bag, kerosene and old 18 pounder
