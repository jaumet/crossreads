 As soon as we pulled alongside the wharf at Bologna, we were impressed with the beautiful sight the City presented with its magnificent buildings, which could be seen from the vessel we were on.  In a few hours we were disembarked from the ship, and lined up in one of the streets near at hand, to prepare ourselves to march through the town, the other end of which our camp lay. This day was a Sunday, and many people passed us on their way to Church. We noticed that everybody was dressed well, but dressed in black; this made us think hard as it was a signal that we were really getting near to the root of the world's troubles.  As we marched through one portion of the City we were besieged by women and children and kissed by them; the children at times carrying our packs and rifles to show their gratitude and appreciation of our coming into their land to fight the enemy with their own fathers who were already in the trenches.

 We walked further round the town until we found ourselves near the main railway station, and on finding this we decided to go onto the platforms and see all we could. We had not been on the platforms very long  when a red cross train came in from the Somme Front. As soon as it arrived a long stream of motor ambulances pulled in on the opposite side of the platform to receive and take away the stretcher cases as they were discharged, or unloaded from the train. This was the first time I had seen wounded men coming straight from the front line with
