<p>a bit of a spit-fire &amp; is rather too straight for some of 'em.  I have not met Her yet.  I must try and arrange to see Her.  I hope to cross to the Island on May 1st.</p>
<p>I suppose you will have had Dave out to see you all ere this reaches you.  My! what stories He'll have to tell you.  He is a great talker &amp; a great exaggerator.  You can take a little bit of what He says with a grain of salt.  You can shew Him this.  We are not frightened to tell one another the thoughts that come upon us.</p>
<p>I am Orderly Corporal to-day &amp; should have had a lot of work.  But the Ord. Sergt. went out &amp; I did not look Him up so I've had a real easy time so far.  Ellis is up at the Mess playing Billiards.  I've several letters to write so I must stay right here &amp; get on to them.  We are both well &amp; have plenty to keep us from moping or going rusty.</p>
<p>I must say Good-night now.  I hope to go to Salisbury with Ellis on Tuesday to visit Mr. Fremantle.  Kind Regards to all the neighbours &amp; Heaps of Love to yourselves.</p>
<p>From Harry, xx</p>
