Holman reckoned Australia would have conscription inside 6 weeks But he is such a liar, no one takes any notice of him.
2nd July, 1917.
Did a bit of a stunt this morning; over the old "Somme" positions Red poppies bloom in the vallys looking like pools of blood; and fields of daisys and yellow mustard make the country round here beautiful. This evening we moved over beyond the town of Mailly Went foraging, found some cherry trees in a deserted garden. We are ordered to prepare for a big field day tomorrow, over the ground where there was such fierce fighting this time last year when the "Somme" offensive opened.
