<p>It is from this spot that I first had a look at the battlefield of the Messines sector. &nbsp;You can see Ypres away on the left and the Ridge or what remains of it, after the colossal explosion, slight to the right, but it is no longer an imposing town like the photograph. &nbsp;Not much of it is left past the X, and the iron railings at the bottom lie about all bent and battered. &nbsp;The surrounding ground is one mass of shell-holes. &nbsp;When we first visited it, it was an Observation Post, with tunnels all over it, but now it is entirelyin disuse. It was from this spot that the King viewed the place, and we commenced our regular work near it about a day or so after. &nbsp;It enables a fine view of the surrounding country on a fine day and that is the idea of the Tower, the &nbsp;village of Kemmel lies about a mile at the bottom of it in front, and there is not much left there untouched. &nbsp;The height of the Tower can be gauged by the fact that the pillars of the steps are about a man&#39;s height, but there are none left there now.</p>
