<p>Monday June 19. 1916<br/>The ship is rolling terribly this morning and last night. There are heavy swells and a strong head wind. The course is 5 points North of West. From 12 p.m yesterday to to 12 p.m to day we travelled 266 miles.</p>
<p>This afternoon we were paraded to the Bath room for a shower.</p>
<p>Tuesday June 20. 1916<br/>Cloudy and showery. The course is the same as yesterday. The sea is lumpy. Most of my time is taken up reading. I have read numerous articles in papers &amp; magazines. The last book I read was "The Wisdom of Folly" by Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler and I found it of very absorbing interest. Reading appears to be the chief occupation of all on board. Games of various kinds are also well patronised. Draughts, cards, Quoits, skipping, etc</p>
