<p>Saturday 6 May 1916<br/>A most beautiful Australian night and morning.<br/>Left Fremantle at 8 a.m., calm sea but heavy swell.<br/>Hard work at stable cleaning owing to it not being none yesterday.  Passed Hospital ship with returned wounded at Fremantle.  We left port to strains of "Hearts of Oak" on horlnet from shore.  Goodbye dear old Australia.  Wonder when this war will be over and what is going to happen to us.</p>
<p>Sunday 7 May 1916<br/>Stables as usual in morning.  Half day off in afternoon in which I did my washing &amp; had general clean up.  Another horse died.  Received news that there is a German ship in Indian ocean;  we slightly altered course on that account.  Wonder if we'll have any fun.  Beautiful calm day.</p>
