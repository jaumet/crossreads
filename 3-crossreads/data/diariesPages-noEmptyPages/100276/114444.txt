one could not help noticing the swarms of rats that infest the ruined city, save for the echoing footsteps she is as silent as the grave reminds one of a city that has been overun by a big fire, nearly all the buildings have the interior burnt completely out only the walls are left standing they all show great gaping holes where the shells have ploughed through, there are 4 buildings in there that one must notice, the first is the ruins of the lovely "Cloth Hall" the next the Catherdal which has only the front walls left standing they have got quite a startling lean on them
