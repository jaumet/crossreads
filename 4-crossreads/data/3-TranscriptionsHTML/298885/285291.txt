<p>night to welcome the New Year in.</p>
<p>It was originally proposed to hold a dance to which the civilians of Morialme were to be invited as they have done so much for the Aussies since their arrival in this locality.</p>
<p>Well unfortunately this dance had to be postponed till the night of the 7th to make allowances for one &amp; all to be present.</p>
<p>But because the dance was postponed please do not entertain the idea that we all condescended to go to bed and keep quiet. Oh NO! far from it</p>
<p>Some did and some didn't</p>
