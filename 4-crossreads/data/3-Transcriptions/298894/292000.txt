<p>but rocks &amp; more rocks. The main road to Castro proved to be a very fair one, being now kept in repair by the military.<br/>Friday 26th. Mess orderly. Weather cold Saturday 27th, Long march in morning which took me all my time to do as I had a bilious attack  &amp; a sore foot. This is my second attack since coming to this country &amp; I thought I had lost them for good. These attacks make me feel wild &amp; snappy with everybody. Very cold with a little rain. Nothing doing during the afternoon.Sunday 28th. Bitterly cold &amp; bleak day. Strong wind blowing with sleet and soft snow falling. Physical drill before breakfast as usual &amp; Church Parade at 11 o'clock. After dinner I decided to walk to No 2 in order to get my mail away. Six miles through a strong wind &amp; driving sleet. I managed to get a pair of mittens &amp; bed socks whilst there. I arrived back at 5.30 several saying they would not have done the trip for a pound. It was not a pleasure jaunt with me but done to get the mail away.</p>
