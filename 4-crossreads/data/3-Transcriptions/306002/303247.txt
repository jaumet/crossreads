<p>11.8.15<br/>Wed. 11th.  Relieved the men on the 'phone at dinner time to-day, a message came through this afternoon that a 3 days feast commences with the Turks &amp; probably another attempt will be made by the Turks to drive us off the Peninsula (with the aid of Allah) their fanaticism has not helped the [them] much in their previous attacks;  things have been fairly quiet to-day &amp; I believe both sides are busy "digging in" at present;  about sundown or a little later the Turks on the left flank made a determined attack, but were repulsed with heavy losses.  From the top of Walkers Ridge we can se the Red Cross waggons busy going over the ground we took from the Turks.  We failed to take hill "971".</p>
<p>12.8.15<br/>Thurs. 12th.  A fair amount of shelling to-day &amp; the Turks were seen to be <strike>tak</strike> withdrawing their ammunition &amp; stores, from the front of our right flank, on donkeys &amp; mules.  An alarm was sent to Hinton's Post last night that a German spy (suspected) was trying to get through to the Turks line, it proved to be Leiut. Edmonds.</p>
