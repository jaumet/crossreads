smoothly & Scotty & I used to get away every evening so with my relations we had a good time, They looked after the pair of us & we can only thank them from our hearts, here I must not forget my New South Wales friends & one felt on Nov 10th when we were to go aboard the SS Ascanias, A 11. That the folks were fully worth while going on active for. There were thousands of people on the pier at Port Melbourne & we got a great send off my relations were there. I felt proud to be going away to do my little bit for such folks. We passed through the Port Phillip heads at 6.30 PM Nov 10th.
