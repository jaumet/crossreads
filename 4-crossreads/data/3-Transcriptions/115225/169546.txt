<p>Vermozeele, it was a wretched cold, bleak grey day. We heard bad news from the Somme. I had a parcel from Mary.</p>
<p>Mar 28th We only did one trip again to-day to Vermozeele with R.E. stores. Cold bleak day, it rained in the evening. I wrote in the evening.</p>
<p>Mar 29th Another wet day, we took R.E. stores to Vermozeele in the morning &amp; took the relief party up in the afternoon. Our despatch rides came up with our mail &amp; instructions in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Mar 30th The morning was fine but it turned wet in the afternoon. We took a load of R.E. stores to Vermozeele in the morning, tunneling timbers etc. I made some adjustments to the lorry in the afternoon.</p>
<p><u>Memo. </u>Very startling news from the Somme this week of a great German advance. We don&#39; know just what to think of it from what we hear, it is said that we are drawing Fritz into a trap &amp; will then cut him off.</p>
