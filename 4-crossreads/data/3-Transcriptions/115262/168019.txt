<p>Sunday 9 September 1917.</p>
<p>Quartermasters fatigue today &amp; various duties entailed by that fatigue.</p>
<p>&quot;Again a little more time to myself&quot;&nbsp;<u>A wonder.</u></p>
<p>Reported that the Taube that came over the other day was brought down near the Waddy.</p>
<p>Another Taube over again this morng. Anti-aircraft guns gave him a hot time. As usual the British planes appeared when he was gone.</p>
<p>Bombardment on the line today.</p>
<p>Water issue 2 <s>pints</s> bottles for washing drinking etc. Total allowed by G.R.O. 2 pts. per man per day. This water comes right from Kantara. Is pumped from there.</p>
