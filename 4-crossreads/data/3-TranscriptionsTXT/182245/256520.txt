 JANUARY 1917 
 5 FRIDAY 
 Fine,&nbsp; but dull &amp; cold &nbsp;and sunny 
 but rained at night. Cleaning 
 harness all the morning. The 
 order came at dinner time 
 that we were to go to the 26 th  
 in the afternoon, so we got all 
 our gear packed &amp; the left 
 section went over. Their billet 
 is not nearly as good as ours 
 was, &amp; we were crowed up like 
 sardines. Lieut. Rourke is our 
 section commander. There were 
 some German &#39;planes came 
 over us, some in morning &amp; 
 some in afternoon &amp; the anti- 
 aircraft guns were shelling them.
