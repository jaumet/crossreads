Up at 10 a.m.  Cold wind blowing all day.By getting up late we save a meal and therefore make the most of the very short rations.  There isn't really enough for two meals a day.Went up to Beaulencourt for rations this afternoon.All 8th Field Ambulance bearers are now coming to Beaulencourt, leaving the 15th Fld. Amb. to work out from Bapaume.The 14th Field Amb. are going out of action in two days time.
