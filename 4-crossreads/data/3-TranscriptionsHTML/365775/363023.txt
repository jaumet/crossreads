<p>Leaving England today 22nd. Feb 1916, for duty in Egypt. About 2000 on board &amp; 800 mules; a dirty old boat the "Kingstonia", an old cattle boat before the war, otherwise we had a splendid trip over, beautiful sea all the way.</p>
<p>6th March. Arrived Maadi Egypt where our L.H detail camp is. The Regt. has just left some few days previous for patrol duty along the Canal. Met Frank Murray, Harold Brown, Jack &amp; Don Gillies. Brown &amp; Gillies boys are in the remount depot. We had one or two gay days in Cairo together.</p>
