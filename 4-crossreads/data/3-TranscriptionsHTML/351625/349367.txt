<p>hospitals but I will be able to go out in the afternoons &amp; buy stuff so I wont do too bad then.  I will have to finish now as my old fingers are getting stiff.  I have to write with my forefinger &amp; thumb which is pretty awkward.</p>
<p>Give my love &amp; kisses to all &amp; whips for your self.</p>
