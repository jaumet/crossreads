DEAR PEOPLE,
   I've so much to write of, but so little that I may tell, however, your Harold has again been well in the thick of things and has again returned with a story that is well worth hearing, but one that I may not tell with any detail here, here are a few facts:  I've been over the para-pet again on a raid and one which received black headlines in "The Times" so you will see that it was of great import-ance, although my party's entry was foiled by wire and other obstacles, one of the three parties entered and did splendid work.  Lieut SFleighter ^39th Bn A.I.F. who lives in Vic.Avenue was trium-phantly brave and daring and will/I'm sure be honoured for it; I expect he will earn the M.C., and he deserves it too.
   I am glad to be able to write this and perhaps my Dad will know his and I would be glad if he told him how well he behaved, coming out of it too without a scratch, though our casualties were by no means light.  However, enough of shop.
   The "Bendigonian" I see has printed the photos that I send them of my platoon and "Life on a Transport" they have enlarged them somewhat and so lost some of their definition.
   I am sending you when they arrive, a set of cuttings from the English papers of the account of our little joke on the Germans, I'm feeling too cold tonight to sit and write for long, for we have had a solid freeze
