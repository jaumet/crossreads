<p>My regret at being prisoned in this camp during Xmas holidays is greater than I care to tell, for I had so counted on freedom<br/>I had hoped to be a giant for a few days<br/>However matters could be worse that is a lesson one learns at the front<br/>Often I pull myself up with that 'it could be worse'<br/>Yes indeed, and what a hairs-breadth of a difference would have made it worse<br/>It is food to even be spending Xmas in a chilly depressing camp. It could have been a great deal worse.<br/>I was pleased the other day to get Jacks cable saying all were well. What a long time it was in reaching me.<br/>It was good of him to be so splendid for the news has cheered me up; especially as I have had no letters<br/>Dont think I allow myself to get depressed. That would be foolish. I have great faith in coming out right someday in spite of a peculiar nature which needs much control.<br/>The awful waste of time annoys me most in this game</p>
