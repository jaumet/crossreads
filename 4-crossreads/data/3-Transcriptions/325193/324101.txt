<p>we arrived at our destination which is situated just behind the enemies front line, we go to bed at 1 A.M., no blankets no over coat, only an oil sheet and had a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>June 6th 1917.<br/>We have just been told to keep under cover all day and that we go into action early tomorrow morning.  the day is terrible hot and here in the trenches it is stiffling, and we can't get out of them to get a bit of a breese because we are under direct observation of the enemy.</p>
