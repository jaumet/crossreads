<p>Dear Father<br/>I think I owe you a letter have lost count. No need to say how pleased I am to get a letter from you.<br/>We are still here as you will see by heading. Had a letter from Les the other day. I am sorry for him loosing his place again so soon. His luck is certainly out. He writes very cheerfully re his staying with Mrs. Field. It will be much nicer for him than being with the Fallers. I think he has learned a bit from his knocking about. I don't think he will leave where he is again in a hurry. I suppose Mr Lunn is back in Sydney again now. This war would give him a bit of a scare. There have been a few boats arriveing here from England. They all report on the discomfort of having to put their lights out early in the evening. Well the war is still going strong &amp; likely to from all accounts.</p>
