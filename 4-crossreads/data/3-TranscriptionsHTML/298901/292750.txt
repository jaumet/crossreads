<p>Sunday 7th July<br/>Extremely quiet.  Received a good mail from Australia, 9 letters latest date being 12th May, just 2 months old which is now the average. Made of weekly drug requisition.</p>
<p>Monday 8th<br/>Sent off my offsider to collect the drugs &amp; suffered for it.  First he left all the returns behind &amp; managed to break the axle of the car.  Fortunately it happened near the workshops &amp; he was given a lorry to complete the trip.  Weather very changeable, rain &amp; sunshine</p>
<p>Tuesday 9th<br/>A very heavy day.  I do all my issuing on this day so all the details come in which means going hard all day.  Got through a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>Thursday 11th<br/>Very quiet but on our right our 4th Div. had a couple of minor stunts.  Weather cool &amp; rainy.  The 1st Div at Menin also stunting so papers are free of Australians with a commendation from Clemenceau</p>
<p>Friday 12th July<br/>Nothing doing in our</p>
