  
 part of N.S.W. as I did, she has travelled a good deal. 29th. "Guest night" & a big dinner with all the pomp & ceremony of military dinners, we all drank the Kings health when the President proposed it, plenty of wine nuts etc. My boil still very sore this morning & I had to go down, the nurses fixed it up by pressing nearly all the black blood out of it, & this afternoon it feels much easier it wants to for I got no sleep last night, it was very painful, I have to go down to the hospital 3 times daily until further notice, the Dr. said it was a very nasty boil & in a bad place, close to the nerves. Rained heavily all night & today it is cold & bleak
