<p>A.M.C.</p>
<p>it is an old, but truthful saying,<br/>"even the dark cloud has its silver lining"<br/>And while the battle to and fro is swaying<br/>Someone is watching o'er your fate and mine.</p>
<p>You hear the call for stretcher bearers singing<br/>From mouth to mouth sounds forth the first alarm<br/>And soon strong, willing arms are bringing<br/>The wounded quickly from the zone of harm</p>
<p>At "Red Cross Stations" nimble hands are waiting<br/>To dress your wounds &amp; ease your stinging pain<br/>Perhaps you have some soft voice sweetly stating<br/>"the fight is won, you have not fought in vain".</p>
<p>And then comes sleep! Per<strike>haps</strike>chance you may be dreaming<br/>Of flowers, sunshine, and the hum of bees.<br/>While some kind nurse with eyes of love all beaming<br/>Whispers the words "saved by the A.M.C.s"</p>
