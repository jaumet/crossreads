France
?devastated area" miles of shell holes full of water tangled wire and ruined villages like a scar in the moonlight. As our train went slowly on one thought of the army of ghosts lying in the cold scattered wet graves. At dawn we passed the familiar La Motte and Blangy Tronville just near Villers Bretonneux and ran down to Amiens where the market gardens now once more appear to be in full crop again. Our train now took the Rouen line passing through splendid woods fruit blossom and grass of deepest green. At 11.30 we had reached Romescamp where Chinese coolies were busy cleaning up the station yard. Had some lunch and tea here ? the troops cannot complain about scarcity of comforts
