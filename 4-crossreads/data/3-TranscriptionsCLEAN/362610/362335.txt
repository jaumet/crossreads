Saturday 29 April 1916Still glorious weather, sunny & warm but with a rather strong wind from inland which raised a good deal of sand & dust. Went to the dentist & thence into Etaples on mess business in the morning & in the afternoon was kept going censoring letters & attending to matters.At night had a joke on Prescott who had gone to Boulogne for the afternoon, fixing his bed up & turning the tent about as it stood.
