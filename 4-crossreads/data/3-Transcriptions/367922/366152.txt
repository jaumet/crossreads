<p>My dear Arthur,<br/>Kindly accept my sincere congratulations on new appointment which I hope &amp; believe is better than the old post. The surprise occasioned when the G.P.O. list was issued, [indecipherable] case, was a disappointment by the omission of your name but such has now been overcome by the pleasing information in this morning's paper.</p>
<p>Old associations, which were always of a very pleasant character, call to my mind the many pleasurable &amp; instructive meetings of our old Society &amp; arouse within me a feeling akin to joy when I note the success of any of those who found such association.</p>
<p>So far a great many of the Old Redfern Literary Society boys have done well &amp; I certainly hope that good old Steve Mullondey will reap the same reward</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>[indecipherable] A Williamson</p>
