<p>There are quite a lot of "Jacks" mixed up among the crowd &amp; the mongrels have taken all their shiny badges &amp; buttons off &amp; are putting up their Battn. colors in the hope of camoflaging themselves but its no use for everyone knows them &amp; they are in for a nice time.  They ought to pitch them overboard to the sharks that's about all they are any good for &amp; the Staff at Horsferry Rd. are very little better.<br/>The Orderly Officer &amp; I had a few words this morning over the Mess Orderlies parade but nothing came of it.<br/>Went &amp; had a look over one of the old forts that was built many years ago to protect Devonport from an invasion.  It's a long while since I saw such massive stone work &amp; burrowing &amp; tunneling all over the place, the whole show is surrounded by a big moat many feet deep &amp; the entrance has a draw-bridge, the whole thing is of course obselete now &amp; is used for a gas school by the Tommies.</p>
