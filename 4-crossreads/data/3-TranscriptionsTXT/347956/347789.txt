inspected our hammocks this afternoon to see that the ropes ends were properly bound, so that they would not unwindWe passed quite close to the Sokotra Islands early this morning.
Tue 24thNo rain last night.  slept soundly all night in fact too sound, as I found out when I awoke this morning that a handkerchief, I had about 15/- tied up in, had dropped out of my pocket & someone had apparently noticed it before I did, & took possession.
We saw a whale or porpoise this morning about 8.30 A.M. all the boys reckon it was much too big for a porpoise & I believe it was; but did not think whales were to be found  in the tropics; it was within one hundred yards of the boat;  I also saw two lovely fish come up above the water at the same time about [indecipherable] feet long. the
