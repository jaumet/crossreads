<p>Thursday 7 Sept. 1916<br/>A glorious day but with wind still in favour of the enemy. A flight of a dozen or more of our aeroplanes passed over soon after breakfast, &amp; was a pretty sight. During the morning visited the right battalion to fix up alarms &amp;c. The ground was drying up well but in places there was still plenty of mud. After lunch went up to the left battalion for a similar purpose &amp; at 6 o'c. had to go all round the left bn. lines with the General : the trenches in places were awful, mud &amp; slush being 10 or 12 inches deep. It was a beautifully clear moonlight night &amp; I enjoyed the trip, everything being very quiet.</p>
