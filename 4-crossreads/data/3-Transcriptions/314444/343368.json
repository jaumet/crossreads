<p>I shall be pleased to hear from you (if no trouble) &amp; trust I am not too much worry.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>In sorrow<br/>Annie Boys.</p>
<p>When the flowers strew the roadways<br/>And the boys come marching home<br/>To the cheering of the people &amp; the beating of the drum<br/>When the father's hands shall grasp them<br/>And the Mother's arms shall clasp them<br/>Oh have pity for the watching ones<br/>Whose lads will <u>never</u> come<br/>A B</p>
