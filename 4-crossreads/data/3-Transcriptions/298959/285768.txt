<p>Seas and shipping them continually. At times the waves were as high as the Boat deckX. We were abreast of East London at 9 p,m. The Town was brilliantly lit up, and could be plainly seen.<br/>Tuesday, 19th. Sea very rough, and wind blowing a gale.

We passed Lion head and entered Table Bay soon after. We went alongside the wharf at 10 a,m. The harbour is very small, and only one vessel can move in it at once. Table Mountain dominates everything. We had a route march through the Town at 1.30 p,m, and were dismissed near the Gardens at 2.30 p,m, and granted leave till 11 p,m. We strolled round the Town and purchased Books of Views. The Town is not too bad, but we liked Durban much better. They have a very fine Pier and some large Business places. We heard that the "Shropshire" had been mined, but denied the rumour. At 11 a.m, the "Ayrshire" pulled out for Australia, with a large number of Australian wounded aboard.
