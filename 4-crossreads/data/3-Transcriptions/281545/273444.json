<p>Bridge meeting the Main Line again at [blank] where you take another curve into the R.O.D. Depot.   After my mate cleaned his Fire &amp; took water we signed off at 11 am, &amp; reported ourselves to the Orderly Sergeant where received a Chit for Two Blankets &amp; a Waterproof sheet, my mate likewise also for meals.    As this is a new Depot in the formation everything is outside down we were allotted a Tent to sleep in having to lay on the ground it was not to comfortable.   A large number of German Prisoners were busy building huts for the engine men so in a few days all hands will be comfortable.   At meal times you go into a Large Tent with Table &amp; Forms &amp; an Orderly brings in the food &amp; serves it out.   After a good Dinner of Stew Potatoes &amp; Carrots &amp; Rice, we both turned in at 1 Pm &amp; I slept fairly well until 6 Pm, when I arose &amp; went down to the Canal which runs along side of the Camp to have a wash.   This Canal will be very handy in the Summer for the boys to swim in.   After I had my tea I was notified to sign on at 8.45 Pm, &amp; at that time we reported ourselves &amp; I received a chit for 12 hours rations consisting of &frac12; loaf of Bread &amp; a Tin of Bully Beef, also a note to proceed to Devies, where that was I did not know.   Another Engine was being prepared as a Banker for me &amp; at 10 Pm we both left the Depot &amp; stood out in the shunting yard for over 2 hours at the Train was not ready.  My mate &amp; myself sat down &amp; after a while we were both asleep &amp; at Midnight</p>
