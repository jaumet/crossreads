<p>July, 1915<br/>Thursday 1<br/>I have made myself as comfortable in my Tent as possible DUG down 2 ft matting floor Egyptian Porous water bottle costs only &frac12; piastre &ndash; 1 &frac14; D &amp; keeps water like in a water bag. The Heat is no worse than Australia &amp; lovely cool nights &ndash; flies are less troublesome now. I bath in a Bucket with [indecipherable] Ammonia twice daily to keep the awful Nettle Rash or Ezcema that so many are suffering from owing to the Heat &amp; sand &amp; lack of fresh vegetables.<br/>Personally I prefer Butterflies to Blue noses.</p>
