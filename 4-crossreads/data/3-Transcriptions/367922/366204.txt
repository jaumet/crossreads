<p>mud. On more than one occasion have I had to be dragged out of a quagmire, up to my waist in depth. Walking becomes a fatiguing labour. But, of course, all the regular roads are duck boarded and corduroyed. This is now frozen into earth as hard as ice and as slippery as a skating rink. Nevertheless, as I said, it is infinitely better than the dreadful mud.</p>
<p>We see little of the French soldiers. We are on a front of our own, part of the British sector, and so are never brought in contact with them. There's lots to interest one in the villages, but we are usually so busily employed that we have little time for exploring.</p>
<p>Well, Professor, I hope you are enjoying good health. Please give my kindest regards to Dr. J, and with best wishes</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>Dene B. Fry</p>
