<p>10.5.15<br/>Mon. 10th.  I have had a bad throat since last Fri. &amp; it has now turned into a cold in the head &amp; as we cannot get medicine on board, it is not improving.  Last night Stan &amp; I slept down a hatchway in the rear of the ship &amp; when we awoke this morning, we were covered in coal-dust, had a lecture on how to dress wounds etc. before dinner &amp; were also cleaning rifles this afternoon.  We passed some small islands before sun-down.  We were issued with cards to send home &amp; retired to bed early.</p>
