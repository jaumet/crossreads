<p>Wednesday 20 August 1919<br/>Cold again. Sea calmed just a little. Passed a boat quite close. Was the Marathon or Miltiades. Duties for Cape Town are out &amp; so far I've slipped for duty. Do me. Played rummy for about 3 hours after dinner.<br/>The nigger who challenged any body on the boat has been matched for &pound;s aside. Have &pound;1 on the unknown with Dal.<br/>Some slight trouble with the guard last night. Lent my colt to Cooper in case of trouble with the guard.</p>
<p>Thursday 21 August 1919<br/>Sea absolutely calm all day. Thick mist about too. Passed a couple of boats. Played cards &amp; read all day. Dropped anchor just outside Cape Town about 8 pm. A boat came alongside evidently with doctors &amp; staff. Finished my long series of letters to Nettie. Was 24 pages.</p>
