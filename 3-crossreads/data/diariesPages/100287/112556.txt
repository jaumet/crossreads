One of the firemen on this ship broke his wrist while boxing one of our lads a few days ago, he is now unable to work the ships Captain is stopping his wages also making him pay for his passage even food
Some of the boys have taken up a collection on the boat for him, it appears he went into the ring against the Captains wish with the above result Anyhow it is pretty stiff on a man
8th. Been very much cooler today thank heaven it has been quite a pleasure to be on top, but last night was a corker for we all got properly flooded out wet to the hide by a tropical storm of some violence the decks were all flooded in a couple of secs we were nearly swept into the sea, took us pretty well the whole day to dry our blankets etc.
