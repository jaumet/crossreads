come off.

As I was writing this note I heard the report of two shells bursting. Going outside I saw two flames in the sky and a few minutes afterwards two Balloon Observers were to be seen descending from their damaged balloon, in parachutes.

It was interesting and exciting to watch them descend, from a distance, as they dangled in the air swinging backwards and forwards gradually bringing themselves down to the ground.

May 31st. Thurs.
Walked out to Mont Des Cats. A pretty stiff climb up to the top of the Mont.

There is a large college and monastery at the top of this hill. At present the college part of this monastery is used as R.A.M.C. Hospital for Skin Diseases

One gets a beautiful view of the surrounding country, much the same as from Mont Noir. The windmill at the top of this hill is made of brick, a different type of windmill it is from the others.

Troops were being instructed in Machine Gunnery.

Witnessed an Aviator doing some marvellous turns and twists in his machine. 
There was also a hospital for Officers here and it was said that he was giving an exhibition for their benefit. One of the turns was a complete somersault on his side.

Returned back to hospital covered
