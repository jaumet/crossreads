<p>Good Friday Apr. 6th   Our Bearers came back from the Trenches today where they have been following up old Fritz.  We are putting on a Concert tomorrow night &amp; we had a rehearsal tonight, so as to give 'em some of our best.</p>
<p>Saturday 9.  Yesterday the Frenchmen on the Farm killed a big pig, to give the Bearers some pork; but when our cook inspected it, he discovered it to be an old sow about 90 years of age; &amp; too tough to chew; so Pork was off.  Johnnie Moore went into Amiens &amp; purchased  a big supply of good things.  The Banquet was gorgeous &amp; our Concert was thoroughly enjoyed by the Bearers.</p>
<p>Easter Sunday   8/4/17. Lovely day. After Dinner Dodson &amp; I went into   Baupaume.  We got a lift in a motor Lorry. It was most interesting the whole way out. Fritz left hundreds of tons of Barbed wire behind &amp; a huge stack of coal. On the roadside we saw a whole train, about 20 or 30 trucks, which our guns had blown off the Line. We also counted 7 tanks which Fritz had "knocked out". The country is just like a Honeycomb, shell holes joining up to one another. We saw MacCallum in Bapaume. He is acting as detail to the 31st Batt. I asked one of the traffic police where the Town Hall was. He looked a bit surprised &amp; pointing to a vacant piece of ground said "That's where it  was." The Huns certainly made a Job of blowing it up.</p>
