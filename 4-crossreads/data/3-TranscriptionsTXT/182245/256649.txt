 1917 MAY 
 14 MONDAY 
 Raining lightly most of the day. 
 took horses to the dip between 
 Steenwerck &amp; Bailleul in 
 morning. I saw young [Seray?] 
 Kinross there &amp; he is in good 
 form. Got word we were leaving 
 the waggon lines for open 
 lines in the morning &amp; got 
 everything ready to get away 
 early in morning.
