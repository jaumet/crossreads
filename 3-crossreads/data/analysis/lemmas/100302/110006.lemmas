 Erquinghem 3/6/16 Up at 6 am and had earli parad for the men avail . After breakfast they went over to L?Estrade for a gas demonstr . I rode over on a bicycl with Curnow . In a small trench gas was liber and the men walk through it . The smoke was yellowish in colour . Approach without the helmet the smell strike one as that of sulphur . Cartridg and other metal expos to the gas becam corrod and all round the crop are bleach a yellow colour . Lachrymatori gas was then liber and the spicer goggl tri and noth at all was notic except a pleasant sweet smell like tin fruit . Walk through without goggl and the eye were too blind and sting to see . A demonstr of a smoke cloud follow the bomb burst vigor and a dens wall of smoke come forward on the breez and obliter everyth in front of it . Return home for lunch cloth stink of the gas . The inter relat of tast with the sens of smell was curious exemplifi today . Pass through the tear gas it sweet smell immedi made me think of tin pear and the men come out remark " Pineappl " or "B----- sweet stuff" , evid receiv the same impress . After lunch cycl with Major Matthew down to Rue Marl to attend a lectur on " Aeroplan and their cooper with Infantri " by a Major of the Royal Fli Corp . Gener Legg and the C.O 's and Senior Officer of all the reserv Division unit were present . The lectur was pure a fli man and was nervous . After a rather technic lectur in rambl fashion Colonel ( " Gunner " ) Lloyd got up and in a speech said "our friend is evid more at home in the air than on a lectur platform" . Which tactless remark was enough to flatten the poor chap . Return via the Rue de Biez which is a splendid smooth road but the rough cobbleston jolt one up intens . Persist furphi that the Brigad is go back to Boulogn as a labor brigad for ship unload and cargo shift . Volunt call for a trench raid and myself , Bazeley , Mackay volunt but I was told I was not to lead it . Noth further has been said about the other . Cherri are ripen on the tree .
