<p>Comforts Fund looked after us well with parcels &amp; we had Pictures &amp; Concerts during the evenings. On Easter Monday we were removed from Quarantine. All hands were up at daybreak getting everything ready to go home. The Ferry came about 9 AM. On boarding all hands were issued with masks &amp; they took pains to tell us that they were to be worn on the face &amp; not in the pocket. To the accompaniment to Cock a doodle dos we landed at Wooloomooloo &amp; met our relatives &amp; Friends. It was the day we had been looking forward</p>
