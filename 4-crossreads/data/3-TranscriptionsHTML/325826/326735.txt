<p>P.S.  Oh Father I tried my hand at printing photos, for the first time on Saturday morning &amp; was doing them stylishly in salt solution first to give that blue tone &amp; then directly I put them in the hypo they all went crackly &amp; spoiled &amp; they would have been such good prints- too.  I was using glossy seltona paper &amp; Wal said it was because I had used the solutions just after mixing &amp; they were different temperatures.  I was going to send you twelve too, doing things on a decent scale to start with don't you know!<br/>Again love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSO.</p>
