<p>[Shorthand transcribed as follows]<br/>I sent a French post card to my dear wife today showing a photo of a typical French soldier.  I said I was sending some more souvenirs which I have made out of the driving bands of German shells.  [indecipherable]. [End of shorthand]<br/>Monday September 24, 1917. (1148.)</p>
<p>A fine day.</p>
<p>We were issued with tobacco &amp; cigarettes this morning. Our iron rations, Bully beef, &amp; a tin of tea &amp; sugar was issued to every man of the Transport section this morning to replace the supply that was called in a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I again paraded sick this morning &amp; was given treatment &amp; no duties.</p>
<p>I received a letter from my brother Willie today, describing briefly his trip to Ireland. He had 8 days leave and had a good look around Dublin, Belfast and other Northern towns, and visited a lot of our relations there.</p>
<p>I sent a packet of souvenirs to my wife this evening in a registered parcel. It cost 1 franc 3d for registration. The packet contained two souvenirs, serviette rings made from the driving bands of 5.9 German shells, &amp; one ring made out of the stay wires of an enemy aeroplane.</p>
<p>Lieut McNicol lent me a book to night, a guide to Paris. He has been there lately.</p>

<p>A beautiful morning.</p>
