so we will now work systematically not anyhow like it has been
Received our first instalment of dry socks this morning from now on while the Batt. is in the firing line every man is to have a clean dry pair of socks issued to him each day, at the same time 1 pair will be collected from him each morning we are supposed to have 1 dry pair on 1 pair in our pack another pair getting washed dryed, this will enable us to always have dry socks, we also have an issue of whale oil the feet are supposed to be smeared over with this for it prevents frost bite to a large extent anything that will do that is well worth using.
