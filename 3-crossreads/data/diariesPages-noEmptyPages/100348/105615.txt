13/9/16.
We were releived last night and came right back via the railway train to Halifax Camp. Did not get up till 11 o'clock. Then I went for a stroll this evening and had a good time in a neighbouring village; there were some jolly girls there. As usual a big mail was waiting for me.

Went looking for a fatigue job yesterday spent the day looking for it. Found it just when it was time to knock off. Marched to the 1st Divisional Baths and had a splendid Bath and a fumigation received a change of underclothes, after wearing the same shirt for 6 weeks. Was innoculated against some disease or other. I have all ready been dosed against every one I can think of. I drew a pass and went to Popperinghe.
