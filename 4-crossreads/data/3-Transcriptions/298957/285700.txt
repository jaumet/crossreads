<p>We leave tonight. Emergency rations issued &ndash; Bully Beef &amp; biscuits for 24 hours. These are not to be touched until we are authorised to do so. Aeroplane dropped a bomb near our Mess Hut, by accident. It was one of our own machines because I saw it land in the camp. Marched down to the railway station at Moascar and boarded open trucks at 9.30 pm. Left for Alexandria at 11.30 pm. It was a very cold and rough ride but I managed to get a little sleep. 41 men per truck meant overcrowding.</p>
