<p>have no cases to load up. Cavalry have moved up, some Indian medical services being attached to deal with their own men. Weather bitterly cold, more rain in evidence. The hopovers we have been concerned in have yielded 9000 prisoners, &amp; 50,000 huns, are calculated to have been put out of action, also commanding positions on ridges have been gained, a very successful effort.</p>
<p>Thursday night 11th Oct  Another hopover going on, this one the French also taking part in but the weather is awful, cold, wind, &amp; rain. Had a quiet night only one train being loaded our complement being 40 stretchers only. It looks as if further movement on our front will be checked as at the best of times round Ypres is very marshy.</p>
<p>Friday night 12th Oct  A very busy night as we loaded up three trains. We appear to have had another hop-over</p>
