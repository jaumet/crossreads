<p>16 June 1915<br/>Wednesday 44 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Another heavy bombardment to wake us at dawn &amp; they kept us on the move to some time, shell after shell came down the valley &amp; got one of our sniper pals in the thigh.  After lunch Hal &amp; I went to pay a visit to a friend of his on Steels Post &amp; there I met Pere &amp; Eric both are well &amp; in good spirits, they are now in a machine gun section &amp; have been doing some rare shooting at time, while we were up there the Turks opened with their arty again &amp; it didn't take us long to get out of it, when we go down to our quarters we were informed that Bill Steele &amp; [indecipherable] had stopped a few about them, then next shell Metcalfe stopped the case with his leg it made an awful mess of it tearing the flesh away &amp; leaving the bone bare to some length I saw all of them fixed up &amp; then got back to tea.  Made application again today for commission at home &amp; hope its ok this time met Fatty [indecipherable] down at the beach he is with the 4th arty reinforcements.  Stopped one myself in the knee.  Alright.</p>

<p>More arty at break of day its getting quite the order now for a salvo of shell to awaken us during the night the enemy erected many "gabions" &amp; these had to be destroyed by arty today [indecipherable] Sykes baty was employed &amp; in 24 rds he did the job but it drew a heavy fire in return from their guns.  A Turkish patrol surprised one of our m guns &amp; shot the gunner the remainder inskied leaving the wounded man to tend the gun this he did &amp; accounted for all the visitors I might say that they came from NZ.  Went for a swim today &amp; after that on a hunting tour I got 6 today and 6 yesterday, am not feeling a scrap lonely of a night now  All lines patrolled this morning &amp; are now in first class condition, all going along satisfactorily at last, changed time to full Navy today &amp; coded in [indecipherable] just the same..Mail expected tomorrow, Rations cut down by half no transport.  No word of our wounded.</p>
