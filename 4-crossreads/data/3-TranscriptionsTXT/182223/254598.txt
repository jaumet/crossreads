 Transcriber&rsquo;s note:&nbsp; Honorary Lieutenant Colonel John Brady Nash VD (Volunteer Decoration) (1857-1925), a parliamentarian and surgeon from Sydney, NSW, joined the Army on 19 October 1914 aged 57, and embarked from Sydney, NSW, on HMAT A55 Kyarra on 28 November 1914 with the 2nd Australian General Hospital. He left Egypt to return to Australia on the Themistocles in early December 1915, escorting invalided soldiers. 
 Mentioned frequently in the diary are his four daughters: Agnes (Sister Mary Hyacinth, a Dominican nun), Caroline, Josephine, and Kathleen, often referring to them as &quot;The Girls&quot; or&nbsp;using his pet names for them (Mollie, Carrie, Joseph or Joe, and Kitty). Colonel Nash&#39;s letters to his daughters while he was on overseas service&nbsp;are also in the State Library manuscript collection, and often expand on diary entries. 
 Also mentioned from time to time&nbsp;is&nbsp;Colonel Nash&rsquo;s orderly or batman&nbsp;Private Edward George Jerrom, sometimes written Jerom or Jerome (No 778), a Parliament House Messenger in Sydney, NSW, who enlisted on 22 October 1914 aged 41 and embarked from Sydney on 28 November 1914 on HMAT A55 Kyarra with the 2nd Australian General Hospital. He returned to Australia with Colonel Nash on the Themistocles escorting invalid soldiers and later served in France with the 1st Field Ambulance. He&nbsp;returned to Australia in September 1917.]
