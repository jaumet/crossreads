 My dear Rene I expect you will be quite interested to have a line from poor stressed Egypt, after all it's a life of great interest in shape of experiences tho far from being all pleasant ones.  We are in good swing now &amp; I am liking my billet very much.  One does not get much sympathy form the O.C. as he is not interested but he lets one have ones own way.  You will have heard of the cataclysm at No. 1, R. Smith &amp; C. Barret stripped of all their glory in one act, the former recalled, the latter now simply "oculist" in No. 1.  Col. Newmarch in charge at No. 1 and the fold were contented there.  Of course there has been great talk but R. Smith will slide out of it all gracefully enough I expect.  Met Mrs. Fletcher for just a moment in street.  She seemed busy &amp; happy.  A great many men have gone across &ndash; the story goes they wired for all available men.  Maxwell wired to know if they wanted untrained ones, the reply came back, Yes if  that  they are Australians or N.Zealanders. And I am left lamenting in this far land so send a line to Yours affect. Agnes Bennett Love (special variety) to the Major!
