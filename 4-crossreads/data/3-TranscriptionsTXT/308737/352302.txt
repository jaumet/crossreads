 Darling Mum &amp; Kids I wrote you all a letter each about a week ago, &amp; through circumstances of various sorts have still got them here. So I'm sending them with this one. They are in official green envelopes &amp; might not arrive with this one. I got Nance's letter the other day dated 9/7/15 &amp; ought to get another soon as there is a big mail for us today or tomorrow sometime. Nance says she's glad I've kept out of it so long! Well we've been in it almost from the "jump-off" I'm certainly very lucky so far &amp; am still hale &amp; hearty. 
 I'm so glad that Claude is getting a commission or likely to. It makes a lot of difference &ndash; take my word. 
 It must have been a job, Mum
