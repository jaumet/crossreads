<p>would not stand to "attention", <u>the whole time</u>, even if all the Military Medical Staff in the Army was in the Ward, so all the Australians joined in the laugh too.</p>
<p>The next morning the Sister was horrified to see both these "Aussies" walk out of the marquee at one end, while the Doctor entered at the other, the Doctor looked surprised but seeing a glorious smile lighting up the faces of all the Australians lying in the beds, he philosophically accepted the situation without comment. Strolling back again when the Doctor was just about finishing the two men were naturally able to give a plausible excuse &amp; had their wounds attented to.</p>
<p>After the same thing occurred the very next morning, the Doctor had the good sense to allow <u>all</u> the men to sit down after the salute had been given, from that time afterwards.</p>
<p>The following morning the two "Aussies" did not appear, to <u>have</u> to leave in a hurry &amp; calmly enjoyed reclining "at ease". The "Tommies" were overjoyed &amp; admiringly told the two Australians that they would not have dared to do what they had done, ever if they had been paid a "fiver".</p>
<p>Although the Sister was a splendid woman &amp; a kind &amp; gentle nurse she always seemed to look upon those two, if not "bad Australians" as not quite so good as the "bed" "Cases" with whom she appeared delighted.</p>
<p>The shattering of one of the "Red tape" orders, even if absurd &amp; even inhumanly unnecessary, was to her, an awful offense, so inbred discipline, seems to be, in all "Tommies" whether sisters or soldiers,</p>
<p>After the Salute has been given all Australian Doctors &amp; Sisters will immediately give, Sit down boys! or if they are reading or playing, Carry on! boys! which is only common sense, &amp; what should really obtain in a ward with wounded men.</p>
