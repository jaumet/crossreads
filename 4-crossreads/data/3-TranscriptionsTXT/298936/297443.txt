 October 1915 
 Thursday 14 
 Wood fatigue in camp [indecipherable] away ill. 
 Received letter &amp; birthday card from Rita letter from Woodlawn. 
 Hear we are going to England &ndash; just the usual rumour I suspect. 
 Wrote long letter to Rita. 
 Feel in very good health. 
 Had a good look around trenches yesterday &amp; saw Gun ridge which they say would finish the business if taken.  Seems an improbable task. 
 The line at Popes Hill on left is very near the Narrows &amp; surely we cannot keep getting across in time.
