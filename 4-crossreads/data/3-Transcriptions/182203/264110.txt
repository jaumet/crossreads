<p>together (British &amp; Australians) in a very comfy mess-room warmed by a lovely heater. Quite a treat after the way we have lived the last 6 weeks.<br/>We expect one of our Senior Sisters any time now &amp; then she will take charge. We really are 3rd A.C.C. Station, next to the 29th &ndash; but address letters to the top address. Goodness knows when we shall get our Xmas mail, but still it is worth the change to wait longer.<br/>I got a nice letter from Armie Thomas to-day &amp; they are very lucky in money matters but I glad I'm a healthy woman, though blessed with very few of this world's riches.<br/>Dont write to Jackson. I've not heard a word &amp; cannot find out anything. His great pal wrote me the other day from London, asking if I had heard anything of him because he also had not received any letters nor could find out any news of him.</p>
