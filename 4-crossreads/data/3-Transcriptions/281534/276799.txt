<p>18/1/19 Waterloo<br/>mound of Waterloo. We drove up to the foot of the mound which is rather disfigured by some restaurants and cyclorama built up against it. Passed the French monument &ndash; an eagle at bay dying but still striking. The fields here are gently undulating and would conceal many troops in their folds. Drove now to Charleroi &ndash; black busy and full of mines and factories. Now to BdeH.Q. (1.30) and lunched. Reached Gourdinne at 2.30 in plenty of rain and settled down to any amount of paper warfare and got rid of some postcards and other stuff from Brussels. Our officer's mess is shrinking in size daily and tonight was a very small family. Drank cognac &amp; talked before bed with Meurice &amp; Marcelle.</p>
