<p>39<br/>17/8/16<br/>Last night we had a poultry supper it was first Class. One of our motor drivers ran over them yesterday afternoon &amp; our cook turned them out in great style.</p>
<p>18/8/16.<br/>Left Senlis this morning about 8-30 am for Canaples, our old haunt. We cycled all the way, called at Rubempre &amp; had a couple of hours at our late billet there. Jeanne seemed very pleased to see us.</p>
<p>The wagon caught us up there &amp; we had dinner &amp; then pushed on for this place &amp; arrived safely after experiencing my first puncture caused by a nail out of a Tommies boot.</p>
<p>We are not in the mairie this time but not far away from it.</p>
