  returned to me directly I discovered my mistake. I left that hole hurriedly, and kept looking back thinking the wretched thing was following me.  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; When we had completed our last trip with material, we would call in at the Y.M.C.A. dug-out at Brigade Headquarters, and have some cocoa.
