<p>July 16, 17<br/>268.<br/>Written for and posted &ndash; Siegfried Sassoon's "Counter Attack", Theodore Maynard's ""Folly" &amp; J.B. Yeats' "Essay:  Irish &amp;amp Amer [American]", to T.B.C.</p>
<p>July 17<br/>269.<br/>Another sunburning day.  At 5 away towards Hondeghem and there with the S.A.s till 9, swimming in their pool, there all the others while yarning to one of them, a splendidly built lad golden brown in the sun, with eyes the colour of copper sulphate, and a face burned and finely freckled.  Met again those we were with in the earlier evening of June 28 &ndash; the dark Dutchman of the S.A.s &ndash; he of the slow lazy smile.</p>
<p>Rain again &ndash; at 10 p.m.  All day long at slow intervals, the booming of the heavies:  long distance guns on to the Boche's dumps about the Lep Valley?</p>
<p>Today two Frenchmen cycle 40 miles to the Estaminet here, to tell their people of the Boche attacking in Flanders on the 18th.</p>
<p>No Mail!!!</p>
<p>July 17, 18<br/>Letters to Billy and Mother posted, and today to Aunt Louie the second series of "The Elizabethean Playhouse".</p>

<p>270.<br/>"One who died"<br/>Eight days suns and rains &amp; troubled nights,<br/>And now the grasses slow<br/>About your body grow,<br/>Quietly she dreams, remembering your smile,<br/>And you lie dead the while.<br/>To "Aussy".</p>
<p>July 18<br/>271.<br/>A sky of green hazing to blue:  above Cassel one long thin cloud line of deep full blue:  the trees of the camp's field still and of silent loveliness.  An hour ago in the pool, and the water still warm from the day's sun.</p>
<p>Midday brought a wire from the Aisne-Marne front of French successes against the Boche's attack in force, and tonight another of further advances &ndash; 4000 prisoners and the Boche artillery retiring.</p>
<p>Today the guns quiet, the guns firing of yesterday all harassing.  No mail.</p>
