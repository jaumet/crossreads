<p>recently we received a Mail in which a photo of a tractor engine was shown. Underneath were written the fabulous words "A tank without its arm<u>our</u>."</p>
<p>It gives us an idea as to how near the firing line these idiots or camera fiends usually get.</p>
<p>Also photos are shown of HANZACS in all the glory of steel helmets and sheep skins sitting and standing about front line trenches utterly regardless of Fritz's  sharp shooters</p>
<p>Oh we are brave fellows but god help the photographer if we could only get hold of him sometimes.<br/>The people are not aware</p>
