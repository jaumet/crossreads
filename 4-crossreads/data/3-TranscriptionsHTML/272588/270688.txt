<p>Tuesday 9 April<br/>Wet to-day.  This afternoon to Bertangles, north of Amiens about nine kilometres.<br/>We are camped under canvas on a decent hill overlooking the biggest airdrome I have yet seen.  Heavy bombardment on the front from early morning &amp; is going now &amp; extended back as far as west of Amiens.</p>
<p>Wednesday 10 April<br/>Ye Gods, Fritz has attacked in the north about Fleurbaix, etc. &amp; captured Saily [Sailly] sur la Lys, Laventie &amp; Estaires.  The bombardment, very heavy continued until early this morning on this front &amp; was very intense. Wet off &amp; on to-day &amp; a walk to Villers Bocace. Fritz is marvellous!!!  The above is so far only a rumour confirmed by Corps H.Q., &amp; I cannot say on what front he has attacked. Our camp here is very decent, but there is no water. Whilst we were in bed to-night we were warned with tragic suddenness to be ready to move in the morning to entrain for the north.</p>
