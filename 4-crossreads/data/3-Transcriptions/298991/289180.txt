<p>Friday June 15th<br/>I am in the "Soft" squad here, we knock off work half an hour before the "hard" lot, both in the morning &amp; afternoon. We get very decent food now, They shifted us to another cook house &amp; the O.C. personally inspected the food we were getting, therefore the above result. Paid this morning 30/-, being about 3/- overpaid. The weather is getting very warm now, I have discarded all my winter clothing.</p>
<p>Saturday June 16th<br/>We haven't done much drill today, Went to an asphysciating gas parade, we were to go through the gas, but owing to so many, &amp; us being the last, we hadn't time. Met Jack West accidently in the canteen. Talking over old times etc.</p>
<p>Sunday June 17th<br/>Went on church parade, all the protestants went to the church of England. Very quiet in camp. There was no reveille this morning, so we had a good sleep in.</p>
<p>Monday June 18th<br/>Raining nearly all day. Fell in 8 am &amp; after a lot of unnecessary bothering about, we marched to Parkhouse Camp, a distance of about 5 miles. Things haven't altered much since I was here last year, most of the old staff is still here. Put in No 6 hut. There are a lot of fellows here who haven't  seen field service yet, They seem anxious to get over to France, &amp; get as many tips as they can. Raining to heavy to drill this evening. Had our records taken also particulars of previous service.</p>
