28.3.16Tues 28thThis morning went to Major Smith to see if I could get the 6 new Sigs off patrols, guards, & piquets, but with no success, so I rang up Sgt Nielson & complained that the men were getting too much work to do; Murray decided to drop out of the Sigs & Ford has taken his place & has done a little of it before;
Last night one of the lads killed a snake about 18 inches long this is the second during the last week as one dropped out of Ibbots blankets a few nights ago when he was making his bed down;Sgt Todhunter & Cpl Bigg returned from hospital today;  I have handed the class on New Sigs over to Les & am putting in the whole time brushing Reid up for the School;
