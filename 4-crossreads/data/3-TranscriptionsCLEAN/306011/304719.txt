  
 morning for Folkstone - came to Boulogne & was back to Wimereux again about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. "When shall I see the old Country again?" 
 Wed 24th Jan (11.30 am) 
 To-day & yesterday have been the coldest days I think I have ever experienced. Both days  nights bitterly cold with the water freezing into ice everywhere. Where is our sunny New South Wales! Our tent hospital is being converted into a hutted one & shacks are being going up rapidly. Have transferred my sleeping quarters from bell tent to a hut. 
 Am now on different work. On returning from leave was to have taken over a portion of the Hospital wards as Section Wardmaster but have gone into the Quartermaster's stores instead and am now in charge of the Steward's store. I only took over yesterday and it will be some days to pick up the work, which consists of the supervising of the issue of all rations etc. to patients & personnel. Have applied for a transfer to 1st Field Ambulance, which is at present somewhere down on the Somme.
