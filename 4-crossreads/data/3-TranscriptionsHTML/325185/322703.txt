<p>trenches yet but are not too far from the firing line. We can hear the guns very plainly  The thing that struck us more, the farmers are still on their farms &amp; working away as though there wasent any war on. One could hardly credit it unless you see it. There was some more excitement away in the centre of France than there is here practically in the firing line. We are living in what is known as billets. That is anyone that has a barn or stable well so many soldiers are told off to sleep there Well father this is hardly worth sending but I will find out later what we are allow to write shall do better then dont want to have the letter burnt have to close   Hoping all are well am O.K myself &amp; feel fit for what ever there is ahead. Will write the Miss Smiths later. Love to all<br/>Your sincere son<br/>Clyde</p>
