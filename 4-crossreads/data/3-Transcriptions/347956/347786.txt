<p>us down below to save getting wet  I could hardly realize this <strike>this</strike> morning when I woke &amp; found we were still on the briny.  I had been dreaming all night that I was home &amp; had been telling some experiences.  the only thing I could not remember was how I got home &amp;  was wondering if I had deserted, or was the war finished; I can imagine "Jim" cantering down to "Tysons" this morning &amp; wondering how "Roger" is doing.  I think I must have a touch of the "blues" this morning;  Idleboy is doing as well as he was on land &amp; has a coat like silk.  he was lucky to miss all the discases &amp; I believe he would enjoy a gallop &amp; I know I would;  I exercise him for an hour or two every morning</p>
