13-1-17killed is estimated at about 300. The camels & waggons we had out were not sufficient to bring in the stores & equipment captured & they had to go ut again the next day (10th); the 8th Regt were left out on the night of the 9th to protect the A.M.C. men working on the wounded, a Squadron of the 8th were attacked by Cavalry & Camelry at 10 oclock next morning, the attack was repulsed & 14 prisoners taken. Today 16 Turks marching under a white flag came in & were brought in by our patrol; they say they came from Gaza (60 miles) & have had enough fighting. The German Brigadier captured at Rafa said he knew they could beat off 2 Divisions & thought 3 could not shift them & they came to the conclusion that 5 or 6 Divisions were attacking. They were rather surprised to find one Mtd. Division
