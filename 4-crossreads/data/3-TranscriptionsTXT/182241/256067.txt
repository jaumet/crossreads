Jan 6th 1918The rain which has been theatening much of late came down in heavey downpour during the night & has continued without cessation all day. Heavy winds also accompany it so we just had to stay in our bivouac & tell yarns the yarns by the way were mostly told by Capt Hurley conserning his trip to the South P. & it was very interesting to listen to him. The big flat where we had the unpleasant experience of being washed flooded out on Xmas day is again awash & the roads impassable. The wadies have been running bankers & Tport is more or less disorganised, Thank heaven it is dry in our tent for I look across a dismal expance of mud where the Horse Tport & Camels are having a miserable time
