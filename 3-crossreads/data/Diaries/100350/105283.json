There are many Warships &amp; Troopships anchored off here. The Battleship Majestic was sunk off here her keel can be seen above water. The entrance to the Dardanelles from \"Seddul-Bahr\" to Fort Kum-Kale is about 3 miles &amp; the depth about 50 fathoms, the highest point is \"Tree Peak Hill\" 730 feet above sea level.
