  
 Boot and saddle at 7-30 p.m.  Move off at 8-30 p.m.  Raining in torrents.  A bit of an argument with the relieving Brigade.  L Bty. is now in possession.  Our guns all in wagon line.  I believe we go 16 Kilometres tonight. 
 3-8-1918, Point Asquin Rained in torrents just before leaving last wagon line.  Landed here 3-30 a.m.  Had a bad treck during the night.  The night was as black as ink.  A man riding a grey horse in front of me, and I could not see it.  We simply allowed our horses to have their heads, and pick their own road.  During the last couple of Kilometres, several wagons fell into the ditches alongside of the roads.  They were left there, and rescued at daylight.  When seen in daylight I wondered how we ever got through, only inches to spare in some places.  Everything is in order again.  Breakfast at 11-30 a.m.  Dinner at 4 p.m.  No shoes off only one sprung.  We are here for a couple of days only and then entrain.  Destination unknown.  We are near Wardecques.
