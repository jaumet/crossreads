<p>Wednesday.  Nearly 20 bands were in attendance and were divided into 4 groups to play for the march past.  One band to relieve the other in succession, marches to be separated by six beats of the drum at the intervention of each new band. Our march is "The last Stand".  The others strange to say are playing German marches "My Regiment" and "Tiekes Old Comrades".</p>
