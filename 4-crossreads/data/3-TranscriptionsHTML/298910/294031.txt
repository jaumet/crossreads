<p>fellow. I went to Confession as opportunity offered.</p>
<p>16/7/16  Sunday<br/>Went to Mass at 6 am at the Church opposite our Dressing Station &ndash; Our Interpreter said Mass. No sleep last night, going as hard as we could, with 2 Doctors &ndash; Before going to Mass we had a lull &amp; then started afresh, by 9 am we had handled some 150 Patients, some awful cases, men not recognizable, several cases of noses blown right off, to say nothing of fractures &ndash; shock etc. Had two cases of shock in particular who were painful to watch, just a bundle of nerves &amp; ready to cow at the slightest noise.</p>
<p>57th &amp; 58th must have lost heavily last night. The Germans blew our very poor parapets down in several places &amp; treated them to Gas, Aerial Torpedoes &ndash; Plum Puddings &ndash; Mortars &ndash; Shrapnel &amp; the full variety of their stock. Unfortunately the only backing they had was the 15th Artillery with 18 ponders &amp; they took hardly any effect, in fact</p>
