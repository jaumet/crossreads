<p>My last day in the desert.</p>
<p>Monday 18th Jan.<br/>I rode over to regt. and nothing in orderly room about me so played in a cricket team, H.Qrs. Sgts. agst. C Squad Sgts., and just as I was fielding a wire was brought to me telling that I had to report at Suez that night, it was all bustle then chaps running at me with letters and parcels to take home.  Shook hands with Col. &amp; Doc., both thanked me for what I had done then mounted on   <strike>old</strike> Zigi I galloped for Ferdan the cricketers knocked off to cheer me.  Accompanied by Doc's groom who will take Zigi back.  Arrived Ferdan, told the good news, handed mare &amp; equip. in, packed my bag then the Sgts. made me a presentation and speech and called for cheers, while they were singing A.L. Syme the Major came down &amp; presented me with a written letter of thanks, my mate &amp; others rode to the canal where I left the desert at last and caught the 8 train to Suez after a tedious slow journey arrived at Port Tewfik at 1-30 in the morning, found an hotel (Savoy) and tired as I was I could not sleep, for excitement so ended my last day of 30 months of the desert</p>
