<p>[This is  a newspaper cutting of a photo of a band marching and playing through the battle ravaged streets of Bapaume. There is a  handwritten notation in the left hand corner [SMH?] 16-6-17]<br/>A PICTURE THAT WILL LIVE FOREVER IN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY</p>
<p>ANZAC BAND PLAYS THE AUSTRALIANS INTO BAPAUME UNDER GERMAN FIRE</p>
<p>This theme will some day provide a great battle-picture for an Australian artist. The army entered Bapaume, headed by a band, between burning buildings. The picture, said the "Daily Mail," recalls the grandiose battle pictures visible in the public galleries. The Australian bandsmen, playing triumphal airs, marched through the blazing streets and burning ruins indifferent to the perils of fire, shell, and falling buildings, cheerily confident in the sense of victory.</p>
