Five other guns passed over, together with their attendant motor lorries and travelling workshop but they didn't cause half the thrill in going over, as the first gun did. One of the traction engines caught an iron support and threw the driver with great force on to his boiler. He is in hospital suffering from a badly burnt face. Bread is very scarce lately, owing to our rations being reduced.

The stokers ran out of coal last night and there was no hot water for the women to wash with so they had to return home. Last night Jack Fallon and I went to the Butchers and fixed up his finger which he had cut, badly. He thought it was wonderful (our doctoring) and insisted on our assistance to get outside two jugs of beer. Pay day drew 20f
A party of C. Section bearers went out to the trenches this morning. It is jolly cold,, and seems as though winter is coming on rapidly. Several loads of coal arrived this morning, so the wheels are going round again, and the Madames can carry on with their washing.

Big crowd came in for a Bath today again and made things lively ? a couple of Engineers have built us a mess room and we are feeling a bit more civilized, although it is very draughty. Was just returning to our billet, after a stroll round the town, when we caught sight of an unusual glare in the sky. We made our way in its direction and found a building blazing away quite merrily. The fire Brigade was on the scene and did good work, considering that it consisted only of an old fashioned pump, mounted on a handcart and about 20 yds of 1 inch Hose pipe. A party of Tommies were formed in line down to the canal and passed a bucket along. The bucket leaked badly and by the time it reached the end nearest the fix it was almost empty. A poor old horse was tied up in the Building and was so badly burnt that it had to be destroyed. The building was absolutely gutted. No wonder.
