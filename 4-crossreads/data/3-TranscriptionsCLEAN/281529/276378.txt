  
 Tried a couple of cases at Orderly Room and awarded punishments.   For the men tonight we tried to put on a few extras at dinner and got the cooks working a little overtime.   Unfortunately we had difficulty in getting enough liquid refreshments and a motor lorry will probably arrive about an hour late.   However always better late than never.   Our printing press struck off Menus for the officers'dinner and a concert programme.   The men's dinner tonight was a success and they all speak of being very well pleased with their turnout.   The officers mess put on a good dinner.   There were very few visitors and we had a few toasts only.  "The Day we Celebrate" was proposed by myself supported by Dooley & Kennedy and Gorman made a rousing speech on "Our Native Land".   The Band played during mess.   We then adjourned to a barn where L/Cpl Herz had a concert rigged up.  There was a crowd of all nations here and we had a regular good rough up "Digger's" concert.  A U.S. Army chap gave a couple of songs.   Wiseman once with J.C. Williamson was a good help and a chap of the 21st came forward and offered his services.  He had a fine voice and a good command of all the latest topical sounds.   A balmy, dark night full of gun flashes & rumble of guns
