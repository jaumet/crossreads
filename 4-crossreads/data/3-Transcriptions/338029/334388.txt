<p>Monday 30th Oct.<br/>Been scrapping on Western Front with Senussi, we may find ourselves down there yet went down by train to the Canal for a swim, enjoyed it, spent evening at R.W.F. mess.</p>
<p>Teusday 31st Oct.<br/>Spent day writing letters, etc.  we are finding patrols now.  A lot of double squadron Sgts. came over to tea and we spent a pleasant bridge evening.</p>
<p>Wednesday 1st November<br/>Double Squadron gone Abbassia for camels, had our boxing tournament with 7th Welsh in p.m., good sport, we only had one man beaten in the p.m. and that was very close,  I see by the paper that the old Hosp. ship Galeka blew up in the English Channel, poor old Galeka, what memories it brings to mind, my three trips on her, twice with wounded and once myself a patient.  All day I have had a raging fever on me, but can keep it down, I am subject to attacks of Dengue, but they only last a couple of days, if I lie up I am settled, I must keep moving to ward it off, any excitement keeps me from giving in to it, and I suffer and no one knows any thing about it.</p>
