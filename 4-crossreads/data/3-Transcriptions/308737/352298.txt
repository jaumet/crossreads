<p>22 July 1915</p>
<p>Darling Mum Nance &amp; Joan<br/>At last I'm writing you a short note from the firing line, or at least I'm now seated in my dug-out, &amp; just had tea. So far I hav'nt been roughly handled by our esteemed foe, except for a [indecipherable] spent bullet which smacked me on the hip, weeks ago &amp; hardly left a bruise. I often see Charlie Bean &amp; have a chat &amp; afternoon tea with him. He is awfully good to me &amp; never lets me go without anything. I never go down to see him without coming away with tin-milk, cigarettes, socks or something. I have not seen Jack yet although he is back again in the firing line. I saw Keith Eltham a few weeks ago he is in good nick. He's in the artillery.</p>
