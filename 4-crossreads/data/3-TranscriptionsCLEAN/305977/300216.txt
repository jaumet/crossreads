  
 trying to frighten us.  But the Austlans are a tough lot.  They have taken to this game as though they were born to it.  I don't think they like living in trenches.  They are always growling, but they are there when there is anything doing. 
 Saturday 22nd It rained the best part of the morning.  It wasn't too comfortable especially as we had to cook our own tucker.  We get a good issue of rations, including biscuits, bacon, tea & sugar, beef, cheese & jam, cigarettes, tobacco & matches.  After dinner we marched out.  By good luck our Squadron was attached to the Battalion Alf Outridge is in & we were in the trenches with them at 6 oclock.  The Turks started their usual burst of firing, but made no attack.  They fire to keep us from attacking.  We came out again at 6 oclock into the rest trenches.
