<p>GERMAN INTERNEES &ndash; QUESTION OF RELEASE<br/>COMMITTEE TO DEAL WITH APPLICATIONS</p>
<p>Melbourne, Tuesday &ndash; There will be no further release of internees until the Commonwealth Government is assured of the wisdom of such action.</p>
<p>The Cabinet to-day approved of the appointment of a committee, which will probably consist of a representative of the Defence Department, a business man, and a judicial or legal representative, which will deal with all applications for release from internment.  Hitherto this matter has been dealt with by the Government on the recommendation of the Defence and other departmental authorities.</p>
<p>"We are going to make sure in future," said Mr. Watt to-night, "that a very careful examination of all such applications is made before recommendations are dealt with."</p>
