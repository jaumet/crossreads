  
 attacked on three sides of us in large numbers. When things were looking as though the Huns were getting the upperhand, the attack from our left suddenly eased, which we afterwards learned was due to the fact of the company commander attacking the Huns overland through the crops unbeknowing to the troops who were occupying the captured trench. This action of our Captain put us in a winning position for the attack was soon taken in hand with the result that the Hun were again driven off this time with a number of casualties. Our Captain also paid dearly for this counter move of his for he was fatally wounded by a machine gun during the move & he died some hours later while at a dressing station back behind the lines. During his command of our (A) Company which had lasted some months he had proved himself a thorough, Soldier & a Gentleman, being well liked by every man who came in contact with him. The men, that the captain had taken with him also suffered very heavily in casualties, there being several killed & many wounded, but still the action succeed in its motives enabling the Company to hold the captured trench. Throughout the latter part of the day our Field Artillery came to our assistance by keeping up a slow barrage of shrapnel about a hundred yards in front of our post, this assisting to inspire the troops with great confidence.
