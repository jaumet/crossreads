<p>3.  Kind &amp; good to me &amp; I'm not in a position at present to do anything to repay them.  Yet although I've not met very many I could meet Hundreds by just chumming up.  We can speak to any Girl &amp; get a civil answer.  They are not the sort to flounce the skirt &amp; turn their Head without giving a Hearing.<br/>Well, I have tried to let You see my ideas about English People &amp; about the men who are   <strike>giving</strike>   risking their lives (for 1/- a day as their own pay &amp; a few pence for the wife &amp; Kiddy).  A wife &amp; one Kiddy get about 20/- to Keep them.  A Mother is allowed 2/8 a week for the first child.  It costs 2/6 to have its shoes mended &amp; it is only 15 months old.  Just think of these things going on in England.  How many Australian wives would willingly consent to their Husbands enlistment under those conditions.  Nearly every woman whose Hubby is a Tommy only, has to put Her Kiddies in some person's charge &amp; go out to the washtub &amp; other jobs to make enough to Keep the Bailiff's out.  Well, Mum, I have no news except what I've written &amp; as it is nearly Tea-Time I will Knock off.  Ellis is lying down in Our Own Room.  Give Regards to all Enquiring Friends &amp; to the Cohens too.  Why the deuce don't one of them write.  Lots of Love to You All &amp; with Hopes that Your Health is good, &amp; that we'll not be very much longer away.  I will say Adieu<br/>Best Love from<br/>Harry</p>
