Had a letter from Mrs Cust in which she says she got a letter from you and was so pleased to get it.
Dear Mother
I was very pleased to receive three letters from home this morning two from Ida and one from you, dated Oct.9th.  I was so glad to know that everyone was well at home and that all else was in good condition. I had a note from Percy about a week ago and he mentioned that my note from "Hollyside," had reached him safely , but I have not heard from Clarry for a long time now. I was very sorry to hear that his little girl had passed away. I am glad that my large photo reached you all right. I thought you might like to have it and it will always be something to look back upon. Have you or Ida or any of the family any new photos if so I should very much like to have some, it is a jolly long
