Another chap was maimed in such a way that I cannot describe, through a kick from 'some brutal sentry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many cases where carelessness in the dressing of wounds had made the wound considerably worse  than it would have been with proper attention.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against some of these cases of carelessness I was told by an Englishman who had been in the same hospital, of a case where an Englishman was operated on to remove an abscess in the vicinity of his heart  the abscess was removed and the heart taken out and washed and then put back &mdash; the patient lived for twenty-four hours &laquo;had he lived longer the Doctor's name would have been made as the feat would have been unparrelled in medical science.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   After being a week in Aachen we were given a tram ride  -through the city to an outlying railway station where we entrained on a Red Cross train - leaving next morning for Rotterdam.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I certainly had the laugh on "Fritz" for I came out of his country as a stretcher case, and I was too comfortable under  the blankets to see what the Holland border looked like in the early hours of the dawn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at the first big town across the border a crowd of Dutch Red Cross Ladies and English Y.M.C.A.
