  
 Monday 4 November The funniest night for years.  Rumour hath it that a French town crier has said, officially, that an armistice has been signed with Germany. All the village, soldiers & civilians are rejoicing, but I think prematurely.  However, I have had a glass of wine with my Parisienne for the occasion. We move to-morrow. O Ye Gods!!!! if it is only true!!! 
 Tuesday 5 November Move cancelled & we move to-morrow, our final de-training station being Epehy, just west of le Catelet.  We entrain at Hangest. Absolutely nothing in yesterday's rumours which were getting a good hold in Pont Remy. Wet to-day.
