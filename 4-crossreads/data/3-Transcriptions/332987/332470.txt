<p>19-8-1918<br/>Weather dull and cloudy, indications of rain.  Working hard shoeing my horses, ready for the roads.  Some wear the shoes out in 3 weeks.</p>
<p>20-8-1918<br/>Move off at 6 a.m. cancelled, move now at 7-30 a.m.  Weather fine.  We are moving into action.  Arrived at wagon line 1 a.m., wagons were then ordered to gun position, returned to wagon line 6 a.m.</p>
<p>21-8-1918<br/>Where we are now is where the British were stuck up, could make no advance, and little wonder, considering the nature of the country.  Very rough, somewhere near Bray.  No village within miles of us.  Water for horses 2 miles away, river Somme.  Weather very hot, foggy in the morning.</p>
<p>22-8-1918<br/>Two men killed and one Officer (Capt. Laidley) wounded in 1st Bty.  5th Bty. shelled out of wagon line.  A big bombardment on this</p>
