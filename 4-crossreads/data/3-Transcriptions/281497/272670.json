<p>5th. This morning the Colonel was out on parade watching the N.C.O. drill the men, he is a very particular man but a fine soldier &amp; the best we have had in the Battalion so far I believe we are losing him shortly Got my second stripe today &amp; am now a full Corporal thats not bad considering its only 7 weeks ago since I got the first one</p>
<p>Its all over the place about me being recommended for a commission, the Headquarters Signallers let the cat out of the bag. Got orders to pack up &amp; be ready to move off at any time probably tomorrow, for we generally move of a Sunday</p>
