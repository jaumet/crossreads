<p>Sunday Nov 11th<br/>The weather is just the reverse to yesterday. It is a very dull cold day.</p>
<p>Monday Nov 12th<br/>Rotnest Island was sighted about 9.30 am. Anchored just outside Fremantle Harbour. Dr came on board &amp; examined every man. Entered the Harbour &amp; pulled alongside the wharf about 2 p.m. Red Cross Ladies brought flowers, fruit, cakes, books &amp; papers on board, all were very acceptable.</p>
<p>All West Australians disembarked about 3.30 pm. The "Borderer" arrived about an hour before us. Sailed 5 pm this afternoon. Colonel Meeks our O.C. disembarked at Fremantle, we lose in him a very good O.C. &amp; gentleman. It was a grand day. There were very few people on the wharf to see the ships in.<br/>We took on Westralian reinforcements to 4th Div Sig &amp; flying Corps, for training in Melbourne. Also five New Zealanders returning to New Zealand</p>
