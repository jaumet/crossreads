<p>27 November 1914<br/>Friday</p>
<p>Revielle at 6<br/>During night 3 more troopers &amp; [indecipherable] passed us en route for India. One signed to us saying that they took Indian troops home then brought Territorials to Egypt &amp; are now on their way to Bombay to take reinforcements home for the first force. No 6 &amp; our hold were taken down to the aft hold to shift &amp; throw overboard chaff as the flooring in the stables has proved defective again so now the same things have happened as did in No 1. 200 were turned out there &amp; there will not be many less in No 6. I took picket for Burrell who is busy shoeing nags now &amp; the day off [indecipherable] prevailed on me to do so. Ship has been averaging 11 knots as there is a two mile current running with us. Sighted three pelicans in the afternoon. Picquet mounted at 6  Bed 12</p>
<p>28 November 1914<br/>Saturday Destination made known</p>
<p>Out of bunk at 5<br/>Night the worst on board on account of the heat &amp; horses very troublesome with mange. Stables were started half an hour earlier as today is sports day for the ship. The programme was long including tugs of war, pillow fights etc &amp; a huge tank has been fitted up for swimming &amp; is being very largely patronised. Great news arrived at 12 today to the effect that we are to be landed in Cairo to complete our training &amp; from there go to the front but it looks that we are to be denied the actual thing &amp; have to take on garrisoning. We expect to land on Wednesday &amp; are to bivouac straight away. Toby very disappointed for he counted on seeing his people home in the old dart. Went down No 5 &amp; freed up waggons besides looking after myself in regard to bins. Am starting letters home expect it will be a long job. Bed at 9.</p>
