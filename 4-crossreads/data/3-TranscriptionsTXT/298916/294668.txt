was sent to the A13 to proceed to the inner harbour for water. The captain & second officer were ashore so the Chief officer & the pilot navigated the A13 through the narrow gates in the breakwater. These pilots are British & live in luxury. They have a native to carry their small hand bag & they themselves are dressed in spotless uniforms of white & polished buttons. In the harbour (inner) which is simply a portion protected by three breakwaters, were the Japanese cruiser Ibuki, & the British cruiser Yarmouth. Outside, was the quaint old Russian cruiser Askold with her five tall thin funnels. The inner harbour was packed with transports & not very far away was the Anglo Egyptian who was just moving out towards the outside transports. Suddenly she dropped both anchors & went "full astern" but too late. With a crash she struck the breakwater near the gates, sending up a shower of spray. The tugboat Goliath immediately went to her assistance & towed her near the shore for fear she would settle down. The damage was practically speaking slight & she afterwards took up her position outside. In absolute silence H.M.A.S. Sydney steamed down the lines of transports & took up her berth. No cheering
