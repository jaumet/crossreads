<p>Anchored opposite the Town about 1 mile off as there is no Wharf Accomodation we could not land so have to remain on board all the time. The Country around here is known as Sierra Leone &amp; the Town is called Free Town . Having had the Loan of a pair of Strong Glasses I had a splendid view of the Town all the Houses &amp; Buildings have their Roofs painted Red &amp; the Green Trees growing amongst them it makes a beautiful Panorama View. Free Town is built at the Foot of the Mountain which is named Mountain Lion. There are numerous Houses built amongst the Hills which look very pretty. The Gov. Residential Quarters is built on Sloping Ground <strike>&amp; [indecipherable] </strike> which is laid out<strike>whi</strike> with beautiful Green Trees growing between the Houses</p>
