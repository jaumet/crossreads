 Walk to ov 11 k.m to Avesnes to rejoin the Coves, most of whom have arrived back before me.  Naturally things are rather unsettled, and news regarding the future refuses to be made known to us.

 Cleaning up day.  A number of cards & photographs posted Home - Avesnes quite as uninteresting as ever.
