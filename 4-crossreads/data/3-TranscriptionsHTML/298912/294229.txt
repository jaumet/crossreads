<p>At last our turn came  &amp; on 24/12/15 we were sent back to Moore Park. Here Jock met us &amp; gave us every thought possible &amp; gave us final leave until 29/12/15. We all rushed home &amp; had a great time &amp; at midday on 29/12/15 we all met at Moore Park Depot ready for the front:</p>
<p>Jock here gave us leave until 5pm &amp; we visited town &amp; fixed up a few items &amp; went to the Theatre "So Long Letty". At 5 we reported again &amp; Jock gave us a short lecture &amp; asked each one individually if he was ready. He then paid us up to date &amp; gave us further leave until 6.15pm.<br/>At 6.15pm we left for the Rwy Stn singing songs &amp; on a Kitchener's Car  - no fares. At the Rwy Jock met us &amp; saw to our comfort, shook hands &amp; said "Good bye Lad". He was the best officer we ever had &amp; anyone I have ever met in the forces has always a good word for him, simply because he was a man to the soldiers &amp; not a swaggering officer in the usual <u>way</u></p>
