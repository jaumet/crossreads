about my illness about Laurel going to Queensland. that was the first I've heard about her going there. I have not even heard from her mother I'm sure she would have written as soon as she heard of my illness, so you see dear how letters must go astray.I was indeed very sorry to hear about poor Billy going west. While I was in France I saw thousands thousands of dead dying got so used to it that I never used to worry at all but how different one feels when you learn of one of your own pals going under. Why dear it very nearly made me cry. I do feel so sorry for his mother too.Of course dear it is very nice to hear you have sent me a parcel much nicer if I do get it. It's just one big game of chance. I have received three so far, two from Lol one from Doris but if I don't receive it, it is absolutely no use making enquiries. But anyway Sis I heartily thank you for sending it not only for what it may contain but for such kind thoughtful
