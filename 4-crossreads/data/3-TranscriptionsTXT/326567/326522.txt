a loud report then a rumbling sound as the Shells travel away over the Lines.Monday 23rd/7/17At 3 am this morning Fritz was over again, but this time I did not stir I simply sat up & put my Steel Helmet & lit a Cigarette & had a smoke & listened to the play outside after awhile things quietened again & I dosed off & slept until 7 am, feeling tired as I had very little sleep all night. Tuesd Friday 27/7/17After a quiet morning the Bombardment increased in violence & continued practically all night, word came from the Front line this evening that Fritz has cleared back 3 or 4 miles but our Lads are not advancing for a while as a trap may be set for them anyhow we are pummelling his Trenches to make sure We can guage how things are advancing by our Observation Balloons. Saturday 28th As soon as it got dark this Evening & as the sky is clear Fritz came over in his aeroplane, you can hear his Engine, Search lights were up in all directions looking
