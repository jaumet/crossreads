 Dear Mr &amp; Mrs Ellis, 
 It is just twelve months today since poor Arthur died so I am writing in hopes that it may be some small comfort to you both to know that we have not forgotten him 
 His name often crops up and he is always spoken of with respect &amp; in the kindliest manner. 
 We sincerely hope that you have been given strength &amp; courage to bear your heavy loss 
 He was a general favourite out here and a grand mate to work with and we miss him too so we can imagine how hard it is for you  so at any rate I am trying to help you bear your loss by letting you know the high esteem in which he was held out here 
 With Best wishes &amp; kindest regards I remain Yours sincerely G.E.W. Peate
