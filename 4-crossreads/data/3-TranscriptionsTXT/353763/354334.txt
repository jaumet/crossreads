by a providential influx of Mutton birds  -  This Petrel goes North to Masthead Island  -  I know & Masthead Island is off Gladstone in Queensland & the Great Barrier reef starts or ends somewhere thereabouts  -
Thursday Oct 19 - 1914   Since I  last wrote nothing of note has occurred  -  The weather has been perfect  -  What a lonely sea this vast Pacific is!! Not a bird, not a vessel until we touched the Australian coast somewhere in the vicinity of the Seal Rocks & saw the strong light to the North of it  -
I was up at 5.30 & the morning broke perfectly  -  Our trip is ended & all one has to do is to see to it that his mental horizon is wider - his knowledge of nature & man improved added to  -  In my own case I think I can safely say that that end has been very fully attained  -
