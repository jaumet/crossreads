<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a noticeable lack of young men here.  Nearly all aged men, women &amp; children.  The women are doing their share proudly &amp; well.  They have women-conductors on a large number of trams, assistants in shops &amp; it is a common sight to see women working in the paddocks.  We are camped on the outskirts of a French Village, &amp; it is continually reminding me of "The Tale of Two Cities."  The scenery in these parts is splendid.  The camp is hemmed on two sides with mountains, &amp; it is totally different to the scenery in Egypt.  This is my first letter since the 15th March when I wrote to you from Ol's place in Cairo.  All outward mail was suspended so that you will know that no letters have gone astray between 15th March &amp; 1st April.  I am keeping in splendid health &amp; feeling  very fit.  Must cut this down to the 2 page limit.  Tucker here pretty decent.  Your last letter date 6th Feby reached me at Serapeum on 18th ultimo.  Thanks very much for news &amp; good wishes.  Sincerely hope &amp; pray you &amp; Mother are keeping well.  Have taken some very interesting photos lately but haven't sent any home since 22-1-1916.<br/>Must close, best love to all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo</p>
