<p>The ships course yesterday &amp; today has been about 25 degrees W. of South.</p>
<p>Monday April 7.1919   148<br/>A fine day. The sun is hot but there is a gentle cool breeze. The ships course remains the same as yesterday. Wireless news from Tenefrie was posted up yesterday &amp; today at the canteen, but there is nothing much in it.<br/>[Shorthand transcribed as follows]  There is a barber shop on board now in the forward part of the ship and I got my hair cut today.  [end of shorthand]]<br/>Land was sighted very early this morning by some of those who were sleeping on deck.</p>
<p>There was a concert tonight in the forward part of the ship on No3.  Deck.  It was the first of a series to be held on board. One of the best items was a recitation "Salt Bush Bill" contributed by Brigadier General Lloyd. Some of the ships staff contributed songs,  the balance of the programme was contributed by privates. A newspaper is to be established on board, and articles are invited.</p>
<p>Tuesday April 8.1919   (149)<br/>A fine clear day.  A fresh wind is blown on the Port bow. The course of the ship has vered a little more to the South.</p>
<p>We have permanent mess orderlies and are paying them 2/- per week. Today was their first pay.</p>
