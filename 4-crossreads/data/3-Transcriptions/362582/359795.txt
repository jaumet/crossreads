<p>who were off duty went. It was a very good programme and we all enjoyed it very much. We had a flashlight photo taken, so if I can get one I shall send it home. After the concert the performers came around to our quarters for tea, we had quite a number of our friends from the camp. Fred's Regiment has moved camp &ndash; passed through here Sunday-morning but they are camped nearer now. Some of the Officers were in Sunday afternoon. Fred came in last night &amp;  we went for a little walk, four of us. Sunday-evening all of us went to Church and our dear Chaplain gave an awfully good address and the whole service was most enjoyable and helpful. It is marvelous the way the men all attend the services. We have not met our new Chaplain yet but suppose we shall in a few days. We have church in a tent now.</p>
