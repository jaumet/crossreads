 Big Mail tonight from AUSTRALIA &amp; England. 
 2 Mothers &amp; DAYS, JOE, WIFE MAY, LAURA &amp; Mr. FERRAR. 
 Thank you all so much. I was so glad the Housewife arrived safely. 
 Re putting names in, quite O.K. when you get my DIARY so long after, no harm can result. Dolly is well &amp; cheerful. Am glad you are all away. Am getting my Desert LEGS again, walking in the sand is quite different to walking in Cairo one gets shin sore there.
