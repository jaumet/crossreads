Work as usual until 12.30 pm  After lunch Legge & I take a tram to Boisguillaume (William's Wood) & enjoy a nice walk for about a mile along a road of an avenue of fine trees to the wood    & enjoy the fresh air. Farmers working in their fields, logs drawn for fuel on long carts & best of all, pure country air. A beautiful of the whole countryside around & in the valley from the hill & no doubt France is a great country.
