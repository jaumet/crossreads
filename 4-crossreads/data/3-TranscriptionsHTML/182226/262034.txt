<p>Still at a loose end nobody loves us &amp; nobody wants us.</p>
<p>The camp adjutant has turned out a brick &amp; is trying to get us bedding &amp; money.</p>
<p>We got 8/- each &amp;&nbsp;our bedding so we are all right. No leave has been given but we have taken a look round Alex, we have no time to do the thing thoughly but from what I can see it is a much finer place than Cairo though not as large.</p>
<p>We got unspecified orders to be ready to move off at 11 p.m., most of our&nbsp;boys were the worse for the 8/- but we got away all right, 130 of us with no one in charge &amp; are now on our way to Cairo.</p>
<p>Hooray, I will soon be back with the boys.</p>
