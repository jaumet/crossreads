He was shot through the head on Easter Monday morning. He was killed where he fell with two others. They were probably caught by a machine gun. Did I tell you that we saw Alan's grave at Warloy village cemetery about two months ago?

Seven men including Dene & myself  [indecipherable]  a  [indecipherable]  fire minutes ahead of D Co.s & advanced until we came in contact with the Huns. Fritz let us get within fifty yds before he opened up on us with rifle & machine gun fire. We had  [indecipherable]  at once & do the snake act back to company & report. It is a miracle that we were not potted then as we were advancing over clear open country
