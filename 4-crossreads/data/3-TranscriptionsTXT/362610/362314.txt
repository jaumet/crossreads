 Saturday 8 April 1916 A beautiful bright day with a very decided nip in the air. The postponed inspection by the camp commandant was held, the massed parade of the 3000 or so men on the hillside making a fine picture. After passing up &amp; down the lines he addressed the men calling attention to the fine work already done by Australians &amp; to what yet remains to be done. After the inspection 50 of my men who had been taken from us at Aerodrome &amp; sent on by the "Saxonia" to the 2nd Divn. joined up again with the company. The tents for officers were put up &amp; in the afternoon we moved into them from the hut, Mr Prescott &amp; I being together in one : he had just been appointed Q.M. Stayed in camp for each meal &amp; at night &ndash; a beautifully clear starlight night with a nip of frost in it &ndash; went down town to purchase eatables, getting back about 9 o'c.
