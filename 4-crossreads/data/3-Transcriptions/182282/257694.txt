<p>Re <sup>Lt</sup> Kenneth Binnie</p>
<p>The Followin brief Summary of my</p>
<p>Father War Service were taken from</p>
<p>his 1916, 17, 18 and 19 Diaries</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Outbreak of War Dad was managing</p>
<p>4D. Alan had won a scholarship to</p>
<p>Wxford and the rest of the Family</p>
<p>(including Struan) had gone to visit him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a &quot;man of the times&quot; Dad was</p>
<p>extremely anxious to &quot;Get Away&quot; and</p>
<p>this was the subject of many letters</p>
<p>to his parents during 1915 beseaching</p>
<p>them to come home and relieve</p>
<p>him of his management duties so that</p>
<p>he could do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>January 1916 saw him finally get his</p>
<p>wish and he enlisted as a</p>
<p>Gunner in the 7<sup>th</sup> Field Artillery Brigade</p>
<p>which were being formed at &quot;the</p>
<p>Warren&quot; /Camp near <s>Holsworthy</s> Tempe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time he was courting my mother,</p>
<p>Linda Lloyd, who was a Sydney girl. <s>and</s></p>
<p>Her family provided a welcome venue</p>
<p>for him on his frequent leave breaks.</p>
<p>Apart from leave breaks they looked after</p>
<p>their Horses, which were carefully selected,</p>
<p>cleaned the guns and Harnesses &mdash; which</p>
<p>he complained &quot;rusted while you</p>
<p>watched&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7<sup>th</sup> F.A.B. embarked on the &quot;Argylshire&quot; for</p>
<p>England on 11<sup>th</sup> May - they had an enjoyable</p>
<p>&amp; less eventful voyage with plenty of</p>
<p>good companionship from North Western</p>
