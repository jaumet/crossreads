10 SundayGrey, cold day. Feeling tired, ill - nourished & miserable because I wanted to work & no warm spot to be had alone. Miss Smith had family party lasting from 3.30 till 9.30. uncomfortable & disgruntled. Oh for a little means to procure peace comfort.
11. MondayMaroon went at 11. Then people began to celebrate. Came on to rain & people slopped around all wet & draggled. F. Post  rang up & asked me round to celebrate with him but couldn't go as Mr A was muddling off to a conference.
12.TuesdayCold grey day. People still celebrating in pubs. Had painful sore throat & weak heart. Went to bed at 3.00 o'clock & slept till 5. Got up & rested & typed a little of "Down Under". Nelson Smith came at 7 also with a cold.
13. WednesdayTwilight all day. Fog.  Felt myself getting worse. Crawled home typed a little & went to bed. Oh the cruel lack of comfort if one is ill. Cold salad not right sort of food.
