Monday Oct 29thA very heavy swell on today, I am feeling fairly well. There are a good few sea-sick. The wind is very strong & cold. It is very funny when the boat rolls, especially below deck, everything is rolling from one side to the other, fellows are trying to walk along, & only manage by short runs.
Tuesday Oct 30thA sweep is got up every day on the distance the boat travels every day, the winner gets about 30/-. I haven't go in for any yet. Feeling very crook today.
Wednesday Oct 31stStill very windy with a heavy swell on. There are a good number sea-sick on board. I am feeling fairly well today. Kit inspection held today, we hadn't to empty out our kits though. Concert held on No 3 hatch. The party is now known as the "Pierrots".
Thursday Nov 1stWe have two sweeps being got up on the Melbourne Cup. First prize is 20   2nd 5   3rd 2.10.0. The tickets costs 2/6 each. I am not in for one.
