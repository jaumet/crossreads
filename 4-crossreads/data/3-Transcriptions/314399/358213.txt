<p>Monday 4 August 1919<br/>Very warm today. Did nothing but read. Played a few games &amp; also cards. Ship ran 330 miles yesterday. Saw 3 whales &amp; 3 boats. Some excitement. Played bridge before lunch &amp; in one rubber was down 701. Finished the game after dinner &amp; won by 1000 (5/-) for us. Do me.</p>
<p>Tuesday 5 August 1919<br/>Mild today. Played deck quoits all day. A dancing class started this afternoon for officers but is very poor so am not joining in. The Colonel spoke to the men about leave at ports &amp; giving the 'birds' a fair go on board. Played bridge &amp; lost 4/- so I'm just about even.</p>
