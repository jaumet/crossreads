  
 trying to make my clothes & boots do until we go to England or France but am afraid I shall have to renew some here. I'm having a Day-Off-Duty-, so taking a good rest. Washed my hair, stocking, singlets and now writing a long letter to you. Shall be helping this afternoon arranging for to-night's  Party . Cakes etc ordered from Cairo - Hope they come! Had a very sad time yesterday. An Officer took suddenly bad & died. He was a C. of E., so had Communion & wanted another sister & myself to have it with him. We have some awfully trying times occasionally. The poor fellow died about 20 mins afterwards but he was quite conscious through the service & answered the responses. if the war does nothing else it makes most soldiers & nurses realize that there is a  Supreme Being . Well, my dear folk, you will wonder what's happened to   Edith  writing like this - Fondest love & kisses to you all. From your loving sister, Edith.
