We are still going back up there & it hurts to read that Baillieu & such places are now in the hands of the enemy. B section will in future attend to all gas cases so things will not be quite so heavy. 
 Friday 19th April Stayed in bed all day under orders & the Major came down to see me.  Felt much improved in the evening so got up had a wash & shave but fear that I overdid it as I don't feel as well now.  Will try & get up tomorrow.  Still no mail, yet most of the others have received them.  Fritz still pushing up north & I believe that we have lost Passhendaele & Messines Ridge.  What lives we lost taking those places last year heaven only knows & now they are gone in a moment.  Gas casualties still heavy mostly through our chiefs being careless or their officers and for which they will be hauled over the coals.
