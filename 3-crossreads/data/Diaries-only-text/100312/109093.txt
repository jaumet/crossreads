From there by devious tube routes to the Church of the Sacre Coeur at Montmartre. Perched right on top of this historic hill it is reached by many stairs leading up to it and has a very Eastern mosque-like look about it. The climb made me quite puffed and the view from the platform was not too good owing to the mist which hung over the whole of the city. Inside it is new and gaudy in looks and a service commenced with much genuflection and candle lighting. A fat monk was preaching when I left. Back by tube to hotel and after a rest came down and met E. taking her out to 5 o'c tea. The way these folk discuss the demimonde is frank and amusing. Had some cakes and iced coffee. It was dark when we came out walked back. This Avenue des Champs Elysees is most magnificent ? at night full of lights.
