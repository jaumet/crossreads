<p>at the Soup Kitchen.  Scotty still patching up our happy home.</p>
<p>Starnes &amp; Chaildecott left this morning on a 3 day visit to a Head Priest in order to get his influence in raising a Kurdish force as our Persians are useless.  Dick Hooper is busy at gathering grain.  Old Wilson is now Paymaster &amp; I attend to the feeding arrangements which owing to the scarcity of food is very hard indeed and only by the aid of a contractor am I able to get sufficient.  Nicol is busy on preparing a map of the surrounding district &amp; McLean went out into the Never Never to visit a chief.  Toby Williams is assisting in training the levies</p>
