much, the fact is that the longer I am O.A.S. the harder & harder becomes the writing of letters - I'm sure its the nomadic tendencies in me that are to blame, they are sprouting & bursting forth at an alarming rate, I'll have to start pruning shortly.  Je pense else in me you'll have a rank tree shrub underg with much undergrowth instead of a well trained shrub filling the landscape only to the alloted extent - its so easy n'est ce pas?  Civilian life seems to me now like some half-forgotten dream - was I ever a staid respectable Country Practitioner?  Can you tell me please? and yet I'm more a civilian than ever meaning that I am not & don't feel myself a Soldier really, merely a layman in uniform - and yet its a good life & in many ways I like it very much, but I can't get over
