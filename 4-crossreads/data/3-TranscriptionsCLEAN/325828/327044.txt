Say what they will the food shortage is very serious for England.  With bread we are only allowed one thin slice (the ordinary 4 sided loaves) per meal meat we can have 4 ozs per day & it is a very rare occurence to see a lump of sugar.The weather is beautiful at present & is inclined to get muggier every day now.On Tuesday last when in the Ambulance going to KIng George's Hospital I saw an Airship [see image for sketch] coming up the Thames at an altitude of 5 or 6 hundred feet.  It was flying the Tricolor (French) & when it got to Westminster circled twice over the Houses of Parliament & then turned East & disappearedIt looked very pretty became being aluminium-cased & shone very brightly.
