<p>26/11/17 Mt. Kemmell<br/>A fine day but bitterly cold. Cut out all specialist training in the morning and put all on to close order drill saluting &amp;c and kept them busy and moving all the time. Kept going round from one company to another. After lunch there were two football matches A v C. &amp;c B v rest of Battalion at soccer. Major Simmonds reported from C.C.S to take the place of Stevens. Took the first steps towards commencing a Battalion paper by calling for a name &amp;c. Started on the raiding platoon and its organization. After mess went out and saw the reading room which is well fixed up and then went to a euchre party of A Coy which was a great success and all the old Billjims were hard at the game and trying to be on their very best behavior. Coffee and biscuits were served at 9 pm.</p>
