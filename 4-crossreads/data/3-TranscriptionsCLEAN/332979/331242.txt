several of our Troops received an Invitation out to their houses which they accepted. Having arrived on board at 11 Pm I turned in being tired after my day.
17/2/17. Friday SaturdayAll hands astir at 6 am. Orders were given out that Routine on board would be the same as at Sea, which meant no leave ashore. We passed the day watching the Kaffers Coaling the boat also the Hindoos selling Pineapples to the boys, they buy them at 1/- a dozen & sell then at 3d each. It was very amusing watching the White Boys taking the Pine Apples out of the Hindoos baskets & throwing them aboard. They did not try to stop them. They were doing well out of what they sold. We left the Wharf at 4 Pm & Anchored in the Harbour till after Six & then a start was made
