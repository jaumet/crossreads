<p>June 24th 25th 26th Sat</p>
<p>Took M. out to see the Pyramids this afternoon.  This is the fifth time this trip had been intended and by some unforeseen circumstances had to be postponed.  A few mishaps also happened during the trip which added spice to the outing.</p>
<p>First of all we lost the five minutes to four tram and had to wait half an hour on the next one.  When we were about two miles from the Pyramids this car jumped the rails and we had to get off.</p>
<p>I tried to bargain for a camel to take us to the Pyramids but all to no avail, so we had practically to walk all the way.</p>
<p>When we reached the foot of the Pyramids we managed to get a camel and a donkey and have a joy-ride round the Pyramids and the Sphinx.  Arrived home at 8 o'clock.</p>
<p>Soldiers being invalided home to Australia left here to embark on the "Ballarat" at Alex &ndash; only 6 patients left in No. 6 ward.</p>
