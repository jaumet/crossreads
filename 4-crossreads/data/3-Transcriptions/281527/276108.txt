<p>4/2/18  Selles</p>
<p>this tiny quiet spot. He spoke much of politics and religion and I followed the gist of his French. With all these people the Foreign Legion has a great reputation &ndash; a corps d'elite with the fourragere of the legion of honour. Tried a case at Orderly Room. After mess had a talk with the company commanders over the work for tomorrow. A pleasant hour at the mess with good chaps. the night was very dark with a cold wind and my sore throat has come back once more. Our band is just now at the Army School and is much missed. We are hoping to get them back soon. This life is so quiet that we will have to go to great trouble to provide entertainment  &amp;c for the mess</p>
