<p>4/10/17 Ypres. De Knoet Fme<br/>My battalion was now down to about 290 in strength and was dug in well on the ridge. Our doctor was wounded beneath the knee by shell. Poor little Cox the runner was killed also Sgt Craner, Lowery, &amp; I think Sgt. Jones, Cpl. Hornan and others. The artillery officer was badly cracked at the door while letting a pigeon go and lay groaning there all day. I had no morphia to give him. Capts. Pearse, Godfrey &amp; Harriot are all dead so is Brewster. Fine men and gallant soldiers all. My batman, Hunt, was wounded in the leg. There were no stretchers and our wounded lay about all day. Davis wounded in the face remained on duty. The enemy has exact range of this dugout and got several round here today. In the afternoon we got a number of prisoners from a headquarters.
