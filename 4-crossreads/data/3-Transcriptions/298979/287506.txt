<p>"sang" too close to the ear hole altogether! The laziest man would "get a move on" under those conditions!</p>
<p>The fatigue party for rations were very glum going out for they had to follow a track on which a light railway was about to be laid instead of going back through the "Sap" &amp; at one or two places they were known to be exposed to Machine Gun fire &amp;, all the time, to shells that may be dropped short, but on their return late at night they looked &amp; felt like heroes &ndash; but did not "rush it" the next evening nor did those who had formed the water fatigue.</p>
<p>The Company remained in the line for four days &amp; then were moved back to billets, this meant a march of 4 miles.</p>
<p>The work of "holding the line" proved quite enjoyable after the first few hours &amp; each &amp; every one was very enthusiastic, &amp; kept mentioning the fact that this sort of work was what they had enlisted for &amp; was much better than all the "old drills".</p>
<p>On the third day the Coy Sergt Major came gleefully down the line during the early afternoon &amp; while congratulating the men, said we intended to "liven" up" the Hun very much more straight away. A fuller explanation showed that we intended treating the enemy to a doze of 60 lb "plum puddings" from trench mortars.</p>
<p>A "plum pudding" is a large circular shell with a steel rod 18 Inches long by 2 Inches in diameter fastened into it. It is fired by inserting this steel rod into the barrel of the mortar, &amp; which on reaching the breech explodes a charge sending the "pudding" into the air almost vertical &amp; the Steel rod makes its decent so very erratic that although it can be seen, no one knows where it will fall.</p>
<p>The Huns have a shell somewhat similar, called from its shape a "Rum Jar". The metal case of this shell ranges from an inch &amp; a half to 3 Inches in thickness, so that no one knows much about it, if it bursts very close.</p>
