<p>Saw some fine fish playing around our boat this morning, must have weighed 30 or 40 lbs.</p>
<p>No one is allowed ashore here  the authorities in Colombo are willing but our Defence people have forbidden it for some reason or other, so the Y.M.C.A. have been taking orders for silks cigars curios &amp; etc they had an order for over @pound;350</p>
<p>It is lovely now &amp; one can almost smell the spicy breezes that blow from Ceylon Isle</p>
<p>8.30 Have just heard that the Y.M.C.A. could not get the things ordered  the job was too big or something to that effect, we are still taking coal &amp; water aboard got some 300 tons of the former <strike>latter</strike> to collect yet, so theres not much chance of us getting away tonight</p>
<p>Took a snap of the Indians who were having dinner today, they all line up &amp; each man is issued</p>
