<p>The weather was fairly damp, misty rain falling fairly frequently but as we had good warm clothes, we did not mind. One soon is used to damp weather as fine days are very rare for this time of the year. We arrived at the station and the train left on time and after a good run we arrived at Etaples at 3.15 pm, and after a wait of 30 minutes the train arrived, they are of the electric type and small and run three together, two are opened at the sides and one all enclosed, as there were a fair number of passengers waiting as soon as the cars stopped, they were full up again, another three cars came in and they were soon filled and both lots started on the 71 kilos run to the Plage, as there is only a single line, two loops for crossing purposes are provided and after a delay of a few moments at each crossing we soon arrived at our destination. The fares are 3d. each way.</p>
<p>The weather was still wet and miserable at it was getting dark, so we both went along the Esplanade, which is a splendid Promenade.</p>
