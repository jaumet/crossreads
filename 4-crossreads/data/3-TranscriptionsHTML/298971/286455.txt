<p>with them.  The 27th &amp; 28th Batt. of the 2nd Div. went over this morning and took the ridge leaving one other before Bapaume.  From the chaos of the battlefield rumours say we have been driven back but this can't be verified in such confusion as yet.  Late into the night we worked with the wounded slipping and sliding between shell holes.  Rain is still falling.</p>

<p>Still busy with the wounded.  Gun blown out near our post.  The Crest under heavy shell fire making our position</p>
