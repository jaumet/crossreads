 Our home from home the 14thAGH has shifted from Abbassia and is now at Port Said - swapped places with the tommy hospital that I was in there last year - so Port Said will have a few more attractions for us now, but it is not much of a place. I could get leave there now but I think I would rather wait till I get a chance of Cairo, anyway this is much too good a camp to want leave from, especially when we have tons of old places here to go sight seeing and we can do it on horse-back here too and dont have to keep giving backsheech to guides etc. 
 I do hope the season keeps on being as good as it started in the spring. 
 Love to Mother & Hal & Fred 
 I am your loving son Robert C. Wilson
