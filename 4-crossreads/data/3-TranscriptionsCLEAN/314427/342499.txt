  
 another one "A school Gemetry" by Hall & Stevens. 
 Sunday March 16. 1918.  126 A fine day.  I went for a long walk the morning as far as Fleet House and came back by Chickerell. This evening I finished reading "The Taming of John Blunt" by Alfred Ollivant, a rather interesting novel, dealing with the life of a recluse. 
 Early this morning seven hundred men were sent away from camp to go aboard the Tyarvitch for home. Driver Mc Connel of the HO was one of them &  Kelly a 1915 man & it is doubtful if  he ever saw France was another. He went as an hospital patient. [Shorthand transcribed as follows]  I received a letter from Maggie Martin, Belfast.  [end of shorthand] This evening I was in Weymouth and went to the Congregational Church and heard an army chaplain preach.  After  the Service there was a social in the schoolroom under the church, which is specially got up for soldiers. There was a programme of sacred music & tea  & cake for the soldiers. This is continued every Sunday night & I only accidientally heard of it today. 
 Monday March 17.1919.  127 A fair day. This is St. Patricks Day and some of  the soldiers are floating a little bit of green ribbon. I was again working in the smiths shop today making splints.
