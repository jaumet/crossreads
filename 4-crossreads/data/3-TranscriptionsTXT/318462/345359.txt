 Huns Bombed Hazebruk last night at 12 &amp; shelled it at 4 this morning from 18 miles away Killed some women &amp; children &amp; wounded a few. 
 Friday 10/8/17 Boys came in today &amp; the place is noisy again, Paid Parks 10/- owe him 50/-  letter from Viv which he sent before I left for England. Got a bad posy for sleeping in here the one before was between a Pig house &amp; Calf House, this has been used by cows &amp; hens. Nice &amp; fine today. Taubes bombed a place about 5 kilos from here trying to get an amunition factory or dump. This morning - shelled Hazelbruk again, supposed to have killed 70 Tommies in a hospital yesterday and some civilians also wounded some ausy's. Aeroplanes about all day &amp; night. Stony broke again. It's awful to see the Refugies coming in carrying all they can scrape together in Bundles on their Backs &amp; leading children likewise, also some with carts full of furniture &amp; Bedding etc. from Hazelbruk.
