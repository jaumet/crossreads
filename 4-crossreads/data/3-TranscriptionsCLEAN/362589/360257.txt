  
 We set trip wires to mines, trap guns & bombs, with entanglements, etc. before we retired & every one worked with extraordinary energy. This is a cold wet camp at present, but we will soon be in Egypt & thence, where sent. Of the 33 Officers who left Sydney we now have but 13. Col Lamrock commands the 5th Brigade, Lt. Parker is his A.D.C> & Lt. McCallum is A.D.C> to Genl. Holmes who commands the 2nd Division. Major Murphy is now O.C. of the 18th. I have instructed Capt. Howard to write & sincerely thank the Committee, to whom one owes a great deal. Many comforts were awaiting us here & were highly acceptable after travelling light from Anzac. The weather here is cold, but the boys are happy & are singing tonight in nearly every tent. Kindly remember me to Mrs. Ferguson. Yours very sincerely,  R. F. FitzGerald  
  P.S.  Major Jenkins was back with us for only 2 days & was still very unwell when he was killed. Major [indecipherable] was O.C. B Coy. & had good health throughout. Major Haren was only just recovering from jaundice when he was killed. He was the O.C D Coy. I have been recommended for the rank of Lt. Col.
