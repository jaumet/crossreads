<p>Wednesday, 17 March, 1915<br/>Rode horses to Canal to obtain mud for the building of an incinerator, loaded eight transports and then came home.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we heard we were to go out for an all night fight &amp; leave camp at 5.30 pm.  Had early stables and coats on saddles when we heard we were not going, we were not sorry as it was a cold night.</p>
<p>Sammy has been misbehaving so he has been taken off the line and held up on his own away from the other horses, the poor little devil looks very lonely and repentant.</p>
<p>Thursday, 18 March, 1915<br/>On fatigue building a model incinerator with stones and mud.  The job took all day and it looked well when we finished.</p>
<p>On picquet at night.  I have been very fortunate this week with letters as I have received over thirteen local &amp; from Aust.  big march &amp; bivouac for us to morrow only B. Sect.  all sorts of rumors are current concerning the fate of the 3rd Brigade that left a while ago.  Issued with caps and a lot of underclothing.  The caps are all too small and our kit bags will not hold any more.</p>
