Monday 19 November 1917.
Smith inspected camels. Got rid of my 2 lead camels as result. Moved again at 1 pm. 5 miles to Surafenda. Passed through hundreds of acres of well kept orange orchards where hundreds of tons of oranges are going to waste on the trees.
28 days for anyone caught taking oranges & lemons from these orchards. People in the villages use Engh money and speak Engh language.
A wet night & on picquet. Got drenched.
