  
 21 February, 1916 Maadi Well its dead jammy in a way I just fixed up an appointment with Bert for next Sunday & to- day is alive with rumours of a shift away from here this week. How ever they say we are going to Ismalia & that is where Bert is stationed so if we go on Thursday there is a possibility that I will see him before Sunday.  There is certainly some move on for the troop competition is right off & it was to begin to day.  This afternoon we did nothing only got our horses out & the Sergeants were making inquiries as to what equipment we still needed.  To night Joe Woods shouted eight of us to the pictures, we were right in it
