 Dear Judge Ferguson 
 General Ramaciotti has already conveyed to you my sympathy in your sad loss, but I would like to personally express my sincere regret and sympathy with you in your trouble. 
 Apart from my personal interest, I am informed by my officers that your son was regarded as a highly qualified and competent officer whose advancement in the Forces was assured. 
 Yours faithfully, 
 G.F. Pearce 
 His Honor Mr. Justice Ferguson Supreme Court Sydney, N.S.W.
