<p>27/2/18  Selles</p>
<p>Had an early lunch and then rode out with Groves and Smith to reconnoitre the ground for tomorrow's operation. Returned to the football grounds marching in rear of the 24th. A great crowd at the football ground where they beat us after a good game. Great excitement and barracking. Col. Durran, General Paton &amp; others were on the ground. Word came to hand that our demonstration platoon under Gorman had won the Brigade Championships. Very pleased about this win. Arranged all details for our operation tomorrow. Some rain came on just before mess. Sutherland Barker &amp; Abercrombie go on leave tomorrow</p>
