  
 have to wait another week before I can expect one. Last night I sent off another 15 films in registered letter. Had second lesson in French at the Burlitz last night. Drill here is not quite so monotonous now, we do not get quite so much by numbers, it is varied. It was my turn mess orderly to day. Coming back from the zoo last Sunday afternoon, I got out of tram to take a few views of the Nile. The Nile is a fine river a little wider than the Fitzroy, There are a good many strange craft on it. Dozen of quick sailing boats which have one sail, suspended from the top of a high mast, too a couple of good pictures of the river. Saturday Dec 18th 15. This afternoon I went to the Museum found it full of mummies, coffins & ancient stuff of all descriptions, it was very interesting. Saw the mummy of Ramses II who lived about 1200 BC, also there is a fine collection of old jewellery. Am still at school
