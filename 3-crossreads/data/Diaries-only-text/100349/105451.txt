9/8/17.
Moved by route march. Via Hazebrouck, to Sec-Bois about 10 miles. The Hun was shelling Hazebrouck with a long range 13 inch gun. As we approached the town the roads were thronged with French civilians flying for their lives. Several German aeroplanes were flying high over the town spotting for the gun and dropping bombs. The Hun is becoming most unreasonable; I guess we are on our way to remonstrate with him; for we passed Birdwood on the road today. This German gun is firing from a place about 22 miles away. He will be destroying a few pubs, and that will tear it. He planted one in the New Zealand Hospital, I guess all the Hospitals will have to be removed from the town.
