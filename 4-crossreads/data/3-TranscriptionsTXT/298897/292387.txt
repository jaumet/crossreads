 Huns claim to have blown up an ammunition dump our reports however making no mention of it. 
 Saturday 11th Nov. Heavy bombardment which continued all night &amp; the day following.  Just as I finished the foregoing they started to shell our position, several falling in quick succession &amp; several fragments fell on the roof of the tent.  'Tis to be hoped that it doesn't last too long as tents are not exactly shell proof.  Last night several taubes were over &amp; I saw one plainly.  They used their machine guns &amp; caught one man at least on the roadway.  Have heard nothing authentic about any damage they did but plenty of rumours. 
 Sunday 12th Nov. Learnt today that the shelling of last night found the weak places of the 15th. Many of the officers &amp; men appear to have bolted for neighbouring ditches etc leaving their duties, &amp; had wounded arrived at the time they would have received no attention, a very grave matter indeed.  Certainly the majority had never been under fire being mostly "deep thinkers" but still to leave a duty post is unforgiveable.  The nearest shell fell 100 yds from my tent being apparently a 6" H.E. &amp; shook the place alot putting out the light I was reading &amp; writing by.  I sincerely hope they don't start again as I cannot shake off the feeling I mentioned a little way back.  Don't know whether I'm a fatalist or not but this thing has me, luckily without spoiling my nerve, my chief feeling being one of sorrow for the trouble I would cause at home.  Should all be well my faith in premonition will receive a shock
