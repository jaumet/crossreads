  
 Sunday 12 September, 1915 
 Had a shave, made a great find in the shape of a pair of socks, I only had those I stood up in before. 
 Scored another tin of milk & had some more rice & milk. Mac had some & reckoned it was all right. 
 The weather is cold & dull, would not be surprised to see some rain. 
 Mac had a "chat" hunt & got 13, he expects to have a comfortable nights sleep tonight. 
 Very light shower of rain during the night. Heavy bombardment by the fleet on the right. 
 Wrote to Mrs Ray, Mr Maquire & Mr Chauvel.
