<p>taken our clothes off for a longer period. Took over Runner Post from 14th, running two Posts with only 4 sets of Bearers &ndash; going like fury all the night &ndash; sent up for relief about midnight &amp; only got one extra squad of 4. We were all completely done in from ploughing knee deep thro the stiff mud &ndash; Absolutely the hardest &amp; most disheartening night we ever put in &ndash; our Doctors &amp; N.C.O.'s seemed to be ignorant of the fact that we had to carry from Runners to Dressing Station. We all refused duty at 2-30 am unless we got more men, were told in answer to our deputation that we could have 48 hrs off, so we struggled on. 3 Bearers of B Section got knocked today, 2 seriously &amp; 1 lightly.</p>

<p>Raining &amp; Cold. Went up &amp; Relieved at North Road &ndash; Fritz shelling in our vicinity all day &ndash; quite monotonous to be always saying we had more narrow escapes. Busy all day &amp; night. Beastly accommodation, feet &amp; clothes wet since I came out, half our bearers getting trench feet, can feel my own feet tingling &amp; swelling. One of the bearers &ndash; poor Hopkins who got hit yesterday died before we got in, the other fellow we all think there is no hope for him. Had a busy night.</p>
