 14th Nov 1914 My dear sister Just a short note to let you know I am in the best of health and am having a good trip. Tell Ralph his remarks about troop ships were absolutely true. There is a strict censorship on all correspondence, hence this brief note. I hope you and Beres are in good health. Well Lizzie I will ring off with fondest love from Ken
