  
 interesting fatalistic story. 
  Entry  Saturday 18th Aug.  
 In troops Train travelling from Rouen to Hazebrook on Belgian front. I am O.C. Train which consists of 50 trooptrucks & carriages. Troops include English, Scotch, Welsh, Australians & Indians. After a heavy shower of rain just before starting  from Rouen at  3.30  the day is now delightful, the country beautiful after the rain. 
 I am given a compartment to myself but have Jock Willis (Lt 15th) with me. We have boots, coats & collars off as it is rather warm. The Seine - a beautiful & large stream looks well - quite crowded with small stream vessels & barges. 
 We arrived in Rouen about 7 this morning, went to  a  barbers for wash & shave, to Officers' Club, but as they were extremely slow there getting breakfast, Willis & myself went to a small restaurant & enjoyed Coffee, bread, butter & French Cheese. --
