  
 Sunday 20 February, 1916 
 Had the strangest church parade I have ever taken part in. It was in the midst of wind & rain. We sang the first hymn & then had to retire in a hurry because of the rain. We emerged however a few minutes later clad in our great coats & went on from the general confession. 
 All our services are held in the open air with the regiment drawn up in hollow square. The Colonel & adjutant sit in the centre with the officers in front in review order.
