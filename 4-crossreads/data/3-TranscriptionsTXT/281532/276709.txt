packs were heavy. Passed Corps HQ at Assevillers and swung on till we met our guides. It must have been a good 12 mile march and the fellows finished cursing at the top of their voices and fed up to the teeth. To my disgust I found the cooks had no tea ready for the men but cooly said that it would be ready in a quarter of an hour. I was in a boiling rage. Camped in trenches and shelters scattered round open paddocks. Trench shelters and the like. Sent out for Q.M. Miles to strafe furiously about the tea business and then went to bed in a well ventilated leanto which caught in its many cracks every wind that blows. Slept soundly and well rolled up in the blankets of my valise until 9.30 next morning.
