23/9/17 Westhoek
Major F Tubb V.C. killed on our right today. The relief by the 16th. Battalion passed off very quietly and well. They had a couple killed coming in. Going out we had hardly a shell. Nearing the Birr X roads we passed very close in front of some heavy gun batteries. The flash and concussion nearly knocked us over more than once. Our horses were waiting and we pushed on down to the Asylum. There was a 10 mile trudge in front of our tired lads but fortunately a shell transport convoy passed and many got a ride in the lorries. Rum tea and chocolate were waiting at the Asylum. A long walk from the road to Dominion camp some slept by the roadside. As the camp was occupied by the 48th. we had to bivouac until next morning. A chilly night. Stew and hot tea were waiting for them. Everyone was extremely tired and knocked up with fatigue.
