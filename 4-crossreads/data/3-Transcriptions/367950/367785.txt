<p>15th January 1917 El Arish Monday<br/>Heavy fog all morning. Two of our aeroplanes went out scouting about 4 oclock this morning and just after 6 they came back There was two of them and they each had an electric light at the tip of each wing which looked rather pretty. They reminded one of some swinging Chinese lanterns I am feeling real good now after the attack of influenza.</p>
<p>16th January 1917 El Arish Tuesday<br/>Have been out on patrol all day with "C" Squadron in the direction of Sheikh Zowond   we went out about 10 miles and another patrol of the same Squadron went further inland. Some Turks have been giving themselves up lately on account of our incessent aeroplane attacks and its beginning to get on their nerves. So we went out a good way in case we saw any stragglers but had no luck<br/>Fritz came over the camp this morning and dropped 4 bombs which exploded near the Camel Corps lines about 2 miles</p>
