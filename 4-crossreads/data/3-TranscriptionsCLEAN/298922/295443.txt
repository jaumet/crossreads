 SHELLAL 
 On outpost again last night, it actually rained & after the heat turned quite cold. I washed & shaved this morning. Sullivan of Deniliquin, Bullock driver is my Batman now. 
 We are camped in a rugged water worn WADI but no water. 
 Hear that a mail is in Camp. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  My substantive Rank of MAJOR came through in Orders so am Temporary no longer & if go sick or wounded I do not revert. Don't know when I'll post this.
