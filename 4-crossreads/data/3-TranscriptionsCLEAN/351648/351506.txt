Australian nurses at one of the French Hospitals I shall go in again as often as I can.  I knew them at Hospital when I was a resident, they have promised to introduce me to a charming French V.A.D.  Life is beginning to become interesting again - what!  I completely wormed myself into their good graces by taking them a lot of sugar & biscuits as their rations are not the best in the French hospitals & sugar is absolutely unobtainable at shops, so "my marble is good" as they say in the Classics.
Well I must write other Aust. letters now, thank you awfully for the coat & for the papers that come along regularly & are a great boon.
Send me a copy of the book "tout de suite" & don't be too severe on the kid - you wouldn't expect your son to feed out of your hand - what!
My regards to John.
With all best wishesYrs very sincerelyJ.B. Metcalfe
P.S.  Did I tell you I was a Major now?
