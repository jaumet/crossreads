 6 miles away from us but I have not yet had a chance of going to see if I know anyone there. 
 I was glad to hear that Keith was still in England when you wrote & hope he will remain there some time, though no doubt he is as keen as mustard to come across. 
 I hope as you say that Caesar will get (or has got) his well earned furlough. His good work, though only what one would expect, is nevertheless good to hear of. 
 Sorry to hear that Dorothy had been having such a bad time. Teeth troubles are undoubtedly amongst the most wearing. My mother, in a letter dated Dec 20, said that the torturing tooth had been removed, so I hope that meant she was soon better. I hope to hear from her before long. 
 For a fortnight now we have had a hard frost with temperatures as low as 5 Fahr. Ground frozen as hard as iron - instead of Flanders mud. Snow all over the countryside & bright sunshine produce a mist & a glare that made our work almost impossible. When the thaw does come the place will be almost flooded & the mud will be 'wonderful to behold'. 
 By the way has Keith a London address? 
 Kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy & yourself 
 Yours very sincerely 
 L.O'G Whitfeld.
