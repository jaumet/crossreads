  
 Bulford 28/3/18 Dear Mum, I told Dad about our success at the Anzac Sports. I am starting cricket on Monday D.V. At present I take a little walk after Tea & then sit in my room to read or write once weekly. I go to the theatre if anything but drama is to be seen. I rarely go to Sarum now. One does not arrive Home until nearly 1 AM. & I detest the awful train journey. I may take the bike again soon as the weather has improved lately. I'll be glad to have the lollies & the parcels when they come along. We buy some sweets occasionally but they are such awful things & so very expensive. I know this part of London, at the top of the Strand very well. It is not as nice as the picture would have you believe. It is a dirty slaty mud colour, like most buildings in the big smoky English Towns. Ellis is getting supplies as I write. I have about 8 or 9 letters to write now. There is another mail in & I get one or two each day. Well, mum I hope you don't lose your glasses again. Remember Dad & you are both hasty. I am not a bit hasty & that is how I always take it in  & I think it over later. Best Love to all   Harry.
