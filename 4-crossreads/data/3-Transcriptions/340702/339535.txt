In the meantime Froggy (who <u>does</u>know a little about motors) was careering wildly around the Outer quite unable to penetrate the Barrage of Experts, He had just completed his 145th lap &amp; was very nearly crying when they understood what he wanted. His prayer was &ndash; For the love of the Good God, go outside &amp; leave me alone &amp; I will fix her up in 10 minutes. They didn't believe him but went out &amp; started putting a pulley on the main shaft intending to drive off that.

When they saw that she (The Japey) was running again they took the Pulley off the Shaft</p>
