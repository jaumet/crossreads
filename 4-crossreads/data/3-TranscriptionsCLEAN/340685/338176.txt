  
 The men had to make 3 trips before finally getting away all the baggage which after dinner and we had another meal of biscuits at the station. When we got down to the camp no officers appeared and after pitching a tent in the hot sun we were told we were to move about 1/2 a mile away which we did late in the afternoon. This camp contains all sorts of miscellaneous and lost men and I really think very few know of our presence and don't care until we are drafted into our respective fighting units. The organisation appears to be very rotten and so far we have done absolutely nothing for four days and they say we do no engineering work here but to waste time. We have a bell tent with first of all 2 sergeants and three men and now six men with our own picked comrades so we are alright. The ground is all on the slope but can be made comfortable. The camp is very extensive and runs for miles in every direction and I haven't got the run of it yet. There are native shops of every kind but are primitive and crude and include Russian and Indian tailors barbers stores and all sorts and Y.M.C.A's. 25.4.16 Reveille at 5 and first parade at 6 and I was orderly for the first half of the day but them permanent orderlies were then appointed, good food so far but not sufficient tea. Water is not advisably to drink the doctors tell us and it is too dear buying soft drinks all day and besides they are not satisfying so a man is in a bad way and has to drink as little as possible. Anzac Day to-day and some good sports were held which however I didn't go to as I tried unsuccessfully to make up some sleep and we had the day off to see them. There is a picture theatre quite close and is 3 & 5 piastres with good pictures and towards the village is a circus (good) for 1/- and up on the hill a stadium free & good matches. Got our dinner at a native "restraim" and 3 piastres for 3 fried eggs and tomatoes & 1/2 for cup of coffee. 24.4.16 Morning entertained by a juggler who made some good money out of us but his tricks were very good but nearly all sleight of hand. 26.4.16 Detailed for fatigue work in the morning and after breakfast went down to the native bazaar to get a watch of Hodgson's. There are some beautiful pieces of work of art but these are cheaper in Cairo and I am waiting and will go to see all thoroughly again soon however. Hospital train ran through this evening carrying wounded from near the Canal and there has been some scrapes there lately I believe. Spent the evening in looking for drinks and drank too much and must go easier to-morrow. 27.4.16 Woke up with a taste "like a sewer" and did nothing but sit about from 6 to 8. Tis breakfast and we don't parade again till 11. on account of the heat. Parade 11-12 and then again from 2.30 to 5 but I think we have a weekly half holiday to-day Allen & Thomson in charge both from Moore Park. The mess-rooms are of split bamboo which keeps out the sun and are very cool. Have met a university chap  and a school chap so far. After dinner I finished reading Methuselah and about 2 we went to look at the village and any other interesting things. A water wheel used to pump water from the branch of the Nile Canal
