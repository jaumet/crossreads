<p>any, so long as my name isn't shown.</p>
<p>I met Ernest in London again this time and we had a good time together.  London is a rotten hole, - worse than Cairo, in my opinion.  Aust. soldiers seem fair game for some classes, but its only because they're so silly and easily taken in.</p>
<p>Well, Vol, I must cease fire and heave my 13 st. 8 lb. on to the parade ground, there to dispense two hours physical jerx" (I am a physical training instructor) to about 80 men.</p>
<p>I hope to hear regularly from you.  Why doesn't Violette ever write?  I've offended her, I suppose, as I seem to have offended all my Sydney correspondents.  When in France I had no platoon commander and had to act as one in addition to doing platoon Sgts. work, so god knows I had very little time for writing or anything.  Most of the girls at Mauries [?] write and Miss Betty, if charitably inclined, might be able to keep me well posted from there.  Saw N.M.T. in London.  He's a real gentleman Vol, say what they like.</p>
<p>Yours &amp;c.<br/>A. Hine</p>
