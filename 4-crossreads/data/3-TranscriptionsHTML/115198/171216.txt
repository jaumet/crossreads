<p>We had a little time now, since lots of the troops had returned to Canada, to learn more about our patients. One in particular we thought rather sissy. He was always making "housewives" for needles and thread and giving them to the boys. We were very ashamed when one of the officers told us he was the most decorated man in his battalion. He had never said a word or wore his ribbons. Finally all the officers departed and the ward closed down.<br/>April. 6th sent off duty on sick leave.<br/>May 5th  decorated by King George V. at Buchingham Palace. Had 2 days' leave in London.<br/>June 20th left Buxlow, where I had again been on sick leave, for Liverpool. Left on the Hospital ship "Essequita" arrived Portland June 21st. It was a pleasant and comfortable trip and the end of the war for me. June 1919.</p>
