It was hell while it lasted but he did not succeed in doing much damage. It lasted for 4 hours. Managed to get a bit of tea. Got to bed at 11 oclock.
6th June 1917. Came on duty again at 6 oclock. Fritz shelled around here today. Killed a few of the boys of other batteries. Built a dugout near the telephone station. Fritz started shelling with gas tonight at 12 oclock. Bombardment started at 3.10 this morning while I was on duty. Lets hope the business will be a fine success and our boys can bring fresh fame to Australia. 5 of our staff are going over with the Infantry. Came off at 4 guns rowing like fury.
7th June 1917. Woke up at 9 oclock with the artillery still going strong we eased up slightly afterwards. The advance at latest reports is going good, our boys have taken Messines ridge. Lets hope Fritz doesn't counter attack much. But I have confidence in our boys. We had a sad day as we had the first death today in this battery. A fine little fellow being caught in his dugout by a big shell. Went on duty at 12 ? 4 8 ? 12.
8th June 1917. Went on at 8 till 12. Rather quiet as far as artillery goes this morning. Although Fritz shelled the position heavily. Fritz also has been attacking the new positions. At 9 oclock at night Fritz attacked new positions heavily which called the wrath of our artillery on his shoulders. Went to sleep at 10 oclock woke at 4 to go on duty. Parties of Fritz tried to get into new trenches at that time
