<p>Anzac<br/>19/12/15<br/>At 0130 Mackay left with 250 men, not a sound rifles slung downwards and butt plate covered with cloth. Mess tins rattling made more noise than any other part of the equipment. We had spread loose earth all over the floor of the trenches and over the paths and rocks. They were just like a flock of sheep following each other and not murmur. Some of the men had a scared look but had implicit faith in their officers and looked to them for everything. Good trained men. Mac. looked so young and boyish and seemed to feel his responsibility. Shook hands before he went and seemed to think we would never hold on till the next night, seeing all his had gone.</p>
<p>Went to bed and had two hours sleep. Day broke cloudy and enemy commenced heavy shelling with 8.2 shells. Our kitchen wrecked and pieces of shell flying all round. Such a bombardment with big shells was unprecedented and they came roaring by like a train. We had just had our last hot meal when one shell blew the kitchen to blazes. We stood to arms with our thin garrison for an hour. It was an anxious time as it looked like the prelude to an attack and a repitition of the Lone Pine business. 75's also busy. Monitor last night said to have kept a searchlight on Gaba Tepe for hours and prevented observation from there.</p>
