 1917 &nbsp;FEBRUARY 
 13 TUESDAY 
 Fine but dull &amp; warm. It has started 
 to get muddy again now. The 
 thaw has set in. Cleaning harness 
 horses ect in morning &amp; out 
 exercising horses in afternoon. 
 While out I tried to send a wire to 
 mother from &quot;Croix du Bac&quot;, but 
 could not do so. Things very 
 quiet at line all day.
