  
 Sunday 26 May  Last night's attack did not eventuate but the Bosch raided instead but was completely repulsed.  He is shelling Pradelles & dist. heavily with gas which I think is a prelude to the second phase of his offensive. Glorious weather still prevails. 
 Monday 27 May Glorious day again & things are quiet about here. We go up to the A.D.S. at Borre to-morrow.
