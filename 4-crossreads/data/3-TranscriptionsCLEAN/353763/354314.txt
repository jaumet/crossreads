No, I did not go  -  There was nothing for me there  -  I went on my own  -  I wanted to see a picture again & let it soak in on my memory  -  A picture that was sea & landscape combined, with the reef & the white horses in the background & the boom of the Pacific rollers in my ears  -  It was the same walk that I did yesterday  -  If we are to leave Suva I am going to have this mental picture anyway so I did it alone & observed things that I had missed previously  -  I walked the 5 mile round - out to Suva point & then away up past the wireless & the signal stations back to Suva  -  A part of the road I walked with an Indian - a friendly old chap - but our different languages prevented any real intercourse  -  He came from Calcutta  -  Had been here 5 months & was engaged on Sugar so far as I cd make out  -  The tide was an ebb one & yellow dabs covered the flat sandy mud  -  Each
