12/6/17 Paris
After leaving the Grand Trianon we went to the carriages ? all the state coaches in burnished gilt and gay trappings. That of Charles X was very fine and much larger than any others. There were also Napoleon's carriages including those he used on active service in the field. Near by were the sedan chairs of the queens and of the royal mistresses and also their ice sledges. The harness for the state horses hung up in rear. To the Petit Trianon which is about the size of a fairly large mansion and very full of art treasures. Looking down from the front of the palace for miles a splendid avenue extends in terraces. There are many fountains ? one of these is the Basin of Latour and represents people being turned into frogs ? all spout water. The green squares of grass on each successive terrace stand out vivial and form the green carpet or "tapis vert". in the Petit Tranon all movable articles such as vases etc. are connected by wires to prevent theft. Near here the Court Ladies had a model village where they were wont to play at being milk maids. The village still exists and may be seen
