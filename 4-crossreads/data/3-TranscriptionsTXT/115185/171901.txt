9 - we wont count on them till we see them. Our hospital is just full of dysentery Jaundice & diarrhoea - very little pneumonia so far - a good deal of enteric fever - very few surgical cases if any. The Red Cross things have been invaluable work our bad bread - impossible for convalescent dysentery cases etc. The biscuits from Arnotts have been life saving. I have never eaten this bread since it made me ill the first try. It's quite sour. I live on biscuits bought at the canteen the ration biscuits are too hard.The tinned fruit & Tomatoes, Red Cross, have been rushed - we have no vegetables her no potatoes perhaps for three days a month, we have them in our mess - we get them from a Greek greengrocer - But he has not always got enough for 105 sisters. No butter can you imagine how I eat bread & butter when I went to lunch on the Minatonka on Sunday! I felt very materialistic - one realized how starved one is when biting good bread & butter. Just think of our poor troops facing this winter with their poorly nourished bodies.
