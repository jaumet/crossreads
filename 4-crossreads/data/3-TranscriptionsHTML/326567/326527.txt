<p>night sleep. As we were having Breakfast 8 more Ammunition Teams came in &amp; took up a position in front of our Mess Tables.  As soon as the lads unharnessed their Teams, all our Boys offered them Biscuits &amp; Cheese &amp; Tea which they were very thankful as they had been on the road all night &amp; were tired &amp; hungry in fact just about knocked. After they finished &amp; had fed their horses they had their Breakfast &amp; down they laid everywhere some under their Wagons &amp; others in the open, there were a drizzly Rain fallen &amp; it made no difference to them they slept through it all until Dinner Time. They took things easy during the afternoon &amp; evening. The Bombardment was very quiet all Day &amp; Evening. It was freely rumored that the Big Push would start at 4 am next Morning. I invited two N.C.G's to camp in my Tent for the Night which they accepted &amp; I learnt from them that they had orders to move off at 5 am next Morning up to their Guns to move the guns</p>
