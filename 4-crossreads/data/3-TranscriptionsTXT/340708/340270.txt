Another big Evacuation today they have turned this hospital into a C.C.S. now Wednesday 18th Fritz paid us another visit but they only got to the outskirts of the town &amp;amp our guns brought one down &amp; the rest turned tail &amp;amp went home.   Another big lot of wounded admitted today. Thursday 19th. Another miserable day this is a great country for quick changes Friday 20th My hopes are dashed again   The C men were evacuated to England today &amp; I am still left   The sore part is they are from 14th to 24th Reinfts that went so it does'nt seem fair
