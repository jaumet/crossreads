 there is a certain amount of vaniti . They go through , do their work at an easi go pace dure the day ( in the even ) In the even put their robe over them , walk stick in hand , they walk home in such a jaunti fashion that one would think they had ?nt a care in the world . Some of the nativ employ at the hospit have surpris one veri much in this respect . Mani time I have met them on the street and fail to recognis them until they had recognis me . Whilst seat in a tram car on my way to Cairo to-day a well-dress Arab sat down besid me . As he sat down he greet me with the salutation" How are you " ? with the emphasi on the you . I repli " Veri well thank you " . He then began chat away on a varieti of interest subject to which I listen or repli as the case may be with delight interest . After we had talk to-geth for some time , he rather startl me with the remark " Your not an Australian your either a Scotsman or an Irishman more Scotch than Irish , I think . " ? I was much amus at this remark . " Yes " I said , I am a Scotsman . " Ah " he said , the onli part that is Australian about you is your uniform" . This Arab could speak veri good English . He was a guid and some of these guid can speak quit a number of languag . I have had quit a number of similar experi like the abov and they all go to show that these peopl who come in contact with other nation can tell by one 's accent the countri to which one belong .
