<p>April 1916<br/>[Note in margin:] Saty Romani<br/>29th &ndash; do not, I don't think they will. Fancy we will advance first. Rumors of attacks at Ismailia &amp; other places at same time. No papers obtainable so have not had war news for some time. Yesterday we passed what evidently had been a hurriedly evacuated camp, tins, rubbish letters &amp; papers lying all round. Horse rails &amp; tank there also. Today our men paid it a visit &amp; collared all useful stuff. Our lot rather good at that game. Several up before the C.O. tomorrow for taking sand bags from defences. Serve &ndash; em right. Understand that 1000 niggers hard at it pushing railway out here at rate of mile a day. Would not be surprised but what Tommy General Wiggin or some such name &amp; his staff get <strike>public</strike> military medals &amp; D.S.Ms VCs etc. Court martial nearer the mark &amp; far more suitable. No one to contradict them<br/>[Note in margin:] Saty Romani<br/>29th &ndash; Orders received regarding hostile aeroplane if it appears in sight Some of New men to active service greatly perturbed over it &amp; believe that it will appear early in morning. Randall, 3 Soudanese 62 Gyppos &amp; 108 camels attached to us for future use. Expect our artillery will be with us in course of a week or so. Very cool in evening. Heavy dew in AM.<br/>30th &ndash; In charge of fatigue party from 4 AM parade. Sgts Cav &amp; Dental Sgts paraded. Got snaps of Romani Camp. Hd Qtrs got news of Gen'l Townsend surrendering with 3000 Tommies &amp; 6000 Indians. Only to be expected after about 5 month siege. Seems a pity he could not be relieved after fighting starvation so long. Other news was French regaining some ground at Verdun &amp; British successes in Belgium. Russia doing well. Suppose above successes mean a couple of yards or so. May be like this success (?)</p>
