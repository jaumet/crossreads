<p>France<br/>14th July  1916.</p>
<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>Had a bit of a change of scenery since I last wrote.  We are now right back out of the range and sound of the guns, for a week or two, and I can tell you it is a relief to be able to ease the strain for a while.  This continual "qui-vive-ness" we have been under for the last three months, would make you go bald in time.  We had some trials and tribulations getting here though and altogether we padded the hoof for over 50 miles, with a twelve hours train journey sandwiched in between.  As we had had no exercise for some time it played little Hamlet with us especially with our feet, but we managed to struggle along somehow.  At one stage of the March we pulled up for the night at one of these fine old French Chateaus, I used to read about in Charles Garvice's books (at any rate if it wasn't him it was Bill Shakespeare).  Had a beautiful wooded park all round it and carriage drives leading up from all directions.  The moat and remains of the old draw bridge are still existing though there is a modern touch given to the place, by the presence of a line of present day trenches running through the grounds.</p>
<p>France is looking beautiful just now, and all along the route we saw crops of wheat, barley, oats etc., all of which of course called for the opinions and admiration of the Amateur and Professional Cockies amongst us.  The crops are full of red poppies and cornflowers, which are no doubt very pretty, but can't be too good for the crops.</p>
<p>We are now billited in a pretty slow town, though a large one.  It has an interesting feature in some historical ruins of an old chateau and a Church of the 12th and 13th Centuries respectively.  The old place has gone to ruin absolutely, though we can still see that it has certainly been some size, and that they knew something about building in those days.  Also we can see the signs of an old system of defences which I suppose they used in those days, and the moat and draw bridge are again in evidence here.  The Church has been well looked after and is in fine condition.  Though it is of course Catholic we went to a very interesting Service here.  France takes a great pride in its Churches, and we have been in many beautiful ones, some of which have been ruined by the Germans.  One was shelled the day after we had seen it, and I believe is not now standing.</p>
<p>Have just got yours of the 21st May.  You should have had some of mine long before this.  They made it impossible for us to cable, otherwise I would of course have done so.  So you have got rid of G'dah Garage at last.  It must have been a bit of a white elephant.  Wonder what Charlie will take on when he gets back.  He'll buy a pair of bees and start a farm next.  Certainly hope he will be able to get out of the Light</p>
