<p>23.3.16 Thursday &amp; 24.3.16 Friday<br/>Two days of constant &amp; never ending rattle of Wagon Transport.<br/> I had the shock of my life to-day, who do you think walked in to see me.  Lieut C H Read, who came over on the Ballarat for the Bridging Train.<br/>He was full of news &amp; just as witty as ever.  It was simply lovely to hear him rattling on again in the same old manner.<br/>We were Lectured by the C.O. Train on our future duties in France &amp; after it was over I went up to the Palace to see Uncle Charlie.  I sat talking to him for 1 hour &amp; then the both of us went over to Heliopolis House &amp; had Coffee on the Piazza.  He expects to leave for Marseilles by next Sunday week.  We are now very busy in transporting the Hospital contents to the Station.</p>
