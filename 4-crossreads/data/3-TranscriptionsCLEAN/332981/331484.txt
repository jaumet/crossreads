Allenby, who had taken over command from General Sir Archibald Murray captured Gaza, and followed up his success by driving the Turks before him crowning his triumph with the entry into Jerusalem in December. Jericho was the next city to fall. This year's success began on September 18th. Breaking through the Turks right wing General Allenby carried out a swift flanking movement which resulted in the annihilation of the three Turkish Armies. Sweeping northwards Damascus was taken on October 1st and Alippo on October 26th.
