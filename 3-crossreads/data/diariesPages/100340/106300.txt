I was real anxious to get that letter of yours as every letter I got from aunty Laurel was always about what a lovely little baby you had I was longing to have a look at it, or at least at her photo. I suppose you are spoiling it too. Oh no, of course you wouldn't, neither would Vol. But as you say, I only hope it won't be long before I will be back again but still it doesn't look too much like it yet. I will be reclassified this week will then be sent back to France or put on a job here in England, all depends on what the quack says. I very nearly went west the first couple of days after my operation but I am real well again
