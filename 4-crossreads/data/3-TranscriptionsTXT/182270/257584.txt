Hot & dry. Tickle mustered
Wheelers Ewes to 4D Yards and we
marked them in the morning. Marked
69% on a shearing count, & put
them back in Wheelers. I went up
to Top paddock and lopped after
Tickle got a couple of draught horses
from the station to shift Darby.
Darby came over and fished up
the pump from Middle paddock
