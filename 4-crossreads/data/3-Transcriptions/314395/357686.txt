<p>as I am here by order of Div. Hqrs., there is a danger of having to remain the alotted span.  A few days ago I cabled asking you for &pound;20.  When I went to Paris, I overdrew in my paybook, and have only been able to draw &pound;1 during the last two months.  You told me once to ask you when I wanted money, and I have done so, but I don't feel quite easy about asking bluntly for such large amounts.  Still any less sum would hardly meet requirements.  I would like you to tell me when you write whether these demands inconvenience you greatly, and if you would prefer me to lower my standard of living to meet a more moderate sum, when I am on leave.  Many thanks for the parcel of tobacco, which arrived safely yesterday.  I am still using the pipe you sent me 3 Xmases ago, and so far, no one has passed any rude remarks about its aroma.</p>
