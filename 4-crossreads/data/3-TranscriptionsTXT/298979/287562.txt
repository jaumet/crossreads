 No man "Standing To" on that memorable night of 19th July 1916 will ever be likely to forget his experience. 
 The whole atmosphere seemed to be torn by the passage of thousands of missles screeching through it every second from the boom of the very heavy guns down to the "crack" of Rifle bullet. The air was filled at the one time with the screech of every one. The innumerable flares, signals, &amp; floating lights turned night into day.

Luckily none of those working came personally into touch with it.

 The men taking refuge in the "dug out" were in constant terror of being buried alive as the dug out was kept in a state of never ceasing rocking &amp; whenever a large shell burst close, the men inside with wide staring eyes, would fearfully watch the beams &amp; supports to see if they were about to fall bodily &amp; crush them.
