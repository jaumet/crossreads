Aberlour
We left Carron at about 6.30 after meeting Audreys comrades ? ?land girls" in smocks, leggings breeches. Arriving at Aberlour ? a small stone village ? we found our arrival to be the chief excitement of the place. Went along to the local barber's with the Colonel and then went for a walk along the village streets. All the shops bore Scotch names ? Grant MacPherson, Thomson, Gordon c. We had dinner and absorbed a number of w. s's and then went for a long walk along side the broad river Spey with its tributaries with their waters all black and peat stained. There were a few fishermen plying the rod but not getting much result. As we walked along heavy rain commenced and was continuing after our return going to bed.
