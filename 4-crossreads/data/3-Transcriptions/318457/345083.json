<p>[Transcriber's note:<br/>Vivian Agincourt Spence Little joined the RAN as a chaplain on 17 December 1912. This diary which begins on 29 July 1914 and ends on Thursday 5th November 1914 describes activities of HMAS Sydney largely around the islands of Papua New Guinea, New Britain and Fiji.  It includes a report on the first Australian men to die in WW1(Surgeon Pockley and Williams A.B.- page 20) and some interesting and very civil encounters between the Australian troops and the Germans living and operating wireless stations in the area at the time e.g. page 11 and the still unexplained loss of submarine AE1, with all on board.  The diary ends with the sailing of a convoy of 36 ships to Aden escorted by Minotaur, Melbourne, and Sydney.  This preceded the Battle of Cocos in which the Emden was involved]</p>
