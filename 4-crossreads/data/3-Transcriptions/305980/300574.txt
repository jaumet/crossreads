<p>25: Xmas Day!!  Rain pouring through the bivvies, but we had heaps of good things, thanks to the parcels &amp; feel as happy as schoolkids.  Had tongues, plum pudding, cakes &amp; sweets for lunch, finishing off with a cigar.  Enjoyed it thoroughly despite being wet through &amp; not a dry blanket in the camp.  Went to bed at 7 p.m., getting up to do my shift on horse piquet from 10 to 12.30 p.m.  Boys had a good issue of wine &amp; had a fine time, being wet inside &amp; outside.</p>
<p>26:  Left Ayumkarra in pouring rain at 9 a.m. riding through a sea of mud to Ezdud, where we camped on the sand.  The whole Division is here, as it was impossible to convey rations to our previous camp owing to the state of the country.  Have a good camp, plenty of water &amp; canteens in the vicinity.</p>
<p>31:  Rain has now ceased &amp; weather is glorious.  Having a good spell, though we get a lot of fatigue work to-day.  This close another year &amp; hope it is my last Xmas on active service.</p>
