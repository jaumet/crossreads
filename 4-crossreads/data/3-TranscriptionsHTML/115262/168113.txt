<p>Wednesday 12 December 1917.</p>
<p><s>In a &quot;standing&quot; camp as it is termed. A&nbsp;few parades today</s></p>
<p>Still in bivouac.</p>
<p>Published that 10,500 prisoners were taken on this front during November. Heard news of British reverse in France and Italian surrender &amp; reverse on Italian front.&nbsp;</p>
