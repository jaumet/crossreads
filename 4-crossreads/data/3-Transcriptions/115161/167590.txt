<p>I tripped or caught my foot in some broken &quot;duckboard&quot;, and fell, hoped that on rising I should discover that I had at least sprained an ankle or broken a leg, but the fates I imagined were against me, nothing happened. I still continued to feel well and strong, and quite able to carry on the good work. How I envied those fellows who were being wounded not very badly, but just enough to get them to &quot;Blighty&quot;. But I, wish as I would, always bobbed up bright and smiling, and do what I might, nothing happened to get me out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; They say that everyone has some form of madness, my special lunacy took the form of cold water. I must have cold&nbsp;water.

Yes! I&#39;m afraid as a drink by itself, water is a &quot;wash-out&quot;. For cleansing artlcles, for garden purposes, or for travelling on, water is good.
