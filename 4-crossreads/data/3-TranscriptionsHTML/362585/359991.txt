<p>My dear Mrs. Ferguson,</p>
<p>Ginger &amp; Sox very welcome indeed.  Thank you so much.  The ginger was excellent.  I would like all its friends sent over as reinforcements from time to time.  Each draft will be duly acknowledged.</p>
<p>I have been having a very busy time writing letters to all the people whose letters have been piling up here while I was away.</p>
<p>I have conscientiously cut out all the parts that have to be answered and have burnt the rest.  I have great intentions but the trouble is that my present quarters are so comfortable that everyone comes in for a yarn and a smoke &amp; the letters must wait.</p>
<p>Am writing to Dorothy tonight if not interrupted.</p>
<p>Best love to all.</p>
<p>Affectionately yours<br/>C.R.Lucas</p>
