which all seem to be built on the hills.There was a very motly crowd there, including soldiers from all over the world.The Zouaves Turcis are very fierce looking fellows the Frenchman themselves do not look too gentle.It is full of vice as can be on a par with Cairo, if not worse.It abounds with Cafes Boulevardes. Tram Service very good. We were all given a good time by the residents, who seem to look up to the Australians.Wherever we went we would hear, Australia Good"We finished up by missing the last tram having to walk about 5 miles.Today we load our train start on a 3 days train trip which will be very interesting as it is a trip from North South to South North of France.There is a big prison for Germans in the vicinity they look what the papers say s of them.On the whole I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Marseilles.
