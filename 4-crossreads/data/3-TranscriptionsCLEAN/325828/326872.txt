  
 There was some mail handed out this morning & our hopes went up expecting to hear but in vain.  It is too early yet, I suppose to hear from you.  No word of any kind through yet as to our future movements, & am fully expecting to put in Christmas Day 1915 among the sand, natives & flies of Egypt. There is a branch of the Y.M.C.A. here & it is doing splendid work among the soldiers in the matter of hunting up missing soldiers, cables & letters. There is no change at all in the weather & we will soon be on to our shortest day. Must close now with fond love to all at home & yourself, Ever your loving son, Leo.
