<p>Monday 1 January</p>
<p>Christmas Comforts from the Sydney A.M.C. Comforts Depot and from the War Chest Funds were distributed today.  They consisted of a parcel for each man and rich additions to the regular menu, Plum Puddings included.  In the evening "The Nightbirds" gave us an amusing entertainment in the large recreation tents.  It was such a great success that the Colonel wishes these men to extend the first half of the Program and give a night's Entertainment to the troops of the 5th Division when they come back to this district shortly.</p>
