<p>Ma'adi Egypt stamp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recd <strike>afternoon</strike> 26.2.16<br/>17th Jany 1916</p>
<p>My dearest Mother,<br/>I must thank you very much for your very welcome letter of the 12th December to hand to-night.  Although this is written on Ma'adi paper we left there on Saturday night for [word obliterated by censor] where we are at present camped I must also thank you, Mother dear, for a pair of sox that reached me here on Sunday night (16th Jan)  They were addressed in your writing, &amp; I will appreciate them very much.  By to-night's mail I also received a letter from Uncle Jez at Lord Howe<br/>We landed out here about 7 o'clock on Saturday night.  The next day we were hard at it all day putting down new horse line, erecting tents &amp; straightening up things in general.  It was one of the hardest days I've put in for a good while &amp; I was very thankful when it was bed-time.  We have had cold weather here since we got down here &amp; last night we had some rain.  The cold winds catch us as we are camped on the top of a slope.<br/>I do hope that Father is better for the sea trip &amp; change that he had, for it is a hard time for him at present.<br/>In the letter from Uncle Jez he talks about coming to Sydney &amp; seeing if he can get over the age difficulty &amp; enlisting<br/>This leaves me in splendid health &amp; I sincerely trust <strike>you</strike> it will find you the same.<br/>Father may remember Parkinson (I think his Father was in the Department) who used to be in the 6th class with Clem Chapman Southee, &amp; the others.  He is here as Captain, but he doesn't remember</p>
