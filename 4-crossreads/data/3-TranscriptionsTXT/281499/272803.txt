see the gaping hole it made in the ground & the earth is thrown up all around like a small mountain the whole concern is shaped like a basin & is easily 70 feet deep, & from one place on it we have a bonzer "observation post" & yesterday they could see hundreds of German's at work behind the lines, of course they never got shelled.  As we were coming across some open ground this morning taking a short cut for it was not light enough for the Germans to see us, we saw hundreds of partridges & some beautiful pheasants, they are fine big birds, this war is giving the wild life around the war affected area a good chance to breed for the place is rapidly growing wild & young trees are springing up all over the place & scrub & long grass
