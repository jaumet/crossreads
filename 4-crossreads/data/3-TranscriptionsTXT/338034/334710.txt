Jan 20th :- the 1st Regt. moved out of El Arish at * A.M. to do escort duty & guard duty to a party of engineers camped 8 miles East of El Arish at a place named Bir el Burj.Jan 23rd :-  When we left El Arish we expected to be away only 48 hours, & consequently we brought only a couple of blankets & no tents or oilsheets. It rained heavily last night & we received a good soaking. It now appears that we are to be out here for a week or ten days, & rumour has it that when we return we are to receive a few days leave.
