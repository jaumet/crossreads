<p>30/4/17<br/>Favreuil<br/>flushing the East as the 21st passed through us and clung closely to the creeping barrage (now horses. Away to the right and connecting with us we could see the 5th Bde operating. After  the 21st had carried out their phase we formed up and marched in. A contact 'plane arrived just after the operation was complete. Rode back through the ruins of Sapignies and had a hard hand gallop across country to a fine old tree that is our landmark. A squadron of 6 aeroplanes humming off overhead on some mission. Very mild and bracing this early morning. Lost no time in slipping into bed on arriving back at Camp and slept until noon when rose shaved &amp; dined. The Brig (Gellibrand) rang up and told the C.O. to be ready to move up with the unit tonight but I don't think we are likely to go now until tomorrow. The last two days have been ominously quiet on the front &ndash; probably both reserving shells.</p>
