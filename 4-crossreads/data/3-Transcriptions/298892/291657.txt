<p>Winter has now set in with a vengeance and the cold is excruciating. It is simply impossible to keep one's feet warm and the men suffer a good deal from them - numbers having congested feet and chilblains. Everyone is issued with whale oil and a frequent application of this with plenty of elbow grease prevents trench feet but does not prevent my feet from freezing all day. I dread putting on my boots in the morning as they immediately freeze my feet and they remain numb until I thaw them out at night with the whale oil. If one could only get boots composed of something warmer than leather it would give one's feet a chance.<br/>Australia will be quite good enough for me after the war. If I do any more travelling round I will take care that it is to some place within the tropics.</p>
