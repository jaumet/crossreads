<p>7 Rec'd another letter from England dated May 23nd. Another Aust came in last night. Believe the 20 Batt was cut up a bit by Artillery fire. Booked for the Base &amp; expect to leave here tomorrow afternoon, possibly for Etaple.<br/>Cold &amp; showery all day, gets on a fellows nerves. Believe there was Church but I was busy watching the promenaders and admiring the ladies. Had a hot-cold shower just the thing to buck a fellow up. [in margin] Sunday</p>
<p>8 Leaving here today, I am not sorry either. Will do a chap good to get out &amp; stretch his legs. Tommy togs dished out to me, not a bad fit, but will be pleased to get our own at Base. Left Hosp at 2.30 per a 6 seater Car for the Base &amp; arrived shortly after. Sleeping in bell tents on a wooden floor. Bit different to Hosp</p>
