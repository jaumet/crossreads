<p>29th 9.'18, Sunday<br/>My &frac12; day.  2 p.m. catch train at Manchiet, arrive Marg. 2.30, native villages, date cutting, filth &amp; everything interesting to be found here.  One imp lost in admiration of the gold cap on my tooth tries to touch it with her dirty little finger.  A boy astride a donk. asks Sister Shaw to buy it for L.E. 20, "too dear", "no sister not, as she is pregnant &ndash; another one inside".<br/>4 p.m. tea under date palms with the afternoon sun shining palely through high waving corn leaves, most beautiful green shade.  Train 5 p.m. to Cairo, All Saints 6 p.m., thanksgiving service for our victories on this front, Hymn, Pilgrims of the night, Lesson, Judge not, condemn not.<br/>Following on our little talk under the palms one feels very guilty.  S. Shaw tells me Miss G. has a high opinion of me, "good nurse &amp; a good organiser" &amp; say how hard her life was a first with us all against her.  Baket [basket ?] falls at church door, bots. &amp; cups scatter in every direction, great laughter.</p>
