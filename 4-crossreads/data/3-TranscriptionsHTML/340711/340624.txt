<p>Friday, 14.<br/>B. Sub tip top. Though the responsibility is now over, I feel the reaction of the old Sub. However, in a few days I will be fit and the neuralgia will disappear. Stables and exercising horses as usual. Still wet---slush, spongy and sloppy everywhere. Boots wet through.</p>
<p>Saturday, 15.<br/>Harness cleaning---holiday afternoon.</p>
<p>Sunday, 16.<br/>Work as usual. Wet as usual.</p>
<p>Monday, 17.<br/>Wet and sloppy underground and still raining. The humpies are damnably stuffy and evil smelling. Each day in spite of the weather we exercise the horses. I am to take Horse Picquet tonight and sleep in the saddlery barn. It is a cruel night. Hay nets to be untied filled, tied on again and then untied again.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 18.<br/>Slept well and feeling fit this morning. Left for Brigade Headquarters at 7.30 and arrived there at 8.pm. Had to wait a couple of hours. Went to the La Petite Chaumi&egrave;re de Lerouge in the evening.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 19.<br/>Took a wagon out to 18th. Battery in afternoon. Spent evening at La Petite Chaumi&egrave;re de Lerouge.</p>
<p>Thursday, 20.<br/>Still wet. Went with Mr Lewis to Bailleul---and managed to do a bit of shopping. He owes me 6 &frac12; francs for a lamp for the Officers' Mess.</p>
<p>Friday, 21. (Good Friday)<br/>No different to any other day as far as our work is concerned.</p>
