<p>1918<br/>Sat. 13 Apl.<br/>Whitworth of the Sherwood Forresters, and his pilot are in our barrack.<br/>(The two flying chaps who got 10 years in a fortress for dropping propaganda papers over the German trenches.   They did 4 months.)   Ordered to prepare to leave today for the officer's camp at Furstenberg in Mecklenburg.</p>
<p>Rotten luck as Bob &amp; the crowd are at Heidelberg, I believe.</p>
<p>50 of us assembled in the mess-room at 10 a.m., including 3 Lt. Colonels (Smith;  and Sloggelt &amp; Bury of the K.R.R.), 1 Major, a few Captains (including Newstead and Wallace of the West Yorks.), some R.N.D. lieut., Clarke, (a Canadian pilot) and other assorted one and two-pippers.</p>
<p>We marched out through the double lines of barbed wire into the town;  past the "Europaischer" and the Stadt Garten (now in full leaf &amp; looking beautiful) to the Bahnhof, where the party was assigned two first-class carriages.</p>
