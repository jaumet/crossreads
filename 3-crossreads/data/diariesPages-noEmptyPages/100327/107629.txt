Up and into full fighting kit (an operation taking 30 seconds) at 0330. All cooks batmen c turned out. RSM Pioneers at ammun. reserve everyone took post. At 0400 on signal the demonstration took place, two mines exploded near Crater and shook the whole earth. Our rifle fire was not heavy enough in volume to draw much from them but when the Turks were all standing to and their trenches full our artillery suddenly opened. 
The big shells bursting on crowded trenches must have killed wounded a fair number. Only a couple in reply from them.
Sounds of intermittent cannonade from direction of the Narrows and also from towards Cape Hellas. All quiet here 0500 except for the usual cracking sound of bullets landing and the reverberation of others down Wire Gully
Petrass returned from Cape Hellas Imbros last night with canteen stores. Sending Hogarth with 4 men to bring them up at 1000 this morning ? mules ordered for then Large orders cleared place right out and our 32 was cut down to 18. 24th 400 down to 25. Fresh stocks arriving so our big order should go through without trouble. Getting contents of boxes so things may be bought by the box in future. Rough trip over there
