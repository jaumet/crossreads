  
 As I declared I would, I managed to carry all my clothes etc with me to Kantara, but now I am really travelling light as I left everything there except one blanket, one shirt,  &  3 prs of socks. Last night I had a severe shock, I dined off some boiled meat, both cold  &  greasy,  &  found to me horror  &  astonishment that I was enjoying it immensely! Truly its time I returned to civilisation.
