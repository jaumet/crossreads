They did everything possible to give me a good time. I went with Mr. G. junior to Bibby's Printing works. and would have visited several other branches and factories belonging to the same firm had there been time. Mr. G. Senior took me through Part of the city and pointed out some of the Principal buildings, and told me about them. but as time was limited it was a rush through. on Monday morning we went across to New Brighton, and had a look round. There is a lovely Promenade there, and the Tower one of the tallest in England is about 680 feet high, it was a miserable morning, cold and windy and a light misty rain falling. The river was shut out from view by the mist, and the Shipping could just be seen, here and there, through it we just walked round then back to the Tin shop. I saw Part of the docks only Part. There are 14 miles of them.
