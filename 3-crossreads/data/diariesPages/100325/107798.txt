11. Turned out guard, one sentry on No 8 post behaved in a most extraordinary manner. As I approached he appeared to be sitting down. He saluted and then turned three somersaults and landed with his rifle bayonet almost through a tent. He got up groaning and said he was ill owing "a little ale" he had before coming on guard" Smelt his breath which was alright and left him moving briskly on his beat. Sent officer of the Guard back to relieve him and put him in guard tent under observation. Field officer reported No 6 lying down on his beat away from his rifle and put him under arrest. He said he was lying down with his ear to the ground listening. Am satisfied that some beer must have been going round, probably taken on in water bottles
Turned in at midnight
