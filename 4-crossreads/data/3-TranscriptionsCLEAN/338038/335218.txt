  
 2nd Lieutenant. 
 Mails seem to have been hung up somewhere. Your letters of Jany 10th being the last received here, although I hear a big mail is expected in Camp tomorrow. Havent heard from Exeter for Lord knows how long. 
 I expect the summer will be practically over when this reaches you. It must have been a frightfully trying one and I do    you  hope that     both of  you are not feeling any ill effects. Had a letter from Mr Broughton by same mail as brought your last & was surprised to hear Mr Trebeck Snr had retired from the Firm. 
 Those photos I sent by last mail. One is labelled    your  for yourselves, and I would like Mrs Forsyth to have one & also Mr Broughton. I posted them altogether to save packing.
