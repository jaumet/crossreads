out on flag work. The dashing crowd of young bloods are going round the ring in great style when suddenly one horse shoots out of the ring and heads for the park lake. Probably he's only taken a fancy for a drink, but the rider always seems to be a pessimist. First he loses cap, whip & gloves. Then he begins a curious sort of see-saw motion, pulls himself over the horse's head by means of the reins & falls back with a heavy, hopeless thud; the motion is repeated until the dazed animal gets mad & starts to do the Grand National round the park. In rear, strung out over abt. a mile & a half of turf, comes a string of yelling grooms, corporals, riding instructors and pals of the steeple-chasing sub. Always he remains a pessimist, and failing overhaul by his pursuers,
He's a dirty [lost?] hound at best. [written in margin]
