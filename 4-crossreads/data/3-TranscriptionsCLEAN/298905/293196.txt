  
 Afterwards I got into Cheapside & bought 2 picture albums one for home & the other for Aunt Amy posted & got them away, & came down per medium of a bus & had tea, I think I will go to the Adelphi tonight & see what she is like I heard to night that there are a lot of Australians at Salisbury Plains, they reckon they came from Egypt. 14th. Last night I was talking to Lady Murray & she asked me if I would care for a ride in her car as far as Picadilly, so away I went she is a real nice lady her husband was wounded the day before Kut fell & is now in India, she takes a great interest in Peel House & spends nearly all her time
