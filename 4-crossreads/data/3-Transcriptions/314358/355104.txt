<p>8<br/>ready next morning</p>
<p>We moved as it were beneath the hem of nights fast fleeting folds, through the breathing silence of a vast spread camp, were sleep with her mysterious spell held life as if by the seal of death.</p>
<p>This marching out of [indecipherable] soldiers before the dawn is like the first few lines of a wonderful poem which is often in my mind but can never be written in words.</p>
<p>Someday there will be a master who will become immortal as the creator of the poem, but not in words.</p>
<p>It must be my music<br/>Then you will have a complete volume of three chapters<br/>"The dawn march"<br/>"The Marsellees" (dont mind spelling)<br/>"The Dead march in Gaul"</p>
<p>So often have i been a moving unit of the dawn march. The heavy black of the moving mass<br/>The spectre like courageous next to you</p>
<p>The measured tread of feet the sound of creaking harness, click of metal. Curse or jest of soldier, and the haunting spirit of courageouship</p>
