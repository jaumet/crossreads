 His duty nobly done. [Photograph] 
 In proud and loving memory of My dear nephew Trooper William Victor Weaber Died of wounds in Egypt June 7th., 1918. Aged 37 years 
 No pen can write no tongue can tell What he went through when he lay ill; To God alone his pains were known, He loved him best and took him home. 
 There are griefs that cannot find comfort And wounds that cannot be healed, There are sorrows so deep in our hearts That cannot be half revealed. 
 Often my thoughts do wander To a grave so dear to me, Where a noble hero true and brave, Peacefully sleeps in a soldier's grave. 
 Deeply Mourned. &ndash; Inserted by his loving parents.
