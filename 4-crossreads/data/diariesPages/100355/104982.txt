deep in crops clover the hillsides studded with rich green crops are covered with flowers. We saw little of Boulogne during our march to the rest camp. The quays at the station have the usual odour of a French sea port, the streets such as Place de Capuchins are narrow but rather clean. One building of rather antique appearance, is enclosed in an envelope of ancient trees judging by its size shape is evidently the citadel. 
Before it is the statue of one Mariette evidently an antiquarian of some repute.
