<p>Monday 4th Nov.<br/>The regt. has gone further to Hell now, N.C.O's are throwing in stripes to transfer and Officers are leaving, it is just one life of discontent.</p>
<p>Teusday 5th Nov.<br/>My mare is in great nick and every morning the Farrier Sergt. and I go for a gallop, his pony is a clinker, he beat me two mornings running over a sprint of two furlongs.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6th<br/>Zig my mare beat Tommy badly this morning over a longer distance, the latter I found out is only smart away whilst mine does not get going until she has had a couple of furlongs.</p>
<p>Thursday 7th Dec.<br/>Rode over to the regt. on business, called at Duntroon outpost on way in, they have arranged for a six days sports carnival for Xmas week, they were practicing for mounted events whilst I was there.  Just as I was leaving the Adjt. called me in to show me a letter from the A.D.M.S. asking was my case a genuine one.  I have to take evidence over to-morrow.</p>
<p>Friday 8th Dec.<br/>Rode to regt. with evidence, sent it to orderly room, had a trial sports meeting</p>
