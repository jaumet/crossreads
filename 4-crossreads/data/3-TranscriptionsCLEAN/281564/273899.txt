 Monday 26th Oct Hoisted up the wireless pole. 
 Tuesday 27th Oct Went on outpost at the cross roads for a week with Cpl Clancy, Wakley, Hynes, Drummond, Tonkin & Steer ("Dags" for short) The post is in a very beautiful spot where the road runs through a narrow fringe of cocoanut palms lying between a belt of massed swamp undergrowth & the waters of the haven. On the other side are the many tinted stretches of the virgin forest & arising into the mysterious clouds which ever hang their poisonous folds about them, are the blue coast ranges - the "on top" of the long shore Kanaka. 
 The spot though beautiful could by no means be called healthy for the waters of the swamp teem with mosquitoes which nightly ( & daily) terrorise the inmates
