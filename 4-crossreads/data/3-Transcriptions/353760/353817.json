<p>January 12, 13<br/>92.<br/>Today to the Dispensary, with Malcolm Miller, Joe Rout:  from him hear of Harley Lambert's and Hughies being killed early in the Menin Road stunting of Oct.</p>
<p>93.<br/>A 2nd Batt. chap in to D.R. again tonight yarning of stunts and war, a fine type, and a service man.  Tells of little episodes of the day in a front-line trenches, in advanced posts and pill-boxes.  His telling full of rich sudden phrases, and full of the evidence of a good nature, &amp; a full liver.  He one of the bearers of the wounded of bombs, at Belgian Battery Corner last Oct., speaks of the way all pulled so well together, and the well getting away of all knocked early in the night.</p>
<p>January 13<br/>93.<br/>Five years ago &ndash; Jan. 13, 1913, full of a woundering and good intentions, I started the first year of articles to Lindsay Thompson.  Five years! &ndash; and in those years ? &ndash; well my taste in pictures, books and peoples has certainly progressed, but how much nearer am I towards the set out for goal! &ndash; how much nearer towards the earning of the name of Architect.  All I possess &ndash; a slight smattering of the styles and building manners, a happy appreciation of Gothic and the Classic schools &ndash; and a facination towards the exotic and bizarre &ndash; the Saracenes and Byzantine.</p>
<p>Here is my desire &ndash; to partnership with Vin D. &ndash; or perhaps with Court:  though with Vin preferably, then to build up a connection and so individually designing all works, that a certain amount of specialising could be gone in for &ndash; in good Domestick and Civick.  Theatrical Art strangely attracts me, the designing of plays and their staging offers a world for such exotic magnificence as is nowhere else possible:  and the modern stage &ndash; where supreme &ndash; almost Japanese simplicity is not aimed at &ndash; seems more and more to aspire towards in most voluptuous [indecipherable].  Two other Arts attract, and there'll be hobbyising there if the Gods allow, Sculpture and Drawing.</p>
<p>For the present, Dressings and a close following of war.</p>
