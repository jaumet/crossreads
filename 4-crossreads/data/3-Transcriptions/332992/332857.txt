<p>Wednesday March 28.1917<br/>A fine morning after a cold night.  The wind is gone down.<br/>I have got a bad cold with a headache yesterday &amp; last night, but it is a little better to day.  I think it was caused through a chill.  There is a big draught comes in through the corner &amp; through a hole in the floor when the wind is from the East.  I spread a carpet over it, to close the hole.  My temperature was very high 98.6 last night &amp; 99 this morning.  I was given some medicine &amp; felt alright this afternoon.<br/>To day I am 1 year in the army.  There is very little war news in Mondays papers to hand.  Artillery has been active on both sides in the neighbourhood of Ypres, and the enemy have been driven out of Beaumetz.  Our troops have occupied Roisel, 7 miles east of Peronne.<br/>There are a lot of enemy planes about today.  A dud fell not very far from this hospital before dinner.  It was probably a shell from some of our own antiair craft guns.</p>
