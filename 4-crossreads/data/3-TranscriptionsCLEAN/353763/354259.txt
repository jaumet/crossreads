  
 The scene on the pier at 6 pm is most animated - officers rejoining their ships - liberty men going off - Native Fijians & Samoans leaving the ships after their day's work  -  Women & children galore  -  Everyone jolly & chirpy & in the highest of spirits laughing & talking & jesting  -  Never has Suva had so many boats in its small harbor  -  There are 20 big ships in & this means a good deal of trade for little Suva  -  I played bridge in the eveg & to my bunk in the Companion way about 11 pm  - 
 I don't fancy any move will be made about our boat at present - bad as she is - we are here - alive & fit & the Admiral wont shift us & all our stores while we can manage  -  After all we got to Rabaul & to Suva - a bit leg weary - but we got there  -  The engineers are cleaning up boiler & fittings  -  A lot of our chaps would like to go back to Sydney & get out of the job &
