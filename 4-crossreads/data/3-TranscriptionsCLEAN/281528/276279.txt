  
 3/4/18 - Berthen It is a fine chapel, modern and the whole place is said to be largely supported by English money.  The original place was erected in 1088 and renovated 1630 and after.  Had a drink with the Dr. in their mess and then rode back to Berthen.  The re-action after a month's hard trench work is on the men and a little beer knocks them over.  About m.n. received word that L/ Cpl. Lee had died in the 22nd Corps Guard Room.  This man was well known in Australia as comedian for Branscombe's "Dandies".  Lately he has been getting drunk a lot & generally going to the pack.  Possibly killed in a brawl but the doctor can see no injury.
