This morning this had to be removed. It was a ticklish job, but Sister Sharpe was as gentle as a lamb & it was soon over. They took the Serg. Maj. away for his operation & afterwards took him to another ward. He went crook about it, too.

What a good long letter I’ll be able to write to B.E. when I get over. Our chaps continue to give Fritz Hell, which is certainly good news. And they are holding all the ground they took. -- About 1.30 a.m. on
