 Becourt Wood 30/1/17 The coldest night ever experienced. Breath condensed on blankets and formed lumps of ice. Hairbrush, sponge, bread all frozen hard as wood. Morning parade close order drill with plenty of doubling and an inspection of packs to see that contents are reduced within field service limits. Four huts full of Lewis gunners, bombers with Slater, and Cull and his raiders hard at work carrying out practice raids. Altogether a busy scene. Snow commenced to fall thick in large white flakes from an ink black sky and the frozen ground became powdered all over again with whiteness. In the afternoon put in some good work at gas drill and oiling the woodwork of the rifles. Having a couple of subalterns in every night for tea and am indeed lucky in having such a good lot of officers. All the men of two companies were closely examined by the doctor tonight. Arranged for dumping of packs tomorrow and also for foot inspection and rubbing. A bright night with the snow all over the scene. General Gellibrand returned today. A cosy hut and a pleasant quiet night.
