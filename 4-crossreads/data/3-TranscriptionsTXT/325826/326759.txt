He said too that he would try & drop Wal a note & keep in touch with him & home.Then a post-script at the end asked me to inform you of his whereabouts because all outward Australian mails are were blocked.  He added that from La Valentine Camp, about 10 miles out of Marseilles.  They called at Toulon en route just as Rid did.  That was not dated, but the post-card from La Valentine was dated April 1st.  He says "Am keeping in splendid health, this climate is just lovely after Egypt.  Saw Rid at Marseilles for about 5 minutes; he was looking well, but I couldn't stay long.  Have sent Father- but very uncertain whether he will ever get it.  Am feeling tip-top, hope you are &c"  He had unintentionally omitted to say what he had sent, whether it was a letter or a cable, but I should think the latter; I hope indeed you did get it Father dear!  He certainly seems to be enjoying himself & I am so glad.  I'm glad too that he saw Rid, you know it was their first meeting since last July in Sydney.     That I think is really all the news I have for you and I shall be only too glad if it is all stale to you because of having heard from the boys themselves.It is a couple of days over the week since I heard from Rid, that letter written before their arrival & just telling of the voyage, so that that means the latest news I have had of him is really more than a fortnight old.  It is not his fault for he writes very frequently, almost every day, and I can only think that the military are holding back the mails- for some good purpose no doubt.  How Leo's came through I cannot think, he must have smuggled them through somehow: they were stamped & had been posted in a post-office, not sent On Service.   The day before-
