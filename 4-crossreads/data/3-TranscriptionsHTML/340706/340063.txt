<p>myself &amp; in succession I am besieged by about 30 young girls at least some are young, Their size habits, beauty &amp; application of paint &amp; powder all vary &amp; their requests are never the same Sometimes it is a cigarettes that is needed &amp; sometimes a flower or a drink &amp; then the inevitable question. But there is no annoyance in a refusal &amp; no complaint for wasting time.</p>
<p>There is nothing repellant like the same class of English girl. It is their business &amp; while one pities their choice one does not feel disgusted with these votaries of Love or Lust.</p>
<p>While waiting for Doc I met Jessie Alosi an acquaintance of my friend &amp; she took me in behind the now closing scenes of the Casino, &amp; a rare sight it was to see these girl &ndash; women in age &amp; intellect but romping &amp; skylarking like a lot of schoolgirl. Truly the temperament of the French is hard to grasp.</p>
<p>I wait until midnight for the Doc &amp; many a [Montmatroise] endeavours to entice me from my tryst. However as Doc does not come I go home to the hotel where I am staying tonight Hotel Mondain 44 Rue Pigalle &amp; am so tired that I do not get up till 11 am though I have to meet Dr at 11 am</p>
