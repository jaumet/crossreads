<p>1919<br/>May 30<br/>In the morning I went for a trip to Kew Gardens.  I was fairly tired so did not go far but lay down on the grass.  The gardens were very fine &ndash; after the style of our Botanical Gardens, but I dont know what space they covered.  I was not particularly impressed by a big fernhouse that I went through, because many of the plants that were under cover, grow outside in our Gardens.  Came back to London for dinner<br/>[Four photograph of Kew Gardens]</p>
