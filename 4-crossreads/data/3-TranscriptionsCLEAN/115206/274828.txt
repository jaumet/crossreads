September 1918.Sunday 15
In Reserve. HebecourtWeather glorious. A beautiful spring day. Fritz planes across during the morning. Rumor, we are moving again tomorrow.Played 53rd football - lost.Heard that Tom Main (wounded at Barleaux) had died of wounds  - correct.Very sorry to hear of this - he was one of the very best. Received letter from pal Doug was simply delighted to get it. Seems ages since his previous one arrived. Issue of a chest comforter.
