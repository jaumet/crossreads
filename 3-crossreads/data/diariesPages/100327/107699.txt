to Field Cashier and drew 5 on my paybook. Printing section and mechanical workshops in stone buildings. Returning got warm with walking and found being out of doors quite enjoyable. Four funnelled cruiser came round here again from her shelter on the other side of the island. She narrowly escaped going on the rocks the other night over here. 
The heights of Gallipoli viewed from here showed up white with snow in the sunlight. Sea very much calmer today. Rumours of heavy shelling and casualties at Anzac also talk of an attack on Lone Pine which I don't believe. Panaghia party returned padre to hospital with jaundice. At night the monitor alongside stranded ship searchlights going and gangs at work lightening her pumping out.
Two villages here put out of bounds owing to smallpox. Turned in 2100 slept well

Slept on till 0900 fine clear sunny morning. Aeroplanes very pretty rising and alighting. Some went back to Anzac today without their goods, wired Bde for instructions. Received reply Wait for usual boatservice. Don't forget our commissions ! (A bottle of whisky a "gorblime" cap) Got some books c from Adjutant and sat in sun reading. Went for a walk up past my Army Headquarters and climbed hill in rear. Could look right across island surrounded by sea. Water calm and Anzac easily picked out by the shipping there. Further south Achi Baba looking blue peaceful not at all like the bloodstained hill it is. Helles further round beyond Asia(minor) also a seat of war
