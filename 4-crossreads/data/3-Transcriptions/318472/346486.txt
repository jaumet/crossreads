<p>18 September 1918<br/>Wednesday<br/>Making good progress with fair weather and a smooth sea Nothing of importance to note. No war news. In sight of the coast all day.</p>
<p>1918 September 19<br/>Thursday<br/>Passed Cape Otway about 8.30 A.M. Entered Port Phillip Heads about 3 P.M. Anchored near Port Melbourne about 6.30 P.M. Excitement seems to be running right through boat. It is a fine homely sight to see the numerous lights along the foreshore of a house. Port once more &amp; a relief to know that we are at our sea journeys end.</p>
