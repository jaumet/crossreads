<p>We all anticipate trouble with the night. Enemy <strike>plains</strike> planes hover round and observers in enemy balloons have the advantage of the clear bright weather.<br/>The last few mornings, the rising moisture is not so dense, the ground haze is diminishing and we are now coming into the season when every care and precaution has to be used. Any activity, any regular movements such as working parties going to and fro, can be seen and we have every reason to expect trouble anytime.<br/>After sunset all is quiet. This we note with some anxiety.<br/>The silence prevails till 9 p.m., then our <strike>queit</strike> quiet strip of country becomes uninhabitable.<br/>Many gas shells explode within a dangerous distance of our dug-outs. We get into our helmets and not a second before time, for when examining shell marks next morning find that one of these gas carriers fell within a few feet of our home. Barrage becomes more intense and our sergeant orders us to beat a hasty retreat to safe ground.</p>
