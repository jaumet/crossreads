<p>22 May 1918 Wednesday<br/>Had a Bath &amp; lunch with my old friend the Military Governor of Bethlehem.<br/>Then attended a Municipal Council meeting [indecipherable], Bedouins etc: in national dress, the President an old rogue &amp; the Scribe with one eye, Books all "cooked," but very neatly ruled &amp; covered with big seals- written in Arabic, commencing at back of book &amp; like shorthand [indecipherable].  The trouble was Turkish money had been accepted by Municipality in  payment of Rates, Taxes after proclamation that Turks notes were not legal tender-  Village was swept &amp; we sat in a circle of heavily upholstered chairs full of Fleas- A Gendarme in old Turkish Uniform kept order- Coffee &amp; Cigarettes- all the time.</p>
