<p>Still in the front line very tired but going strong &ndash; have not had a wash for a week. Still all in the game. Our men are always at their best when the pinch comes &ndash; but these pinches make a man old &amp; reduce his Tummy some. Off again at dark on a counter march of 12 miles &ndash; like a game of Chess, interesting if not so damnable sleepy. The whole landscape rises &amp; falls in front of a man, he sleeps on his horse odd moments. Still this is soldiering.</p>
