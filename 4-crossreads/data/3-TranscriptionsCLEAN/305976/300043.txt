  
 Wednesday Sept 18 We hear the big stunt is about to commence. This camp is closing up & every available man is going down to the valley for what we hope the final smash. Excitement is running high. I have enjoyed myself here. It has been so quiet & such a change to be away from Horses for a while. Have heard we will all be rejoining our various units to morrow. We heard a heavy bombardment in the direction of Nablus during the early part of the evening.
