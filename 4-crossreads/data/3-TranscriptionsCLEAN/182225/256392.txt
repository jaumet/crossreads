 Fine. Poss Nivison & self were with a fatigue party loading & carting stable manure down to Durrington in morning & we had to load again in afternoon. The 3 rd  Division held a Sports meeting & we all got a holiday for it. There was not anything very exciting in the events in afternoon at all events as Poss & I were there. We saw Joe Clonan, Billy White & Jack Walsh and "Pop" Lloyd up there. We went to the pictures in evening & they were not to bad.
