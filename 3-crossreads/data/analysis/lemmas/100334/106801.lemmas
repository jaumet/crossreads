 I now add a few remark of my experi and impress . When the King and Queen came out from the Palac to take the Salut , that was a moment I had alway long for , to see the King and Queen in the flesh , as I had so often seen them in the Pictur . It gave me great pleasur to stand " to attent " when the band play the Nation Anthem and the Officer salut the King . I stood among the crowd for a while watch the Troop on the March and as each Division Flag with a Wreath on the top was pass the Civilian took off their Hat out of respect for the fallen . I then walk along the Mall where a number of White Wooden Pillar were erect decor with Flag of each divis and Wreath and name of place were the Guard had fought . These were erect on the side of the road , from the statu and along the Footpath were huge crowd run into mani thousand and with the cheer and wave of Hanki and colour flag made an impress sight . I decid to make for Holborn
