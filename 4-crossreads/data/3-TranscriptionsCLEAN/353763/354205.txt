tried to catch a brilliant butterfly  -  I've seen him at Bellenden Ker in N Q before today - & there was also one of those big dark butterflies who flap largely & then settle & instantly vanish from your ken  -  Imitation I presume for life's objects  -  The cliff was dark & dank & aroids & ferns were thinly scattered over its face  -  I got a stick and looked where I went among the dead leaves & stones for snakes here are numerous & deadly  -  However we saw none - nor did I see any ferns or small plants new to me but it was dry vry dry, save just this cliff face  - = All vegetation is waiting expectantly for the rainy season  -  One thing I saw & warned my pal against & that was a cluster of bees on the surface of a large laurel like leaf  -  Let sleeping dogs lie  -  We looked & then retreated  -  On our way back we took another route & presently spotted a yard with two fine water buffaloes in them  -  Chaps I'd seen
