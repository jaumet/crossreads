<p>you might think that I wanted more than seemed necessary, and that I ought to have had a few pounds saved up, for the matter of fact I have between four and five, but you will understand that this is the first chance since leaving Australia that I have had more than a days leave and I would like to have a look at the old country while I am here. In France although we did not get paid regularly, a chap could not save much, biscuits and bully beef, you know gets a bit tiresome after a few weeks solid go at it, and a chap soon gets rid of a few shillings on a decent feed or two when he gets near a canteen or shop of any sort. I trust this will find you all at home quite well mother, I hope Aub is still on the mend and is helping dad as he was some time ago, will send along another letter in a few days, no doubt by then I will have got a letter from home,</p>
<p>With best and fondest love to all at home, and to the boys,<br/>With fond love from,<br/>Your loving Son,<br/>Gordon</p>
