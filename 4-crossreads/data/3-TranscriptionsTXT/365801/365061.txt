 My Dear Fitz Just a line to let you know I am still going along.  I ordered yr colours &amp;   [indecipherable] this morning they had been sent to you so hope you have them ere this.  I also called on Col Massy Woods &amp; everything there is satisfactory.  I also saw young Stewart he came &amp; spoke to me in the street &amp; made himself known to me, he had quite grown out of my recollection but I told him you wd be dealing with his application [now?] &amp;amp advised him to drop you a line.  I see good news still continues to come thro &amp; I hope there will be no end to it.  Weather is bad here wet &amp; cold a little better today than yesty -
