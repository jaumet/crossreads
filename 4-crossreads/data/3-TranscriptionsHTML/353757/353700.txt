<p>Mudros (Lemnos Is.)<br/>24/9/15</p>
<p>Dear Vol</p>
<p>Thanks for yours of July 31 &amp; 5th Augt. received the other day.</p>
<p>We are here for a short spell, after five months in the Trenches at Gallipoli.  Like you, the last five months for me have been very busy, but instead of carrying motions we carry positions &amp; trenches.</p>
<p>Glad you rose superior to the Peat bog mob though never doubted the issue, if brains &amp; initiative go for anything.  Am only sorry that I was such a failure in the Political secretary line but, albeit I did my best &amp; have been doing it (though with better results) ever since.  Your figures are interesting &amp; on looking over it I can quite realise what a narrow shave you had.</p>
<p>What about your heart?  Is it still bad?</p>
<p>Prior to receiving your letter the wife had written saying that you had won the selection for Nepean, so you see she watches the papers for items of interest to me.</p>
<p>Sorry you're disappointed because I hadn't been wounded or killed yet &amp; will no doubt, in the coming session, be able to oblige you.  Will enclose in this a bit of shrapnel which I've been carrying as a mascot.</p>
