 1915 May. 14 Fri. In the evening got into Cairo to attend meeting of 1st Cairo B-P Scouts. Quite a treat to be with the chaps again &ndash; reminds me so much of my own fine little Troop, which I hope is sticking well together although I have heard from them much lately. - I do not doubt for one moment that it is my long connection with the Scout Movement that has kept me straight in the many hours when a chap is tempted in so many different ways roughing it in the A.I.F. Friday is the Egyptian Sunday &amp; the working people can be seen praying in the fields.
