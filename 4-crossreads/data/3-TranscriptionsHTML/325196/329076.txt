This morning there was Church Parade, I evacuated the camp while stables were being done this afternoon, met Arthur at the A.V.C. &amp; decided to call at Abbassiah &amp; see Morgan on our way to Cairo, &amp; we were just in time to see him as he was in the Ambulance ready to go to Hospital sick, so Arthur &amp; I went with him to the hospital &amp; then went on into Cairo &amp; had a very good time, Had an Egyptian supper composed of minced meat &amp; rice mixed &amp; cooked over hot coals; unleavened bread, tomatoes onions, &amp; several other dishes which I cannot put a name to; Arthur had been there scores of times before &amp; knew the Egyptian customs &amp; style of eating, everything is very clean &amp; every convenience for washing before dining, no knives</p>
