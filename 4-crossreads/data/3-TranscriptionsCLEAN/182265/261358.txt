 In Owl Trench - X or Reserve Line between Messines & Gapard Farm. Arrived here last night about 9.30 from resting at Drouancourt near Belgian Border. Coming up we had hot cocoa & milk at Bde Hqrs. Met Gen Brand here. 
 McKillop, Cleland, Westwood Merifield & myself. Sniped at coming in but no casualties. Trench fairly dry, but sloppy in places. 
 In charge carrying parties last night carrying from Mule Dump to Reserve & Front Lines beyond Gapaard Farm. A quiet night comparatively here but tremendous straffing on either side, especially North.
