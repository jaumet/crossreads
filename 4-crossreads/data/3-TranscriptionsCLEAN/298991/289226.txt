Sultan of Egypt reported dead today. Nearly everyone is getting about with only a pair of "shorts" & a shirt on, owing to the very hot weather. 
 Friday Oct 12th The natives keep well away from the boat now through being so constantly pelted at & hurt by the military police. A good deal of gambling goes on since pay day, one fellow was caught & got 7 days detention. The guns of the fort here were practicing today, some fairly good shots could be observed. 
 Saturday Oct 13th Was 21 years old today. Left Sierra Leone about 2.30 pm this afternoon. Sea was very calm. We have a different "Cruiser" with us this time & one more ship.
