 28 WEDNESDAY 
 Fine but dull. Cleaning 
 harness all morning &amp; we 
 went out exercising horses 
 in afternoon. We have to 
 go out with bandoliers ect 
 now &amp; the O C waggon lines 
 has to be with all exercising 
 parties. No letters from home 
 yet &amp; all the others have got&nbsp; 
 late letters. Wish they would 
 turn up.
