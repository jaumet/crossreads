 13/2/19 Marcinell In our area the Brigad cinema has set up and tonight it was go and a band was play . Had an earli mess and went with Dr David to the Cirqu to see Carmen . The build was ramshackl and draughti and all plaster with advertis . All thing consid the player put up a good perform . Our seat cost us 3.75 and as much smoke as one like was permit . The last act was fair good but , in fall , poor Carmen 's leg went well up into the air . We walk down to a caf for some coffe but it was dread stuff near pure chicori and tast bad . Canal and lock here all frozen over and cover with ice . Reach billet at 10.30 ? the reek of stale air and cook fill the whole hous . Slept sound all night .
