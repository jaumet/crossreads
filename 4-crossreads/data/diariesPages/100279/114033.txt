About 4 oclock this morning there was a great commotion up round the firing line, the strength of it was this, early last night our chaps got word that there would very likely be a raid so they got ready true enough it came off it was a dismal failure for the Huns everything was ready for them artillery, machine guns all I believe the ground was littered with their bodies this morning, "revenge is sweet."
When I lobbed in the Camp this morning, I was surprised at the number of entirely new faces quite a number of details had arrived, including Depina, Baines a few more.
