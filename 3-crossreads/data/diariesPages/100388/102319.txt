with plenty of work. Quite a contrast from the boat which was just the opposite though the food was bad. It is fairly warm during the day, but at night it is very cold.
Camels are pretty plentiful and the horses shy like at them. If we stay anytime here I will soon learn the language. The French language is fairly prevalent here.
