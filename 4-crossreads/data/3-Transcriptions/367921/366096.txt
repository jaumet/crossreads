<p>general healthy appearance of the majority of the working party against practically all of the Germans we came in contact with.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Recollections are very vivid concerning on allied air raid that visited Dusseldorf shortly before we escaped.<br/>We were awakened shortly after mid-night by the noise of the anti-aircraft gun fire. Almost immediately every light in the barrack was switched on and all heads were at the different windows watching the searchlights and bursting shells. Our sentries, finding all argument useless as regards having the place in darkness, left us for the lower regions and we watched on hoping to find the city in ruins next day.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Next day when the party marched out to work every head was held high with pride in the achievement, and we all hoped that Fritz would get reminders like this at least every week. The German papers put the raid down as a failure, but some months later we were told by a Russian that the factory he had been working in, amongst others, had received considerable damage over the visit.</p>
