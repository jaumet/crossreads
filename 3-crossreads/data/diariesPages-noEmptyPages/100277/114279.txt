now this is very much against the Army rule's for we are never supposed to be without them day or night I was hurrying down the trench I bumped into a 3rd Batt. officer he spots me without the helmet, pulls me up asked me where my helmet was I answered him readily although I was taken by surprise, what Coy. do you belong to was his next question I told him so I did but not of his Batt, well he said don't let me catch you without it again off he walked.
.As soon as we arrived here last night Len another chap named Gilligan WATMAN had a fight, it appears Gilligan WATMAN called him a B- Len into him knocked him out in a couple of rounds it was an easy victory.
