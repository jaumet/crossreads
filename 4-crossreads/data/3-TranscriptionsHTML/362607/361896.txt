<p>Dear Mum. Just a card this time. We try &amp; write by every mail. We are getting warm weather all the time but it is bearable &amp; the night are lovely &amp; cool. I am going to have a shower &amp; get to bed very soon now. I have had 3 nights of late duty but I will not have any more for 10 days now. It is my day off again on Sunday &amp; I will have a good rest, How are you getting along now? We have not been ill yet at all. I have only had 2 days with my nose since I left. Well Good Night,<br/>Love From Harry</p>
<p>P.S. Don't let anything of ours get to the papers. It all comes back &amp; is posted on the notice board from everyone to laugh at. We are the only ones who have had it done to us. Hy</p>
