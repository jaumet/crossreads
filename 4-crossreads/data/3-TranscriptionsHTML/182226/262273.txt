<p>Wednesday 8 September, 1915</p>
<p>Have made a seperate dugout for ourselves. Mac, I &amp; Bernie Norris. Mac is pretty crook in the stomach but seems to be improvong. The 21<sup>st</sup> Batt relieved the 24<sup>th</sup>. They are very raw men &amp; allowed a Turk to get into our trenches early in the Morning.</p>
<p>21<sup>st</sup> Batt were torpedoed outside Lemnos &amp; lost the Brigadier &amp; about 40 men.</p>
