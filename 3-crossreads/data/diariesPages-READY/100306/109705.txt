Firing Line. Le Sars
13/2/17 Wrote letters until 4 a.m. and then collated Intelligence reports. A very quiet night. Patrol heard some Huns having a heated argument among themselves. Turned in about 7 and had no breakfast and slept on until the early afternoon. Padre called in with his comical little salute. We are going to put up a cross to Bertie Curnow and the other good fellows. "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mea mori!" God: how I loved Bert. The place is getting muddy again with the thaw. A couple of heavy bombardments off our front. Arranged for our 18 pounders to fire on the Quarry and they dosed it well. Batmen hard at work cleaning up the dugout of accumulated rubbish and others at work on surrounding trenches. A very good new batman named Charlesworth late of a ship's steward. Officers back in camp are to have all preparations in the way of blankets hot meals c ready for chaps marching in from front line tonight.
