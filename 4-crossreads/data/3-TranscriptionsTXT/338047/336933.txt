 1919 Jan 18 day we waited all day to be sent on to our Battalion, but the lorries did not arrive.  We spent the day in the little estaminet next to the mill drinking coffee (the only drink they had) &amp; playing "five hundred". 
 Jan 19 The lorries arrived at 10 am.  We all got aboard except our officer who was not to be found.  It transpired that he was sick of us, thought that we were a lot of savages, &amp; had gone on the day before.  Our lorry broke down at Sivry &amp; we had to wait half an hour.  One wag proffered another bootlace but the driver said that it would not do.  We arrived at Beugnies a little after dinner.  There was not much work for signallers &amp; only the corporal of our company was doing duty on the phone.  I was put into No 14 Platoon.  We had the first &amp; ground floor of a house.  I was upstairs.  There was a stove in our room. The town of Beugnies adjoined that of Sars Poteries.  The two towns were great pottery manufacturing
