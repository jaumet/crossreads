<p>Tuesday 8 October<br/>Leave London.</p>
<p>Wednesday 9 October<br/>Arrive in Edinburgh on a wet day but still can do the Castle, Royal Mile &amp; the Holyrood Palace, all places abounding in history.  The Royal Mile however, loses all its historical beauty, by the awful condition of the people living there. George Hotel.</p>
