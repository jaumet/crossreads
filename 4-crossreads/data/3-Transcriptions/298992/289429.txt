<p>I have been wanting to hear very much too, to see what Dene is doing. The last I heard was that Dene had transferred from the A.M.C. &amp; was going into an Officers School to try and get a Commission. Wish him good luck for me, though if he does get through, it will probably be a long time before he gets away, if things are like when Nivin &amp; Noel went through. I have not seen anything of Noel since we arrived in Egypt, though I went over to where he was camped several times. I think he has gone down to the Canal by this time. I caught a glimpse of Nivin one day about a month ago in Cairo, but did not have a chance to speak to him, and I have not seen him since.</p>
