<p>October 1916<br/>Enough to go.  I went myself &amp; we left camp at Hill 70 at 5.45 and rode to Kantara &amp; caught the 9.30 am special train getting to Alexandria at 4.30 pm.  The change of air camp is nicely situated near the beach &amp; there is every facility for the troops comfort.  A large amount of freedom is granted &amp; the troops have only to keep themselves &amp; their camp clean.  We are allowed leave from 2 pm to 11 pm.  The tramway is nearly 2 miles from the camp &amp; is a good stiff walk; a good service is run.</p>
<p>Alexandria is the best place I have been in, it is more European than the other towns in Egypt.  The Residential part of the town is very pretty &amp; there are many beautiful houses &amp; gardens.  I called in on my old pal Bill Long at the Records Section &amp; we put in the afternoon &amp; evening together &amp; had a box at the Alhambra.  There was a big crowd mainly military &amp; quite the largest number of white women I</p>
