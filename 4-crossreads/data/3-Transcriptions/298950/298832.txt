<p>February 16th  This Camp inhabites about 5 per cent lunatics wich run about Camp unattended.  In most Cases, this has been the result of the long period of internement &amp; the former unjust treatement.  This day an Austrian (also a lunatic) <strike>toke it</strike> climbed 3 Barb Wire fences each 3 yards high, to get outside of the Camp.  The Guard (a Horseman) stood about, as eye witnesses say 25 yards off, without stopping the Internee of the illegal action of tresspass.  The relieving Guard 8 in number &amp; a Sergeant in charge being than about 50 yards distant.  This happened during the afternoon between 4-5 oclock.  So in broad daylight.  When the Lunatic (Internee) got about 20 yards of the other side of the Fence the Guard got of his horse, kneeled on the Ground &amp; fired.  The shot however missed.  Same remounted again reloadet his Rifle &amp; cantered after Pris.  The report of the Rifle called 8 other of the Guard in adition of 3 Light Horse &amp; <strike>left</strike> Lieutenant Stoddart wich came <strike>ridden</strike> mounted from the direction towards wich the lunatic escapee walked.  The Guard in a body <strike>start</strike> comenced firing, in all 16 shots wher fired.
