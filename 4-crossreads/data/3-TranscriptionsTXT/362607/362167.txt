 Dear Mum This is the end of the corridor   &amp;  the door on the left leads to the room where in the Princes were murdered. After leaving the Tower we walked round onto the Tower Bridge which you see so many Photos of. The Thames is only about 500 or 600 yds wide here. We drove out in a Taxi but went back per the Tube. The Tubes are great to get about on but very unhealthy.  Harry
