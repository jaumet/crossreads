Went down this afternoon to Bulford & Durrington & got a few snaps that I wanted, there is a very old church at Bulford, dates back to 1130, & she looks it, though the building is as solid as the day it was finished, no jerry building or slumming those days, Bulford is a very pretty little village the Avon runs right through it, & there are several little creeks winding in & out cutting the village up & the houses are all as old fashioned as can be, with plenty of flowers & creepers climbing all over the place, there is a big Camp close here where all the veneral cases are quartered & doctored, you can find any rank you like here from the General down to the
