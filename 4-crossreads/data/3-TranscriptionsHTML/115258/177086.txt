<p>notice Hal has put explanations to some of the words in it. I feel very insulted and annoyed!! No doubt the words are hard scientific ones and I would not have had the slightest idea what the meant if Hal had &nbsp;not translated them for me; but all the same I reckon its awful cheek on his part. He forgets I&#39;m his elder brother!! I have been trying to thinks of something I knew that I could fire off at him, and keep up my reputation a bit, but it seems to me I dont&nbsp;know nuffink learned; unless I ask him about &quot;Continental time in the preamble of a cypher message&quot;, but that&#39;s only a common signaller&#39;s work! We have a very nice Padre here now, Major Gordon; he was in the 1st Bde at Romani and knew Ronald Macdonald well and was at Beersheba when Dick died. He has the MC and all the chaps think an awful lot of him. There is absolutely no news to give you, but I feel in a writing humour so I think I&#39;ll go ahead and try my hand at making a letter up as I go along.</p>
