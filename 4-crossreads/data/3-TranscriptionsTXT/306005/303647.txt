I covered the telephone line across the camel & horse roads today & have a lamp aligned on Bde H.Q. in case the line breaks tonight. Today we received a large quantity of Xmas gift goods which were very acceptable. From our observation post we can see the Spire of El Arish & Turkish Outpost on the hills through the Telescope. I forgot to report that Major Smith with the Troop of C Sqdn men returned from Wady El Arish on Thursday night after a very successful trip. Early Thursday
