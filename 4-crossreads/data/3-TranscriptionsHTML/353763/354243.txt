<p>Tuesday Oct 20-1914<br/>I am going &ndash; for the present anyway &ndash; to wind up my serial tale  -  We are back in a British port &ndash; a well known port &amp; description wd  be superfluous  -  My letters will come regularly &amp; I'll note everything of interest as it comes along  -</p>
<p>Sunday 18th= I put in aboard  -  We were using Divers to fix up AE2's new propeller &amp; the rules of the service require the Dr not only to examine the man before he goes down but to hang around handy in case of accident  -  All went well &amp; the job ended about 6 pm  -<br/>I  sd have mentioned that on Saty the big ships went out but, what their job is we don't know  -  On Monday morning we shifted our berth inshore  -  We now lie - with AE2 alongside  -  some 400 yards from the wharf  -<br/>I put in the morng on the Grantala  -  I took a sick man over &ndash; an ERA (Engine Room Artificer) I stayed to lunch &amp; talked to the doctor men  -  The Fizz &amp; sparkle is off the champagne now we'r out of German territory &amp; back to a British settlement  -  All that remains is to watch &amp; ward &ndash; Doctor man's job in the navy is potential at all times  -</p>
