 There you have the Complete Stunter by one who is heartily tired of it. 22nd Sept. Sand,  Sand, Sand Everlasting shifting sand that gets in  your bed o'nights  &   your food by day; that gives off a dazzling glare from the blazing sun that makes one  pucker up one's face  &  shield the eyes with the hand - I am so deadly sick of it all.
