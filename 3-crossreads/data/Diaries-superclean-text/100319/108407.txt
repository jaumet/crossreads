12/10/18 St. Vast 
Dull and misty. A great improvement in the appearance of the men today though our Battalion with its 3 companies is very small in size. They did ordinary work on the parade ground. I inspected the Transport Lines and found the horses rather pinched by the cold and right out in the open. There is a good amount of drunkenness going on. Why our fellows should be so vicious in this regard I don't know. Perhaps too much money is the cause but I know that the wineshop keepers are making fortunes. Sports in the afternoon. A dull grey afternoon. Very pretty undulating gentle country round here with little woods all round. In the distance the Vignacourt church stands out bold and high. Yarned with Madame Mademoiselle round at the mess. They freely discuss quite forbidden topics.
