Detailed for fatigue work in Artillery lane.
An old dressing station to be turned in to a new one. Plenty of digging.
This station is further north & higher up than Shell Green which is visible away to the left.
I think this place is more dangerous than "Shell Green" for shells were bursting around for a good part of the day.
On the way home stopped at a gun on the way looking south &  therefore overlooking "Gaba Tepe". Looked through glasses & saw trenches on the olive groves flat.
