 1918 Fri. 4th Oct Another meeting of the theatrical party.   More than stormy, a cyclone.   The committee was sacked, a new secretary, new producer, new stage &amp; manager, &amp; new president were elected &amp; a new policy laid down. 
 Hampson is to control all plays (as distinct from revue &amp; vaudeville) McGrath, (the Third Person of our Holy trinity!) by virtue of his Temperament is Adviser, "feelings" are  not  to be considered, &amp; new talent is to be sought for.   I am to "star" in W.W. Jacob's "Bosun's Mate" this month, &amp;, after much argument and counter-argument, I was voted permission to appear in two French sketches at the next French performance.  (This by a narrow majority;  racial prejudice runs high on both sides here.) 
 &hellip;.. 
 I did not mention our "day out" last month.   Applied to the Kommandantur for permission to visit Brandenburg "to see an optician ",Geo. &amp; Whitaker to accompany me to hold my hand during the ordeal, presumably.   I got it, too.   (am learning "the ropes" of this hellish hole.)
