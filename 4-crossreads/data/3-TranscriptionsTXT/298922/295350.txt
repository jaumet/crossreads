 Fine weather at last &amp; we move on to  El Burj, Col. Meredith  has been given 4th Brigade &amp; he wants me to go as Staff Captain -  My chance of a majority here is possibly good but   I'll go if sent for but it means leaving the old 1st L.H. Near here the Syrians are starving &amp; the Bedouins are out to robb &amp; kill friend or foe, I mean Turk or English. Poor Armenians have been killed &amp; starved to death in 1000s. 
 2 enemy planes bombed us but our Archies bombed them, one horse hit by empty shell from Archie. These fall all around us from above  after missing the enemy .
