<p>Tuesday 18 December</p>
<p>Roads covered with snow.  Rest of our unit arrived at about 4 a.m.<br/>Run to Desvres thence to Samer and return via Questrecques.<br/>Another run to 5th D.H.A. later in the day.<br/>Tonight I sleep on a mattrass which I have taken off the bed, there having been two on the bed previously.<br/>This mattrass plus 5 blankets, a thick "Tommy Warmer" coat and the water proof motor coat are sufficient to make a warm bed.</p>
