  
 marching on to the canal. 
 The nights are getting quite cold, have had to start rugging our horses again.  Saturday Jan. 30th 1915  expect to get through  drifted  the canal, are only allowed to travel at 5 knots an hour.  Have anchored at Ismalia tonight about halfway through the canal. There are a big encampment of Indian & British troops here. 
 Saturday 30th Jan. 1915. Drifted during the night on to a sand bank, are having some trouble to get off this morning, they have had to tie a rope on to the Persic & drag us off, have just got clear. This is a big lake, came through two yesterday. Saw two biplanes rise from the shore this morning, they are scouting round watching the movements of the Turks. Still passing British & Indian troops, they are lined right along the canal, there are supposed to be 60,000 Indians troops alone. They are busy making trenches & putting up barb wire entanglements. 
 Have had a bit of a stiff leg these last few days where that horse kicked me, went to the Doctor, he says that I have a little water under the knee, swollen a good bit &  damn  painful, but I expect it will be right in a day or so. Passed another Battleship today the Swiftsure. There is a battle inland now we can see the smoke from the artillery.
