 She came out with us for Afternoon tea. In the evening the three of us (Kelly, O'Dwyer   &amp;  self) went to see "Monty's Flapper" very silly but we enjoyed it very much &ndash; I had not been to that Theatre before. 
 We left Dorothy   &amp;  another Sister at an Imperial Hosp. in Abbeville. Just next to the 1st Sth African Gen. (where we worked at first in, France). We shall all meet there again on our way back, then our camp is supposed to be ready for us, which I really hope they will be. It is grand to think I'm returning to them again. It is horrid to go amongst strangers. 
 We called on the Soth. African while in Abbeville   &amp;  they were very pleased to see us. They are much more comfy. Have improved the place very much.
