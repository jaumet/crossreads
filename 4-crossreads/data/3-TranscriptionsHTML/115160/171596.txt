<p>Dear Lock,</p>
<p>Yours of 30th now to hand, altho&#39; Bess and Dad&#39;s of 12 May beat it. &nbsp;I see you have turned up trying to pick em. &nbsp;Just as well when 40 &amp; 50 to 1 chances win. &nbsp;Bess says Miller still tries to pick &#39;em too, and his promises are thereby delayed indefinitely.</p>

<p>Fancy selling Port &amp; Beans - Limcol&#39;s or Davies&#39; I expect. &nbsp;This is an article of our ration, and used to come up about four times a week. &nbsp;It has been getting scarcer of late, altho&#39; the troops don&#39;t mind generally, but, perhaps on&nbsp;</p>
