<p>Wednesday, 29 September, 1915<br/>I spent the day fighting influenza I got really bad during the day, the Corp &amp; I made a fine dug out and finished an elaborate larder having received three big parcels of good things.  We work together and will get on splendidly I think.</p>
<p>During the afternoon we inoculated another 100 men for cholera, I got another dose myself.</p>
<p>90 Reinforcements came for the regt. to-day so they will soon be getting back their strength.</p>
<p>Thursday, 30 September, 1915<br/>Had a bad night in consequence I stayed in bed most of the day the corporal doing the sick parades.  My temp was very high at night and the Dr wanted to send me away but I refused as I knew I could get myself well so I made a mixture of [indecipherable] &amp; washed it down with a heavy dose of rum in the morning another all the fever gone.</p>
<p>Good news still comes from France and they are bombarding the narrow forts night &amp; day.</p>
