 1918 Thu.  14th Feb. This morning the snow-capped heights of the Norwegian coast loomed up ahead and we turned South. 
 We are strictly forbidden to go on deck but we glimpsed the coast through the door coverings when the sentry was also looking out. 
 We had an hour on deck a day or two ago &ndash; the weather clear with a smooth heavy roll. 
 Quite a number of the crowd are now taking a more or less surreptitious interest in Bibles and Rosaries.   Just before midnight I came out to find Dempsey, the boastful Canadian n-c-o from Singapore, sitting in the centre of the hold close to a water tight door buried in a bible. 
 He has gone quite hysterical;  he grabbed me as I passed and told me to "pray for deliverance, it is all we can do now." 
 I unsympathetically sent Webbie to make the German guard send him to bed &ndash; he was a disturbing influence on some people.
