<p>of going on to-morrow, I did not think I was so tired, until I stopped   &amp;  now know, feel as if I could sleep for a week. Rested all yesterday   &amp;  today went  for a lovely walk this afternoon   &amp;  our luck was in, it poured raining just after we returned   &amp;  has done so ever since. We are tucked in bed feeling very safe   &amp;  comfortable.</p>
<p>Still address my letters C/O Aust. Base Post Office, Horseferry Road. London. If any change shall let you know as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Hope you are all well   &amp;  happy   &amp;  that things are going smoothly with you. I'm longing for letters from home. Tell my friends I am too down-hearted to write just yet but may be able to settle down   &amp;  write y letters. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all,</p>
<p>From<br/>your loving daughter<br/>Edith</p>
