 JAN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUNDAY 23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916 
 Very hot &amp; muggy.&nbsp; We all sat in nursrey [nursery?] all day and played the phonograph.&nbsp; Bob Lawson called in about 5pm to tell us he had tried to join the Light Horse &amp; Artillary &amp; he had failed.&nbsp; Linda &amp; self went for a walk round the Strand scrub after he had gone.&nbsp; Like those walk&#39; e s round Strand scrub with Linda very much, as we seem to get to know one another better through the talks we have there.&nbsp; Dont know why it should be but we seem to be able yarn much freer there than anywhere else.
