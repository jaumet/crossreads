 1916   SUNDAY 30   JAN. 
 Fine & hot. M r  Lloyd & self went for a swim in Spit Baths before breakfast. The two Hunter boys & their sister, Reg Boyce & [Lolu?] came in afternoon & we had some good tennis. Final leave up & I went back by 9.40 train to the Warren camp. I did not like the idea of going back either after the ten days holiday. Linda & Self both enjoyed that ten days very much I think & we both saw deeper into one another. Heard that all units had been put back a month & instead of us going in Feb we were going in March
