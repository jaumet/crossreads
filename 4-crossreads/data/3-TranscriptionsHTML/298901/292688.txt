<p>April 12th Friday<br/>This diary, the 7th since enlistment, opens at a period critical &amp; momentous.  The great hun offensive has been directed upon us in full force &amp; has gained quite a respectable success.  We expected to give a little at points but our leaders apparently underrated his offensive powers.  A second effort has been made north, over ground I know like a book &amp; so far has been successful, his advance reaching 7 miles into country of extreme value.  Armentieres, Sailly, Bai St Main [?], Merville, Estaires, all old friends have now passed to the enemy.  Altho' temporarily the enemy is in the ascendant I feel sure he will be checked &amp; this feeling of confidence runs throughout the whole army.<br/>It was a very quiet night altho' there was heavy gunfire from surrounding batteries  Those just behind us consist of 60 pounders 6" howitzers &amp; 6" Naval &amp; firing over heads as they do we receive the full blast.</p>
