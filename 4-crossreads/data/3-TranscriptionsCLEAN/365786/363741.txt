  
 proud of them & gloried in the fact  "Australia will be there".  Most of us women will vote yes from a personal reason - because we have someone dear to us over there.  And if our boys  are  those dear to us are not reinforced they may be wiped out.  Our loss  is not the number of men we send, but the number of men who never come home.  And one way to minimize this loss is by reinforcing those already at the Front.  Sufficient reinforcements mean (1) that ground won can be held & positions consolidated (2ndly) that  the men can  those holding the front trenches can be relieved regularly  If this be without extra men  & they are thus less liable to disease &  lastly  also that the more men we & all the Empire send to the front the sooner the war will be over & our men back home. Some people say if we vote "yes" on the 28th that our own men will be sent away to fight & this land will be flooded with cheap coloured labour.  Then when our men return there will be no place for them.
