<p>turn to the right, with a dangerous bank <strike>on the right</strike> to swing the transport clear of, and an exceedingly steep descent to the next level.  Then the process would be repeated, only this time the turning would be to the left; and so on, with many stops, we finally reached the bottom, and a fair road, but not before the pole of the Water Cart had been broken, one Sand cart dislodged from its bed, and the coupling work of our rear limber broken and the limber and its contents launched almost into the Wadi, alongside the road.  After fastening it as best we could we reached camp for the night after only once leaving the tail end of the limber behind us.</p>
<p><strike>We slept soundly that night.</strike>  It was rather amusing when our rear limber capsized, there were some Scotch Infantry men passing, coming from the firing line. Just as one was alongside the accident took place.  The Scot moved as though shot out of a rocket, and only just in time.  "Ye pit the wund up me that time; it was worse than the shells," he said, when he had recovered his composure.  We slept soundly that night, and without any rocking.</p>
<p>When we stirred on the 20th we found ourselves in a deep green valley by a Dry Wadi.  To the flowers we were already familiar with, there were added beautiful wild stocks, scarlet sweet peas and another heliotrope specimen which I had never seen before.  We watered our horses at a huge excavation in the chalky wall of the Wadi, filled with water the colour of strong tea, and quite as rich in fragrance, but of a different nature.  They did not enjoy it overmuch, but it was all there was to be had.</p>
<p>We were able to go to the top of a neighbouring hill, and see the struggle put up by the 60th Division for the possession of a hill about three miles away.  Through the glasses everything could be seen</p>
