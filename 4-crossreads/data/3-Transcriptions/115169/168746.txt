<p>weather was exceptionally fine and clear and we turned South at 15 knots intending to overhaul the troopships en route to Albany W. Australia</p>
<p>Oct 25th at 6 PM we arrived at Albany, and during the voyage from Port Phillip we were at intervals continually overhauling and passing the transports, and each one in response to our signals replied 'All Well' &ndash; it was without doubt a pleasurable trip especially across the Great Australian Bight, where more or less boisterous weather is encountered, - but on this occasion the sun was shining very brilliantly through the sunlit mist, the sea appeared to be motionless, and only the ship cutting her way forward thru the mighty deep sea caused a ripple on the surface</p>
<p>It was a splendid sight to watch the passing of each trooper, for it seemed the side near to us was crowded with Anzacs waving handkerchiefs to us as we sped past them &ndash; Several had already arrived</p>
