Sunday 11 November 1917.
On again till 9 am. Halted 3 to 4 hrs. & then on again in direction of Gaza & coast. An old mail somehow arrived. Letter from Arthur Thompson just in Egypt.
Travelled through till midnight with one stop for 20 mins. and numerous halts for 5 when passing through villages when it was done in single file. Line of Country looking more settled & civilized. Orchards here & there, owing to war have been neglected.
