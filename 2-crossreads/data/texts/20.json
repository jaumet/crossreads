When I was younger, I used to do my homework while watching TV. Now when I watch TV, I surf the web.» [1] He has a website, or rather a blog, or rather two blogs; but these are not necessarily the best place to start for an understanding of his work. He describes himself as a programmer; but that is only one of his identities. He is also a teacher, musician, artist, performer, exhibition curator, and occasionally an art critic. Some of these activities he carries out as Cory Arcangel, others as a part of one of the many collectives of which he is either a member or occasional collaborator: Beige, Contagious Media Group, The 8-bit Construction Set, Gay Beatles, RSG, Paperrad. Often works are even presented as both individual and collective."

		"p" : "One of the bases for the coherence to be seen in his work is his love of \"old systems\". One might here speak of nostalgia: there is no doubt that the retro-chic fascination of his work – together with his irresistible gifts as a performer – have made him the darling of the New York scene, courted by the likes of Jeffrey Deitch and other private individuals and institutional bodies. However, I would say that the correct term to describe Cory Arcangel’s attachment to old systems is economy. As he himself revealed in an interview with John Bruneau: «I like these systems not cause of nostalgia, but because they are cheap and easy to work. Also they are the perfect middle ground between analogue and digital video.» [2]"

And there is also economy of space, codes and bits: in this era of broadband, Arcangel produces remarkably light works, often of less than 32k. This is even an economy of intellectual reference: Cory himself has commented that «I would love to say there was some contemporary artist who’s work really got me thinking, but lately I have just been trying to sort out twenty years of garbage TV culture that is filling my brain.» [3] He is someone who strives for maximum effect with minimum effort, considering it a positive thing \"to do as little as possible\"."

His discovery was this: take a huge data file—in this case his computer's memory file—and fool Quicktime into thinking it's a video file. Then press play. Your computer's memory is now video art. Quicktime plays right through, not knowing that the squiggles and shards on the screen are actually the bits and bytes of the computer's own brain. The data was always right in front of your nose. Now you can watch it.» [4]"

The smaller the idea the happier I am.» [5]<br />For Arcangel, lightness also involves a sort of Pop superficiality; hence his denial of any artistic influence that is not contemporary, and not the result of friendship; and hence his immense, passionate love of television and the internet. «I am a pop artist and all pop culture to me is fair game! I love it all. I don’t have a TV now, cause if I did I would watch it all the TIME!!!» [6]"

This I guess it quite common, but more specifically Buffalo, has this really strange video art culture. In the 70’s all these insane video art people from New York moved there to teach at the University. These people included Stan and Woody Vasulka [...] and Tony Conrad [...] So the work of these artists really shaped the artistic identity of the city. I remember watching TV when I was younger and seeing these weirdo minimal color field videos late at night. It is hard to put into words, but by growing up there I never thought it was weird to make a 15 minute slow motion video. No one ever told me this was strange, …I would see such strange stuff on the public TV all the time, that it wasn’t until I moved away that I learned that these were 'art videos'.» [7]"

The Beige group was formed around 1997, when he was at music school, and is the \"collective\" background for all his subsequent artistic activities. Founded by Cory Arcangel, Joe Beuckman, Joe Bonn, and Paul B. Davis, this group of programmers was also a musical band and a small record label:<br />«After a few records we all started to make some really weird stuff and eventually wandered off the map into hardware hacking, video art, and bead work [we do not really see any difference between audio and visual work] so we just went with the name BEIGE as an umbrella to describe everything we were doing.» [8]"

It is no coincidences that, after the 8-bit Construction Set, Beige experimented with the use of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) as an instrument for making music as well as video. These experiments led to Fat Bits, the group’s first installation, which was presented in 2001 at the Chicago Deadtech. For Arcangel, NES cartridges were the perfect tool for making videos by working on minimal graphics and old platforms whilst remaining true to the nebulous resolution of the television image (which he finds much more fascinating than the precision of new pixel technology)."

		"p" : "This fascination for old systems and lo-fi aesthetics explains his interest in old videogames better than any presumed nostalgia for an infancy spent on the Nintendo console:<br />«I never really liked or played the game. At this point most of my interest in the game is in the 16 * 16 sidescrolling graphical limitations [...] I think there are a lot of people who missed that particular game, but no one who missed the aesthetic of the early computer and video game movement. [...] I don't love the games so much, but I really love the systems. I love the look that the old Systems have. For one, the NES directly accesses the TV's colors. So you tend to get these really bright colors on older TV's, much brighter than cable, or VHS tapes. This kinda thing also looks good even as a glow cast on a room. Like my cloud cartridge was really made for a TV I have in the corner of my apt, so at night it makes my living room glow that slurpy blue of the sky in the game. Second, I really like the idea of scrolling. Even more than movies, games tend to frame narratives in such a way that people really believe that the game world extends beyond the borders of the screen. All you have to do is move the joypad left or right to see it. And I really like the yucky stuff that the TV signal adds to the pixel perfect style. People forget that the pixel design style that is really popular is kinda like a mirage. That aesthetic only exists in the heads of designers because back on the day pixel graphics were all displayed on TV's which of course make everything blurry.» [9]"

Coming almost a year before the clouds, his Super Abstract Brothers substitutes all the characters and backgrounds with abstract forms and figures, transforming Mario Bros into a strange Tetris, undermining our memories from a world that, due to our absorption in the game, we tend to perceive as real. In Fantasy Cutscenes # 2 (2004), on the other hand, Arcangel adds to the same cartridge captions that evoke both silent cinema and strip cartoons, thus causing a \"collision\" of various narrative genres."

However there is a precedent for this, in the work of the hackers who created cracks for Commodore 64 games and went so far as to sign them proudly with their own \"tag\", namely a brief video at the start of the game. Arcangel came across these tags while he was working, as BEIGE, on Low Level All Stars (2003), a research project made for the show \"Kingdom of Piracy\", in collaboration with Alexander Galloway [12]. The two artists examined more than 1,000 tags and selected ten of them to put on a DVD."

The defacement of pop culture myths is something that we can find in many of his works: Sans Simon (2004) is the video of a concert by Simon & Garfunkel where the silhouette of Simon is hidden – I would say censored – by the artist's hands; while Beach Boys / Geto Boys (2004) is a mash-up where the video of \"Little Surfer Girl\" – an icon of the surf culture of the Sixties – is played side by side with the video of an hip-hop song by the Geto Boys."

Finally, the classic I Shot Andy Warhol (2002) combines hacker intrusion with graffiti defacement. The victim is the cartridge of \"Holigan’s Halley\", another old game for NES. Our victim, on the other hand, is Andy Warhol, whose silvery wig and dark-rimmed glasses make him unmistakeable even in 8bit graphics, alongside the Pope and other pop icons."

Oh, and I was forgetting, the target is presented on a TV screen, and the joystick is a toy pistol."

As for the road in \"Car Racer\", when stripped of the roaring engines it becomes a poetic metaphor of travel and new frontiers, an American highway with mountains in the background, immobile clouds in the sky and a Nintendo advertising hoarding on the horizon. It is no coincidence that Arcangel has based a series of posters on this landscape, bringing out the full iconic power of the image."

Pizza Party (2004) is a UNIX command-line program with a GPL license that can be used to order pizza via the internet, and organize improvised pizza parties. The work is a hack of the Dominos Pizza ordering system, in which Arcangel mixes all the ingredients we get used to without ever getting bored of them: lightness, lo-fi aesthetics, a sense of humor, uselessness, apparent insanity. Almost unknown in the contemporary art world, Pizza Party became a cult project among hackers and geeks: an audience Arcangel never dumped for the gallery-goers."
