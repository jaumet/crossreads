<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We are instructed that our Battalion colors and puggaries for our hats must be sewn on before the first parade the following morning at 6 a.m.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Solid drill is in evidence again, and we get very little time to ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<u>WE MOVE TOWARDS THE FRONT</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We remain at Vignacourt until the 3rd. when at 7.30 a.m. we start our daily march up towards the front.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The first day we marched ten miles, in the mud and slush, such as is hardly imaginable, with full pack, steel helmet, rifle, ammunition, and all the other necessary impediments. It really is wonderful what a soldier can carry. After every hour marching a rest for ten minutes was allowed. The &quot;rest&quot; was taken advantage of, by us all sitting down or lying down on the roadside, thereby adding more to the weight we already had to carry, by the quantity of mud that would adhere to our clothing. During the afternoon we arrive at the village of &nbsp;<u>GARDENET</u>.</p>
<p>We are here accomodated in stables or other outhouses which happen to be vacant at the time of our arrival. We really don&#39;t mind very much we are so dog-tired that just anywhere will suit us. After a meal we roll ourselves in the blankets we have carried, and very soon forget our troubles in that great gift, sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before daylight the following morning we are astir, have breakfast, then pack up and load ourselves for the days march, Our feet are beginning to feel the strain, blistered heels make themselves felt, but it&#39;s got to be gone through and we are not drawing-room soldiers now. After an inspection by our O.C. to see that every man is shaven and his boots polished, we are given the order fo &quot;form fours&quot;, &quot;right, quick march&quot; and we are off again to our next stopping place, thirteen miles nearer to the &quot;line&quot;.</p>
