<p>Just before we left Seraphium the Prince of Wales paid us a surprise visit, you ought to have  seem some of the boys rushing out to have a look at him, some with no boots on some without tunics or hats &amp; others with just their trousers on I warrant he thought we were a pretty rough looking crowd but the boys gave him a good welcome they crowded all round him trying to get snapshots with their cameras General Birdwood was with him &amp; he was smiling like anything  We could all pick the Prince out easily by the plume in his hat he only looks a boy &amp; has rosy cheeks like a girl</p>
