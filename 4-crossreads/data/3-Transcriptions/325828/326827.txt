<p>Whilst coming home from the paddock on horseback, &amp; bringing some others with me, when all of a sudden one of the horses rushed over to the one I was on &amp; kicked.  Instead of kicking the horse, the brute caught me right on the shin bone of the right leg about 7 inches below the knee.  On examination I found a cut about 1 &frac12; ins long &amp; exposing the bone.  After bathing it carefully in lysol &amp; hot water, I got Mr Pearce to stitch it up with cotton, then I put a Bates' salve on, which eased it a good deal.  It is getting on well now tho', &amp; I am careful about keeping it bandaged well to keep the dust out.<br/>Father dear, what is the meaning of "efficacious", &amp; what way is it used.  We were wondering the other day what it meant.<br/>Must close now, thanking you all again for your birthday presents,  With love to all at home.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Leo.<br/>able to produce the result intended.<br/>produce of Effects.</p>
