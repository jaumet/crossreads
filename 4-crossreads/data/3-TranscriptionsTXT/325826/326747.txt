8.  are rather haughty fashionable hi dames and not pleasant to work with, still it does not matter much for there is not much opportunity for knowing or being known, only sometimes they hurt one's feelings a bit in their superior ways.  They are mostly from the well-known fashionable Shepheard's Hotel, so Sister Lucie says, but I can't help thinking they must be really kind-hearted to bother to go & help there at all.Sister Lucie does not improve on acquaintance she is spoiled by the notice the soldiers take of her, or that she says they take & I get sick of hearing little egotistic things, though of course in the main she is absolutely lady-like & must be good to spend all her time for the Y.M. as she does, it is only that she is getting a little bit old & silly- perhaps I mean too old to show such silliness, for she is quite young really, only about 38 or 40.I wish I had more to do for the soldiers but am keeping a look out, it is no use worrying when there are such lots of nurses here idle, & other very important folk.Must close & post this.  My love to Jobber and your dear dear selves,Very lovingly      Your daughterOlive.
