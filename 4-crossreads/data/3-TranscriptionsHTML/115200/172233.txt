<p>20) The Landing</p>
<p>we were Some 35 miles from Dardanelles. We could hear the Violent Bombardment that was taking place. when we arrived about noon we learnt that our Boys had Been ashore Since 4AM. This made us all very excited and we were all to get ashore to help our Brave Comrades. There was 7 or 8 warships Bombarding for all they were worth&nbsp; all this time we were on our transports waiting for the Destroyers to come and take us ashore. At last one came along Side and took Some of the 15 and 16<sup>th </sup>Battalion ashore.</p>
