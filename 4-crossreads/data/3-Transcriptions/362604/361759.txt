<p>a Barrack room where the Staff sleep so I had to move in last week.  Ellis also moved but He has gone back to the flat again.  I am in a small cubicle with Ern Thomas &amp; we are quite good Pals since we first dossed together on the sand at Warwick Farm.  It is only 50 yards from my office &amp; 100 from the Mess &amp; is ever so much more convenient for that</p>
