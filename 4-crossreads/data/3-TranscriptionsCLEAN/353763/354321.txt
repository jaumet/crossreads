In the afternoon the Australia went out  -  She was unattended save by a fast collier  -  The Yarra came in & anchored  -  I did nothing all day  -  I wanted a spell & in addition there was nowhere to go to on the beach  -
The wildest buz is afloat  -  Everyone is going to Sydney  -  We are all to go to Valparaiso "The Falklands" The Australia is to go alone to Valparaiso & the rest to sit hard  -  We are to go to Noumea & be joined up by AE2 & the Destroyers  -  As an actual fact no one knows anything  -
Monday Nov 9  Steam ordered for 5.30 am  -  At 6 we were alongside the wharf & began taking in fresh water  -  No further news  -  We are to report to the Encounter when our tanks are full  -  I went ashore at 9  -  Got my hair cut & bought some P. Cards for R & Mab  -  I also invested in 3 stone axes for R's benefit  -  Nothing like seeing & handling these old instruments of Neolithic man  -  At the shops they told me the polished axes were the more valuable which is just the reverse of correct  -  The older unpolished axe is far the more valuable - the unpolished represents man in the Paleolithic or old stone age  -
