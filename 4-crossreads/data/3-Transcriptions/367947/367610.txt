<p>My dear Jack &amp; Clare,<br/>Got an undated letter from you today but should think it was posted in September.</p>
<p>My word old horse you sound cheerful but you are not having the best of time. However I hope the furnaces are now going O.K. again &amp; things are straightening. I am sending you along a fiver for Xmas &amp; hope it arrives safely to give you &amp; the kids a day out in commemoration.</p>
<p>Dear old Clare I hope she is doing well. I had made full arrangements to call on Mrs Dye but the Turks came &amp; I did not see. I think she has now gone to India but will find out for certain soon as we are now in a camp having arrived here yesterday evening. Its great to be in a tent again &amp; tomorrow I hope to have the luxury of sleeping in a bed even if it is only made of feed-bags. You can guess it will go alright after not having seen one for three months.</p>
<p>Tell Clare she needn't growl about her luck. We suffer here with too little bed. Glad the kidlets are doing so well. Yes I would like a snap of them very much. Sorry Barrett is wounded &amp; hope its nothing very serious. I had heard about Annie Gainer. Its bad luck but it looks almost like a judgment.</p>
<p>Give my love to Ede &amp; Al &amp; the other tribes. You didn't mention Al or Ted. Hope they are going alright. Am sending Al along a couple of quidlets for Xmas.</p>
