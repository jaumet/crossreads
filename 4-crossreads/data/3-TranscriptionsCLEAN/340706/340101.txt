  
 when all the old trees in the avenue that is 3/4 mile long thro Busby Park are all in bloom all the world is going there & after waiting an hour for a bus with standing room on it I take Tube to Shepherds Bush where no bush exists & then tram. 
 I enter into the Court itself & pass through the building See guide - then go thro the room Then see the Great vine 5 ft in girth at its root & 4 ft 7 in 1 ft above ground Then the pretty Italian garden with its arches in shrub & in centre its low fountain & at far end its Venus hidden grotto. Then I go along the three grand avenues all opening from Kings window and edges with magnificent [indecipherable] - a quicker growing tree than beech. 
 Thence I pass along to Chestnut Avenue & walk along to Teddington & then retrace my steps & walk to Knightsbridge (2 Kingston) & meet a Socialists who yarns with me & tells me to call in at Socialist Club Fitzroy Square & ask for Mr Keel & say Hayes sent me. These men I found for the most part to be idealists with impracticable philosophical ideas but a few of them were bomb throwers [by] Hegarty. 
 Finally reach home having had nothing to eat since breakfast & having walk about 8 miles or more
