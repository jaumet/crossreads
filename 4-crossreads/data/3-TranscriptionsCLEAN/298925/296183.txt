extract (Professional Beauty)
Beauty is but a vain & doubtful goodA Shining gloss that fadeth suddenlyA flower that dieth when first gives to budA brittle glass that's broken presentlyA doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,Lost, faded, broken, dead within an hour
Since thou cans't with more than oneThou'rt worthy to be loved by none
The first sound in the song of loveScarce more than silence is and yet a soundHands of invisible spirits touch the stringsOf that mysterious instrument the soulAnd play the prelude of our fate
Two separate worlds - the one that smallBeloved & consecrated spotWhere Quita was; the other allThe dull wide waste where she was not
