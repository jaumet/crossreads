<p>All the Compane's nominal rolls were checked today, a healthy sign of coming battle.<br/>Some of our platoons went for a bath today but they were sucked in for they had to have instead of the usual hot bath a cold shower &amp; no change of clean clothing<br/>This morning I had charge of our platoon for physical exercise, &amp; tonight I am in charge of the billet guard, a very soft snap.<br/>It has been drizzling rain all day &amp; the roads &amp; streets are very sloppy  Its funny here to see the boys with champagne it costs 6 Francs a bottle as a rule (5/-) &amp; they buy a lot of it, its like feeding pigs on strawberries, to see them guzzling the sparkling liquid down</p>
