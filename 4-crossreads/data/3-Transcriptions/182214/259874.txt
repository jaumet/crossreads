<p>we had no wounded and one shell shock case from our unit had to be evacuated.&nbsp; Both got to England and (indecipherable) Howard won the Military Medal the first honours awarded to us. On July 24th I went to Locre in Belgium and saw my brother. He looked veery well indeed and had evidently been having a rough time in the Ypres sector. I only saw him for two hours. He left next day en route for the Somme district where the offensive was still going strong. There he had a rough time about develle Wood and Gullimone. Contracted rheumatic fever and collapsed very nearly died. He eventually got to England when I saw him whilst on my first English leave, July 31st got crimmed &nbsp;for the first time during my military career</p>
