Mess very comfortable &amp; a good lot of young bloods. X  Am too old to think of joining the Flying Corps-<br/>This aerodrome is at J.S. &amp; I had the pleasure of being up with 6 other machines all nicely loaded with BOMBS for the Turks <strike>on the Jordan</strike>   One can judge country well from up above &amp; someday a manager outback will have a look round before breakfast in his monoplane-   All TYPES are here &amp; we are top dog in the air on this front.</p>
