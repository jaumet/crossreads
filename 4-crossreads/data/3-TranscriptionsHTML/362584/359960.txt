<p>caught one to a station &ndash; I forget the name of it, which was not very far from the Headquarters buildings, where we arrived at last, not very well pleased with ourselves. A staff captain gave me some orders to read to the men, which I found out afterwards were entirely wrong, &amp; under his instructions arranged to meet at 9 p.m. on Waterloo station the following Tuesday.</p>
<p>Somebody had advised us to stay at the Imperial Hotel Russell Square (Bloomsbury) &amp; as the name sounded all right, we booked rooms for ourselves &amp; Duffy &amp; Conway who came on later. It's a tremendous place, quite nice &amp; out of the way.</p>
<p>Next day we drove round London in a taxi, which, by the way, is a remarkably cheap way of seeing it. You feel an indescribable sensation on getting out of a taxi to find that the fare is only 8d. After hearing so much &amp; expecting so much of London, we were very disappointed, though it really is a remarkable place. You could go for days &amp; days &amp; see</p>
