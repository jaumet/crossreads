<p>Steenvoorde 20/10/16 Here we have meadows trim, and neat old thatched farmhouses embowered in belts of trees.  The 21st were billeted about here and Colonel Forbes rode along with me towards our destination.  The marching was damned bad owing to our having many new comparatively unseasoned men.  Few fell out but the fours were uneven and ragged.  Arrived in the village of Steenvoorde.  We found that we were a little too early for our billeting parties.  The church has a rather peculiar tower &ndash; not solid.  You can look right through the steeple in "slits".  We passed a cemetery before this and therein upon the verdant sward  between the crowded tombstones of highly respectable burghers  - a lordly Australian, doused with the hop fumes rising from the good ale within his bosom, I took a recuperative sleep in the hallowed spot.  To avoid a halt in the town, kept going through the market square and then continued straight ahead and on what later proved to be the correct road.  Soon we met McLennan and the companies were then drafted off to their destinations.  Very much scattered all of them.  The men were commencing to flag and one crowd became quite a rabble and called for a few biting comments to its O.C.  But it's easy to rouse &ndash; the men are green and want plenty of training.  Our H.Q. billet was uninviting in outside looks but not bad inside with two canopied beds.  The walls plastered with the usual religious pictures and certificates and some educational certificates too.  Noticed today at Poperhinge the same shaped gables on public buildings as are seen on the hotel de Ville &amp; Church of St Vaast at Bailleul and elsewhere.  The Trappist Abbey of Mont de Cats (1832) dominates the whole country from here and should give a fine view of the front at night.</p>
