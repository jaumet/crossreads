Add to this the fact that both in 1914 & 1870 it was proved to be the key of Amiens, & some idea of its importance can be gained. On both occasions Amiens was taken on the following day I believe. I know from experience that from the  western  ridge on the western side of the village the whole stretch of country round Amiens can be seen, & from another ridge nearer the city but still about 5 miles from it, the who of the city can be seen, with the spire of the cathedral predominant in the centre When we halted the march up & I looked back at the city, it reminded me of the view one gets of Salisbury from the Stonehenge road.
