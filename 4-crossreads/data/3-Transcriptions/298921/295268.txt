<p>October, 1915<br/>Sunday 24<br/>[indecipherable] to Khediral O.Z. with Funnell riddled with bullets &amp; shrapnel. Said goodbye to Skipper of good ship "Franconia" who never left the bridge for 3 days &amp; nights &amp; with the sun shining through the mist a good omen we steamed out for Anzac &ndash;<br/>Every man loaded like Father Xmas with all his earthly possessions. Arrived 6.30 p.m. unloaded into Barges, &amp; reached our trenches at No.1 outpost on the left of Popes Hill with only one casualty.</p>
