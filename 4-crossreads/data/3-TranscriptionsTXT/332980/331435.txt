we caught a Train for Audruicq & after one hour run arrived & reported ourselves & each Driver was told off to an Engine, No. 840 was mine & off we went to look for them, they were all coupled up together Oiled & ready to leave, These Engines are from America, made by the Baldwin Locomotive Works & are Six wheel coupled with a Bogie in front, they have the Superheated principle & the Westinghouse Brake, Rocker Bars & a Dump plate to clean the fire quickly also two drop doors at the bottom of the Ash Pan, they are a very high Engine the Driver & Fireman are about 9 ft from the ground & the Driver is on the left side which is Bon for seeing Signals as the are all on the left hand side of the running line.   The Engine & Tender complete for the road were about 100 Tons, after all the Tools were checked & signed for we all moved off at [indecipherable] for St Omer & in 40 minutes arrived at St Omer
