The next day we went by tram out to Waterloo (fifteen miles from Brussels) where we spent a whole day seeing all over the historic battlefield.  It was indeed a great privilege to have done this.  The guide took us to the top of the famous lion monument, from where a great view of the Battlefield can be obtained (it is almost a mile square) and he explained the whole battlefield, also the Battle of Waterloo to us, pointing out the various positions that were occupied by the English, French and Germans.

Stayed the night with my Battalion telling the boys of the great time I had (very few had the luck to get to Paris or Brussels).
