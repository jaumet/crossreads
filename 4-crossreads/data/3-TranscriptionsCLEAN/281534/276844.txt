  
 17/2/19 Cologne Simplicimus we dined & wined them at the club and the Entente Cordiale was cemented in many libations. To Davis room where a flacon of eau de vie disappeared and they fell on our shoulders chanting "excessivement bien!" Out into the night air on a long and disputatious pilgrimage to Bob St where a long meat queue was waiting and the APM was present. Courlette & I left here and wandered home on an all too narrow road and were soon asleep. Davis and the others tried to awaken me at 3 a.m. but could not. Somehow I fear that our gallant Allies will not catch the 7 am train tomorrow morning!. The Fraulein femme de chambre says Gott stafe England & Deutschand unter Alles.
