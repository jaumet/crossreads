We enter the Barrier Reef pass through lots lots of Small Islands which was a very fine sight; we stopped at Palm Island where there was a small mission station. Things were quiet there as we did not know then why we had stopped anchored. HMAS Sydney left us to go to Townsville, in the afternoon, HMAS Encounter came along anchored

Landed two companies for skirmishing drill etc. on Palm Island, we saw no natives on the Island. The Sydney returned during the afternoon, left the Island about 6 pm for the ship, as the boats could not come near enough owing to shallow water, we had to wade up to our waists to get into the ships boats, returned to the Berrima wet through, as I had no second Pair of boots or trousers had to walk about wet, but everyone in best of spirits, concerts every night
Aug 26th 
some of the other companies went on shore did attack defence drill etc. rowed a race against the navy who won easy, as it is not our game. Rabbits for dinner, quite a welcome change;
Aug 27th
boat races between different companies G Coy 2nd in final, big concert on Board, still at Palm Island
Aug 28th
drill on Board by numbers which is sickening to me, who did it before the sergeant who is drilling us was born, rotten way of doing things to my Ideas of Soldiering
Aug 29th
drill, drill, more drill, men who did not know anything about the Game getting soft billets, could not slope arms correctly or turn about right, instead of old soldiers who knew their work
