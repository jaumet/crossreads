9/8/19 Durban
My impression is that civilization must be good for these people as their native condition is little above that of brutes. Civilization, however bad, could hardly still further debase them. At 4.30 we caught a train back once more noticing the jungle, some monkeys in the trees and the sugar cane plantations. In general the dull colour of the landscape is much like Australia. Visited the fine Durban Club and then dined and wined at Twines Hotel. The shops along Durban streets are verandahed in Aust. Fashion. Visited native markets again and found them all closed. The mosque lit up tonight. Coaling still in full swing at the boat but no sailing till Monday.
