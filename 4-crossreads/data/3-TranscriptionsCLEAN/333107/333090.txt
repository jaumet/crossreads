  
 Mon Dec 16.  Boat rolls seem to be made out every day here, so I ought to soon see mt name on one. My hands are that bloomin' cold I can hardly hold the pencil. We are not allowed to light our Fire till after dinner owing to the coal shortage, so we had to do a "perish till then!". 
 Tues 17 What rotten weather, nothing but rain day after day. I'm hanged if I've been warm since being here. It will be a treat to see some sunshine again. 
 Hooray: Got some more mail today. 3 from M.S., 2 Mother, 1 Nell. Mother is going to Sydney at last. I'm jolly glad of that. The change will do her good. 
 Went into Town after Tea. Met Art Williams on the prom. It poured in rain on the return journey and we got somewhat damp. 
 Wed 18.  Another Boat Roll out today but my name did not appear on it. It is quite frosty today, quite a change from the Rain. There are a number of German prisoners working about the Camp. Things are very free and easy in this Camp. I haven't been on Parade since I've been here. In fact I don't know where the Parade Ground is. 
 Thur 19.  Met Bill Beards today who used to work with me at Sutton Very. He has his toe operated on and is marked C1. 
 Sunday Dec 22.  Nothing exciting happened this last few days. I started off to walk into Weymouth yesterday but the weather was so rotten I changed my mind and stayed in Camp. This morning I wrote Mother. I must write France tomorrow or she will begin to think I have forgotten her. Went into Y.M. Hut about 8, where a Lady with a very sweet voice sang a number of songs. 
 I am acting Sergeant of the Day Canteen today. It's not a bad job. The worst part of it is that one has to parade at 10 pm, and it's not too pleasant hanging around these cold nights. 
 Mon 23 Fine day. After Tea walked into Weymouth with Cpl Kesley. Had Tea there, sausages and chipped potatoes. 
 Tues 24. Xmas Eve. 
 Things are very quiet in Camp. It's hard to realise it's Xmas time. Fitzpatrick, our Hut Cpl and Humphries went away yesterday morning. I am Hut Cpl.
