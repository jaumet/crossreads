<p>- Part 7 &ndash;</p>
<p>Saty  -  Nov 7  - 14  There is a stir on  -  We are going to move &ndash; to Sydney is the general idea but no one knows definitely  -  Personally I wish to happen what does happen though the majority want to return to Sydney &ndash; AE2 cant go up on the slip  -  She is leaking we hear  -  We also hear that 5 G cruisers off Valparaiso have engaged 3 British ones &amp; disabled or sunk 2  -  Our friends Scharnhorst &amp; Gneisenau are among these 5 cruisers so we are not doing much good here as a fleet  -</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be best to go back to Sydney for there is a good deal of grousing on the Upolu &amp; its starting point is the Captain  -  He reviles his superior officers &amp; grumbles at his orders &amp; then of necessity all under him do ditto  -  Discipline wants to be stricter  -  Moore's idea of discipline is to be very sweet to his superiors to their face but to his subordinates he is more often bearish in his manner not to say boorish  -  He also permits &ndash; drinking &amp; talking of a vile description &amp; even tries his feeble hand at it himself  -  Well &ndash; I promptly wrote a note to you &amp; posted everything I had to post by 2 pm &amp; then I felt quite a free man  -  There was some tennis on &ndash; a tournament was ended &amp; the Governor gave the prizes  away  -</p>
