 Saturday 8  Fine  We snipe at the Turkish trenches when we see a target. Heaps of dead Turks can be seen round all their trenches which are about 400, 700 & 1100 yds to our front. Our trenches are fairly safe now & loopholed. Nothing exciting happened today We left the fire trench for a rest about 6 PM having done 24 hours on watch. Had to haul up an 8 Pounder gun. It was hard work 
 Sunday 9  Fine . So far we have had plenty of hard work & little or no rest right from the word go. Australia's boys have stuck to it so far & will stick to it to the last. Our platoon went down to the beach for a swim but the enemies shells stopped us after we had got down. Several more chaps wounded with shrapnel. Navy bombarding on extreme right all night. On guard all night.
