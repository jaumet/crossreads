<p>20th January 1916</p>
<p>First rumour today. They are expecting us back in Australia in the First week in February! Have had to take charge of the mail again I thought I had "got shut" of the job. I had the responsibility of looking after the Regiments correspondence for 7 months on the Peninsular and hard work it was too. I had to distribute 5 bags of parcels &amp; papers. Practicing telephone work and Compass work &amp; message sending this afternoon</p>
<p>Extract from Regimental Orders</p>
<p>"The Army Corps Commander desires <strike>that</strike>that  during the period available to the Corps for recuperating, every effort be made to complete the establishment in both personel and equipment. It is essential that the Corps move off as soon as possible</p>
<p>(Interrupted here the orderly came for the orders and I never got them back)</p>
<p>Orders returned balance follows from the word "possible"<br/>"While orginazation is in progress no effort will be spared to improve training and discipline and to maintain the men in that physical vigour that is essential for the successful conduct of the Campaign</p>
