just a fascinating inclination to slide down. If we had been children we probably would have done,Many slightly wounded have arrived from the Somme, among them a Private in the 2nd Grenadier Guards. This is his first trip from the front, excepting leaves, in three years & seven months. Almost a record one would think. Straight through from Mons to the second Somme!
