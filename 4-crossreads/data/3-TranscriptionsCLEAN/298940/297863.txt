The Count - a little red faced prematurely baldheaded, oathsomely agressive yet harmless individual - who is the fourth man of our squad, took one patient with me & Dickson & Kollosche took the other. First we carried through a narrow trench where duckboards are erected about a foot over the floor to allow for water, leaving a space at each side where the unwary might step over. From this the track bends over a small wooden bridge to the tramline. Here we got a truck placed it in the line
