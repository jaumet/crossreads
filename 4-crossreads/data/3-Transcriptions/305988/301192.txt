<p>Major Thorne who used to be in charge of the 5th T.B. - Rollestone; a very brave man.</p>
<p>Well he being the only officer there, he grabbed a rifle and bayonet shouted to the mob, and out he went over the top with an excited mob of men after him with absolutely no formation whatever, advancing in broad daylight to gain what seemed the impossible, but they gained it, yes they got a footing in O.G.1, and then the bombing started. We bombed all that day, chased him up a good distance and formed a block. Then they did the same with O.G.2. That night and the next day there were frequent bombing stunts. And then we were relieved by the 10th. We took some prisoners and they all told us the same thing; That they had been "standing to" for a week waiting for us. They knew we were coming, but they did not exactly know when. Forewarned is Forearmed, so you can imagine the lively reception that we got, but I was lucky enough to pull through it, so everything's OK.</p>
