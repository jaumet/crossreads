 The University of Sydney 
 24th Jany 1916 
 Dear Mr Waterhouse, 
 I am greatly indebted to you for your letter enclosing a photograph of Walter. His work throughout his University course was unfortunately excellent and he shows great promise of doing useful research, so that I grudge his temporary absence in obedience to the 'higher call' almost as much as you do. I sincerely hope and trust that he will return safely with added laurels when victory is achieved. 
 With Kind regards 
 Yours Sincerely 
 Robt D Watt
