<p>&amp; had their business fully explained.  We are moving in a few days apparently to St Omer but after that our destination is obscure.</p>
<p>Oct. 14  Move this afternoon to Steenvorde, a town within French border, 8 miles from Poperinghe.</p>
<p>Oct. 15  Leave Steenvorde at 11 am &amp; marched about 12 miles to Villet [?] about 5 miles north of St Omer.

The country is beautiful hopfields giving way to pastures &amp; fine trees.  Cassel is a fashionable health resort.  More I see of France the more I am enraptured with it.  Berries now galore, blackberries raspberries &amp; currants.</p>
