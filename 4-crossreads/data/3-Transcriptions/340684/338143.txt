<p>467<br/>New Zealand Military Hospital<br/>Walton on Thames<br/>16th December 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father<br/>Many thanks for your kind letter which Jocelyn forwarded on to me. I was awfully pleased to hear such good reports about the Farm and that Billy had quite recovered from  his illness &ndash; Mr Brewerton came on Wednesday and was very pleased with my eye &ndash; He has finished giving me treatment and I will go before a medical board next week when they will decide what they are going to do with me &ndash; the New Zealand people absolutely refuse to part with me and as they are likely to put me down for home service, guarding a railway line or bridge or some similar work  - I am asking</p>
