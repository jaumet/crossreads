30/9/17 Dominion Camp. Esplanade Saps YpresA fine sunny day. Early reveille and cleared the camp by 7.45 a.m. Marched to Ypres. Baird evades by first self inflicting a wound with barbed wire in his hand and then being warned for trenches throws a fit on the road. Sent the doctor after him. We are quartered in the ramparts in dugouts and cellars - good protection but dirty and miserable. At dawn there was a tremendous bombardment lasting over an hour. Last night Taubes were over the camp all the time dropping bombs. What with them & our m.g. fire there was not much sleep for anyone. Searchlights very active and pinned one Gotha for quite a good long time. Went over to see Duggan and the General & found them established in the Cavalry Barracks. A Nissen hut being finished we took it for the night. Good deal of air activity & a little shrapnel. Specialists went up tonight. Arrangements for our assault are now well forward. They have the red diamond painted on the helmets.
