  
 Friday July 13th Plenty of work today. There were a good few drunk here last night, of course it is a usual thing pay day, another thing, all the [indecipherable] go round raffling different things on that day. 
 Saturday July 14th The chap who has been working with me, was taken off today, so I have double work to do now, that is outside, but another fellow was put on the clerical job, so I have only outside work to do now, there isn't very much to do, & if there happens to be any heavy work a fatigue party is always drawn of the parade. Received fourteen letters from Australia. 
 Sunday July 15th Very peculiar day, Sunshine & raining, a couple of very heavy showers too, it seems to have cleared away this evening though. Answering letters nearly all day, all fairly long ones too. All the lads here made a riot this evening about 8 p.m. & it last well into midnight. None of the old hands were in it. The trouble was caused through gambling. Two of them had a fight & the Military Police interferred, one lad was taken to the "clink", & the mob would not let the other be taken, so the M.P. & Warrant Officer tried force, result Corporal M.P. broken jaw in two places. W.O. skin knocked off his face & black eye.
