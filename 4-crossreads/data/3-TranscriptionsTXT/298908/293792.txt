 Have been feeling very restless &amp; discontented all day long so this evening after tea I collared my stick &amp; set out for a long walk.  It was a lovely evening &amp; the air quite sharp &amp; nippy.  Everything looked splendid all the foliage of the beech trees has taken on a lovely golden tint &amp; some are quite yellow, soon they will all begin to fall &amp; cover the ground with a golden mantle heralding the approach of winter.  The grass is quite green yet &amp; so are the hedges.  There are some very pretty walks round here, the one I took tonight is one of my favourites I pass several old fashioned churches nestling among clumps of oaks beeches &amp; pretty flowers, their old towers standing out plainly against the sky while behind them are the chalk hills covered with clumps of scrub &amp; old fashioned thatched farmhouses are here &amp; there with stray stock running round the stables &amp; farmyards waiting for their tucker.
