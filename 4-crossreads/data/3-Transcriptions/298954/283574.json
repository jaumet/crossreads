<p>1918<br/>Mon.  18th Feb.<br/>The "Lyric Lambs" made "Absolutely their last appearance before Touring the Continent" tonight in the Jun. Officers Mess.   The J.O's. Mess is now deplorably filthy, the accumulated rubbish of many moons is littered everywhere but the centre floor is always swept before the concerts.   The dirt goes into the sides against the hull.   The "Lambs" uniforms are now a little more mildewed then ever before &ndash; the collars a little yellower.</p>
<p>The concert was &ndash; musically &ndash; appalling;  actually it was every enjoyable.   There is a big strike on in Kiel;   no food has yet been able to be sent to the scurvy-stricken "Wolf" and the very grand-ships have sent boats over begging for some of the crab, dried beans and musty bread which has nauseated us for months.</p>
<p>Under these circs. a topical skit on the lines of "Mother Hubbard" was a huge success.</p>
