 Saturday Sept 22nd Was paid thirty shillings today, &amp; my word I needed it too, as I was on my last penny. Went down to Portland this afternoon, it is a very quiet town though. 
 Sunday Sept 23rd We are having fine weather now. Was detailed for fatigue this morning but when we got on the job, we were not needed so we went for a walk round the rampart. There is some very pretty scenery around here. One very interesting part, was a seaplane rising &amp; alighting on the water. Went out &amp; got a few blackberries this afternoon, they weren't up to much though. 
 Monday Sept 24th A beautiful day. A boat roll of about 500 was called out today. I was not on it. Another one is expected out on Wednesday next. It was "L" boat roll, so I could not expect to be on it. I am expecting to be on "J".
