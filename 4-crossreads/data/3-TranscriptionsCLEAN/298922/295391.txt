 [The following paragraph crossed through.] Young ROSS son of KIM ROSS people who used to have Horse Teams in the old days is here as a Lieut. He goes into Cairo with a car every day, when I go I go by TRAM or TRAIN, plenty of L.S.D. Do not mention Revolver in notes as we are not allowed to keep any arms taken in war but I have saved so few Trophies though would like to keep this one. NECK alright now & am feeling A1. 
 Thank you for Australasian. I see a lot about DELATITE in the last. 
 [The following sentence crossed through.]  Love to you from your son Frank.
