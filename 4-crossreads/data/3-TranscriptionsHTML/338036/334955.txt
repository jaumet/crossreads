<p>THE 3 DAYS MARCH TO YPRES<br/>[25TH Sept. contd]<br/>as a consequence had to do picket from 3 to 4 am (Wed)</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th<br/>Reveille at 4 am (very dark foggy &amp; wet)  We soon had two or three bonfires  going with the waste wood &amp; rubbish and they acted as good arc lamps.  At soon after 6 am the long march &amp; most of our packs were not feeling at all light.  My work was wagon orderly to a limber wagon &amp; of course had to work the brake. my pack was not carried all way though as occasionally I managed to niggle it on the back of limber.</p>
<p>By midday we had passed through Drianville &amp; Elnes and on arrival Lumbres we halted for a few minutes.  I met Harold Bastian &amp; - Kay (bro to J.W.K.) who are attached to 9th Engrs here.  After about another &frac12; hour we had dinner (or bully &amp; bread) and set out again at 2 pm.  Following the main road we eventually left Wizernes behind and <strike>soon after</strike> couple of hours later St Omer was in sight looking A1.  Passing this town on southern side we came to Arques on the river &amp; got some fruit which was acceptable.  At Arques are a number of CCSs &amp; quite a number of Hospital barges take badly wounded</p>
