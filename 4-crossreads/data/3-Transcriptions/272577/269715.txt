<p>25th October 1916<br/>Early morning stables, signalling in a sort of a way.  Transferred to B. Sub.  Received Australian letters from Lena &amp; Laurie.  Did not go out anywhere.</p>
<p>26th October 1916<br/>Early morning stables.  Did not do much today.  Went for a few strolls.  Passed out of signalling school as A Class.  Working my head in in still going across in class.  Went orderly tonight as D.A.H.Q. orderly.  Received letter from Rana which was opened.</p>
<p>27th October 1916.<br/>On D.A.H.Q. orderly.  Over at Post Office all day taking out telegrams.  Raining every part of the day, very sloppy &amp; rotten.  Cleaning up harness.  Our leave postponed for what reasons we know not.  Mr. Carroll transfered.  Everything getting over the odds.  Makes one sick of the whole show.</p>
<p>28th October 1916.<br/>Fooling about stables all day today.  What with inspection of horses &amp;c. things were very "onkish".  Word tonight of leave being on again.  Did you ever hear the like.  Quite a keystone army this.  Wrote letter for Aust. mail.</p>
<p>29th October 1916<br/>Sunday today.  Raining like blazes.  Went to a church parade in the morning.  Wrote letters for Aust. mail at Y.M.C.A. in the afternoon.  Did not go anywhere else.  Fixed up my saddle &amp;c for tomorrow's manoeuvres.</p>
