<p>But it did not add to his popularity, and in the Australian Army these little incidents are liable to be mursed.  The men fell in four and one of their number posed as an officer. In this way they got through the guard at the gate. Cute, wasn't it? They all returned that night in various stages of sobriety. However, no effort was made to check the men, and no punishment was meted out to them. Strange? No! In the meanwhile the "Demosthenes" (A 64) had departed with nearly two complete Victorian Battalions, from the Pie, right opposite us.
