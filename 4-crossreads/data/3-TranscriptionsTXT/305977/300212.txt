Brigadier delivered a good speech.
Friday 14th [May]Was on pumping fatigue all day.  Got the niggers to do the work while I wrote letters.  Most of the troop went to Cairo.  I stayed on Maadi & didn't get past the Nite  Cafe.  Most of the lads got inebriated & got home at all hours of the morning.
Saturday 15thWe were kept fairly busy most of the morning getting ready & fixing up our kits.  Water was turned off most of the day, so also was the canteen, so we put in a very dry day.  We marched out of camp at 8oclock & got a special train at Maadi.  We had a great march through Cairo, amid wild whoops, yells, etc.  The train for Alexandria was very crowded so we didn't get much sleep during the night.
