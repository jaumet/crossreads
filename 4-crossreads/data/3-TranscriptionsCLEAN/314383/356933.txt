The Cavalry Dr went out & returned at dawn with Mrs. Shed stating the Dr had died during the night from Cholera.  Thus are lost our right hand man & a Christian hero went to his Maker fighting for the cause until the end.
At dawn the outposts opened fire & on going to the ridge saw a party of the enemy in retreat.  Moore feigned sickness & handed over to me.  After altering the disposition we waited for the enemy without avail.  We then pretended to dismantle the guns & retire, hiding just over the crest but without avail, they wouldn't come on.  At noon we set off on towards Taken Tepe hoping the people would be clear of a dangerous gorge a few miles back.  The Cavalry rode on with the convoy while I with my people formed a rear guard.
A patrol had been sent out
