  
 who have been out just a little over a fortnight have to go in again. Saw a balloon of ours come a "gutser" this afternoon. I think a Taube shot her down for we saw one high above here when she started to fall,  out flew 2 parachutes one floated like a huge umbrella over towards us but I could not see no one hanging on to her the other parachute had a man on alright for she descended rapidly a bit too fast I think for the chap on her, the old balloon turned over & over as she neared the ground, & I dare say fell a wreck. Len was sent ahead as billeting N.C.O. to these huts. 24th.  Went for a route march this morning & the road was crowded with troops marching both ways   it was a bonzer morning clear
