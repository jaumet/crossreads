<p>The Battalion settles down to get the hang of its new position,</p>
<p>to improve the existing cover and to do as much damage to Fritz as</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the winter months it is often impossible to</p>
<p>hold continuous lines of trenches owing to the swampy nature of the</p>
<p>country, and on these occasions the line is held by posts arranged</p>
<p>along the trench line or elsewhere, just where the ground is suit-</p>
<p>able.&nbsp; The intervening spaces are covered by machine guns and in</p>
<p>addition patrols watch the gaps by night.&nbsp; The enemy holds his</p>
<p>line in the same manner and for a time the raiding habit was</p>
<p>popular, each side trying to cut off one or more of his opponents</p>
<p>posts.&nbsp; At this type of warfare Fritz is no match for our men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food has to be carried out to the various posts by</p>
<p>night taking advantage of any clouds which may be about in the</p>
<p>event of the moon being bright.&nbsp; On the occasion which I have in</p>
<p>mind the moon was at its full, and this in conjunction with the</p>
<p>snow covered ground made movement very precarious as the enemy was</p>
<p>quite close.&nbsp; Of course we took fullx advantage of it to worry the</p>
<p>Boche, but that is poor comfort to you when you are crawling along</p>
<p>on your stomach through the ice and snow on your visits from Post</p>
<p>to Post.&nbsp; The available officers split the time up so that each</p>
<p>only has a few hours crawling to do each night.&nbsp; Accompanied by</p>
<p>your Patrol Corporal you set off to visit the posts.&nbsp; All is well</p>
<p>until you top a bit of a rise just behind the first line of posts:</p>
<p>now we are on a sort of plateau which is a salient into the enemies</p>
<p>lines.&nbsp; This makes it very awkward as Fritz&#39; snipers and machine</p>
<p>gunners on the left are able to &quot;moon&quot; you against his flares</p>
<p>(which are being sent up a mile or so to your right and rear.</p>
<p>Usually it is only necessary to drop down flat for flares in</p>
