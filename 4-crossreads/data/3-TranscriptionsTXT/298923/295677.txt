11 January 1918 FridayPow wow by General Chaytor this morning had a game of Bridge at B.H.Q. last night after a bath in my oil sheet.Enemy planes bombed a town not far here & some of our anti air craft shells hit a man playing football-WINE is plentiful here & oranges & the Turks did not behave half as badly as some of the Papers state.  I hope to go to Jerusalem in a couple of days after we shift Camp, it is only 24 miles away.
