 Flanders 17-10-17 Dear Mother and Father I am in the delightful position of having written to everyone whom I can think of. We are all quite alright. 
 I remember Sgt. McMurtrie quite well. He was quite a good man &ndash; He must have been pretty sick. He has been away for some time. 
 I think I have answered all your letters now. 
 The weather is quite decent again. Saw a ripping sight this morning. A Bosche aeroplane shot down by one of ours from about 10,000 feet. He did come down nicely with our fellow sporting round and swanking after him. 
 Best love Your affectionate son C.R.Lucas
