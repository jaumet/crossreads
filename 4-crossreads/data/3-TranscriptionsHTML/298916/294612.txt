<p>So this was the escort. I had heard a warship on the wireless set several nights previously.<br/>Not a cheer arose from our men, but in respect our ensign was dipped &amp; she answered, as she drew ahead of the German Australian boys' Oberhausen, then a prize of war, &amp; anchored. At twelve oclock another band was playing, so we all went up on the bridge to see where it came from. It was another battle cruiser the Ibuki, flying the "Rising Sun". Our ensign was dipped &amp; she returned the salute. As our officers stated afterwards, it was one of the smartest actions they ever witnessed to see that Japanese battle cruiser anchor. She stopped in twice her length &amp; before the anchor was down, a boat load of men was coming</p>
