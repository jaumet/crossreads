My dear Aunt Min.I opened your letter to day so am replying to it straight away, although I cant post it till we get to [deleted].So far we have had a splendid trip and I have never missed a meal although I was a bit sea sick yesterday.  It was not very rough but there was a big swell on and a head wind and it upset most of the chaps, however I was alright when I was on deck so I got too big horse mats and slept behind one of the hatches and was right as rain this morning.Today the ship is hardly rocking at all and I have not been able to stop eating all day.I suppose Mother will have gone home by the time you get this; don't you think that she was awfully good the way she let me go off & I hope people will write to her a lot because she needs it more than I do because I have all the excitement to keep me going.You will think that I have been crying in this letter but it started to rain just now and it got wet before I could get it away.  My word every body was good to me when I came way and you especially Aunt Min and will you please thank Charlie for telling Vida at the train that morning; I was sorry not to be able to see him again.  My balaclava cap is grand & I sleep in it every night.  Love to Mr Hungerford and Miss Hungerford & CharlieYour loving nephew.Robert C. Wilson
