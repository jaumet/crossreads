 Feb 1918 left they seem to have been much overrated buildings mostly plaster instead of carved stone as I expected. Even today 3 shells dropped on the main street near the Hall &amp; although there  are  were a lot of men about none were hurt only 2 horses killed. Got a very useful parcel from the Victorian Patriotic Fund containing, Tob, Cigs, Biscuits. Creamy curry powder, Soup cubes Ham Paste, Boot laces Chocolate &amp; Chewing Gum Each man got one &amp; there was some difference in them all 
 Sunday 17th Work. A couple of H.E. shells dropped close to our job just before we left. A lot of Arial Activity today. Fritzie got well over our lines several times &amp; got abay allright. One of our machines came down &ndash; hit with one of our own shells I believe
