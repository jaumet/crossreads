<p>Saturday 24th November 1917</p>
<p>Moved out at 10 a.m. in a Convoy with 20 others &amp; escorted by destroyers.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]<br/>Fairly rough &amp; the little Lady is not so happy as usual - &amp; is in bed. Mother I hope you have had my letters from Alexandria &ndash; my next will be from Cairo &ndash; D.V.</p>
<p>Passed the Eddystone Light House quite closely, could see people on the turret. We go I believe a long way out of our course but the longest way round is the shortest way home.</p>
