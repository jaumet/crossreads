<p>Its most distressing and I think I better leave it to you to tell Roslyn what you think wise when you see how J is.<br/>It irritated him terribly when she wrote him tell him not to work at Cancer. It evidently is not the thing to try and reason with him &ndash; rather without his knowing fill his life with other things. He is so dear and childlike in his appeal to one for human sympathy. He uses such coarse language I believe at times but I never heard it &ndash; nor has he ever told me the vulgar jokes he is reported to tell. He has a wonderful mind. It's just a heartbreaking trial. When he has been the mainstay of his numerous relations and <strike>mean</strike> been so humiliated by some of them that his poor tissues give way with the strain. He is very distrait &ndash; hardly listens to what any <strike>way</strike> one says. I perhaps better enclose a letter to Roslyn for you to read and give to her if you think advisable &ndash; as Col Stawell asked me to write. It's Easter Eve now and I must to bed early if I want to be up for 6.30 Service.</p>
