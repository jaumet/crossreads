<p>are not permitted to send any word, so must hope on &ndash; Thursday worked all day &amp; fearfully busy &ndash; have some very sick patients. Friday afternoon off-duty. To my surprise Ron Thistle called to see me, he brought a friend with him named Smith, such a nice man, was quite pleased Ron has such good taste in choosing him as a pal. They had afternoon tea with us, then I went for a walk with them and we blew-in at the Canteen for a cup of tea about 6. P.m. They brought me back about 7. O'clock. I had promised to go to the French Club to dinner that night. We had a party of six &ndash; Sisters Fleming, Graham &amp; self with three Officers (ex-patients). Had a most enjoyable evening. I do not go out with only one now. Had to stop writing this for an hour or so. Young George Bower has just gone, called in to see me &ndash; he has got a commission, he is Lieut Bower now, he has left Fred's Reg. Joined the Inf. Brigade 60th Batt.</p>
