<p>28-7-15<br/>It was a beautiful moonlight night last night. As soon as we stood to arm this morning there was or rather an attack took place which was quite out of order (we had almost forgotten that we were at war other than the shrapnel greeting us now and again: we stood to arms for 1 hour. Day break this morning was beautiful we could see Embros Island quite plain it was a grand sight with <strike>all</strike> a good number of Trawler anchored about. The men are also billy beat (washed out) &amp; are grubby all day (I don't blame them if one goes to the quack doctor he will give you pills pills for any mortal thing which may be wrong with you. <strike>We go</strike> Two men returned yesterday after being wounded they were not fit to be sent here (Pale about the Gills) &amp; were sent away again today.  Rations were good to day. Fresh Meat Bacon Bully Beef Tea Sugar Onions 6 Milk one Tea to 8 men jam as usual. There is a rumour about a big attack taking place to morrow. Out sapping this afternoon from 16 hrs till 20.00. We got a shower of shrapnel while we were working but the boys are quite broken in by now. When I came back to camp a Corporal whom I had left in camp had cooked my tea (skirt steak) which was just had the doctor order. Thing are very quiet up at the firing line.</p>
<p>29-7-15<br/>We did not stand to arms this morning which of course <strike>we</strike> the men took full advantage re sleeping in until 8 oclock the best night sleep for some time. Rations today Bread &frac12; goad Bacon Jam a mixture of Prunes Vegs &amp; Currents, Rice little Onions [indecipherable] cheese. At last things have been looked into it why the boys are betting great odds that the rations will not going so strong. Out on fatigue again this afternoon from 16.00 till 20.00 but the boys don't mind now that they have got a little belly lining into them. Late this afternoon to aTurkish Tuabe Aeroplane put in an appearance &amp; there was two of our planes up but they did not go after her. She dropped a bomb at one of our batteries but it fell into the water. It did one's eyes good to see the Boys jump in &amp; swim after the prise then were stunned by the shock of the explosion &amp; caused by same. Rum issue</p>
<p>30-7-15<br/>We stood to arms again this morning from 3.15 till 4 oclock, as soon as we stood to arms an attack greeted us it was a pretty warm one, but it not last more than 3 hour. One of our Aeroplanes was up early this morning &amp; sure was going at a terrifick pace Thing livened up somewhat this afternoon one</p>
