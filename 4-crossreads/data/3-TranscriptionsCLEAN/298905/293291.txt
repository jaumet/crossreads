saw one while I was thereKelleway the cricketer got hit today he got one in the hip I believe3rd   Had a night off last night but it was not much good to me for about 1 oclock our fellows started the heaviest bombardment that I have ever heard it is impossible to picture the roar of our guns everything for miles around was all of a tremble & in our billet the plaster on the ceiling started to crack & fall, so you can guess it was pretty severe.The Germans retaliated & shelled Fleurbaix & the billets for all they were worth, they got that close to ours that we had to get up & take refuge in some trenches that are always built close to the billets in case of shell fire
