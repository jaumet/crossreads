  
 shell shock etc - Three fellows that used to carry with me have gone off with shell shock "Penfold, Weeks & Hand". In my wildest dreams, I never thought war meant anything 'like this' - our feet are always wet, our clothes are all over mud & we are getting very poor rations - it is almost unbearable we have to sleep anywhere & on the whole line there's not a decent dug out that would stop a shell, we certainly would all strike to a man on any other mission, tucker or no tucker - wet or dry - cold etc, the only thing that keeps us going is our poor  cobbers , who are so helpless when wounded - What a different tune the ignoramuses sing now of Stretcher Bearers. I haven't had a decent sleep for a week. Had many narrow escapes today - many H.E. burst within 50 yds of me - have been hit with scraps of shrapnel & covered with mud. Saw two of our Aeroplanes brought down after an exciting air dud with a Taub - one poor fellow just dropped plane & all within our lines - & within 10 seconds he was just a charred mass, as he touched the ground there was just one violent explosion & flames finished this sad sight. Two Taubs brought down later. The weather is all against us or the Boys would be in
