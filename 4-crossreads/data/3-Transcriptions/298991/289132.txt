<p>Sunday January 7th<br/>Reveille was at 6.30 am this morning. Everyone was very busy packing up. Fell in 8 am &amp; marched to Mametz, a distance of about ten miles, it was very muddy coming along the road &amp; exceptionally muddy here, very deep in places. A fine day, the best we have had for a long time. Detailed as one of the two cooks for A Section, as the Sergeant said I was too light as a stretcher bearer. Raining tonight. We are camped in huts here, which are perfectly dry (board floors).</p>
<p>Monday January 8th<br/>Raining this morning. Also a very strong cold wind blowing. Left Mametz at 9 am and marched to Longueval, a distance of about 5 miles. The roads are very muddy, &amp; we were held up a couple of times on account of very heavy traffic. We are billeted in huts at the dressing station where we were before. Great improvements have been carried out since we were here before, duck boards everywhere, water laid on &amp; places remodelled. Detailed as assistant cook to A Section. Fritz put a few shells on a hill about half a mile away, one went right amongst some horses.</p>
<p>Tuesday January 9th<br/>There are a good few guns around us here, they are firing unceasingly day &amp; night. Fritz has kept very quiet all day, he put over a few shells early this morning. Have a very light job at the cook house, only having to keep a tank full of water. It is very cold carrying the water though, we have to carry it about two hundred yards. Feet very sore &amp; aching. The twelfth Field Ambulance are in charge here this time. We (bearers of the 4th) are attached to them, also the 13th Field bearers, cooks, &amp; transport.</p>
