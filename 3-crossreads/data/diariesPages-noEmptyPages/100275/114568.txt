lay a couple of miles beyond this on top of a hill, it is a small forest where we pulled up big canvas shelters have been erected for the troops hardly any sun penetrates this beautiful place great big trees are everywhere, we have no trees as green in Australia as the trees grow here, they are more like a hop field of enormous poles there is scarcely a limb on them for nearly 40 ft up, they spread out umberella fashion, they are a sight once seen never forgotten 
It was about 9 o'clock when we arrived here, shortly afterwards we had tea went to bed, soon all were asleep thoroughly tired out.
