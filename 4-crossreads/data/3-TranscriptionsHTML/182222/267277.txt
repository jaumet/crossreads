<p>24/&nbsp; Been on 4 Hectic Days leave &amp; never felt cold all the time. Saw C. in Wareham &amp; stayed - 24<sup>th</sup> - night in camp there. He&#39;s doing C.B. very prettily &amp; everything seems OK. Looks a bit worn &amp; has bad foot but can take nourishment. Sorry I couldn&#39;t stay there longer. Went on to Hortons &amp; was welcomed. Like them Beaucoup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; London needs remoddeling &amp; cleaning. Smells bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 Feb. Feel very off. M. O told me nothing wrong -- go on parade. Went to D<sup>r</sup> Williams in village. Slight pleurisy. Camping alongside O. Room fire by Coleman&#39;s orders.</p>
