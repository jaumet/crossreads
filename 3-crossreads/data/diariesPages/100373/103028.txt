A Free and Easy concert held by the Tasmanian Unit on deck. Good musical talents amongst them. The chairman had an amusing manner of intimating the various items. He intimated the name of the song, the singer’s name and also the nick name he is known by amongst his mates. Instances of the humerous nick names were, the "Fatigue Dodger", the "Greasy Corporal" etc.
