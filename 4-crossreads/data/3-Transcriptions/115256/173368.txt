<p>Monday 19 April 1915</p>
<p>A pleasant surprise was in store for us to-day.  The order came through for the troops to have practise at disembarking, subsequently going to shore and going through a little squad drill by way of exercise.  Happily, this was cancelled and a swimming parade was substituted.  I have never enjoyed a swim so much before.  From this thickly [?] over-crowded, troopship the cold water of the Mediterranean was like an iced whisky and soda after a week on tepid lemonade.</p>
<p>Everybody, officers included, enjoyed themselves to the utmost.  After the bathe, a sun bath, the crowd lying stark naked in the midst of a Lucerne crop which came right to the edge of the sea.  This was followed by a short stroll around the neighbourhood.  This fertile spot is dotted here and there, with small Greek villages.  Everything points towards prosperity, and the inhabitants bear this out with their contented appearance.  At 5 p.m., the pleasant afternoon came to a close and we all went on board in a happy frame of mind.  Australia, unconcerned, takes its troops a few miles from the firing line.  It was a novel sight, well worth the guardians of so many precious lives.  Now and again, a steam cutter passes by and completes this scene of sleep and stillness but, at the same time, been activity and bustle.</p>
