The "Osterly" sailed at 3.30 P.M. We passed Queenscliff and Pt Lonsdale about sunset and I was able to get a good look at the old beach were we used to play when we were kiddies. I saw our old home quite plainly, the sight of that little old house where I was born woke a lot of memoires. We dropped the pilot onside the "Rip" just as the sun went down, rather a thrilling spectacle for there was rather a heavy swell on.

Mal-de-Mer has claimed many victims today. There is a heavy sea running. I have had no indication of sickness as yet but I am thoroughly enjoying this trip.
