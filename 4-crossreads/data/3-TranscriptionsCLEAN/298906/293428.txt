  
 [Note : 1st June 1917] 30th. Lectures up till 4 oclock & then we had the day off, which never meant much for it took us a good while to write our lectures up. 31st This morning I am platoon commander for 4 days have to be pretty slick for we do things in style down here. Lectures all day today will take us till late tonight to catch up, we have fine times here treated like gentlemen & have girls to wait at our tables & 'orderlies" to make our beds for us we do nothing in that line, officers & men are practically on a level footing & they treat us as such. 1st June. Lectures & live bombing today each man threw 2 live bombs & fired 1 rifle grenade
