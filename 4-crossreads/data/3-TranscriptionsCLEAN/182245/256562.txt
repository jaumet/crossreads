 FEBRUARY 1917 
 16 FRIDAY 
 Fine & dull all day, but came on a 
 bit showery at night. Cleaning 
 harness all morning & out 
 exercising in afternoon. They 
 are starting to fool round 
 again & make everything for show. 
 We have to wear gas masks 
 bandoliers ect out exercising 
 now. They are hurling the Tommies 
 down our throat at all possible 
 occasions; the Tommies do this 
 & the Tommies do that so why 
 dont you do it. I never want 
 to see a pommie after the war. 
 The battery was called out about 
 7 pm to take up ammunition 
 & we were fooling about. I did 
 not get back till 3 AM. Nobody 
 seemed to know anything about 
 the stuff, & when we got unloaded 
 nobody knew were we were to 
 load again.
