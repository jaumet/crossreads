<p>I did not send the beads, but they must go forward during the coming week.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the newspaper cuttings.  The Labour people under J. J. Ryan swept the Queensland poles to the parliament house.  J. J. R. I note comes from my old college, the Jesuits in Melbourne.   The American note to Germany was a real frost, and subsequent events tend to show that Wilson meant nothing by it.   The Yanks are out for making money out of the war and human lives have no weight in the balance as against the almighty dollar.</p>
<p>Mr. Holman is in a peculiar position in regard to the referendum proposals, I note that he was at Adelaide still opposed to them, it will be difficult for him to steer clear of them if they be submitted at an early date, he is clever but the weight may be too much for him, Hughes and Fisher are very persistent and the result of the Queensland elections will encourage them to try to coerce N.

<p>Kitty dear:   You were a very good girl to write to me two letters.  I thank you muchly for them.  The first bears date 21st May 15.   Getting old for birthdays, my dear, none the less did I appreciate the cable which you sent to me.   Thanks.   Yes my dear:   Giddy old Mike Bridges and the rest are the price we pay for such a luxury as war.   Have you noted how warlike have become those people of peace, Miss Rose Scott, Mr. Holman, and the others who during many years have been saying that man has become too advanced to war ever again?   My best wishes to Mr. Anderson, Mrs. Maitland and your other friends.   I have heard nothing about Dot Patens young man.   No time for riding these days, and the weather is too warm, were I to go out it needs to be between four and seven o'clock in the morning.  Good Maria.  A tie for the writing is the correct decision.   A jolly fine artist at getting out of a difficulty is</p>
