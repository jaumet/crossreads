the line in a most disgraceful state nearly all the duckboards were under water & slush the parapets & dugouts were in a shocking state, & as for communications & reserve trenches well they simply didn't exist for all the use they would have been if ever the Germans made an attack, things are a bit different now, its wonderful the improvements that have been effected even in so short a time. we have built 2 more new communication trenches numerous saps, besides improving all other things out of sight, the Tommies would scarcely know this part of the line now if they were to return.We had a sing song last night in our billet this war so far as we are concerned is nothing but a huge picnic compared to Gallipoli.
