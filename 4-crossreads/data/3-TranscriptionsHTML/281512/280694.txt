The casualties have been heavy, but out of proportion to the important advance &amp; great number of Boche prisoners. I'm sick of being amongst killed &amp; wounded &amp; hearing that hellish din of cannonade &amp;  dodging shells. One becomes a fatalist &amp; I am convinced its no good shell dodging. We have even a worse time than the infantry, for to get pictures one must go into the hottest &amp; even then come out disappointed. To get War pictures of striking interest &amp;</p>
