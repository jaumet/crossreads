<p>the trip.</p>
<p>Our next experience was that of being conveyed round the town in a rickshaw.  These rickshaws boys are as hard as steel very long winded, thin and wiry.</p>
<p>They appear to me as a pair of human bellows and built for speed on account of their thinness</p>
<p>No doubt they can run for hours, up hill and down dale without varying their pace and never tire.</p>
<p>After an hour of this we had tea and reported back on board and looking forward</p>
