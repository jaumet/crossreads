 Dear Dad & Mum & George, 
 Just a few more lines to let you know that we have never enjoyed any Holiday half as well as we enjoying our work here.  We only have two treatments a day, each one lasting about 2 to 3 hours & then we have the rest of the time to smoke & fish & eat oysters.  We are told that we get 3 days a fortnight leave, so we are feeling quite right now.  We will not be home just yet a while.  There is a roster made out & we go as we are put down.  We are tearing into the work which is interesting, & are as used to it now as walking up down the measlie wards.  There is no risk when you are amongst it.  It is only when you are going into places where you do not know there has been any patients.  We only have five chaps in our tent so far but expect to have 2 or 3 more in a couple of days.  We have Ted Grundy that I told you of & Horace Norton one of the Petersham Federals.  We are getting 12 more men up to-day.  They will make our staff up to 50 strong with fatigue men included.  This is a terrible place for cigarettes, tobacco & matches.  It is pay-day to-day or on Monday, we do not know which yet, & of course everybody is stony.  You can't walk 10 yds. with
