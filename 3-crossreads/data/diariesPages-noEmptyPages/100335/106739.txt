a long way on our right and yesterday St Helena Island away on our left, and now we are making straight for the Cape of Good Hope hoping to round it this day week. The Weather lately has been cloudy and threatening but the rain has held off, It is cool all day long and more pleasant down below of a night to sleep and towards morning a Blanket is required. F Yesterday Saturday brought excitement for all on board,. Orders were issued for a Life Belt Parade at 4 Pm, and about that time the Siren blew one blast and all hands proceeded to their allotted posts, I took up my position on the lower Promenade Deck starboard side about 20 minutes later the Siren blew again and we all took it for the Signal that the Parade was dismissed, when all of a sudden the Boat stopped and word quickly went about that a Man was overboard on the Port Side. I hurried through the Saloon Entrance to the other Side and saw the Crew launching a Boat quickly from the Boat Deck, one chap told me that a Man had fallen from the Boat Deck above and a Life Buoy had been thrown to him. Our Ship by this time had formed a circle and making towards the Spot where the Man fell, in the meantime the Life Boat with 6 men were pulling strong against a fair Sea, the Siren blew several blasts evidently directing the Crew, word could be heard from the boys that they could see the Man swimming in the Water, after a lapse of 20 minutes a Digger is supposed to have seen him from up
