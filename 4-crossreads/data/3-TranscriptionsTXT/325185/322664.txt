I went down to see if I could find Reg Gibson but was told he isint in the 11th of 2nd so am waiting now in hopes of his finding me. I daresay Bert will soon be making across now. If this reaches you before he leaves. Tell him to come out to Abaseir if we haven't gone to the front will be there I dare say. I think we will do the winter here now move after the cold weather some where not Galipoli either.
