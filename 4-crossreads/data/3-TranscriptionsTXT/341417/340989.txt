 Dear Miss King 
 Am dropping you a few lines letting you know that I have commenced my long journey for home. 
 I left my Battalion on the 13th of Feb. for a demobilisation camp at Le Havre and expect to be leaving any day for England. I expect to be in England some time before I embark for dear old Aussie but nevertheless I will soon be home. We were very unfortunate not going to Germany, but I think the authorities were wise in not sending us. 
 I hope you are in the best of health after all the good work you have been doing for the last 4 years and I sincerely hope I return and find you all well and contented. 
 Best Wishes Yours Sincerely. Sgt. R. Otto. 2nd Battalion AIF.
