<p>the Doctors hands as wounded, but those of his own section B[dash] McC[dash] &amp; also C M[dash] were not there nor were others belonging to the Coy.</p>
<p>About five oclock the following afternoon the whole of the representatives of A Coy were formed up for roll call those left in the support line had moved into the "base" billet, that same morning.</p>
<p>Each man, able to carry it, was issued with his pack together with what surplus rations which otherwise would have to be left behind. Not being much the rations were easily carried</p>
<p>The total number of A Coy men, reported present, amounted to 87 and as the number who went into action totalled 187, exactly 100 men were killed, missing and wounded.</p>
<p>The following day orders were received by the Sergt in Charge to proceed with the "remnants" of A Coy to a billet at Ligny-Thilloy, "about a mile or so the other side of Bapaume".</p>
<p>A march of about 5 miles was then started. Most of the men were very tired &amp; sore &amp; a good many were a little depressed at the thought of the loss of their "cobbers" or "pals".</p>
<p>However as the march was made under the direction of A Coy's Sergt &amp; was therefore without the incessant "jaw" and "roar" that usually occurs when an officer is in charge after going about two miles the feelings of depression had worn off &amp; the whole of the men began to get quite light hearted &amp; merry &amp; in a very short time every man had resumed his "every day" happy go lucky manner.</p>
<p>Any humourous incident that had happened was "loudly" retailed for the benefit of all &amp; general, chaff was the order of the day. One man caused quite a hearty laugh by relating that a certain very well known officer (not in A Coy) well known, if for no other reason, because he held the reputation of being the finest officer in the battalion for seeing that the men were fed. Whenever on duty in connection with "tucker", he always saw that if "tucker" was to be obtained no matter who else</p>
