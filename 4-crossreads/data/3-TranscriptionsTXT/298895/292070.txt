As I sit on the grass during the cool of the evening the sound of laughter &amp; happy voices can be plainly heard all round.  Football is being played and contentment apparently reigns supreme, and all within full view of at least six German observation balloons. Sunday 13th May    Not a great deal doing just the usual firing going on &amp; ordinary flow of wounded.  Had tea at the 14th Battery where I knew a few fellows.  Had a couple of taubes over, the lads firing away with their rifles at them weather hot &amp; oppressive. Monday 14th May    Spent the morning taking over &amp; sorting drugs &amp; dressings left behind by the 3rd Fd.a. their condition showing a messer of a dispenser.  Witnessed a very thrilling incident at midday.  A taube came over &amp; was promptly shelled by our batteries.
