<p>forest has to a large extent ceased to exist. Much has been cut down during the war &amp; also for defensive purposes as the wood contains Montmorency &amp; Montlegnon two of the outer ring of [indecipherable] of Paris. Rousseau sheltering place is in Rue Gretry which we entered in error.</p>
<p>A cafe called the Ermitage was our aim in Boul. d. l'Ermitage we return to chez abel &amp; pass a pleasant evening &amp; then set off for Lake Enghien (1/2 M by &frac14; mile).</p>
<p>The edge of the lake is fringed with the houses of the noveau riche of Napoleonic times but very beautiful. One in particular [a small sketch here] took my fancy &amp; I may reproduce it in my chateau.</p>
<p>The avenue [de Ceinlare] forms a pleasant wooded walk especially on such a night as this is. Calm &amp; peaceful with a full moon &ndash; the moon whose silver rays can lend enchantment to any scene &amp; which gloss &amp; beautify what the glaring light of unsympathetic day only reveals in its squalor.</p>
<p>On the banks of the lac stand the great Casino where life &amp; gambling run high. Now it stands a white skeleton in the moonlight &ndash; a souvenir of remembrance of the devasting influence of war for it has not opened its door &amp; the myriad lights that once shone in its gardens are now extinguished soon however it may re open</p>
