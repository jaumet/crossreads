<p>After all the &quot;Tassies&quot; have left the Rio Pardo, quite reluctantly, I am sure! - we steam out to sea once again.</p>
<p>Of course the anchor is lifted before doing so.</p>
<p>A very rough sea proves friendly after we turn North.</p>
<p><u>July 22nd</u></p>
<p>A bright, sunny day!&nbsp; At noon we have 411 miles to travel to &quot;Our Harbour&quot;.</p>
<p>We now number 150 N.S.Welshmen and 40 Queenslanders.</p>
