<p>wanted me to go off duty.  Nothing much doing during the day, so did not overwork myself</p>
<p>Wednesday 17th April<br/>My birthday. Today I reach the 30 year mark &amp; certainly feel it at the moment.  This is my fourth birthday in the army &amp; I sometimes feel that I'm tired &amp; would like a spell.  Just at the moment I am feeling very weak &amp; ill.  Last night was another bad one, I was up several times &amp; then we were shelled, one falling within 10 yds of our cottage &amp; breaking a window only.  Between my sickness &amp; Fritz I was feeling anyhow.  Slept in until 10 AM. to make up for the poor night but found as soon as I turned up at the Station there was plenty to do.  Several gas cases were coming through &amp; our new officers were fresh to the treatment.  It appears that the sector has been heavily shelled with mustard &amp; we have had hundreds of casualties, about 600 went through from this sector during the day.</p>
