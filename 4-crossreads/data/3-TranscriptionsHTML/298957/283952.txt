<p>Another route march round the old earthworks and more signalling. With Lennie Rial &amp; Allan Bruce I witnessed a queer performance in a canteen &ndash; A big burly Australian was actually eating crockery. He bit a mouthful out of a saucer, chewed it up, then drank a bottle of sauce after it. This is a positive fact.</p>
