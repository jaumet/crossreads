<p>into the Place.  We got the water pumped away later on.  The sum total of my work this morning I will give you in detail.  I took (1) a patient up to the Skin Specialist, (2) wrote out a Diet sheet, (3) Inspected the Patients Dinner.  This afternoon I walked around the Tents of my section with the O.C. 1/C.  This is my second job this afternoon.  When this is finished I've got to kill time until 4.15 p.m. Tea &amp; then I'll get cleaned &amp; go down to the Y.M.C.A. Concert.  A good job I've got eh! what!  Some days I get very busy but it is only some days.  There is nothing to write to you about at all.  I spend nearly every evening at the Y.M.C.A. arriving Home for supper about 9 p.m.  It is going on for 4 p.m. now so I will go &amp; clean my boots &amp; leggings before Tea.  We are both well now &amp; having as easy a time as possible.</p>
<p>Best Love to you all,<br/>Harry.</p>
