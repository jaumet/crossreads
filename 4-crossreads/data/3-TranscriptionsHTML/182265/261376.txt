I think of a big tank, or several of them, on wagons, being hauled over a corduroy road. Some of the guns over 10 miles away shake the sandbag walls of my tent, while the naval 10 inch gun about &frac14; mile away shakes the earth here quite violently.

<p><u>6.10.17</u> Have a slight cold so have just had a hot rum &amp; condensed milk &amp; got to bed. Raining nearly all day. Went for a long walk this evening for exercise. Very muddy &amp; slushy. Took 6 men over to Kruisstraat Farm to act as runners for Signallers. Inspected men&#39;s feet, all O.K. Received a big mail today for the company. I received 5 from Joy. Wrote to J - the 6th time this week. Read magazine.</p>
