 My dear Judge, 
 I sent a cable to you last night.  I don't remember having written to you lately.  We have been moving about a good deal and my letters have been accumulating shockingly.  Last night I wrote 9 straight off and then went to bed in an almost unconscious condition. 
 We are on a delightful sector at the present time and everybody is very happy.  I am living in an old German Pillbox affair, very comfortable and fairly safe.  We have got our mess decently established here and can get a good night's sleep every night so what more can be desired.  There is a great deal of work to do in the daytime, mostly consisting of walking, walking for miles and messing around supervising &c. 
 Alroy is commanding a company and is doing quite well.  His methods are however very trying and he will get himself all over mud and will wear everything he has in
