for some time yet. as they have friends and Relations who are only too Ready to keep them, as long as they care to stay. when they get back they, or some of them will be caught, and Perhaps fined and given a spell in "Detention" but that has no terror for them, and they do not count it as a disgrace, for the heads of the army have gone to such a lot of trouble to manufacture "crimes" and then enforce the Punishments for them on every possible occasion. That men do not care. One man reported here after 69 days holiday, of course he was grabbed, but when they hunted up their Records they found that they had no Record of him, his name was not on any Roll. so they let him go, and now he is on a Staff job. "here men are in Responsible positions in these camps, and when at Bovington, I overheard on Officer in the Orderly Room say "that if he had a business in Civil life, that was so Rottenly managed and, carried on in such a slipshod bungling manner," he would burn it, and then try to start afresh." I quite agree with him their lack of system, is evident to all, who care to take notice.
