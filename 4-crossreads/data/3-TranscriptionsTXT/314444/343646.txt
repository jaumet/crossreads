Dearest Mother, Father & Little Sister
I expect you are wondering how I am getting on. Well I am quite well & having a good time. I am still in very good health & losing no weight Under the conditions the food etc is good We all cook our own food. I make quite a fine dish out of tinned beef, onions rice & preserved potatoes. I enjoy it tip top and feel in tip top order for a scrap after I have finished.There is no mistake this is beautiful farming country. I think you could grow anything. Stanley is quite well & wishes to be remembered to you all , also Q M Potts & Paddy Hayes. Remember me to all my friends & tell them I am quite well.Now dear Mother & Dorothy do not worry about me as I am safe as a church & after all only doing my duty. By the way have a good Xmas dinner & the good old Monopole, as it will all be over then. Give my love to Helen. Hoping you are all well With love & etc Your loving SonTom.
