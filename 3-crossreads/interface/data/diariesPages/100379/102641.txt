21st January 1917. Early morning stables. On sanitary fatigue all day. Bombardment very heavy all around the "Horseshoe". This is the name given to the front on which we are at present. Armentieres forming the frontal part of the shoe. Still very cold the ground frosty hard which is a blessing. Some more of our gunners went up to the pits today. Did not go out tonight.
22nd January 1917. Early morning stables. Got word today that I was to go up to the guns as telephonist on the staff of the 25th. Somewhat glad at the idea of getting away from this hole. Left the wagon lines at 4 and arrived at Armentieres at 4.45 and got to the guns at 5.30. Reported got fixed up in our dugout which we hope to make very comfortable. Visited the boys at the pits afterwards went to bed ready for going on duty at 4 oclock tomorrow morning.
