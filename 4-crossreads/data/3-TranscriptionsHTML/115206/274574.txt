<p>January 1918<br/>Friday 4</p>
<p>At Beutin<br/>I have to report my first visit to the M.O. today. For the past few days my old wisdom tooth has been having a great time, and I have not had too much sleep. I departed to the dentist via the M.O. to have the cause of the trouble removed. After riding 40 kilos there and home I had the satisfaction of knowing that tomorrow will see the end of my trouble.<br/>Mac has not yet returned from B. our Rough team played today and won . Very heavy frost.  Roads like glass.</p>
