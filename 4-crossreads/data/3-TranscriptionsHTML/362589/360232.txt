<p>Gallipoli<br/>2nd December 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father,<br/>I've just received notification from the Eastern Telegraph Company, that I can foreward Cablegrams to you without prepayment so have just sent along a word or two to test the working. It will probably take somewhere about 3 weeks to get from here to Alexandria so you ought to have received it somewhere about Christmas. Everything has been going on much as usual here with a little additional amusement &amp; excitement &amp; just a few falls of snow to give us a touch of what we may expect later on. I've <strike>le</strike> seen enough snow to last me some years, the only redeeming feature it has is that it increases our water supply, but as it is now too cold to wash more than about once a month, where does the advantage come in?<br/>Yr loving son<br/><u>Arthur</u></p>
