The work in the Cabin is fairly easy during the day, not many trains about. There is an engine comes up every morning at 7.30 am &amp; shunts the sidings at the aerodrome &amp; petrol dump, where as a rule a lot of material is handled. There are about 1000 German prisoners working in the aerodrome loading &amp; unloading material from the trucks &amp; as a rule they all are kept fairly busy.
