Notes to 12th NovrJoined 2 2nd Expedy Force Septr 10th & went into camp at Roseberry Park on the 11th.  Found things pretty rough there, arrangements not completed.  Caught a bad cold & it rained for several days.  Shifted camp to Rosehill on the 23rd Sept & had a fairly rough week there.  Our regt was moved to Liverpool on the 30th & conditions got much better.  A big recreation tent was erected & we had a fair amount of room to drill.  We had a lot of rain at Liverpool during the first 2 weeks & the parade ground got very sloppy.  However we had a fairly easy time & got a good amount of leave.  We had all foot drill up till the end of October.  We got some excitement when our horses were given us.  Spills were very common.
