  
 You must  not  take old Pete too seriously.  I hope they are happy anyhow & he certainly has a prize. 
 How did the Races go on 29 Dec.  I wonder what sort of a time you are having at Manly. 
 Well Mistress mine I must slope off.  I wish I could write pages and pages but somehow the gift isn't there.  Its sweet of you to write so often & at such times & I appreciate & am most puffed up & I'm not getting tubby & bald, just greyer than ever & very pursey round the eyes.  My boots still twist into weird shapes, I'll never be a soldier like person but I get along somehow. 
 I will write soon again, my stress of work won't last for ever thank Gawd. 
 I was out riding today about the 3rd time in 6 months, I love ? it as much as ever.  I'm afraid I shall never love riding again now that Gramps is dead.  What will I do, I'll never manage a motor bike or car & I can't walk everywhere & I can't sit still like a cabbage. 
 I'm quite anxious about your book, I do wonder how the first is faring & how the second progressing.  How is Graham & is he loving the surf, I'm hating missing his growing up. 
 Hope Mac is less worried & the Boss doing & keeping well.  Tell the dear old chaps I'll write very soon.  Cheerio my very dear missus, much love & every good wish. 
 Yours always Wilks
