 We are very comfortable here &amp; should like very much to be on the Staff here but no such luck. Last Monday had a busy day at Headquarters, pay-office etc.  Tuesday , shopped in the morning, had luncheon at a large shop named Selfridges. Then went to Westminster Abbey &amp; it took all the afternoon &amp; then felt as if we had only passed through. It is a most wonderful place &amp; of course full of interest, so sorry  I cannot go into detail but hope to do so when I return.
