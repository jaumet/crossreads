yet. Just as we had finished dinner and were preparing to yoke up, a curious figure made its appearance on the hill. A big stout man, dressed in a long and voluminous robe of a black coarse material with capacious hood hanging down his back, and an enormous crucifix suspended from his portly waist, and a large and bespectacled face, with full black beard, crowned with a big white cloth hat. He smilingly bade us "good day" in broken English. In answer to my enquiries, he pointed out the Monastry of El Khoubbieh on our left, from whence he had come, and told me that the famous Nebi Samwil lay on our right towards the north east. Crowning the height on our right was the village of El Sukir.
After our fresh start, we found the road a good deal better. I must not forget to mention the wonderful view we had from the top of the hill previous to our accident. Looking out to the west, one can see the coast line almost up to Cesaeria, Jaffa, Ramleh, Ludd, and all the smaller towns of the plain are clearly visible, and then the blue line of the Mediterranean stretches away on the left for many many miles into country totally unrecognisable to me, though we must have seen a good deal of it.
Turning our back on the Mediterranean the first thing that attracts one's gaze is the outskirts of the Holy City. Then away in front and to the right, stretch miles of the terriced rugged hills, little spots of green cultivated patches showing vividly on their sides, and with many of them, their peaks crowned with tiny villages. A journey of perhaps a mile, and we had passed a portion of the Battery, who were unyoked for dinner.

There are many of these about, mostly used for stabling animals, some with mangers complete, all carved from solid rock.
Soon on our right, we saw a beautiful lake of water, a natural reservoir formed in a basin
