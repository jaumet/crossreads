  
 19/5/15  Punch  From home to the Trenches  
 Sonny, it seems like twenty year, The while since you've been gone, And left me lonesome for you here Trying to do my bit - oh ,dear! - By keeping steady on. 
 I promised and I've meant to do, But now and then at night I've been to blame the time it blew Like guns that answered guns, with you - My you - amongst the fight. 
 But in the morning "Dear old fool" I've seemed to hear you say; "Mother, no need to fuss, keep cool," Just like the Cheeky brat at school You was the other day. 
 You wasn't always quite so grand; Once you was mighty glad, Chased by a puppy- dog, to stand Behind your mummy, slip your hand In hers, the way you had. 
 Small son turned big, now that you're grown And in a real war, And set to face it all alone, I'm wild to run & guard my own Same as I did before.
