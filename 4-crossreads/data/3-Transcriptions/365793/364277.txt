Was coming out of the YM &amp; fell head over heels into a nice heap of stones.<br/>Recd a letter from Uncle, &amp; one from the NSW Bank re &pound; 25 cabled to me. Written a long letter home. This eye socket gives me jip at times, &amp; the glare of the sun &amp; much walking or reading makes me feel dizzy. Packs are at Plymouth so have written for them to be sent on here<br/>[in margin] M</p>
