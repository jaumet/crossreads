2/3/19 Marcinelle
Usual morning yarn round at 22nd. At 1.30 left for Gourdinne in a Ford ambulance and commenced a round of visits. Madame Crochelet produced a good bottle of wine and then I went round to Legaits and had coffee and biscuits with the charming Yvonne family. Then down to the Brasserie where were M. Fernand, Mdlle Anna, The Secry of the Commune another friend. We drank wine and talked and they had all long since reached the conversational stage. They are a wise race and have all the pleasures of imbibing without ill after-effects by observing proper restraint in keeping away from drunkeness. Gave Yvonne a lift back to Charleroi in our car and after dinner I wrote and read.
