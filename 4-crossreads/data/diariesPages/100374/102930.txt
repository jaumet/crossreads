While seated at the cross roads, who should come along but Major Brooke Moore, one of the officers. He was on the hunt for some excitement. After having a look round he offered us a ride back to the C.C.S. in a Motor Amb, a thing we gladly accepted.

July 29th. Saturday

Weather beautiful, something like summer weather.

Went for a walk across country. Passing through fields of beans, peas, oats, potatoes, etc. This struck me as a good business point of these peasant who do not believe in putting all their eggs into one basket.
