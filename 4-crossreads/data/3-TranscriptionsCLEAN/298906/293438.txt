14th. Was out scouting this morning Colonel Beghy took us out he is a fine old chap & travels like the wind, belongs to H.L.I. & what he does not know about scouting isn't worth knowing. This afternoon we were out on the parade ground drilling like maniacs racing round & round like madmen.15th. This morning we were out all around the country, & when we came back we had to sketch the country we had passed over & make all sorts of notes on it. In the afternoon we were on the square again drilling for our lives every man had to come out & drill the squad & Company in his turn, caused a bit of fun I can tell you.
