Sunday 4 June 1916A fine morning but a very light drizzle in the afternoon. After breakfast had to take the company to the divl. laundry to have their helmets inspected, getting back in time to fall in for Church Parade at 11 o'c. in the Sailly hall. It seemed strange to have men in battle order for a church parade : padre was 20 min. late turning up & then it was a most formal service without any sermon or address : there was something in the united singing &c. however, & I was glad of the opportunity of attending. Soon after lunch Rid came in for a short time after having held 2 or 3 very successful services : as usual was so glad of a yarn. A small mail came in from Aust. just as he arrived. Soon after he had gone Leo put in an appearance & together we set out to go & hear Gipsy Smith who was down to speak in the Sailly hall : however met 2 officers en route & by the time we reached the hall the meeting was over.However I met Gipsy Smith & shook hands with him. Writing letters during the evening.
