<p>As I said I took sick and had to go to Harefield Hospital which is 30 miles away from London, and while there I had a good time.  Harefield is a very pretty place but has no town of any sort, it is a very healthy place.</p>
<p>I remained there for a week, and from there down to Weymouth again this time I went to Weymouth everything was different in the camp.  I was sent to Monte Video Camp, and here I met a few of my old friends that I was with before.  After spending a few weeks at Monte Video in which I did plenty of guard and fatigues I was sent to Verne Citadel which was a new place opened for our boys.</p>
<p>This place I may mention is on a very big hill in fact</p>
