<p>June 1915<br/>Tuesday 15<br/>Fine.    Very windy.  A hostile aeroplane again dropped some bombs here doing no damage fortunately and made a good escape although he was fired on by our warships. Am well looked after here. There are many patients here. <u>Cholera</u> has broken out</p>
<p>Wednesday 16<br/>Very windy. I have been placed with the medical patients in P Ward (a large roomy tent). The doctor examines us regularly at 9 AM each morning. The orderly is very attentive to his duties</p>
