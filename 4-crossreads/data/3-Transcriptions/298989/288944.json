<p>9/1/16<br/>Up at 0720 bright sun shining but cold morning. Messing with Q.M. at 0900 fell in for church parade caps sidearms &amp; got a good square fixed up with padre in centre. Will order <strike>caps</strike> hats in future the sun getting too hot on the necks. Struck all tents at 0900 and shifted on to new ground. Roth pegged the camp out. Had a yarn with young Simonson. Very busy in the office at work on correspondence and returns &amp;c.  Saw a transport wagon full of natives go along all chanting to a chorus filthy brutes like a wagon load of monkeys. Arranged guard &amp; other duties for tomorrow. The desert here has set hard with the rain and there is very little soakage in the pits. It seems quite different from Heliopolis. Our transport and mule drivers rejoined after some going to Salonika. This will be a big camp when all the tents are pitched in it.</p>
<p>10/1/16<br/>Rose 0630 and at first parade marched the whole battalion out into the desert and sat them down there checking their kits. Parcel arrived from Jakey also some papers and other things. Afternoon at drill delightful day a little warm but nothing to growl about. Fairly busy in office in fact am just about full up of the job and would relish a change for a while. In a day or two will take to horse again and ride. Still without tents and no leave is being granted as yet. Brigade slow Divn slower.  Goucher left today. HJ back.</p>
