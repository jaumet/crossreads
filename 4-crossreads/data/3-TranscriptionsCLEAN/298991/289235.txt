Wednesday Nov 7thStill a very heavy swell on. This is a great old boat to roll. The wind is blowing behind us, we also have the current in our favour.
Thursday Nov 8thDeck billiards are all the go now. A good few matches have been played. Kept down below all day, as it was very windy & cold up on top.
Friday Nov 9thMuch better day. Sea much calmer. Expect to be in Fremantle on Monday morning. All the winches & ropes have been got ready to start operations as soon as we arrive in port.
Saturday Nov 10thIt was a very nice day today. The best we have had since leaving Capetown. Numerous comical posters have been put up, about different states. West Australia, Victoria & N.S.W. have suffered most. We have an artist on board, & he has contributed a good few very funny sketches.
