  
 Sunday 29 August, 1915 
 Should have been a day of rest but it has been the greatest battering we have had since I have been here. We blew up a Turkish sap a few yards away from our gun pit, we just got out in time. The charge exploded as we came out of the tunnel. Water is the great problem here. We have to carry all we drink for over a mile. 
 I had Les Payhem over for a yarn today, I was very glad to see him. 
 Shells have been crashing into our position all day. There are a couple of guns we can't locate & they are a veritable thorn in our side, you hear the whizz bang of shrapnel at the most unexpected times & places. You never know when one will come close enough to put you out of action. 
 Great engineering skill has been used in making the valley as safe as possible. There must be 5 miles of saps 6 ft deep & 4 ft wide dug by the infantry at night.
