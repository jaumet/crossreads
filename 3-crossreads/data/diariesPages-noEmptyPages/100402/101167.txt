Friday 15 November
Still at Bussigny. We are liable to move at any time to the Frontier, but I think that we will have to go on foot. We are having glorious weather the moonlit nights are no longer feared for fear of visits of enemy ?planes. We saw a very fine show to-night, the "Pedlars" it is the best we have seen in France.
