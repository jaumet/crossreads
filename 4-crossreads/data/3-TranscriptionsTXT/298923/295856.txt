 9 July 1918 Tuesday Out wiring last night Jacko shelled the adjoining hill pretty badly &amp; made good fireworks, we dont get home  to  until midnight or 1 0'clock &amp; stand to arms again at half past 3, so can do a sleep  [indecipherable] gone "phut" again -  Reinforcements come, stop a week or 10 days &amp; go, evacuated sick, only a few of the hard old survivors hang on &amp; make the back-bone of each troop-   permanently my nerves are rotten  Anyway the type being sent  from Australia now are a poor lot  &amp; don't seem to last more than a few nights wiring etc:-
