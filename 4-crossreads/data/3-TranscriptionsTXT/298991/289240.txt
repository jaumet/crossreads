 Monday Nov 19th A lovely day. Had dinner at 10.30 am, so as to enable us to get away early. We were taken down to Elsternwick railway station by motor, but as the trains were delayed three quarter of an hour, we were taken back to the hospital, &amp; brought back again, an hour later. I was lucky enough to get on the first train. (there were two) We were put in first class carriages, which were very comfortable, The Red Cross, kept up a good supply of cigarettes, cakes, sweets, &amp; drinks, also a pair of light slippers to wear in the train. 
 We received a very good reception all along the line, arrived in Albury about 9 pm. We left Melbourne at 2 pm. A very good spread was waiting for us at Albury. We then entrained on the New South Wales side in Red Cross train. Beds were already made. The vestibules had once been 1st class sleeping compartments, so you can guess how comfortable we were. Every big station we called at, there were crowds of people to welcome us, &amp; give us sweets, cigarettes, flowers, cakes, biscuits, &amp; tea. A good many were enquiring after different fellows on the train, but it was like looking for a needle in a haystack, &amp; there were five trains.
