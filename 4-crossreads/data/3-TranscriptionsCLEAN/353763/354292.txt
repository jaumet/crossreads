Sunday Nov 1 - 1914Nothing doing as regards war ships  -  Warren of the Parramatta dined on board last eveng  -  & when the usual Rabelaic discourse ended the war & its prospects were discussed  -  The naval men discussed the resignation of Prince Louis of Battenberg as 1st Lord of the Admiralty  -  They hope Fisher will go back  -  He is regarded as the Naval Kitchener - a great organiser - not a strategist or tactician  -  He couldn't handle a ship, let alone a fleet, but as an organiser he is supreme & the maker of the modern Navy  -  Fisher says "Favoritism is the secret of efficiency" & in his hands this meant that he picked men & made them his favorites so long as they were efficient but efficiency first & efficiency last in any single department of the navy was Sir John Fisher's aim - Ships - Men - Dockyards - Coaling Stations all came under his eye & were made stable & efficient  -  Jellicoe under him came to the front & under no other system could Jellicoe have become Admiral of the Fleet  -  The road to eminence should not be thro the rooms of Buckingham Palace or the Royal Yacht but thro hard work done by a strong brain -
