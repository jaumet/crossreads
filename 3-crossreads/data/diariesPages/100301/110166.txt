gave some of the boys quiet a fright as they did not know where the shells were coming from for a while, after about 30 shells had been fired, we advanced got to where they had scooped places in the side of the road just so as to hide one man so as he could fire down the straight road, niggers were posted by the germans every mile or so to give them the tip when we were close up to them, about half way we established a Hospital found that the Germans had retired from one trench that as we passed along the road we came to where one of the Encounters shells had hit the road ploughed it up, also some cocoanut trees had been blown down we kept marching on in the afternoon rain came down in Torrents I expect the Heavy firing caused the rain to come, anyway it was very welcome as it was terribly hot I was delighted at getting soaked through through, we had a naval 12 Pounder with us we men of G Coy who were just behind the Gun relieved the sailors helped them to pull the gun along as a gun of that size gets heavy as we went along, the Cocoanuts were a great treat to us, as at every halt we sent niggers up the trees to get us some the milk out of them were quite refreshing, even officers rushing to get them when we got a chance.
