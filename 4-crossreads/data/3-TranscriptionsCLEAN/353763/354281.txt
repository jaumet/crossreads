This was received in absolute silence but after lunch I pointed out that the situation was changed  -  We were not hosts at all but were asked as guests  -  In the long run this view obtained - I said it wd be discourteous to Commander Cumberledge & Captain Warren & Stoker & others not to accept this invitation & regard all else as washed out  -Of course there was the usual discussion but all came right & the lot of us went save those necessary for the ships watch  -  Two launches went from the beach at 8 pm & our own launch pushed off at 7.30  -  Several ladies were most unpunctual & got blessed by the Officer under their breath but by 8.30 we were all aboard the Destroyers  -  The 3 had been lashed together  -  The Yarra was in the centre & a stage had been rigged aft & draped with palms & flags  -  Each Destroyer has a complement of some 86 men so the work went forward merrily
