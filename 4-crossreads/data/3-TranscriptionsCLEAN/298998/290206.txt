This unwomanly horseplay clearly shows their inhuman, cruel and feelingless nature. I am position most men who have experienced Hun brutality, will agree with me in saying that the women are more inhuman than the men. The above is quite common here. Men are so accustomed to it, that they laugh at one if one ventures to speak of it. 
 29th-30th. Usual ordeal. 30th. Transferred to No. 7 barrack, situated in a block of ten huts, similar to huts in British training camps. 
 The weather is glorious. If I were free from vermin and hunger I should be quite content. The huts are an agreeable change from the awful ward just evacuated. The Russian Surgeon informed me that the Hun intended operating on the 3rd. July. I have waited three months for this operation, which had I been in a British hospital would have taken place within a few days of the date I received my wounds.

Beer and coffee are the only refreshments obtainable. The customers seem to derive such enjoyment from the slight diversion which is apparently, typical Hun pastime.
