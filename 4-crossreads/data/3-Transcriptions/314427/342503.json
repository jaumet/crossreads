<p>Thursday March 20. 1919.   130<br/>Occasional showers throughout the day.<br/>I did not go on parade this morning at 9.a.m. because the previous 3 mornings I was warned for guard and had difficulty each time in getting out it. By absenting myself I escaped being warned. I was at a very good concert tonight in the  Y.M.C.A..</p>
<p>Friday March 21. 1919.   131<br/>A fine day.<br/>Last night I heard that I was marked A.W.L. in the Guard Room, but today I have heard nothing about it. I was again detailed for guard this morning, but did not go on parade this afternoon , as I was very busy in the work shop. The Educational Officer asked me if I heard any more about guard, &amp; told me not to go out.</p>
