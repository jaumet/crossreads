<p>Aerodrome Camp<br/>Heliopolis<br/>26-6-15</p>
<p>My Dear Judge,</p>
<p>We have now been at this place just a fortnight.  Heliopolis itself is really a fine place, dumped down on the edge of a desert, with a good many very fine buildings &amp; excellent streets &amp; shops but as soon as you get about 100 yards [?] outside the town you get on to just a limitless waste of almost flat country with nothing to break the monotony except an occasional nigger with an overladen donk and a few willy willies.  I have always heard this place spoken of as being sandy but that is scarcely the case it is rather a mixture of small pebbles &amp; choking light dust.  It is awfully heavy going in this stuff &amp; it is most distressing on still days to march any distance because the dust just hangs in a cloud &amp; you cannot see more than about 6 sections of 4s  ahead.  The sun put a good few men temporarily out of action at first but after a few days it got much cooler and we have not had many troubles since.  Occasionally we have a small treat in the way of a dust storm which sweeps up very suddenly &amp; works something like a stage curtain.  It blots out everything beyond a range of about 20 paces &amp;</p>
