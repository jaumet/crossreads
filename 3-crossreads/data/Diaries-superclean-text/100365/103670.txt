transformed. The casualties are naturally very high but the Germans are losing thousands. The big shells are blowing men trenches into the air. It is revolting sickening scene one can only wonder how on earth men are able to live in it.The Battle is particularly violent this morning, as our army is attacking the German 3rd system of defences if this is broken it means a glorious advance.Needless to state there are thousands thousands of men waiting behind the line, roughly 100 000 Cavalry are drawn up waiting for the word go. I think that it is on its last legs now, if we are able to break through through their retreat in to confusion they will lose heart surrender wholesale.Another contingent of Russians have arrived here are situated further down the line towards the Champagne Front.The latest news to hand, is that their front is broken our troops are enfilading them on two sides. The Bombing Companies are working like mad inflicting very heavy losses on the enemy.Fully 80 gigantic Battle Aeroplanes are cruising around dropping Bombs. The Fokkers seem unable to combat them.The Battle which is proceeding now will for ever live in my memory every one of us
