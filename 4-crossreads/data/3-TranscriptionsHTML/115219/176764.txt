<p>Looking back over more than three quarters of a century, one is naturally inclined to stress the great changes that the years have brought. Some of these changes, perhaps, are more obvious to the <strike>country</strike> boy who has left the country to <strike>changed</strike> pass his adult life in a city. He may be inclined to forget that there are still boys <strike>who do not regard</strike> to whom water is not simply <strike>as</strike> something that you get by turning a tap, who still let their <strike>horse</strike> thirsty horse sample a puddle before venturing to strain it through a handkerchief for their own use. (Or is one still taught that it is safe to drink <strike>water that</strike> any water that a <strike>the</strike> horse will drink?) But <strike>there are novelties that owe nothing of their strangeness</strike> the really striking changes are of a different kind. It is not easy for those of my generation to get a clear realisation</p>
