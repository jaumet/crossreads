<p>April, 1915<br/>Friday 16<br/>Brigade day today fighting the New Zealanders, near Mataria &amp; the old Suez Road.<br/>Personally I am better, but ever since the bullet went thru' my nose, the Doctors say I'll sniffle with my throat as I breath per mouth. Am feeling A.1. again. Myra Nyse very ill &amp; I am told at Hospital she has only a fighting chance.</p>
