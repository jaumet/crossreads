<p>Pal of Mine</p>
<p>Ginger wasn't much to look at he was dirty vulgar low<br/>But I bet he's a favourite where game dying soldiers go<br/>He'd never had no schooling &amp; he'd sell his shirt for wine<br/>But I loved him as a brother &ndash; lion hearted pal o mine</p>
<p>Oftd I see you little comrade as I did that winter's morn<br/>your blood flecked lips swearing the old smile ever worn<br/>Where the rattle of the rifles &amp; the roar of bursting shell<br/>With screams of men hard dying made it all a proper Hell</p>
<p>On that grey &amp; cheerless morning the mist wrack all aswirl<br/>I kissed you lips old comrade as I've never kissed a girl<br/>"Fall in" for you was sounding &ndash; the last great trumpets call<br/>Your soul "stood to attention" on the field that levels all</p>
<p>Well I don't know much of Heaven this harps &amp; halo game<br/>Though the Chaplain used to tell us as how a Christian came<br/>Who'd save the poor &amp; lowly if they pray'd it to him square<br/>Though in hell I am game to meet you little comrade if youre there</p>
<p>Yet I sometimes get to thinking in the day beyond the night<br/>There's a Heaven home for soldiers who battle for the right<br/>The soldier's Hell is No mansland with the star shells overhead<br/>&amp; the red moon kind of leering on the battered bloody dead</p>
