Robertson then and had a talk about things. We may be pushed through the 5th to take further objectives. A very beautiful view from the high ground at Mericourt Wood looking over towards Peronne. Wood clad ridges in the distance add to a very beautiful scene ? at a distant glance. A closer look revealing batteries in action and shells bursting and the knowledge that one is looking at a bloody field of battle does not make one any the more appreciative of its beauty. Spent the afternoon at Bn HQ writing recommendations for decorations and for the next half yearly lists. After dark the heavy guns started their nightly hate and their flashes lit up the surroundings. The flares along the front were infrequent and our troops in reserve were amusing themselves by firing their ones too.
