4.  at home and that thither it was my duty to go, as far as he could judge.        There are two more points that perhaps I ought to include though I did not talk of them to him.  One is the fact of there being no work for me to do in England, and the other drawn from that.  What sort of effect would it have on one to be alone in England in these times with nothing to do.  I have tasted properly of "alone" in Egypt with very little to do and it tastes more bitter than I had guessed though I am thankful to be so well, but months of it in England, coddled as I have been so lovingly all my life, might taste so bitter as to make me sick.       I think I have told you before that I have inquired most carefully about my chances of helping in any way in work in England, and they are hopeless, specially without knowing anyone there.    The cafe work here is greatly diminished on account of the hosts of soldiers that have left Egypt, I am down to two days this week & much less rushed ones too!Now Mother dear you may see lots of flaws in these arguments that I do not but at present I feel most satisfied to plan coming home.  Of course as I said this morning many things may happen to make me revise my decision.  I do not think I am exactly homesick though I should live to be home again, but still you will understand that that would mean leaving my Other-Half all those weeks of distance away & that if it comes to my going to England after all, for some reason or other, I will try & forget all the strange lonely parts of it, in thankfulness of still being near him.The thought of home brings with it a great longing; & hundreds of happy memories connected with it, & you all, naturally make me feel that it will be no effort to be happy in the nest if I come back to it.  I have so much to be grateful for, you dears!Must close, very very much loveLovingly your daughter,Olive.
