<p>a job with you, when I get back?  I'd never go back to M's with Goodsell there, as he is detested by all Ausies who know him.  I can't tell you as it would be slander, albeit true, but some day I'll give my guts about him.</p>
<p>I am sending your baby's photo home to my Mrs. and hope you don't mind.  I can't keep it here as such things soon get wet and ruined and I'd like to have it in years to come, if only for purposes of comparison.</p>
<p>Well I'll have to cease fire now with best wishes to yourself and Mrs. M. and baby.</p>
<p>Your old chum<br/>Arthur Hine</p>
