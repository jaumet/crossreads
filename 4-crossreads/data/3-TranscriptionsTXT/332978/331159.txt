55 officers arrived from Karlsruhe camp tonight, including 19 invalid officers - some minus limbs.
Cull & McQuiggan arrived. When I left Karlsruhe, they expected to be leaving any day for England. It is indeed pleasing to know that as exchange has been effected so far, Karlsruhe Camp has been cleared completely so as to make room for the Italian officers - The special camp has been opened for Flying Corps & Naval officers -
