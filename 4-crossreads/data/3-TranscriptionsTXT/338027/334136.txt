 Wednesday, 17 February, 1915 Sir Winston Churchill made a fine speech in Parliament on the war, we read it in the home papers.  German is threatening, with a blockade of neutrals but it seems farcical in her present position. 
 Cleaned saddlery in preparation for big march to-morrow is of little use here as it is covered in dust a few minutes later. 
 Went into Cairo at night and spent a very enjoyable evening at Mrs O'B.  Did not return home until 3 am the morning dodged guards &amp; m.p's [military police] all the night, as we had no passes. 
 Thursday, 18 February, 1915 Big field day with the Brigade.  I rode Mary out.  We left early at nine and marched till lunch when the bearers went with waggon, the others were left at the dressing station.  We went within a few hundred yards of the firing line, when we were told to split and hunt for wounded independently.  I gained some important information and reported it then I had to gallop back to head quarters as despatch rider, when I returned I found that the others had discovered four wounded Aussies so we applied first aid and then brought them back to the dressing station, then we returned to camp, tired out after a good day's work.
