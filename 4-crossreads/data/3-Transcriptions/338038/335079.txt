<p>I am sure you must be bored to read my letters, they are so devoid of any news, but we are shut off here as it were and nothing much happens of any interest.<br/>This last week we have spent in practising fording rivers, swimming horses, bridge building, etc. I have some very good photos which have gone into the album and will come along in due course.<br/>The D.A.C. had a sports meeting on Saturday and we put in a very amusing afternoon. Officers' tent pegging and lemon cutting on donkeys, camel races, etc. were some of the attractions, all of which provided plenty of fun.<br/>Our section was beaten in the best turned out team event, but the time at our disposal to prepare militated against our success. Captain Madden's section, No. 3, carried off the prize.<br/>Saw Reg yesterday. He is still in the Army Service Corps</p>
