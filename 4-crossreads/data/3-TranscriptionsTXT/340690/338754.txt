The Fisher's Wooing
IGive me a plaice in your sole, love,In spite of my 'erring ways,I'm weary of whiting for your thee, love,Lonely & sad are my dace.
IILife has its catches of ills, love,So carp not but heed my call:'Twould be a sad bloa-ter me, love,To lose you, my haul in haul.
IIIThe net result up to now, love,Has left me crab -by and sore;With a kerchief I dab my eyes, love,Oy-ster, full of vim, no more.
IVGive me a plaice in your sole, love,We'll pair like the finest Dover,And ever - no cod! - I'll remain, love,Your own loving Salm-on clover!
Transcriber's note:P. 12 - "Pelman" is referred to several times in the diary and is "a system of training the mind in the United Kingdom during the first half of the 20th century".
