 F. Finish my Cape Town Story. Go to English class on Figures of speech. Sea much calmer & lots of small birds about. I go in sweep on mileage but lose horribly. I play my game of Cribbage & win. Work right up till 8 pm bath, write & go to bed. It was cold & rainy & I had to get up at 3 am to close Port Hole.
