<p>1915<br/>Dec. 7 Tue.<br/>Went out to Nuzha Gardens, several miles from the city &ndash; had a good look round, very pretty &amp; splendidly laid out. Went out there by tram (1st class &amp; without paying fares, of course) but drove back in a garry partly along the banks of the Mahmoudieh Canal &ndash; stopped at Groppi's in Rue Rosette for afternoon tea.<br/>Alex is a much prettier &amp; cleaner city than Cairo &amp; contains far more Europeans most of whom are French &ndash; The former city is laid out in French style.<br/>Asthma has'nt left me yet &amp; wheezing comes on at night accompanied by running of the nose &amp; sore eyes.</p>
