Up 9 am; saw other chaps just as I came back from breakfast. Went down Market St, then back to Red Cross and met Hawkins. Called into Palace Hotel to see Gibson but he was not back from Los Angeles. Then went for walk down the Embarcaders to Pier 37 to see the Ventura, but she has gone to the dry dock. 
After lunch had boots shined and cleaned nicely then went and did some shopping with Hawkins, buying a cane suit case for 1.95. On way back to canteen met a New Zealander who is one of crew of the Paloona, so I went for walk with him. He showed me some of the old dancing halls in one of the worst streets of Frisco.
Met Hawkins again at 5.30 pm then we both went in Geary St'tion out to 26th Avenue and to 2528 Lake St, to Mrs Clemens and had a nice little dinner with them; then took tram back to Phillimore St and went to a picture show ? the main picture
