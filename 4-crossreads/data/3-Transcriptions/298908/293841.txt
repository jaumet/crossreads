<p>7th.  Have been busy shaking &amp; belting my blankets this morning &amp; they are now hanging out on the wire with my pyjamas getting a good airing which they so badly need.<br/>Am Orderly Sgt. again this morning, this job will do me for its nice &amp; easy especially when one knows the ropes so well.<br/>There was a great commotion about the town this afternoon, we were all just sitting down to tea, when there was a most tremendous noise in the harbour all the whistles &amp; horns of the steamers &amp; warships started blowing &amp; every little thing that could raise a scream took it up &amp; there was cock-a-doodle-doing galore, we all guessed at once what it was the armistice signed &amp; the end of the war.  All the boys rushed out of the huts &amp; started cheering &amp; shouting &amp; everyone was wildly excited, so much so that none of us could wait for our tea but put our tunics on &amp;</p>
