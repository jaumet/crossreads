Getting warmer each week & the men are in SHORTS again, they were issued with Helmets last year but so many floated down the Canal we have been allowed to keep our HATS this year.
Just recd. word of Father-in-law's death, enclose cutting he left everything in = Shares to Dolly & his son Capt. ISH. His wife NIL, nor does he mention me, but the Will was made in March 1916, I have a Copy - don't I know total but he was a wealthy man so Dolly is well provided for.
Will post this at once. Love to all.
