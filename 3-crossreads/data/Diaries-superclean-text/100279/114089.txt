his place had a cut at S.M. Great excitement last night straightening our platoon rolls up, for from now on, every morning the platoon Sergts have to hand in 2 parade states one to the S.M. the other to his platoon officer so we have to keep our hands out of our pockets from now on.
The Dr inspected the Coy today to see if they had any "Scabies" I think he got 2 out of my platoon that showed signs of them and had an inspection of iron rations I don't think they got any at all in our Coy, they got quite a lot in A Coy they all got 10 days C.B.
14th Marched out on the Bn parade ground this morning
