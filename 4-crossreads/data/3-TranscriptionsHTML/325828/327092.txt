<p>Christchurch College,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 10.8.18.<br/>Oxford<br/>28.5.1918</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I was very glad to get your letter of 31.3.18 yesterday written from West Maitland.  I am glad you have been able to get away for a change &amp; hope you feel the benefit of it.<br/>I wrote about 10 days ago telling you of my arrival at above College.  We are having a pretty strenuous time of it here on the whole, but it really wont hurt us.  We have another 2 weeks to go before our finals come off.  When we pass we will probably be sent to a Gunnery School for about 3 weeks at Uxbridge, &amp; then posted to a Training Squadron to do our practical flying.<br/>I am returning some photos that you sent me from Harry.  They look very well, &amp; I would like a trip down that way by plane.  I am also enclosing some p/cards of the College here.  The dining hall is a marvellous old place &amp; I would very much like you to see it.  It is hung all round with oil paintings, some of which are absolutely priceless   Just opposite my place at table are 4 paintings with a total value of perhaps &frac12; a million, 2 by Gainsborough, a Reynolds, &amp; a Romney.</p>
