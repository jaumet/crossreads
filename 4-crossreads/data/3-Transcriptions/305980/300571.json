<p>December</p>
<p>3:  Stand to at 3 a.m., N.Z. mounted had a hot fight near Jaffa, having to retire owing to the infantry not being strong enough to gain the objective.  Enemy counter attacked, the .N.Z. men serving machine guns at a range of 30 yds, and having to swim the river to escape, only two being hit, but they managed to get all guns away in time.</p>
<p>5:  Left Ayumkara at midnight, reaching Jaffa at 2 a,m. in support of Auckland regt.  Though town was out of bounds we managed to attend a concert given by a Romanian violinist on the 6th.  Town is rather nice, well laid out &amp; fine buildings.  Camped in an orange grove, but it has been raining since last night, making things unpleasant.</p>
<p>7:  Stand to 3 a.m.  Left Jaffa at dusk, relieved by 54th Div., rode to Ayumkara in pouring rain, clothes &amp; maps being soaked.  Reached camp at 10 p.m., place flooded out &amp; mud inches deep.  Moved on to the sand &amp; camped.</p>
<p>8:  Stand to at 3 a.m., exercising horses at 5 still raining &amp; country in a fearful condition, transport cannot cross the flats owing to mud.  Canteen goods &amp; wine on hand today.</p>
