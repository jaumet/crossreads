One great advantage in these detail positions is that we are treated with much more consideration by all combatant ranks, officers and men alike. The only officer we are accountable to is our Medical officer All other officers have absolutely nothing to do with us – Our M.O. censors our letters, grants our leave and in fact have full control over us

Most of the troops have been marching to Ismailia lately and quite a number have died – This is a crying shame as numbers of empty trains go down every day. Somebody in charge should be told off for causing these unnecessary deaths. It is a case of history

repeating itself as most of the deaths in Tel-el-Kebir Cemetery were caused from thirst in 1885. Nine deaths occurred in one battalion alone including one officer and a brave one.

Today our Brigades were completed out of the 5th and 6th L.H. regiments. I don’t suppose there are more than 10% old artilerymen these Brigades so you can understand they will take a good deal of training to become efficient I am still without an M.O. and likely to remain so as medical men are scarce. We are about the only ones left in Tel-el-Kebir just now, and Tommies are taking our place.
