  
 Monday 17 September 1917 Rather dull morning and some showers.  Close in to coast 9 a.m. till 11 a.m.  Wilson's Promitary & lighthouse very clear.  Took snaps of the latter but afraid light not good enough.  Rev. Birch describes this part of Victoria as "The Garden of Australia", does he know anything of the North & East coasts I wonder? Wrote letters, did little sewing and reading. Miss Ralston is cousin to Bob Ralston of Wellcamp & we had a lengthy talk about past patients. At 8 p.m. saw flash lights of Port Melbourne showing across the water 60 miles away. Bed 9.30 p.m., all clocks put back about 20 minutes.  Motion of boat becoming more marked, so far can stand it but not much more!!
