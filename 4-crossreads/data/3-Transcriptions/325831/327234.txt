There were about 40 patients at this hospital, including several Canadians, a Bermudian, a South African, a chap from China, another from India, one from South America, a couple of New Zealanders, some English, Scotch &amp; Irish &amp; several Australians.</p>
<p>Thus the Empire was well represented. The place was mostly run by amateurs &ndash; society people of the County &ndash; &amp; their efforts at times in the housework etc were most amusing.</p>
<p>I had two weeks' sick leave most of which I spent with friends in Scotland.</p>
<p>I got back to France soon after passing the Medical Board &amp; found my battalion down here labouring in the mud.</p>
