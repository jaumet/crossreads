Dear Mr. LaytonYou kindly gave Mrs. Horsnell 2 on the 20th to tide her over until her son should receive his pay. He is not expecting any till Friday or Saturday. As she has no money left do you think you could give her 5/- or 10/- to help for the next day or two?
Believe meYours sincerelyE. M. Wallack
