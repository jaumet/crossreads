at the office very morning.
How is old John?  And also little John, give them both my very best love tonight, and tell little John to put in a good word for me occassionally in his prayers.
I believe Lloyd has gone off to the war, you remember, I wrote him some cabled him some time back saying he should go if he wished to.
Well goodbye & good luck to you all.
And please excuse this short & scrappy letter, but the letters are just to remind you that I often think of you all & the good old days - please Heaven they come again.
Jock Ellis
