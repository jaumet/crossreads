<p>Dear Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 58&nbsp; 71 &amp; 7V&nbsp; + the</p>
<p>Thank you for taking</p>
<p>off photos of the original <s>old</s> Binnie<s>&#39;s</s></p>
<p>photos (or paintings). I see in George Binnies diaries</p>
<p>that he says &quot;Reading my Father&#39;s diaries 1858</p>
<p>on his trip to England he must have been</p>
<p>very ill all the time he was in Britain, but</p>
<p>he buzzed around and saw a lot, note his</p>
<p>father was born at Coatsbridge near Edinburgh&quot;.</p>
<p>That trip was nearly 10 years after his</p>
<p>Californian trip and 5 years after he was</p>
<p>married to Elizabeth Williams. Did she go too?</p>
<p>did he go to England later again? Also in</p>
<p>George&#39;s diary 1905 Jan 19<sup>th</sup> Uncle Richard died</p>
<p>89 years a good man gone&quot;.</p>
<p>Pam lent me a small diary (but not his</p>
<p>proper diary, this was more records of 4D) the</p>
<p>night I was at the Club. Alec&nbsp; is being most</p>
<p>helpful but says all he knows of family history</p>
<p>he got from his Uncle George and my Peter -</p>
<p>Ken I remember after George died took his grand-</p>
<p>father&#39;s diary being the eldest. Please look</p>
<p>up for me &mdash; All well here and such a</p>
<p>thrill having my great grandson - waddling</p>
<p>round, he&#39;s now a year &amp; I see lots of him very</p>
<p>advanced and so like Jimmy. We&#39;ve all</p>
