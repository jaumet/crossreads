 1916 &nbsp; SATURDAY&nbsp;9 &nbsp; DEC. 
 Fine most of day, but had a few showers. The brigade went out &amp; shot as a brigade &amp; did very well. I did not go out but was clipping horses &amp; disinfecting rugs in the morning&amp; was at the YMCA in afternoon. Got the&nbsp; leater &nbsp;leather waistcoat that father sent me from Farmers.
