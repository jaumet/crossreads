<p>published after we left Melbourne &ndash; I am the senior major of our hospital &amp; will be the first for promotion should any vacancy arise amongst the Lt. Cols. Nearly all our officers are a very decent lot of men &amp; we all get on very well together. The men also are a splendid lot of chaps. I have not yet had occasion to reprimand Priv. Phillips &ndash; he is always very well behaved &ndash; he was present at a lecture I gave yesterday &amp; was quite exemplary in his attention &amp; desire to absorb the words of wisdom. I saw young Rainsforth for the first time this morning but was not speaking to him. The Budden's friend, I forget his name, is a very decent quiet young fellow.</p>
