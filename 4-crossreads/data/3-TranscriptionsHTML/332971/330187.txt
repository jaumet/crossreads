<p>to take you <strike>down</strike> in for everything.  If you pay 1/3 of what they ask you arrive at about their value, paying also for the fun you get out of it.<br/>At noon I leave the 4 Sisters &amp; take a car to see the famous pyramids &amp; Sphinx, its an hours ride out there &ndash;very nice too,  After leaving the outskirts of Cairo we make a tour of the gardens of Ghezirah between the two arms of the Nile then cross the English bridge &amp; we are soon on the road to the pyramids which is bordered for 8 miles with magnificent Sycamore trees 100 years old.  This road serves as an embankment for the rising of the Nile, by the way I am lucky to see this rising which only happens once a year &amp; it is now almost at its full &amp; almost up to the pyramids embankment.  One gets a glorious panorama view of all this from Mena House.  I soon arrive at Mena.  Now converted into a Convalescent Home for our boys-  I enquire for Sister Burns- but am sorry she is on duty so we wanted to see the sights together however she finds a substitute in a nice soldier boy &amp; we go off on Donkeys.  See the pyramids Sphinx- the Temple of granite &amp; a suite of chambers formed of alabaster &amp; granite- take a ride to the outskirts of the native cemetry, then return by Mena Village</p>
