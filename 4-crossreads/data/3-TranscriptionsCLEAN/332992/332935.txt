Wednesday May 2. 1917A beautiful morning, but there is a haziness in the air which makes visibility not so wide & clear as our airmen would like.  Our Batteries are continually shifting their position & it is well, for Fritz has been reaching for one with H.E. shells, dropping them in a line parallel to our store, & on the old battery site.  Up to 10 O'clock he must have put over 150 shells, a large percentage "duds", and all for nothing so far, and costing the enemy over 1000 for shells.  At the time of writing he is still shelling, schrapnel from the bursting shells coming quite close to our billets.  When I was shaving I saw a company of soldiers narrowly escape being hit with a shell.  It burst in front of them, they ran across, when a "dud" fell behind them.Other companies made a wide detour.  The concussion from the bursting shells shake our stores & rooms.
I heard last night the Jack Brake is in the 30 artillery near here.This evening I examined the shell holes made by Fritz this morning & saw hundreds of shell fragments lying about.  I recovered a few for souvenirs.  A Tommy was killed about 10 chains from our stores by shells this morning.
