<p>30-12-16<br/>Hill &amp; myself ran out &frac34; of a mile of wire to the Outposts supplied by A &amp; C Squadron &amp; it was dark when I got back for tea; We have a cramped home tonight &amp; packed like sardines, it is very cold.</p>
<p>31-12-16<br/>Sun 31st<br/>Was hauled out at 3.15 this morning as the Adj. (Capt Weir) came over to the lines &amp; could not find the horse picket. Foster was on &amp; I found him between the blankets &amp; put him under open arrest &amp; went back to bed, we all slept cold till "Stand to Arms" at 5 oclock; made tea at 6.30 &amp; were ready for the return trip at 8 oclock.
