 Wednesday June 13th The weather is getting much warmer now, a perspiration can be easily raised. There  are  is plenty of physical  drill  drill &amp; drill here. There must be fully a brigade of men here altogether. On Infantry drill nearly all day, it is the first drill of the kind I have done for about eighteen months, so I proved very awkward anyhow there were plenty more besides me "in the same boat". Some of the fellows are sent over to France from this camp. I am expecting to go to Parkhouse Camp on Monday. The food isn't bad here, but not enough. 
 Thursday June 14th It is very dusty camping in the tents, everything get very dirty in no time, &amp; you feel just as dirty five minutes after you have a wash. There are plenty of officers here. By going on the medical inspection this morning I missed a whole day route march, &amp; this  evening  afternoon we went out &amp; laid down all the time so we have had a very easy day. The O.C. here is an artist, he is a bit off his head (general opinion), but very good to the men, he comes out with some very comical sayings. 
 There was a big draft left for France this morning. The light horse is expecting to leave for Egypt any day now. I wish I was going with them. Every one in camp seems to be broke, it is a common occurrence, now one very seldom has any money a couple of days after pay day, especially now as the prices of everything is very dear, &amp; the two principal items (cigarettes &amp; beer) have gone up tremendously.
