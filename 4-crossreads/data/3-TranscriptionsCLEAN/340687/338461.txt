June, 1917. Wednesday 6Up at 6 and after 7 parade set out at 8 arriving about 12.30. Very hot day and stiff march through Lavieville, Buire & Morlancourt to about a mile past Bray Village. In afternoon had some [indecipherable] and rode round Bray on bike. Very deserted & few shops and has been shelled slightly. Bonza river with fish and had a dip although rather too deep. Fair billets. Spent evening trying to fix gramophone. Looked thundery in evening so slept in.
