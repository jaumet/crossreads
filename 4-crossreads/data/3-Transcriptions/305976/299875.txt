Gyppo Woman seem to have a very graceful carriage when walking due they tell me to carrying large Earthenware Jars on head<br/>Friday June 29<br/>On fatigue. Great commotion in Camp. Individual betting 5 to 1 War is over. Hard to believe. Wonder if he has dingbats booked &pound; 5 to &pound; 1 on knowing nothing. Canteens pretty stiff with prices.</p>
