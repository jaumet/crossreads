<p>of miles of these duckboard tracks in France; in fact&nbsp; in Winter</p>
<p>they are absolutely necessary where men have to travel off the</p>
<p>main hard roads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us ffollow a Battalion into the tranches.&nbsp; An</p>
<p>officer and a couple of N.C.O&#39;s from each Company have gone up to</p>
<p>the line the night before to obtain full particulars as to how xx</p>
<p>it is held and the disposition of the troops in the various posts.</p>
<p>They return and are able to divide their Companies up accordingly</p>
<p>so that on arrival at the trenches each party can move to its</p>
<p>appointed place without confusion.&nbsp; A heavy frost is on and the</p>
<p>road is slippery so the men wrap a sandbag round each boot to help</p>
<p>them keep their feet.&nbsp; Steel helmets are chalked white so as not</p>
<p>show up against the snow.&nbsp; Rations and water being served all</p>
<p>round we push off.&nbsp; For a mile or so we follow the road and then</p>
<p>branch off on to a duck board track and here our troubles commence.</p>
<p>The duckboards are frozen and are very slippery.&nbsp; I used to think</p>
<p>that walking with carpet slippers on polished lino was a risky</p>
<p>matter, but frozen duckboards beat all.&nbsp; It is moonlight and the</p>
<p>duckboardx track shows up well across the snow as it winds about</p>
<p>dodging shell holes.&nbsp; Falls are frequent and the language is vile.</p>
<p>Once a man falls it requires a considerable struggle for him to get</p>
<p>to his feet again so great is the load on his back.&nbsp; After three or</p>
<p>four hours of walking and slipping we arrive at our area and each</p>
<p>party moves off to relieve the post to which it is allotted.&nbsp; Half</p>
<p>an hour goes by and then the report comes through &quot;relief complete&quot;</p>
<p>and we are left in possession of that section of the line whilst</p>
<p>the relieved Battalion winds its weary way back to the Camp from</p>
<p>which we came.&nbsp; Fortunately a few clouds had come over to obscure</p>
<p>the moon and the relief was accomplished with trifling casualities.</p>
