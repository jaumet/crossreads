<p>I went &amp; had a good bath at the waterhole &amp; finished washing the grease off my legs. Had physical drill before breakfast.</p>
<p>Tuesday 9th. Physical drill before breakfast. after breakfast we marched about 4 miles to the Ocean beach &amp; had a great swim. Several hundred New Zealanders were also there. The water was very cold but it was very enjoyable after the march. We passed some large encampments of British soldiers &amp; there must be many thousands of troops resting here just now. We also passed an Officers training camp. The bay in which we swam contained about a dozen mine sweepers also store &amp; supply ships. One can only gain some slight idea of the magnitude of these operations by moving about when fresh evidence is always showing up of the work going on. Spent the afternoon doing some photos. At night six of us had a banquet, the night we chose being the anniversary of th 'Emden Sydney Clash' we voted it the best we had had for months &amp; consisted of sardines &amp; salmon, tinned fruit, biscuits &amp; a bottle of wine</p>
