 Last night a raiding party of Germans broke into the 11th Battalion trenche's but never a one got back again, they bayoneted 32 of them including a Prussian Guard officer they had no fewer that 28 bayonet holes in him According to report these aerial torpedoes are pretty crook things, they reckon they caused nearly all the casualties the other night, one of them lobbed right among a squad of Lewis gunners &amp; blew the lot of them (7) to atoms. I saw a great aerial fight to-day between a Taube &amp; one of our machines I don't know how it finished up but the Taube had the worst of it &amp; was being forced down when I saw them last There was a great string of barges towed down the canal past Sailly to-day there were about 20 of them
