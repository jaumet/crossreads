We talked of the so called Advance. The opinions of L & I are not optimistic They are giving out rum again now. Courage. A la demi John.
Tues 3rd. All talk is of the move.
Wed 4th. Tite & Cooper came to tea & voted it a blow out. False attack by our front at 9 pm. The Aust & Col generally seems to lack an eye for method & thoroughness
Thur 5th. Called on Tite in morn. They cleared over to left in evening & same with NZs. Bill Jenkins left & Fred Price went away sick The move begins soon I hear Tommies landing every day or night now
