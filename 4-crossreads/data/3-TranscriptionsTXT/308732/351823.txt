 nicer loafing about under the lovely shady trees, than walking along the hot dusty road to Havre, which is a few miles away, and probably not much different from Boulogne. The march in to Havre was not  add  at all nice, we had besides our ordinary pack, which is quite heavy enough, a blanket &amp; 120 rounds of Ammunition and as the day was hot &amp; the road dusty we were quite glad when we arrived. 4/6/18 We did not leave Havre until 9.30P.M. and had a very slow trip, it was interesting enough, but when we are so close to such a thing as this "Great War", one is naturally a bit unsettled. Le Havre seems to be much the same as Boulogne to look at what we saw marching into the Station. We saw lots of Americans on our trip, and they are a fine lot of men to look at and if they fight as well as they look there ought to be something doing when they  do  get started.
