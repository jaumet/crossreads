<p>4 March, 1916<br/>Serapeum<br/>There was 35 men on Fatigue from the Squadron <strike>this morn</strike> to day so that made us short handed we had to do two trips to water the horses.  This evening we went down to the shops &amp; imsheed in some [indecipherable] &amp; mats for the tent so we were a bit more comfortable  To day has been another windy day &amp; Im afraid that Ive eaten as much sand as food.</p>
