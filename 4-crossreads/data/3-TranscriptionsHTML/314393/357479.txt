<p>During the 15th the battalion was marched to the divisional baths for a bath &amp; change of underclothing which was urgently needed. Whilst in this camp plenty of drill was carried out for a change had taken place in regards to instructions in modern warfare also the armament of an infantry regiment. On the 22nd I had to take my bombing section to a bomb range to put them through a practical bombing course. This including the throwing of live grenades, the bomb having to be thrown over a small sand bag parapet into a water hole these having been made for that purpose. During this practice one of the section became careless &amp; while in the attempt  of throwing a live bomb his arms became entangled with the chap next to him causing the bomb to fall out of his hand at the same time hitting him in the head knocking him unconscious. As soon as this happened the boys made a run for cover for the bomb had fallen inside the parapet having only five second before it went off. We did not have long to wait &amp; as soon as it went off we rushed round to see how the chap was who dropped the bomb for we fully expected to find him killed but to our surprise found him to be still unconscious so set to work to bring him round when we found he had only received a small piece in the right arm this being sufficient to send him away to hospital. The following day all the Officers &amp; N.C.Os of the Brigade we assembled on a big field for a course of aeroplane contact signalling. ** This proved very interesting for it illustrated the communication between the aeroplanes &amp; front line troops for an aeroplane was used for the instructions. Next morning Sunday 24th September our Brigade was assembled near Poperinghe for a church parade this being attended by General Birdwood &amp; Mr Fisher, High Commissioner for Australia. After the ceremony the General decorated officers &amp; men with medal which had been won during recent engagements.<br/>** For instructions received see page 216<br/>After the church parade accompanied by a mate I made my way to Poperinghe to have a look round. Poperinghe ranks among the largest towns in Southern Belgium being fairly well layed out, with the usual big market square, similar to all European towns, in the centre of the town. Along both sides of the main streets are terraces of big business places &amp; at this time was fairly well populated by people who were game enough to remain within easy range of the enemy's big guns. The old church with its tall spire surmounted by a weather cock is still to be seen, having suffered several hits by alien shells but no great damage had been done to it. At this time the town was visited by hundreds of British troops on daily leave &amp; for their convenience &amp; amusement the military authorities had commandeered the largest hall in the place for a cinema show. This show was well patronized by the troops also by a certain number of French civilians who were allowed to attend each performance for they like the soldiers it was their only place of enjoyment in the town. The Belgium people in &amp; around Poperinghe spoke English fluently being generally very good to the troops especially the Australians for our Division was practically the first Aussies they had been mixed up with. Naturally they were very curious in regards to our customs &amp; dress also numerous questions were asked about our home land &amp; civilian life. Their hospitality was returned by the majority of our boys who appreciated the little kindness &amp; hands of friendship which was extended them. After spending a very good day in the town we arrived back at camp about 8 PM then turned in for the night. next morning the 28th things became busy in camp for we were told the battalion was to go in the front line again that night &amp; I was detailed to act as advance guard for my platoon.</p>
