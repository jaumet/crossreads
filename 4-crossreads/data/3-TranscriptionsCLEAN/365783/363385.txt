I am longing to get a batch of letters describing your tip on the Demosthenes.   There are lots of things that I would like to tell you about but our letters are censored & there is no use wasting pen & paper. I went last night to see the Sphinx by moonlight - it was quite a weird experience - the moon at its full - the wide expanse of sandy desert with here & there the lights of some small Arab settlement - a group of camels & donkeys & their Arab attendants looming up largely on the skyline - in the distance the long straight sycamore bordered road to Cairo up & down which went a never ending cavalcade of tram & motor cars - right in front of us the imperturbable Sphinx with its background of pyramids.   Some natives for the consideration of a small amount of backsheesh started their magnesium lamps & showed us how the Sphinx smiled.  On the way back two of us essayed the task of riding on a camel & a queer experience it is.  I don't think I would like to make a very long journey on the back
