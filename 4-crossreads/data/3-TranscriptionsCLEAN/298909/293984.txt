heat of the desert, it is a scene that brings a lump in a fellows throat to think that these fine men will never muster again in the same numbers - as no doubt this is our final Review.

Rather hot & dusty - Read out in Brigade orders, that we deserved credit for our display yesterday & the G.O.C. thanked us - On Guard all day - Another Kit inspection - All cameras have to be got rid - under severe penaltys for disobedience, as no Camera are allowed to leave Egypt.

Had the day off for being on Guard yesterday. The Boys pulling down & packing our Marquee tents etc - We are ready to move at half an hours notice - While swimming at night two big Boats went through one was the Whitecourt & the other a French Mail Boat converted into a transport, it had a lot of Indians on, also a lot of mixed passengers aft, we were rather surprised to see women & children we had to take to the water as we were in all stages of dress, they gave a good cheer.
