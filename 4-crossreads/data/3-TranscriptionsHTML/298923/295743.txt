<p>18 March 1918 Monday<br/>Drying clothes, shoeing horses- just been detailed to stop here &amp; look after Brigade details if they move so I am alright tonight-   Bought eggs 3 for 1/-, shaved, &amp; caught lice &amp; felt happier- the men's boots were in a very bad state from the rocks also the horses shoes-  This monastery is a very well built place the Germans had used as their Hd Quarters see paper 19th 20th &ndash;</p>
