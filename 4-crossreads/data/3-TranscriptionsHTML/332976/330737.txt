This morning I went with the Major to look for a new site for a camp.<br/>This afternoon one of Fritz's aeroplanes came over our lines a considerable distance but at a great height.  Our anti-aircraft guns peppered her &amp; scored a hit, but she planed down &amp; landed in her own lines.  Fritz has been shelling during the night but did practically no damage.  <strike>has been done</strike><br/>2nd   I have been surveying the new position for a camp for 6 Battalions near Longueval all day.</p>
