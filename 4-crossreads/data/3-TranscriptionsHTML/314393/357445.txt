<p>that eager to have a glimpse of him that things ended in a rush crowding round the visiting group in disorder nothing sensational taking place. The following day the 20th March the battalion had a general kit inspection which was close in every detail, after which we were told that the battalion was to leave for France within twenty four hours. Next morning the camp was awakened by an early reveille and every thing was soon a hustle &amp; bustle preparing for our departure which took place at 2.30 PM the 21st March when we marched back across the canal to East Serapium railway station. We had to wait until 8.30 PM before entraining so during the waiting hours we had tea after which a big fire was lighted with old cases &amp; spare wood. When the fire started to burn properly the battalion assembled round it for a concert which proved a great turn out considering the circumstances &amp; will live for ever in the memories of those who were present. When the train arrived at 8 o'clock we found it consisted of open trucks, the battalion gear being put aboard first then the troops after.

The harbour, which is divided from the sea by a huge breakwater, is a fair size with a big berthing accommodation for large deep sea vessels &amp;  also has a very big coaling stage which is near the entrance. When the ship pulled out into the Meditteranean Sea twelve Vickers machine guns were mounted at different parts of the main deck thus adding more armament to the ship should it be attacked by an enemy submarine. The troops aboard were comprised of Brigade Headquarter staff &amp;  details, the brigade machine gun company &amp;  Trench morter battery &amp;  our battalion less the horse transport which had to go by horse boat.
