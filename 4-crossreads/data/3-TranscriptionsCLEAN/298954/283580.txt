  
 1918 Sun. 24th Feb. The sea-plane is now on deck - having emerged from the hold yesterday painted grey, covered with Black Maltese Crosses and carrying the number 841. 
 A huge ensign flies at "Wolf's" stern and a positively enormous white pennant tipped with a golden ball streams from the main mast. 
 And the crew appeared for the first time  in hat  wearing "S.M.S. "Wolf"" hatbands. 
 Kiel, with its pretty surburban villas fronting the Bay and the wind mills capping the hills behind, occupied but little attention - all our interest was centred on the Fleet. 
 And it was certainly "some sight".   A huge lane of battle-cruisers, cruisers, and lighter craft stretched down the Bay with the crews all manning the decks and cheering.
