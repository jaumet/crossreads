4 - about the movements of the troops - they are moving - but to France or Mesopotamia we do not know.We evidently are not going to stay here - the other hospitals, it is rumoured are moving. I am content to be here - though I should like to be where our troops go. There are heaps of wonders to be seen here and I feel I am very priviledged to be here. Though I find it difficult to appreciate them as I would have if there had not been war.This is a boring letter. The other sisters are in the room now and talking, so I can't write. Much much love to you & Father. I hope you are well, my precious parents. I long to see you. Much love to Constance & Ernest Bill & Edith & Roslyn & Auntie Cousin Lily & PercyYour very loving daughterBetha McMillan
