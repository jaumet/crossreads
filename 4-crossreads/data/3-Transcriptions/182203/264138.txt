We hurried back &amp; fixed up things for their tea &ndash; all sorts of jellies, custards, cream &amp; biscuits. The patients had an early tea &amp; a cheery time. <br/>The Orderlies had a great dinner at 5.30. p.m. It was a merry sight. Their dinner was over at 6. 30. p.m., then they cleared the room &amp; began an excellent Concert which lasted till about mid-night. The Convalescent Patients of course were in it all.</p>
