Our Artillery very active. Rifle fire fierce at 8 P.M. yesterday. Our Saddler Sgt gone over to Tenedos today to buy some luxuries<br/>10/11/1915<br/>Rained like fury last night. Dull and foggy this morning, rained stopped. Thousands of regulars, Scottish arrived Just come from France, they were in the retreat from Mons. They say that they are here for garrison duty. Heard that Lord Kitchener is going to visit us. He wants to shift things along a bit faster. Our Vet Officer is getting unbearable. He actually wants horses groomed and exercised similar to race horses. At present we exercise for an hour at night, he wants it extended to 1 &frac12; hours per night. He also wants a shoeing list kept, and he will examine it every Monday morning. At present he is mad on clipping</p>
