Just took my Squadron to Rail-Head to be DELOUSED - !!  "Modus operandi" - Engine supplies steam to closed in van into which each man's clothes & Blankets are put he meanwhile going through a DIP -
[The following sentence crossed through]It would do some of those sheep owners who won't dip their LOUSY sheep to come here & be dipped themselves.
Khamsin still blowing.
Reported enemy with their machine guns from planes on Yeomanry at EL BURG last night - I found several copper bullets & shrapnel around our Bivies after last visit. Jim Ayre just read me a lot of HAY letters with much news of the River & Riverina.
Still Bandaged up like a sore finger - pampering my neck as BAINS FATHER would say
