Girt with modest robes of sacrificeLet us not mourn this Gory bed A challenge flings to all who see to raiseA song not born of sorrow, but of praise.
3Of noble clay, and so we do not mournBut, in our pride of him(Who giving all, obeyed the voice,That, whispering down the dim,Vast arches of the Centuries, speaks to manAnd him lay down his life for another)Believe that far beyond Times finite spanWe shall again behold our brother,A soul uprisen from the Cumbering sodRenewed, Eternal, face to face with God.
