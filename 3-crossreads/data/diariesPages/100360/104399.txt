Wed. July 4 (Assault at Arms) cont)
Our First Aid Squad did very well, too, If anything was at all doubtful it was our Stretcher drill. [Barny?] gave the orders in an uncertain manner, which resulted in the movements being a bit ragged. Every man was a trier, though. It was a very interesting programme, & the Anzacs showed up very well. Birdwood & a score of lesser lights were present. Our Cooks brought out a Copper & made us some Tea, so we had Dinner on the Grounds, & made quite a picnic of it.

Thur. July 5th They gave us the day off, after about an Hourâ€™s Gas drill. We played Cricket & I did some washing. A job I detest. Received Pipe from Mac; who is at Weymouth.

Friday. July 6th Received Letter from Ruth. Went for route march with Maj. Wooster through the villages of Hedauville & Forceville. We had a good spell in a deep forest, which was very cool. On our way back we passed a big bunch of cavalry. They went by at the trot, & presented a very fine appearance. Played Cricket after Dinner. Commenced Letter 24 to Lill.
