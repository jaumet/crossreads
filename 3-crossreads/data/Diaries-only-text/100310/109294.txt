2/9/17 Campagne
A lovely moonlight night so went for a walk via Wardrecques before turning in. On the way back an air raid commenced and the archies and searchlights started furiously. A number of bombs were dropped round our billets but no damage or casualties resulted therefrom. Pieces of shell were falling round. The raiders were very persistent and hung round for a long while. The people were much alarmed a little Marie was very afraid and needed quite a lot of pacifying ? a pleasant job. Madam was also worked up. The shooting of the anti aircraft guns was futile and ridiculous simply blazing money up into the air. The obvious counter seemed to be to send one of our fighters up and let him engage everything in the air. Spasmodic shells were fired by the aerial gunners long after the raiders were half way back home ? a most windy performance. By midnight all the excitement had died down and everyone turned in for a quiet sleep.
