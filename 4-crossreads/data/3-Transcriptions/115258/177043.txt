<p>would be able to keep out of all arguments. So as soon as I came down here I bought a cheap copy and am hard at it reading it now. When I get home I <s>go</s> am going to study the different sorts of cross breeding all I know. Darwins records of his cross breeding are wonderfully interesting but I dont think he knew anything about Mendelism when he wrote them. I dont know&nbsp;much about Mendelism but I think that had Darwin suspected Mendel&#39;s laws he would have carried his experiments further; but of course that would not have altered his species theories at all. I must read Mendel&#39;s book first chance as I have already been in some arguments over it through not knowing anything about it. I say I believe Mendel&#39;s theories, or rather what Gossip has written about them, and then chaps say if they are right it proves that Corriedales, <s>starting</s>&nbsp;originating from a cross, cant be a fixed type. I certainly believe Corriedales are a fixed breed so I&#39;m terribly tied up and only keep finding out how little I know. Have you read any of Gene Stratton Porter&#39;s books? They are A1. They are beautifully written and such nice nature studies. I wish I could see her<s>e</s> collection of photos which she mentions in &quot;The Music of the Wild&quot;.</p>
