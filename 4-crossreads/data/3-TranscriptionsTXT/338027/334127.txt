 Saturday, 30 January, 1915 Left Maadi at 9 a.m.  we went by road right through Cairo, whilst all the L.H. went by the desert.  It was a splendid march our bearers in front and then the amb. wag. and trains bringing up the rear.  Before we arrived at Zeitoun we had a general salute before the Brigadier.  Heliopolis is the most perfect town imaginable no building is less than five stories high, I will describe it elsewhere.  We arrived at the camp at 2 p.m. and were all astonished at its magnificence.   Every thing was ready for us tents pitched so all we had to do was put our horses on the lines and unload the waggons etc.  I struck picquet first night but the horses behaved well. 
 Sunday, 31 January, 1915 No Church parade we were all on fatigue in the morning erecting hospital tents etc and other jobs.  We have a splendid mess room and cook house.  It is truly a wonderful camp.  On the left of us are the N.Zers on the right Heliopolis and the big Egyptian barracks whilst on the other side are the Lancaster Territorials that have not gone to the canal. 
 I went to Vhena Camp in the afternoon to try and raise some [indecipherable] but found my mates in worse difficulties than myself.  They are all full up at Vhena trudging about in the heavy sands.  Thank God I am in a mounted corp even if we do have longer hours.
