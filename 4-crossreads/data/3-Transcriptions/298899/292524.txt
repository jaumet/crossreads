<p>Wednesday night 17th Oct  Had a strenuous day instead of going to bed. Two of us went to [indecipherable] &amp; "Bailleue" about 10 or 11 miles away to see old friends. We walked part of the distance down &amp; got a lift by a lorry reaching there in two hours. Had dinner with my friends &amp; a good yarn it just being 12 months since I was last there. We then went to "Bailleue" where we spent a hour, when we set off home again at 5 P.M. reaching camp at 7 A.M. &amp; going on duty at 8 P.M. We had a fair way to walk coming back &amp; also boarded four vehicles during the journey luckily threatening rain held off until we reached camp. No train in during the night so managed to snatch a few hours sleep which made up for not having any during the day.</p>
