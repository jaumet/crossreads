<p>February, 1915<br/>Saturday 27<br/>I'll cut this out today &amp; send with love &ndash;<br/>If wealthy people want to know the best gift to a Squadron it is a <u>portable Kitchen</u><br/>Very few are here &amp; they are a boon to Soldiers.<br/>Pow-Wow on yesterdays work which is most interesting. Hope all are well. If possible I'll ride to the tombs of the Kaliphs this afternoon not far away.</p>
