<p>this is War!! Upon my soul Guy it&acute;s a bit hard! "Parramatta&#148; hasn&acute;t fired a shot yet; now that we have lost a sub. and Yarra is half disabled we destroyers are going to sea for two nights probably to attack Koenig Wilhelms Haven, which prisoners inform us is mined and to which they have been allowed to be signalling (indeed, all facilities have been given!) ever since we&acute;ve been here !<br/>Do you know: prisoners inform us that they had 500 native troops &amp; 30 German officers here to defend this place &amp; wireless and we have landed two lots of 2_5 men 10 miles apart to take it<br/>&#151; &amp; did whats nearly as wonderful! the rest of troops sat down waiting till the station was taken by two officers finally who bailed up 30 troops &amp; Germans in a strongly intrenched place &amp; held them till reinforcements came up!! Dudly can tell you more of that. And everyone who sat down and waited now laughs like hell and thinks it was funny. Well, we might get a bash to-morrow night* its nice to do something but I must say the time seems very ill chosen.<br/>Must apologise for this wail, but really I think we are more to be pitied than blamed.<br/>Love to all Yrs<br/>A.B.D.<br/>* &acute;&acute;Encounter&#148; comes with us, I suppose to report the result of the action by wireless!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#148;</p>
