July 14th   1915.My dearest Mother,It will be your birthday to-morrow  & I do hope you will have a Happy Day. Sorry I shall not be home to help celebrate the event. I can be with you in spirit if not in person.Well, we are still having fearfully hot weather but manage to work  &  go out still. I'm on night-duty, so work the best part of the day. I'm sleeping fairly well too.Sister Murray is no night-duty still, so we are having a glorious time together. She is a very well read lady    &  imparts some of her knowledge to me.My kind friend Capt. Smedley has gone to Alexandria. He had to go last Sunday-morning at 6.30. a.m. Had a note from him to say he arrived safely. I missed him very much. Lt Wright Smith took me out a good deal    &  is an awfully nice young fellow but sad to say he has gone to Alexandria too. He got marching orders    &  left Tuesday morning at 6.30. a.m.  On Sunday I stayed in all day
