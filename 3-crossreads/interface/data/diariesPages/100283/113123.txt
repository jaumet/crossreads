could wish to see, I was riding in front with the driver we were going down a hill, I noticed a chap carrying a load just in front of us he looked round when he did I beckoned him to rush the car I would give him a hand on, just before we got opposite he makes a dash across the road but never noticed a motor byke that was tearing up the hill, he stepped fair into the bike, there was a loud crash both sides were sent spinning to the road the mans rifle clattered like tin on the stones, it happened right under my eyes I made sure the man was killed, I jumped out quick amp lively run over picked him up he was dazed weak but wonderful to say
