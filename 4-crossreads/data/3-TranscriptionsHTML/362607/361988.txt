<p>Dear Dad,<br/>This is another view of one of England's favourite Watering Places. We thought that Manly was the greatest Place on Earth. It <u> is still</u> to us. But for Promenades &amp; Hotels, gardens etc. Manly is absolutely out of it. The Beach is not equalled but everything else is tawdry &amp;amp hum drum compared to English Sea side places. Now in Bournemouth you never see a bit of rubbish or paper lying about &amp; every street is as clean as the Corso on Sunday morning at 9 am. The Cliffs of the Isle of Wight are easily seen from here. I suppose they are about 10 miles away. This Zig-Zag Path is quaint &amp; nice but I went up the Cliff by one of the lifts. I had a note from Norm Upton that I used to work with.  JB expect him over today. But, it is such a weary windy wet day that I do not think He will take the walk on. It is 5 miles each way from where He is camped. No news Dad, except that we are both well &amp; that Winter has started.  Love From Harry</p>
