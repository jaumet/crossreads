Influenza is again becoming prevalent and an order now directs the closing of cinemas and public places of amusement. In the afternoon took a cruise round the crowded streets of Charleroi and penetrated as far as Haute Ville where there are many buildings which were destroyed in the fighting of 1914 between the Germans and French here.
