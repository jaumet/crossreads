 Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence, Melbourne, 24th August, 1915 
 No. 50925 
 Dear Sir, 
 In continuation of my letter of 20th August, relative to a communication from Mr. Justice Ferguson, regarding troops sent from Australia to Gallipoli, I am desired to inform you that complete arrangements are made to ensure reinforcements receiving adequate training, either in Australia or Egypt, before being drafted to their units at the front. 
 2.  In order to ensure a high standard of efficiency, recent instructions have been issued that, before any soldier leaves Australia, he must complete the musketry course prescribed for the British Army. 
 Yours faithfully, T. Trumble Acting Secretary. 
 The Hon. W.M. Hughes, M.P., Attorney-General, Melbourne.
