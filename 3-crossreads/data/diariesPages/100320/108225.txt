well and nearly jumping out of her skin. Rode back to Yzeux – a dull grey afternoon. the little villages snuggling in hollows with curls of gray smoke rising from their chimneys. Very poor rickety kids in the streets. Found the General at Bde HQ on my return and very strong rumours that we go into the line once more in 3 weeks time. Brown has returned from leave and gave us his experiences at mess. Later we received word that Peace had been signed with Turkey as from noon today. Tomorrow General Rawlinson of the 4th Army will see us at DHQ to explain "the military aspects of the present situation". Also another conference at 1st DHQ to be presided over by the Corps Comdr. Generals Monash and Rosenthal have been recalled from leave.
