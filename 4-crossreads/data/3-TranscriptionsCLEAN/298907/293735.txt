 I am at my window again scribbling this & the country is looking lovely for the rain has ceased & the sun is struggling to show himself through the fleecy clouds that are drifting lazily across the blue sky, all the foliage & trees are looking bright & clean & you can almost see the crops springing to it while the perfume is glorious that is floating about, the atmosphere is very clear & I can see quite distinctly the beautiful Lickky Hills many
