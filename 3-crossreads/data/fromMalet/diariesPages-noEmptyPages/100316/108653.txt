12/5/18 Franvillers 
During the night there was rain. Being Sunday did not get up until late. It was a dull rainy looking morning. From the wood came the sound of bands practising. Word came back from the line that our fellows had a collision with the Boche last night and that one of our men is missing. One of ours died of wounds also. We were most uncomfortable out in these fields with rain falling and generally cold conditions. After lunch called for my horse and with an orderly named set off for the front line. Passed a number of heavy batteries en route and saw a terraced hillside covered with shelters and dugouts quite like Gallipoli. Rode down along the Somme to Heilly. The river is fringed with low lying ground covered with green trees whose leaves have that yellowy tint of early Spring. Heilly was quiet. I found Bde H.Q. in a Chateau which was a modern house on an old site. The walls were massive and supported a big terraced garden from which there was a fine view in all directions. The General's mess was in a smaller house which was beautifully furnished evidently by someone with money to burn. There was stained glass worked in all kinds of fantastic designs, and made to show out in quaint rivers of colours under artificial light. Yarned with the G. about operations for the future.
