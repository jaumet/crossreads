<p>March 1st<br/>Have not written up this weighty tome for a long time, mainly because there has been nothing to say.<br/>We have enjoyed a blessed immunity from enemy 'planes &amp; life has pursued a very even tenor.<br/>From the 22nd Feb. to the 26th I spent in Cairo at the National Hotel &ndash; quite a good place.  Had a very quiet time mainly visiting friends amongst whom I find that the Curtises &ndash; who gave me a great evening at Shepheards last year &ndash; have come into a baronetcy!  Also I was nearly run over by the Sultan in a huge red car so I moved in very exalted circles.  I brought back a good Arabic grammar &amp; have started to study it.  I hope to join the Camel transport soon so that I hope to be able to get a fair amount of practice &amp; should be able to pick up a fair idea of it.</p>
