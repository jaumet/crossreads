<p>the last message through to Brigade.<br/>There were three final messages to be sent through on that memorable night. The Regiment left in three separate parties for the boats which were waiting at "William's Pier". The first party (Known as the "A" party) left about 8 oclock. The second (B) party left about 9.30 pm and the last party (C) and the last of them to leave at 10.45 pm. I had to remain behind and wait until the tail of the column had disappeared around the corner before sending the message as otherwise the naval authorities arranging the transport of troops with the barges out in the harbour to the troopships anchored there would be given wrong times and everything was times to the minute.<br/>So I sat down outside the dug-out which did duty for a telephone box and looked down the gully to watch for the tail end of the troops to disappear around the corner. At 10.45 pm the last man disappeared and I went into the telephone box and put my hand on the key intending to send "L.H.A." (1st Light Horse Brigade Head Quarters) and the telephone refused to "buzz". Previous to this I had tested the instrument and it was in good going order. This was extremely annoying because so much depended on that "C" message getting through to Brigade and being transmitted on the the Naval</p>
