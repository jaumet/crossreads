<p>contrast to all else.  A little was filled out for me.  How to avoid drinking it?  Pretence to sip.  Happy thought, offer some to a wee daughter standing by.  A fortunate act which I discovered was accepted as an act of high courtesy.  She drank some and handed back the cup.  Another pretence.  Again request the lassie.

Some people of good position in our country my estimate an estate of this magnitude as being wealth beyond all dreams of avarice.</p>
