<p>in the afternoon &amp; rowed out to HMS Talbot  We got a good supply of stuff there.</p>
<p>Wednesday 4th<br/>Did nothing all day but sleep, read &amp; smoke.  There seems to be a lot of preparations going on for a big move.</p>
<p>Thursday 5th<br/>Had a washing day.  First time Ive had a chance to do some in fresh water since we left Maadi.  Got ready for guard in the afternoon &amp; at 6 pm 12 of us relieved the Border Regt Guard.  Was on 2nd shift &amp; No 2 post.  It seemed quite strange marching a beat again &amp; I didn't go too much on it.</p>
<p>Friday 6th<br/>Came off guard at 6 pm.  There was a big bombardment in the afternoon &amp; at dusk it was a splendid sight to see all the guns firing at Anzac.  There was a big advance &amp; it is believed a large body of troops were landed successfully</p>
