<p>have not been able to silence him.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Well try and locate him</p>
<p>definitely next time he fires, Sergeant, and I will get the Stokes</p>
<p>Mortar people on to him&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Very good, Sir&quot;.&nbsp; As we are talking</p>
<p>a figure could be seen wallowing xx along in the snow from the</p>
<p>direction of No.4 post.&nbsp; On scrambling in he explained that they</p>
<p>had seen us come to No.3 and the Sergeant had sent him over to</p>
<p>report that a man in his post was in a fit and had been in that</p>
<p>condition since 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon!&nbsp; He asked for instruct-</p>
<p>ions.&nbsp; Beyond recalling that you should put something in the man&#39;s</p>
<p>mouth to keep him from biting and that you rub their hands</p>
<p>vigorously none of us knew quite what was the correct treatment for</p>
<p>fits.&nbsp; As the messenger explained that they had tried both these</p>
<p>remedies without effect I decided to go over and have a look at</p>
<p>him.&nbsp; A bit of an old sap ran part of the way to No.4 and although</p>

<p>andx beyond a few shots from a sniper who seemed exceedingly close</p>
<p>we were left alone until when just as we had to expose ourselves</p>
<p>rather much in crawling over the parados into the post,a machine</p>
<p>gun fired a couple of bursts at us without effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in</p>
<p>the fit still shewed no signs of coming round despite the fact</p>
<p>that one man was assiduously pushing an entrenching tool handle</p>
<p>down his throat and another was smacking him vigorous blows on the</p>
<p>palm of the hands.&nbsp; After consulting with the Sergeant it was</p>
<p>decided that he must be got xxx back to the Aid Post in the rear</p>
<p>and that two men should go with him, one to crawl with the patient</p>
<p>on his back and the other to crawl along side and hold him on</p>
<p>as the man was quite helpless and limp.&nbsp; So as to avoid as far as</p>
<p>possible the risk of them being shot on the way back I sent my</p>
