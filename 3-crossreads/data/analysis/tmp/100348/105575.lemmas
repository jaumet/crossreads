 12/6/16 Cold and Wet . Work on the tram-lin from " Tin Barn Dump" . Was caught in the open by anoth bombard and sought the protect of my friend the ditch again . Did not mind it this time for our gun open up and gave him bean ; which was veri comfort . The crossfir of his machin gun was veri hot . There were no causual . The peasant in this part of the world wear big wooden shoe , shape like pontoon , and becaus of the amount of rain that fall in this region , I reckon they need them , the mud and slush is a caution , a man could drown in it ; and splash through it make a man so tire , that I can throw myself down on the stone floor of my billet , and sleep in my satur cloth like someon dead .
