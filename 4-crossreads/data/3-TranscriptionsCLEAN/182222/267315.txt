 Dec  15/ Feeling quite chirpy  sitting up  & intend to get up & walk on the stilts for practice (was in sand bags & plaster of paris) Remember going in with 2 sections & taking over with Brandburn & Gelding. Fired tests for luck. Rotton possi. Exposed side of deep muck hole full of dead men & mules. Delayed getting back & left abt 2 a.m. Tommies exposed against moon on ridge. Got slaughtered. Think started it. Gen. bombardment up & down road. no good going back go on. 5.9s very thick got tumbled three fois in the mile. Think I saw Bavaria         36 Batt Boy.
