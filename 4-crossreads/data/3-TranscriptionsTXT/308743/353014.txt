We had a pretty tough night of it & the Cheshires had to give up a trench they made it that hot for them, but I dont think we will come back any further. Only for a arty duel the day has been very quiet The cruisers bombarded the hill the whole day through & our guns have done more than their share, they reckon that the Turks losses exceed five times our numbers. Our troops down at the Cape have been awake lately & its said that they took 700 prisoners within the last few days & the French are progressing top hole. Aeroplanes have been chasing round all day and at 6 tonight there were four of ours when one of the Deutcher's appeared & they all after him but he got away safely. I went down for a swim this morning & whilst there they were bombing for fish & we just came along in time to get about a doz & they went real well.

Heavy Turkish attack was delivered about 0530 this morning mainly against Rhododenda Spire, Chunak Bair & down the slopes E of farm. Turks massed in great numbers under the Bair & suffered awful losses coming over ridge as they were exposed to field & naval gun fire who made the most of their opportunities. They succeeded in taking trenches on the Bair but had to clear out later on account of arty & cross fire from No. 3 Section, the attack died down at 1100. Our left has been thrown forward by the South Wales Borderers to Naylor Chair. No. 6 section had also extended on the left, an 100 men was sent out last night to strengthen the L flank inner defence No. 5 section extending it from Bauchops Hill to the sea. Sniping on the beach has been pretty bad all day & at times they brought a machine gun to bear. Two Zepps & nine planes reported in Constantinople. Our planes have had two goes with the enemy & have driven him off on each occasion. They shelled our ships today
