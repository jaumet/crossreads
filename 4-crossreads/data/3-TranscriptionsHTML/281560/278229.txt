<p>28/3/16.<br/>Ordered away from Kasr-el-Nil at 9 A.M. Marched 9 miles to Zeitoum via aerodrome; and entrained at 6 P.M. in open trucks. I guess it would do a N.S.W. railway commissioner a lot of good to have been with us in those trucks, the crush was indescribable. We start for an unknown destination at 10 P.M.<br/>29/3/16.<br/>We travelled all night, and it was bitterly cold travelling beside the Nile. Arrived at Alexandria at 6 A.M; and immediately embark on the Transport. "Translyvania". Troops are arriving hourly and are pouring aboard this ship and others that are ling around the quays. The ship leaves the wharf and anchors in the stream. I saw a South African Regt. arrive.</p>
