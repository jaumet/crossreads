  
 Friday 27 October 1916 Still cold, wet & muddy. Drizzling rain driving in everywhere, & more mud than ever. Hardly possible to do any work during the day, but walked round a good deal mainly for the sake of the exercise. The General came back from division in the afternoon, & 4 of us had to move out of the bell tent into a tarpaulin shelter.
