 8/9/17 Campagne Moved off at 8.15 in column of route for a gas attack demonstration.  Paraded at nearly full strength having about 850 actually out on parade &ndash; a long khaki snake.  There was some fog as we moved down to our training area and there had demonstrations of gas.  Formed up on a J.O.T and gas and smoke were let off.  We did an advance in our respirators and managed quite comfortably and well.  Formed up and had some company lectures then marching home.  Stayed in billets all the afternoon and at mess Jack came down and had dinner with us.  Walked with him down to Wardrecques and called in on Col. James and had some supper.  Then back home and yarned with the doctor, Bunning Alderson and Stewart preparing to have a bath prepared by O.P. Hunt who yesterday returned from a leave of 10 days, jaded and exhausted by sleepless nights of dissipation and hard doing I dare bet!
