 Our Tent Sub are not working this week &ndash; A &amp; C Sections having commenced the work in this new position, so I spent yesterday in helping to fix up the cellar. Eva &amp; I got a roll of tar cloth from a camp beyond the railway, &amp; made a linoleum use of it. 
 Yesterday we were very rough on any stray Fritz planes the came over observing. One was brought back by three or four of ours, &amp; another narrowly escaped destruction &amp; had to clear away for his life. We got three balloons during the day. 
 In the evening I went to a concert party which was showing in a Nissen hut next the Sugar Refinery. The show was given by the Boomerangs (3rd Brigade) &amp; Jimmy Dowling, one of our concert party good at ragtime, showed for the first time. Frayne, also is joining them. 
 Today is fine &amp; in complete contrast
