During that time our chaps bombarded the enemy very heavily.
Thursday 12.10.16Preparing to move in a day or so.  Not at all sorry for this billet has not been a very pleasant one.  31st Battalion raided enemy trenches successfully, but suffered casualties to the extent of 4 killed & 22 wounded.
Friday 13.10.16Off duty, walked around the outskirts of Armentieres.  Have done a good deal of walking since our arrival in France.  German prisoner (wounded) brought in here last night; a fine big fellow of a Bavarian Regiment who were opposed to our [indecipherable] last night:  Expect to move from here to-morrow.
