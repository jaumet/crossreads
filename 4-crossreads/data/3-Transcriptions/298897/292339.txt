<p>bursting.</p>
<p>Wednesday 9th August<br/>Spent a restless night, what with listening to some heavy guns nearby firing &amp; traffic on the road.  Several 6 inch naval guns went pass drawn by caterpillar motors.  Went to a reinforcement camp in the morning to fix up their sick parade.  More German planes over today but very high up.  Our batteries peppered them well especially when over our heads, a fuse &amp; a lot of the shrapnel falling amongst us.  One appeared to be driven to land in their own lines.</p>
<p>Thursday 10th<br/>Had a little excitement today in the way of a case of scarlet fever.  The whole Hospital had to be isolated patients orderlies &amp; all.  This necessitated fresh arrangements as regards picquets etc which kept me busy during the day.  Very little doing otherwise.</p>
<p>Friday 11th August<br/>Nothing doing so did some washing &amp; mending.  Hospital still isolated &amp; most of work going to 'B' Section.  Weather very hot.</p>
