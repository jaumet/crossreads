 Spanish Flu, I report to the Field Ambce. 
 24 th  Nov.  My eyes are bad with the dust & I cant shake the Turkish fever off so 
     I am to be evacuated to the 14th AGH Portsaid & I bid farewell to the old bob tailed nag pack up my kit & depart per motor ambulance to Div Rcvg Stn Damascus.  Here they allot me a 6 by 2 space on the cement floor.  The building is crowded with sick Tommies & Auzzies suffering from malaria Pneumonia Spanish Flu & dysentery.  The staff is shorthanded as half of them are down with the same complaints.  Turkish Red Crescent orderlies are commandeered & go about their work as if they had been attending to sick Britishers all their lives.  I am to go on to Beyrout 100 miles away but word comes that Beyrout Hospitals are overcrowded & I stay here for 5 days
