<p>told us that our beloved younger daughter &ndash; Marjorie &ndash; who enlisted a year ago as a Military Nurse, &amp; was on duty at the Victoria Barracks Hospital, Sydney, had contracted meningitis!  Mrs. Walker went over at once.  Thank God! she is mending.  She is at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.  A cable yesterday arrived from our wounded son, Stuart, that he has got 4 months convalescent leave, &amp; is sailing shortly.  It will be good to see him again.  He went through the inferno of Pozieres, &amp; did well there.  We have another boy in France; another in the Arabian Desert (after 7 months at Gallipoli); &amp; the youngest in the Royal Flying Corps.  We are most glad that our children are of the right sort, arn't we?, but -!  God guard your remaining boy!  Was it Arthur whom I baptized?  I am glad you remember me.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,<br/>Grinwell Walker</p>
