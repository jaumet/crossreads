Reveille as per usual
At 0735 a plane was reported approaching our lines from the direction of Katia & 5 minutes later they said it was hostile, she came over the 155th brigade then across us on to Hill 40, Petresium Kantare. She came back again & hiving over us for a deuce of a time our anti aircraft gun had a go at her but it fell short the plane came round again & flew over El Maler, not one of ours to be seen until she got well over Katia when two war planes were here up at a deuce of a height.
Bed 9 oclock, on a stunt tomorrow night.
