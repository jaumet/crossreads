After passing "Cassel" the road led down the hill on to the level ground here we passed some beautiful mansions set back from the road in a patch of green trees, round all of them there were beautiful lawns fountains playing, most of them had a fine stream of clear water running past the lawn over along these little streams of water hung lovely spreading trees some thing like what we read about on the South American rivers, I think with the exception of the South of France this was the finest part of France that I have so far seen.
The Germans had been for a short while round this part for I saw the marks of their shrapnel in several places, notably on the gasometer.
