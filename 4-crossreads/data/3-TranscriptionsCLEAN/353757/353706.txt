 Dear Vol 
 First of all, convey my congratulations to Mrs. Voltaire.  Secondly, accept same yourself.  Thirdly, don't do as I did & come to the war when you've been married a fortnight. 
 Am A1 now.  Much better & going back to my unit this week. 
 Yes, my brother-in-law died in Egypt to my great regret.  He was a fine boy & full of fight.  For myself, I've done my best, & am going back still full of fight. 
 London is fine, there are no lights, however, at night, as they're afraid of Zeps.  I haven't seen any yet
