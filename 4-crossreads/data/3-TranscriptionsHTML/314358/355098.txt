<p>piegonholed applications of a poor sapper who is thereby forced to drag on a painful existence in utterly distasteful and most unlovely surroundings. The worst feature of which is the wearingly mental squalor of filthy humanity</p>
<p>Do you know, can you picture to yourself how life would be with you if you were prisoned in with a pack of hounds each of which is joyously happy and sufficiently [indecipherable] and kindly in its own way towards its fellows while it is gobbling filth one minute, disgorging it the next and then licking it up a second time.<br/>Perhaps with such a picture before you it will be possible to understand my position mentally<br/>Of course it makes no difference to my [indecipherable] and has no debasing effect upon my reason<br/>This very fact makes it all the more unbearable and repulsive<br/>The best way to express my life at present is to say I am merely a lonely existence where human surrounding are a continual insult.</p>
<p>I am willing to admit that I would gladly put up with greater [indecipherable] and darker [indecipherable] if manners expressions and thoughts were only polite. If things around me were beautiful, if, in short, the sinners were gentlemen.</p>
