 JANUARY 1917 
 15 MONDAY 
 Fine &amp; sunny the early part of the 
 day. The first sun pretty well 
 since we have been in France. 
 I was stableman for the 
 day, so did not get out 
 anywhere. Got seven letters 
 from Australia &amp; a parcel 
 from [Lisheen?] 
 Got my first parcel of tobacco 
 from the Civil Service Stores.
