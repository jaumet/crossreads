<p>different people. All I am in need of is a letter from you or Ruby. I haven't heard anything of Horace, have you? I am expecting some letters every day from Egypt.<br/>When you write always address to the 3rd Batt. A.I.F. because I won't get them otherwise.<br/>Best love to all at home and yourself<br/>Ted</p>
