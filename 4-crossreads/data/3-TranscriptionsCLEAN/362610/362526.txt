  
 Monday 6 Nov. 1916 Up a little before 4 o'clock & set out with the General, but owing to the darkness & greasy going caused by the drizzling rain, progress was so slow that the General soon decided not to go on, so we turned back & went to bed again. About midday we went up to Bn. H.Q. getting back for a very late lunch. There were some showers & a little hail, but in general the weather was fair. A mail came in from home & was oh so welcome.
