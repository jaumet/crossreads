10/1/19 Gourdinne
A fine day. Carried out an inspection of billets in company with our eccentric Dr Millett. They were not in bad condition. Pat Gorman has returned from leave after a somewhat adventurous tour after books for the Educational Service. We had some Veterinary officers round classing our horses but otherwise things were dead quiet in our village and 'the Square" was void of life and animation. In the afternoon went down to Gorman's billet and we had several arguments about conditions in Australia after the War. Stayed here till late investigating the contents of parcels. Evening read that wonderful paper the ?Times" ? every line of interest.
