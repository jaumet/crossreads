<p>France<br/>26/6/18<br/>My Dear Sis,<br/>Have just received your letter of 22nd April. Have had letters from everybody this mail you say Lol is a bit fatter, another says she seems a bit taller  &amp; a third says if anything she has grown better looking so am I to believe all or none. Heard all about the wedding &amp; I think they did the right thing in letting her get married for her people used to worry over her a lot. Of course I am not saying whether there was reason to worry or not but I think I knew Bob as well as any one &amp; what I know I know &amp; "nuff sed". I have received the four photos you have</p>
