  
  Thurdsay  Oct 23 - Friday- After breakfast AE2 cast off from us & went away to a creek nearer the entrance to the harbor  -  I think the idea is to let the men swim & bathe & go on shore & to be away from Pubs & similar well known evils  -  The fleet came in save the Sydney & promptly anchored  -  Nothing doing but in the eveng there was a buz round that the flagship had got some good war news of a naval kind  -  Well - we shall glad to hear something good from the North Sea  -  A mail boat came in & I got a letter from Mrs McConnel of Cressbook Qld asking me for details about AE1 & poor Scarlett  - We got papers up to Oct 13  -  What harrowing details that flight from doomed Antwerp supplies  -  Old men, women & children with their manhood away at the front  -  I wonder what 'unser Gott' thinks of machine guns on the steeples of his special buildings spreading the gospel of love as exemplified by Bill - his chosen  - 
 I watched bullocks - 6 altogether - being towed by the French transport to the Montcalm  -  They put strong poles athwart a launch & at either end tie a beast & keep his head well up  -  Fresh beef for the Montcalm  -
