 24 December 1918 [not 1919] Tuesday Xmas eve &amp; on duty Field Officer, raining hard &amp; very cold-  We are in sight of the sea which is very rough-  All the old 1914 NCOs &amp; men have gone-  I enclose some snap shots of my BABE, she will be  crawling  when we do get home at last. Censor these notes if you print pretty heavily-  Nowell Forth gone to France Abyssinian job fell through-  He is a great aristocrat these days &amp; looks the part- like Laura I think he prefers to be thought something else besides an Australian-  Laura always says young Charlie is  not  an Australian
