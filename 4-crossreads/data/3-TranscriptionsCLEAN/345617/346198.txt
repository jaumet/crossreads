  
 Octobre 3 We have had a good rest today - very little doing except a little Coy fatigue. At night went with Sgt Morrison & Cpl Funnell to a cinema at Reningheltz. 
 Octobre 4 Coy resting well again today. Great news of the 1st & 2 Div advance. Prisoners reportedly coming in freely very little resistance having been met with. Advance is practically in front of the ground we advanced over in front of "Polygone Wood".
