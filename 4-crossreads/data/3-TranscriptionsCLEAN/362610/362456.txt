Monday 28 August 1916A sunny day with several showers at intervals. The General & B.M. were down the line & the others out so I had to stay in for greater part of the morning & then biked out to look for Division, just happening to find it as I was on my way back. Country round about is flat & fertile. Hops look splendid, cereals mostly cut & stooked, apparently good crops having been obtd. Many more men noticed about than was the case in France. In the afternoon had to meet the Div. Gas Officer & kept on the spot by him. After tea in the gloaning biked the 2 or 3 miles to the spot where I had noticed the sign "ADMS", & had a few minutes yarn with Leo : he was well & in good spirits.
