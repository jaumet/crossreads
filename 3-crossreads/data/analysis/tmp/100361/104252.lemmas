As soon as we enter the Build some Ladi ( age ) ask me if I would be her partner , to which I acquiesc . She was a veri good player , but we held rotten card and did not manag to get a prize . After the show my partner ask me if I would care to have a cup of coffe befor I went back to Camp . I said I would and she took me Home and gave me two cup of coffe and some Bread and real butter and chees . It doe n't do to say " No " to a Feed nowaday .
