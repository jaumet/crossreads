 Entry  11th  Yesterday  10th  we visited Hotel de Ville, Eglise St Georges, Notre Dame, Palais de Justice. The interior of the Hotel de Ville is extremely magnificent, the walls of three halls and the roofs being covered with valuable paintings of industries, professions & allegories. Notre Dame was rather a disappointment after the cahedrals of Amiens & Rouen. In the evening we went to a Cinema.
