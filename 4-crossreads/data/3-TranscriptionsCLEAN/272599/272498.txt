 A record number of chest & penetrating lung wounds in the ward. 40 I'd say nothing of the doz. sick. Busy no name for it. Run off our feet --- Jock & self hasty meet & walk along beach. Dot & Carry one.  Poor old Mc. Carrol died this morning. It seemed a crying shame to have such old men in the firing line he must have been 50.  Meet Billy Seeming in Wimereux. Looking well.
