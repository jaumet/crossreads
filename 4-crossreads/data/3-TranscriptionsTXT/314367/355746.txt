I'm mess caterer now - I know nothing about it but I'll come out right - The Chief Engineer takes the Wine - Well this 24 hours at sea is a Godsend we can work quietly - no visitors & no calling - The Fantome is the ship in the harbor that entertains but now we've got to think of ourselves. We had got up a new lot of stores & we're selling every single thing the mess has - We cant sell in Sydney - As soon as we leave Rabaul we shut right down & lead the simple life - Keep all expense down & go for Sydney - Hell for leather - We are going to sell Gramophone & Soda  Water machine - You'll get a wire days before we land - Stop all mail - I shall wire when we get to Sydney which cant be before the 20th Feb - (There is a buzz we are going into a new Commission & go to help Africa - E up at Mombasa or W at Walfish Bay Keep this to yourself - Its Buzz - ) The Destroyers go - any time - so I've to be ready - I'm going to get all the Destroyer sick on the Fantome & bring them down - poor chaps - By God it's an awful life on a Destroyer - Work like Hell - nothing much to eat & any quantity of Malaria - The boat is jammed with men - & the sick lie in the turrets of the guns -
