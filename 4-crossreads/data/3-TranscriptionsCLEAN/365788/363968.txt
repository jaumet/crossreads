  
 4 shell. Well they (the shells) found this poor chap & several men with him some 100 yards from the entrance to our Camp - with the result I of our men Killed - another wounded (slightly) a friend of theirs lost his arm & a tommy Killed by shock. Bad luck for the poor chaps - Pieces of shell used to fall near us as we played Cricket, but evidently "the numbers were not up" for the rest of us. Glad to say I am well & hope Will & the children are well also. In case you did not get my letter of about a fortnight ago - I again wish you many happy returns of your birthday. With very much love dear old girl to you all. Always your loving brother, Fred.
