<p>kindly to take a hand and patronisingly approve of the "works". This they did cheerfully though somewhat in the manner of Laodicea. I think they didn't know what to say. The jocund convener of this reunion of critics then informed me that "before I went I could "take" him. What a lout! The whole performance mortified me.
