<p>25 February, 1916<br/>Train near Suez Canal<br/>B Squadron moved off at 12.0 last night &amp; we had a nice quiet ride into Cairo. The saddles were left on the horses &amp; they were put in the trucks, 10 in each, it did not take long to get them in. Went up a little way from the station &amp; got a cup of Coacco it was OK.  The train left Cairo about 5.0 am &amp; we are still travelling at about 10.30, we are near Ismalia &ndash; had a sight of some gunboats on the canal a moment ago.<br/>Serapeum   Later<br/>The train pulled in to the station at about 10.30 &amp; it was all bustle getting the horses off &amp; the kit bags &amp; gear out. We moved to about &frac12; mile from the station &amp; linked horses &amp; shouted for something to eat but we had to leave it &amp; go &amp; put down the horse lines &ndash; we got the horses on the lines before tea , it was biscuits &amp; bully again</p>
