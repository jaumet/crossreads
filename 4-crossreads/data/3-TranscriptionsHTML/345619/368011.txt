<p>On this card is a donkey that people ride on in Egypt, you can see they are not very big, and the funny saddle they have on them. And you can see the woman with the jar on her head that I told you of them  carrying water in, you should try to carry things on <u>your</u> head and you will see how hard it is.  Goodbye little girl.<br/>From Dad</p>
