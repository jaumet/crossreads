  
 October, 1915 Saturday 2 Big Budget of old letters which had been to Gallipoli & back rec'd this morning - People are good to write but I cannot answer all. Just had a  Carbuncle  Knifed on my forearm & inoculated for CHOLERA so am not too cheerful & arm sore.  Dates  are now ripe & the Palms have great golden clusters, which melt like butter in the mouth; so different to our squashed Dates, often pressed by Arab feet into the Boxes!!!  Long letters Aug 15th & 17th from Mother & envelope will be returned correctly addressed.  water clearer, Nile subsiding, when flooded like Pea Soup 18% Lime, 9% IRON 8% Quartz 68% water & Sand - very good as fertilizer but not pleasant in the Bath
