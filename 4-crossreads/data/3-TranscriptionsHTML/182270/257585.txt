<p>TUESDAY,&nbsp;SEPTEMBER 30, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Lopping in Top paddock</p>
<p>in morning. Tickle shifted</p>
<p>Darby to Middle bore, but we</p>
<p>found (after getting tools stuck ect)</p>
<p>that it was all falling in at the</p>
<p>bottom &amp; as its only a 5 in hole</p>
<p>Darby cannot do anything with it.</p>
