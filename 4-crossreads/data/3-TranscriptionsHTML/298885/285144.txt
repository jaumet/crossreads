<p>wasting any time boarded our train for London which left at 2.40PM and when we had put 75 miles behind us we were getting out at Victoria Street Station at 4.55PM. Out of 3 train loads there were only about 40 Australians, so we were collected together and marched to AIF Hd Qtrs and after getting our overseas passes signed we were our own bosses for 10 whole days, a fact we can hardly realise</p>
<p>As it was about 6.30PM when we came away from AIF Hd Qtrs and everybody being more or less tired we did not waste much time in getting a bed.</p>
