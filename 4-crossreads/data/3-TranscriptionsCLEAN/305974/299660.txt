  
 30 Monday A very bleak day. The bearers of A section are billeted in a loft, & it is very comfortable.  There is a stove in the room which keep the place very warm.  This is a very small village but they have a very nice church here. There are also three cafes which all sell beer, so it is a home for the  Bhoys .  We play five hundred all day to pass the time away.  25 per cent leave to Abbeyville is only now granted. 
 31 Tuesday As we have to have a pass now to go to Abbeyville I put in for leave & obtained it from 2 pm till 8 pm.  Went into town with Freddy Ryan.  The military police are very strict & keep on demanding our passes.  Saw bill Freeman in Town.  Wrote ten Post cards & a letter & sent them away.  Received 2 letters by the mail today got home about 9.30 pm. 
 1 November  Wednesday Fell in at 10 am & left Monflieres for Vauchelles a distance of about thirteen Kilometres (about 8 miles).  Vauchelles les Domart is only a very small village & we are billeted in very dirty houses.  It was an ideal day for marching today, but started to rain during the evening.  There are plenty of apples about here.  Autumn is now nearly over, & most of the trees have shed their leaves.  Plowing & sowing have started, & everybody seems to be busy.
