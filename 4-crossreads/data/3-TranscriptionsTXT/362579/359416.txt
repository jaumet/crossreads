a   Tomato. My it is cold   &  wet today, am afraid we are in for winter now. I shall get out my Combs, glad I've got a good supply. Also woollen pyjamas. My cream cashmere nighties are not warm enough for winter here.

So glad you have bought some Equity Shares for me, that is   just  what I wished for.
