I got 3 more sheets giving to me after Tea &amp; I put them on the Side &amp; a chum gave me a door he brought home, so in spite of the Mean Theives I slept in my hut that night not being required for duty. Thursday 29th 8/17. I was called out for duty as Pilot which meant that I was standing by my Engine all day to work any specials if required anyhow nothing doing so I never turned a wheel. All day long and during the night things were quiet, nothing happening worthy of note. Friday 30th . my Chum during the day brought his stretcher over &amp; camped with me in the Hut. I was booked again on duty at Midnight on the shtr, when signing on</p>
