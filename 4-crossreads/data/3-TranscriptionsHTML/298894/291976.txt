<p>bit of exercise. They told me that two torpedoes were fired at them on the last trip, having a very narrow escape.</p>
<p>Sunday 10th. Four of us went aboard the Swiftsure for tea and dinner &amp; had a splendid time &amp; a fine old yarn with the warrant officers. We left there with 200 odd pkts of cigarettes but owing to a dispute with one of the party who had had too much spirit as to who owned the stuff he was pitched into the water &amp; many of the cigarettes with him. He afterwards reported us for robbing him but no notice was taken of him &amp; he was glad to let the matter slide in the morning. We gained a little information &amp; news concerning movements but mostly enjoyed the social side &amp; two good meals off real china again somewhat of a change from tin plates etc.</p>
<p>Monday 11th. Nothing doing much bar work. Had a go in with my assistant &amp; refused him leave during the afternoon as he was slacking. Have a slight cold in the head my first touch for months</p>
<p>Wednesday 13th. Nothing doing bar rumours of a ship with a large mail being sunk. The mention of the mail makes it a personal matter the loss of the ship being passed over</p>
