<p>Blaney Tronville.  D.R.<br/>Weather fine and clear.<br/>Wemnt for a spin to Bonnay and Callanvelle. Had a talk with some Yankee Engineers on a Bridge job.<br/>Bob  Butcher came down &ndash; had the usual talk.<br/>A few planes  - a - la Fritz across after heavy guns.<br/>Rumored that Fritz had captured Estairs and S-illo up Flanders way. I sincerely trust that such is not the case.</p>
