  
 Ballanarane Lonan I O Man 
 Dear Harry This is another part of the promenade, and is visited by thousands of people in the Summer time. The old boat house that used to be there has all gone, and beautiful waiting rooms built in its place. There are three theatres here one, called the Gaiety, is opposite the lunch stand you see besides there are, the Palace and Derby Castle, two large ball rooms, and Opera houses. The Palace has a floor of 18,000 square feet of polished oak, the largest room without pillars in the world they say. I have not much room to say more so will conclude with love from all. I am ever your loving Aunt Hannah
