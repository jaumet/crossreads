<p>This land is different to Egypt as we know it.  Here it RAINS, in fact has been for 4 days, last night an extra heavy shower one of the men sang out QUACK! QUACK,!!! &amp; not another sound was heard.<br/>Like me buying my Fowl holding out 5 Piastres &amp; saying "Chuck Chuck" only language available.<br/>But in the dead of night it showed the men were right -of course very bucked at their success.<br/>Gen <strike>Chetwynde</strike> paraded us &amp; did the usual about our wonderful cavalry work makes the Tommies a bit jealous, but they always do their bit &amp; certainly in France, <u>a big bit</u>.</p>
