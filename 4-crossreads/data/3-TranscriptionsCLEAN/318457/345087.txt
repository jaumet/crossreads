We steamed up coast inside the barrier, and anchored during Wed night. Next morning we arrived at Thurs. Id. when energetic measures were taken to load as much woodwork, tools etc as possible, most of which had been made ready beforehand. We came alongside Burns' Philp's wharf about 8am and put into anchorage about 3.40pm.
I sent a number of letters and attended to certain other personal matters. I also got in as good a supply of mens necessities as could be got.
Next morning 7th Aug we sailed at 7.30 and were ordered to join the Flag at at rendezvous S.lat 12.10 long       .
We took a course down the Darwin Reef to an opening near Cape Melville and thence to the rendezvous. Whilst at Townsville we had siezed an Oil steamer the "Cyreena" from which the destroyer took supplies. Again at Thurs. Id we took another larger oil steamer containing about 1100 tons of oil fuel besides benzine. This ship accompanied us along the Barrier Reef but being slow (about 8 to 9 Knots) was sent on to Port Moresby. We passed through the Barrier reef at 11.30am and met a mood sea with considerable swell raised by the sky S.E. trade wind which caused some pitching to.
