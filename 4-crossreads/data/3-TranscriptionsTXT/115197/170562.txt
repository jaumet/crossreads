 After all the &quot;Tassies&quot; have left the Rio Pardo, quite reluctantly, I am sure! - we steam out to sea once again. 
 Of course the anchor is lifted before doing so. 
 A very rough sea proves friendly after we turn North. 
  July 22nd  
 A bright, sunny day!&nbsp; At noon we have 411 miles to travel to &quot;Our Harbour&quot;. 
 We now number 150 N.S.Welshmen and 40 Queenslanders.
