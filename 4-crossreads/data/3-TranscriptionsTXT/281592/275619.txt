Orders have been issued to increase the accomodation at Mena House.  We are all anxious to leave Egypt.  We will probably have to wait till a passage of the Dardanelles has been forced before we will leave here.
The increased accomodation in the hospital has been rapidly filled up.
March 27th Sun.
Heavy shower of rain fell during the night.
A severe sand storm this morning.  It covered all our gear with sand and made us very uncomfortable getting into our eyes, ears, nose and mouth also.  The Pyramid is completely hidden from our view.
We cannot keep the pegs of our tents in the sand so strong is the wind blowing.  We have a great deal of trouble with flies during the day when the sun is hot.  In the cool of the evening the flies disappear and then the mosquitoes turn to torment us comes.
I have resorted to wearing my Balaclava cap during the night, but still they get at me.  The very small exposed parts of my face and also my wrists get bitten all over.
