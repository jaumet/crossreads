1916 March 14
Tuesday
A little more work a lot of leisure. Nothing of import. Oh yes though. Receive wire from Stan telling of his arrival in Sydney with Harry Alice and Ted to see me off. Of course our day of sailing has been postponed till next Tues. Go down to Hewletts meet them. Have dental leave till tomorrow night.
