and fought till every man was down. No snivelling, baby-killers these, but big men, all very tall. One fellow was 7 feet high. The day was fairly quiet.
5/3/17.
There was no incident yesterday, a couple of unlucky shells caused casualties in the company. We moved up further, for the advance continues slowly. There was no incident last night except dug a new trench in a field that was fairly free from shell holes. This is curious remembering the bogs we have been living in for the past months. Have a cold time of it, the weather is bitter and we have no shelter, and no blankets. Am in a post in the front line. Hinie is not far away, one of his snipers nearby bagged this little one today. Have his "possie" marked and will have something to say to him presently.
