<p>Still Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;28.4.&#39;15</p>
<p>My dear Home-folk:- That includes all the nephews and nieces, and Mabel, Francie, Viva, Leoda, Ida, Nora, Molly, Mrs.K., Farmer Whyte, Percy Allen, Billy etc. etc.</p>
<p>The cry of the Light Horsement in Egypt at present is &quot;How long O Lord, How long.&quot;</p>
<p>For all the infantry and artillery have gone to the Dardanelles to thrash the Turk, while we have to stick here on the Desert like an &quot;Army of Occupation.&quot; Of course we are assured that we shant be long, and that once the landing has been affected we will follow straight away. But somehow that does not satisfy us.</p>
<p>We have had a rather interesting time lately. The most interesting function was the &quot;Fete du 75&quot; held in Cairo. I had to attend several meetings and then direct the Sports. I enclose a cutting from the paper and a programme.</p>
<p>Headquarters have just finished their Musketry. We rose at 4.30 a.m. tramped a mile across the desert and then fired at 100, 200, 300 and 500 yards. Out of the headquarters men I came second, being just beaten by one point by Serg. Shelley (Percy Allen knows him). The Brigadier and I both had a special shoot at the &quot;disappearing man&quot; and we both got the possible. A khaki &quot;head and shoulders&quot; pops up out of a trench for a few seconds and disappears, and while in sight we have to fire. First time I got 4 shots home out of 5, and the second time I got them all home. The only shot I missed landed right in front of the mound. I know I aimed exactly right, so I am blaming the faulty ammunition (This is the old excuse).</p>
<p>General Sir John Maxwell came out to the camp yesterday and inspected the Brigade. I felt quite important riding in his entourage round the lines. Also we had a buckjumping show for his edification. We have an outlaw here that has already thrown 29 of the best riders in Egypt. He threw three men yesterday and is still ready for more.</p>
<p>Wonderful sunset yesterday; sky all pink and gold and amethyst and purple and azuline: but nothing garish. All soft tones, &#39;cept the Pyramids, which seemed to be dirty triangles stuck at the bottom of the picture. The light shades here wonderful.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t believe in magic do you? No more do I. But there are strange things here that the Egyptians have had handed down from generation to generation. They probably got some of their magic from the ancient Chaldeans. (You will remember that the magicians of Pharoah were able to turn their rods into serpents). Well a very wise Egyptian (who by the bye is a freemason) gave Major Lynch a valuable Scarab mounted in a gold ring. There is a book dealing with it and wonderful properties and powers are attributed to this uncanny thing. It is a talisman and a protection to the owner, but has deadly powers. It is claimed that nothing can harm the owner, who however can shrivel up an enemy by just pointing at him and muttering incantations (not unlike our Northern Territory natives who&nbsp;<u>will</u>&nbsp;an enemy to die by pointing a bone at him). I had some fun with a Dragoman who wanted to sell me some scarabs. I pulled his leg a treat</p>
