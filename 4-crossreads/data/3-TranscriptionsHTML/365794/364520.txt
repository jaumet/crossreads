<p>Sunday 28th April 1917 [1918]<br/>A beautiful day, wind cold when sitting in grounds.  Really up and walking, a bit shakily it is true, around the premises.  2 S.A's to talk to Officer Gibbs newly married and Pte. Howard.<br/>Not up in time for church as new M.O., C. Rankin, visits.<br/>10.45 a.m. cold &amp; stiff, now I learn to appreciate the true gentleman C. Spencer is &amp; the thorough doctor Col. Trout is.  One always finds out these things by comparison, it would seem.  This one merely shrugs re the swab &amp; Sister takes it later on.<br/>N. Sister tells me she has R. Main, 10 officers including myself, 42 in Annex &amp; 24 at other end Left Main, so not so bad for n. duty, most all convalescent.<br/>We hear all late leave stopped for 31 &amp; Nasalie [?] Hosp'l's. one fair lady or two, coming home intoxicated!!!  Ah Sisters!!</p>
