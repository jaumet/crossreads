We pitched our camp about 3P.M &amp; got under cover as we all needed a blow. Had to get our tea the best way we could, some of the lads beginning to wish they were home again, popped into bunk early &amp; had a good sleep. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>(25) Fine day things trifle mixed at present. Started on our new menu of Beef &amp; Biscuit. There are a great many troops around here, British Troops, Egyptian Lancers &amp; Camel Corp. Paid a visit to the Lancashire Fusilers Barracks this afternoon. They are a fine crowd of men &amp; can drill some. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>(26) Coy Orderly Sgt. We had a march out across the Desert this morning. Rifle drill this afternoon, we get a good view of the Pyrimids from here. P aid a visit to \"Heliopolis\" (City of the Sun) this evening, very pretty place &amp; some fine Buildings, especially the Palace Hotel.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>(27) Went through our usual parades to day. Had leave to visit the City of Cairo, had a good tour round, there are people of all nations here especially French, there are some fine buildings but the City generally is rotten, it fairly hums, they dont have any sanitary arrangements at all. There does not appear to be any rule of the road. Donkeys, Camels Garrys, Horses etc seem to go where they wish, Of course as one can expect the City is crowded with Soldiers, who the Egyptians profess to like, no doubt on account of their spending powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(28) Sand storm passed over camp this morning making things very uncomfortable. Very had job trying to keep rifles clean on account of the sand. Usual Church Parades held. Swarm of locusts passed over camp this morning. Had the afternoon to ourselves.

After the usual waste of time we set off to Aerodrome &amp; arrived just in time for dinner. Had to fall in again in full marching order for the general inspection by General Sir Ian Hamilton.  Something like 25,000 men on parade, they stirred the dust up a treat on the march past both horses &amp; men one could hardly discern the company in front the dust was so thick at times.
