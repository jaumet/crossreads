<p>8.9.16<br/>Fri 8th<br/>Received our passes this morning &amp; rode to Mahomedah.   the train left at 9.30 &amp; we got to Port Said soon after midday, had lunch at the Continental then took a walk down to the Empire Club, &amp; tea, bread, Butter &amp; Cakes here, &amp; at sundown walked out along the breakwater, put in half an hour yarning to some old gentleman fishing there &amp; got back just in time for the finish of a game of water polo played by two teams off the French cruiser Porthieu, &amp; got back to the picture show just in time for the 6.30 to 9 performance, but it was rather stale to me as I had seen them a few nights ago &amp; the same pictures were being screened, got to bed at the Continental at 9.30</p>
