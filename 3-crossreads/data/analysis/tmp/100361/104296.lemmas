 Sat Jan 4 . Had Breakfast at War Chest . It is easili the best place for a feed in London . Stroll around the citi . Saw the chang of Guard at Whitehal . Veri interest . The weather is veri cold and wet . It is much lighter in the citi at night than in the daytim . London is full of soldier , and it is difficult to get a seat at ani of the Theatr . I book a seat at the " Coliseum" . It was a good show . The music alon was worth the money . I did not care for the Russian Ballet . There was a perform seal that was almost human . Sun 5 . Attend Servic at Westminst Abbey . The sing was beauti , but the servic was "dri as dust " . Was on my way back to the Club when I met Bill Avonson , so I hop on to a Train with him and went as far as the " Eagl Hut " where he had to meet a chap . Then we had some dinner at a Dago restaur , where they charg us 4/6 each , and we left still feel hungri . After that we stroll around the Citi . Had Tea at the " Strand Corner Hous " . Veri nice . Good Food and Good music and price veri reason . After that I went with him to where he was stay , near King X Station . We sat yarn for a time then went and had some Tea . Eggs and Toast .
