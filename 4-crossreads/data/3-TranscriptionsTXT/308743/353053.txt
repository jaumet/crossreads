 Reveille 6 Had a good night for I' good oh the first thing that greeted us this morning in the hold was 2 dead horses, after heaving them overboard we disinfected the ship.  About 10 smoke was visible on the horizon &amp; later on it turned out to be the N Zealand [indecipherable] of 11 transports with 5 warships as convoy 4 British &amp; 1 Japanese the Jap came in &amp; left the contingent at anchor outside then the Britishers followed &amp; paid their compliments to us as they passed later on the troopships followed &amp; got a rousing send in from the boys.  Teddy went ashore &amp; later informed us that all letters have to be postcards &amp; thoroughly censored at that.  No letter from Nell I can't make it out.

Had a decent smoke on our Port bow this morning but it passed right over  censorship is strictly enforced from today &amp; we have had some of our letters sent back to us.  I got my first two letters today one from home &amp; the other from Nell.  they were worth their weight in gold.  Another horse died in No 6 hold today, making 4 for the trip.  fixed up No 1 hold as regards fodder.  Toby gave a good lecture on map reading, his contouring &amp; measuring was particularly good.
