<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>It was at this town that I wrote and told you how I had heard a Scottish Pipe Band thrill both soldiers and civilians with their music. &nbsp;We were stationed at Brancourt, a few kilometres away, on that foward stunt.</p>
<p>We have joined up with the Section two mornings ago, and we are all billetted in a big hotel. &nbsp;We loaded for the Artillery on the 27th at Roisel, and came on to Fresnay-le-Grand where we put in the night. &nbsp;We set off next morning and picked up the rest who had just moved forward from away down near Abbeville a day previously. &nbsp;In a day or so they are going back again to where they came from, where we will be back to the Artillery.</p>
<p>The weather has been remarkable for its mildness, and excepting a day here and there of rain and frosty mornings of course, it has been quite sunny and mild during the day.</p>
