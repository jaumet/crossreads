  
 Friday 27  [26] April 1917 [1918] Visit 4 p.m. from Canon Garland, says how well I look etc., prayers, very earnest, long talk with all ouside [outside] doings of Australians.  At Alex. a party landed bound for Aust., 81 with only 1 leg apiece disobeyed all orders, went into wine shop, broke bottles etc.  Arrested on return, next day marched to another camp but over 100 men with fixed bayonets & 130 rounds of ammunition!!  Our reputation grows. Crowded Church for Anzac day & great success in every way.  130 boys at Aust. Club for lunch afterwards. A submarine reported in the Indian Ocean. Very nice visit from O.C. & smiles when I say "hope so" to his remarks "leaving us soon Sister".  He is very thorough in his work I imagine (Scotch).
