<p>Spruce is as good a bushman as myself and we did excellent work.  Specimens fairly straight already won are, Scrub or holly oak,<br/>[Drawings]<br/>Pine (never higher than 10 ft.) dwarf yew, <strike>and</strike> a kind of Willow and a very thorny thorn.  The pine was the more plentiful and I got two specimens of this wood but taking it alround the stuff is really scrub &amp; not meant for walking sticks.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the rain came on fairly stiff and Spruce went back to Hughes' camp with a touch of malaria.  I waited patiently in bed for my bout but thanks to extra blankets &amp; a good afternoon sleep I dodged it although I got rather windy when the temperature rose to uncomfortable degrees.</p>

<p>Today I felt quite well thank you and with our Sergeant Rogers made the best of a dull wet day by building or rather helping</p>
