Bgde. left Gully about 9pm. & bivouaced some 3 miles back but were scattered by shellfire about midnight & made for trenches at hand y where we slept till morning. One man was killed within 6 yds of where I lay & all I knew was the feeling of a shower of dirt. Never heard the report I had well dosed myself with Rum before retiring & was surely doped & dead sleepy with same.
