<p>exasperated and thus might have overstepped ordinary bounds, so the Sentry for the occasion became "deaf &amp; dumb", but thoroughly enjoyed the experience &amp; chuckled mightily inwardly.  However the game was finished without further comment by either.</p>
<p>At the end of the round, the last hole, the A/Caddy master was waiting near the green &amp; although the Sentry had been approaching &amp; putting wonderfully well, very much above his ordinary style, this was one, of the two greens, in two rounds of 18 holes upon which the Sentry took three putts all the others were holed in two or under.</p>
<p>This the Sentry accounted for by the wonderfully good grass grown on the putting greens in the Old Country for although it looks thick &amp; matted, the blades are so soft that the direction of the ball is not diverted from a straight line, when its impetus is dying down, such as is apparent on most "greens" in Australia</p>
<p>By a method well known to Australians the A/Caddy Master was able to discuss the "round" under very comfortable circumstances.</p>
<p>The fact of the request on behalf of the A/Caddy Master's comfort, being made by one of "those Australians" the House Steward read the rules, for once, with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>The A/Caddy Master thoroughly enjoyed the account of the sturdy support of the local talent by the caddy. Oh Yes! he said, It's a real good man, that can shake the local men off the pedestals upon which the "young uns" place them.</p>
<p>The man that succeeds must be a world famed "top notcher".</p>
<p>During Luncheon hour the Staff of this Club could not have treated the Sentry better if he had been one of the highest in the land.</p>
<p>An incident occurred during the afternoon round which although not quite expected, according to ordinary traditions, amused instead of annoyed</p>
