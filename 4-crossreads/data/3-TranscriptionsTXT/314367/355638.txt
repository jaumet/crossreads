to the best looking Marys - They smoked them very nicely - How the men danced - not the women - I only saw one woman dance. Some of them - seated on their crouching with bent knees - They had coconut shell strung on bamboo & this they rattled & chanted a monotonous sing song - Yes - I also saw a body of girls, with some elder women, with flowers in their hands - form a circle & chant weirdly - Some men - had wax masks tight fitting - military - scarlet - tunics & then bunches of green fern all round their waists hanging down - They were armed with old rifles & gave a military dance - rocking - swaying, crouching, jumping up & hurling forward - then sinking & swaying & all the while the tom toms beat the time. This went on all morning & all the aftn - In the aftn rice & biscuit was served out & roast pig & finally the Administrator distributed trade tobacco & then finale - Thorold is the administrator -
