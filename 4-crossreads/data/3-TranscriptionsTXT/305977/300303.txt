January 1st 1916New Years Day;  No holiday for us. We are down to hard work reorganising & there is a lot of work to do.  Received more letters & parcels.  Wrote to Doles.  Had a splendid dinner.  Turkey & ham & Xmas pudding & drinks.  Many of the lads got leace & went into Cairo on leave.  Met Les Whipp of Croydon Park.  He recognised me first.  Was jolly glad to see him as I hadn't met a cobber for a long time.
