<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I'm not writing a letter this mail, &amp; just dropping a note so as not to miss a week. I'm also enclosing a menu to show you that we have a mess, &amp; that although we are miles from anywhere, we are not starving. The circular drawings at the bottom of the first page, represent medicine in the only form procurable out here. In case you don't understand the references on the opposite I'll explain them shortly. Monash gully is the most dangerous place I've ever had a months rest in. Suvla Bay never had much to do with me, I</p>
