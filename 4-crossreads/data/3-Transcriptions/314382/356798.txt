<p>November 3rd: -<br/>Exceedingly hot all day.</p>
<p>Moved from mid-stream to a wharf at 10 am, and, shortly after 1 pm the first trainload of patients arrived. At 4 pm the 2nd batch came aboard, practically all these being walking cases, the men in many instances having contracted fever in Egypt and therefore they had never been to the front.</p>
<p>Ward D1, was filled with the most serious cases, most of the amputation cases being here admitted. In E1 &amp; 2 some severe dysentery cases were taken along with a few isolated enteric patients and 2 others who had been operated upon for an appendicitis whilst in Egypt.</p>
