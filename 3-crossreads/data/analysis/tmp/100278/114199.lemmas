 11th Had all the men I could find out this morn , we were get a lot of old barb wire from Fritz 's entangl and also French " concertina " wire and stake this is to be use for practis so that when we go out wire we will understand our work . This afternoon we had a go at a new type of entangl that Brigad had recommend as be effect and quick , the Brigadi , Major and a few more of the head were there to see it carri out but in my opinion it is a rank failur for men could creep through it quit easili . The plan of it was someth like this , everi 7 or 8ft we screw one of the long steel upright into the ground , they are shape like a cork screw and are veri fine thing , opposit these steel stake we drove a wooden stake about 4ft long into the ground
