<p>Mum was asking in her letter if there was anything she could send along &ndash; Well if it would not be too much trouble, a few tins of welcome nigger tobacco would be most acceptable.

<p>Sorry those photos of Mr Budden's have not come along but I am sure he would be only too pleased to send another. I never see him these days, but Jack Fell frequently looks us up.</p>
