May 19 night just off Southampton. Cigs dished out after tea,
20 Glorious morning. One or two tramps passing along the fairway. On our Right is dear old England & on the left the beautiful Isle of Wight its foreshores literally covered with trees out of which peep a few fine old buildings or mayhap even an ancient Castle.
Left the boat about 9.30 waited on the platform for over half an hour & then entrained. We are now waiting just outside Southampton - what for I don't know. - Just finished a bowl of tea some bread & jam & a cig! There are several women carriage cleaners outside yarning to the boys, mostly middle aged & grey haired women.(3rd London Genl Hosp Wandsworth SW) Arrived here per motor from Waterloo Station about 3.40 had Cocoa, a hot bath, & then tea. Am in Ward D3, & there are some of our boys here.[in margin] London
