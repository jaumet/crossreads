<p>Flessells 13/12/16 Today we sacked our cook and 3 batmen and the mess has improved.  Beggs is the new cook and had bad luck lately.  His wife died, one child died, he got trench feet, and the very day he was off on English leave, he developed V.D.  Dick examination proves him well again now.  A fine cold morning.  Rode out with Battalion to practice ground and there we carried out our attack.  Major Genl. Regge and G.S.O 1 &amp; 2 were there.  Aeroplanes worked with us but misty air thwarted them.  There were about 2500 men engaged.  Afterwards all officers conferred and Colonel Forbes and myself criticised the operation.  Col. Bridges uttered some commonplaces.  The General was evacuated sick again today and RS. went back to Brigade.  All boots for us arrived today and proved to be of the Blucher pattern.   As the men are right on the ground we would have been very glad to take even these rotten things but our damn fool R.Q.M.S refused delivery.  This boot scandal &ndash; the issue of an excellent English boot first, then the scrapping of our good Aust. ones and the cancellation of all contracts in Australia, then as soon as that is done, the heaping on us of miserable shoddy &ndash; this is going to be heard of after the war.  In the evening all the officers came down to a conference and we went over tomorrow's operation.  My French is not progressing at all &ndash; rather going back.  I get no time for talking to the people but some of the men are quite fair linguists now.  Crosier sketched me about 4 but just missed the expression again.  Last time was on the Peninsula in the Reg office.  Bed 1015.</p>
