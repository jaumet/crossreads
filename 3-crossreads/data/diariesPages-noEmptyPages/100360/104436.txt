Sat. Sept. 22. Misty but fine. Fritz tried very hard to knock our Pill Box in --- but am jolly glad to say he failed. He put 2 shells right on top, but it only shook ‘em off & we are still going strong. A good few wounded came through & we were kept busy. We had Breakfast as well as possible under the circs. About 8 a.m. the 1st F. Amb. came to relieve us & never were they more welcome, as things were getting most uncomfortable around our Pill Box. We marched back along the Menin Road to our A.C.S. where we got aboard motor Lorries & returned to our H.Q, at Poperinghe. It was a very pleasant surprise to go back & we greatly appreciated the good dinner that awaited us. We also had a hot shower & clean change of clothes. After Tea we had an Investiture of the Bottes.

Sun. Sept. 23. Woke up this morning feeling refreshed after a good night’s sleep & the Bath. Had Break. at 7. Fell in at 8 & came away in motor lorries to Ypres, where we now are awaiting orders. Yesterday I got a Letters from Mrs Ibbs & Ruth, containing that postcard of M.S. which I was so anxious to get. As we passed along in the Lorries we met a number of Belgians on their way to Church. It struck me – what a contrast. They were on their way to a Peaceful gathering, & we were on our way to join in the bloomin’ argument with Fritz. We are camped in a big dug-out, which is built near the Town Square. The entrances are cut through what was once the city walls. It is about 6ft thick & built of brick. It has accommodation for about 1000 men. Bricky & I took a stroll round the town, but as Fritz was sending over a few souvs. we returned.
