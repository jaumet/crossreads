<p>Caestre for an hour or two, &amp; got some milk chocolate from a Church Army hostel in an old house.  We also had a chat with some French Canadians.<br/>Next morning we marched from the rest camp to the 1st Division details where we heard that the 3rd Brigade (ours) is in the line.  Not moving out, Gray &amp; I went into what we thought was Caestre, but which turned out to be Fl&ecirc;tre, another village near the former.<br/>We saw plenty to interest us there &amp; walked out on the main road towards the front &amp; another village.  This is just on the border of Belgium, (about five miles from it I fancy), &amp; most of the villages named on the sign posts in that</p>
