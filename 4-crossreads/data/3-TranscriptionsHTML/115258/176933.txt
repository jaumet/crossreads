<p>I generally wear all my clothes on treck and only carry a towel, razor and soap. Even then the ammount of stuff being round our horses is awful. Regular white knights they make of us. I am sorry to hear of Hughie Spring enlisting - it always seems so much harder on them than the unmarried chaps - and there still seem to be a good many unmarried men keeping the home fires burning round Mudgee. Thank you for sending that photo to Mrs Jacob. But Mother did you put an s on her name? It is a fearful crime to do so I believe. Harry has just gone down to a 6 months cadet school to train for a commission. We are sorry to loose him but he has earnt his com. alright. Those waivey looking lines in that photo of Bethlehem are the terraces of stone round the hills. You see the hills are very rocky there and the Arabs have picked up the stones and build walls to stop the winter rains washing all the earth away. The earth soon fills up level with the top of the wall and then they start in to cultivate their wheat fields, which are about the size of wallaby tracks along the side of the mountains at home. It makes it terrible hard work to get up these hills on horse back because each paddock is about six feet higher than the one &nbsp;below it and you have to wind about backwards and forwards for hours before you reach the top</p>
