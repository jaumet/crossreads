January, 1916Tuesday 4No news yet as to our probable movements.  Put in the afternoon repairing a watch in dad's workshop.  It rains all afternoon & night & the water penetrates through our flimsey wooden houses & makes things very unpleasant.
Wednesday 5Write a letter home & generally waste the morning.  Go on  a short route march with the Coy in the afternoon.  March through Matariah & see one of the famous obelisks a small replica of Cleopatra's Needle.
