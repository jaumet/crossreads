Dear Judge,I got back to Anzac a week ago, & have been going hard ever since.I found a large number of letters, awaiting me, amongst them 2 from you, of 14 Aug. & 1st September. Thank you so much for them. Letters are such a Godsend to us here.We have just gone into the Trenches & I am desperately busy - Please do not think me discourteous, but I have written Mrs Langtree such news as I have, & asked her to send my letter on to you. Her address is Greenoaks Avenue, Darling Point.
