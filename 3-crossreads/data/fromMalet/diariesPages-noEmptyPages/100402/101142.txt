Friday 27 September
Early this morning we arrived at Pont Remy where we are now living. We have been house hunting all day, funniest experience imaginable finally got a nice room with nice people. This village on the river is pretty, 8 kilos from Abbeville but is full of all kinds of people, including W.A.A.Cs. Thank Heaven for a sight of civilization again.
