 23rd. June 1918. - 28th. June 1918. The second anniversary of our landing in France. How the time has flown by.  It is hard to realise that I have been in this country for two years. The changes that I have seen in the Unit has been enormous. One can scarcely recognise the old Unit now. Almost every second man I meet is a new hand. Quite a number of the old members have returned to Australia. "Lucky beggars". Alas! a few have made the supreme sacrifice, & a fair number have been wounded. Still I am going  strong & in good health so I have a lot to be thankful for. Splendid news to hand to day of the Enemy's offensive in Italy being a failure. The Austro-Germans have suffered sever casualties, & many prisoners have been captured. A little more news like this from the different fronts would be very acceptable at present, & would certainly cheer the troops up. 
 I have attended quite a number Pierrott shows lately, which were held by different Units in our vicinity. They were all enjoyable & helped to break the monotony of this Military existence. A few of the "Heads" inspected the ambulance on Friday the 26th. inst. 
 June 29th 1918 Baseball match arranged for the afternoon between the "Yanks" & our Ambulance. The match was most amusing & exciting. You probably know that this is the national game in America. An American Band gave items during the match.
