 30/6/17 Beaulencourt Reveille 6. A threatening morning. Arranged to move off for attack practice at 8 a.m. and 23rd had already moved ahead when cancelling orders arrived. Visited Crowther &amp; Duggan at 21st. lines. Returned to camp and the whole battalion paraded and drilled on grassy slope behind camp doing section drill bombing Lewis gunnery and signalling. At 11.30 with Stewart turned out &amp; inspected the Transport Section where, of late, there has been a great improvement. Found them all smart and like new pins but got text for a lecture in a shortage in iron rations and some field dressings &amp; a disc or two. Ordered the fixing &amp; unfixing of bayonets &ndash; rather awkward for mounted men to do without practice. Heavy rain came on after lunch and parade was held indors as a consequence. Officers lectured and specialists did their own particular work. Jack returned today and came over for a talk looking very fit and well. Very cold tonight in this airy place.
