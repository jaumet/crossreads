The Final PushAll eyes were on the news-papers about the time of which I am going to write. At this stage of the War, early August 1918, the German Army was further advanced than it ever was and from all appearances things were looking very bad for us. But then people, other than those actually engaged in the war operations, did not know the true conditions of things. They did not know that we were once more well organised very strong. They did not know that in the first week in August thousands of guns, shells soldiers were moving up towards the forward areas. They did not know our strength and that within a few days the greatest advance that was ever made would begin.This advance commenced in the early hours of day of the 8th August 1918, right along the whole Allied front. A few days previous to this attack we un knew something was coming off.The roads were literally covered with traffic. Wagons loaded with stores of shells going up; empty ones coming back for more. This continual stream of traffic was going day night amid air-raids by the Germans.Noticing this enormous movement of traffic we began to anticipate things and by the time the attack started we all knew what was doing.6th Aug. '18On August 6 at 4 p.m. we marched from Longpre (near Abbeville) to Conde where we had a hot meal, which was a luxury I may state, and embussed at 8 p.m.We were here able to get a few hours rocky until about 1 A.M. sleep in the busses. This snooze had many interuptions, as we were packed 25 men to a buss.
