<p>Dear Mum: -</p>
<p>This is just a little account of our scrap that I thought would interest you &amp; if possible would like Ruby to see it, as I cannot spare time to pen her a duplicate.</p>
<p>I am answering your letter of July 2nd under seperate cover.</p>
<p>Give love to tell, Kit &amp; all at home, &amp; accept the best of love &amp; kisses from your loving son</p>
<p>Birk</p>
<p>Keep this account in sight as much as possible, so I can give you more details when I come back &amp; compare with my diary.</p>
