<p>Thursday 13 January, 1916</p>
<p>Arrived safely at Tel-El-Kebir at 8.30 a.m. Mac was O.K. I went straight on duty. It is great to be back at it once more, 5 brigades are here with Artillery &amp; Light horse.</p>
<p>Received 6 parcels, had more than I knew what to do with but you may be sure that nothing was wasted.</p>
<p>Went &amp; saw Bob Dryden, he is well.</p>
<p>Best of all I received 25 letters, I had a gay old time reading them.</p>
<p>The Dervish trenches are only 5 minutes walk from the camp where the battle of Tel-El-Kebir was fought in the Egyptian War of 1882.</p>
