roam round Bapaume after tea : went into the vault under the ruined Cathedral seen the skulls : there are hundreds of them the tale is that they are the victims of the French revolution : heavy storm at night : thunder bad lightening very vivid : mere mortals their power seem very puny in comparison with nature : yarned before turning in, with the Lithgow "knuts"
Sunday July 8th
Bapaume : rain very muddy : Holy Com at 9.30 about 40 present : laid down after tea
Monday July 9th
Bapaume : showery : reveille 3.45 am : fell in in battle order marched to our "stunt" ground : I was attached to the A.M.C. for the day so done very little : the "boys" put in a heavy day "advanced" a long way so finished up pretty tired.
