<p>27-3-17<br/>Tue 27th<br/>The machine gun &amp; Field Amb. Combined played the Regt football this afternoon; it was a great game &amp; resulted in a scoreless draw. The Mounted Troops East of Gaza withdrew today &amp; allowed 9,000 Turkish reinforcements get into Gaza &amp; then closed up again to stop them getting back or so the rumor goes, we have had no official news through &amp; there appears to be more interest taken in football than in the fighting Went down for a dip this morning with several other Sigs. One of our planes was brought down in flames yesterday at Gaza; Two R.F.C. officers were killed</p>
