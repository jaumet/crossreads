All that this girl has done for me would take too long to tell but I shall return to her tout a l'heure.
This is the usual programme for each day now though I realise the strain cannot endure very long. But if human energy & application can conquer I am determined to win. When I have a definite task which depends on my efforts I can generally bend my will to it [indecipherable] there is no end in view like the Bar [elat] I have fear.
My health here does gives out finally & suffer from extreme exhaustion on return from Italy. The eyes too give under the strain but Brise doctors me up with colargyrol which is magn. She really ought to have been a doctoresse.
So many of my days follows the above programme that I need not rechronicle it.
I wish I had some records of all the little thoughtful acts that of Brise during this period when at the best I could but be regarded as a nuisance in the house. She is all goodness but I have yet to realise the depth of her affection when my life lay in danger in May 1920. She is a jewel without any price.
Every Sunday I cease work & spend the day in an outing something always taking Brise who represents it herself
