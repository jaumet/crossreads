 of pursu the sensibl cours , and allow them to dri a littl first . We have a number of men just return from Hospit with Malaria , but these men have to stand out in the midday sun groom for half an hour with the rest . In Egypt where the climat was not near as hot , we were forbidden to work in the midday sun . Here , in a place which is reckon uninhabit by white men in the summer we are out all day .
