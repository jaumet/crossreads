Friday 18.5.17
72 of us going out into line again to-night to do a further turn in. 5 men go on leave, very lucky to get away at such a time. Left camp 5.30 pm, luckily got on of the back posts; still Fritz made it fairly warm with big stuff around about, especially in the village of Neuriel near by.
Saturday 19.5.17
Dug in for a bit of shelter, much quieter than when we were out last. Fritz has been using a great number of gas shells has caught a good many of our boys napping.
Sunday 20.5.17
Very few casualties coming through, much quieter since the "Tommies"
