<p>Sunday 30 December 1917</p>
<p>Spent the Day with Dolly &amp; returned by 6 o'clock train a 3 hours run to Moascar expect to get away tomorrow.</p>
<p>Took Dolly to Continental for Dinner, she has been to 3 or 4 dances since she came, &amp; girls are very acceptable &ndash; so far English people here. Peace proposals are in the air &amp; I really think the end is not so far off as some may think.</p>
