  
 Friday Nov 27 (onboard Rheno Westfalia at sea) : Yesterday morning I left Alexis Hafen with 11 men to search for a steam boat belonging to the Rheinisch Mission. I am now on board the steam-boat & the "Lili" is following in our wake; we are returning to Alexis. From information received we decided to visit Kurun, on the south coast of Dampier Isd. We cleared Alexis Heads at 6.30 & set our course (Nth). Cape Croissilles was passed at 8.40 and we then steered for Dampier. The morning was very hazy & nothing could be seen ahead for about 1/2 an hour. Then gradually out of the mist grew the shape of the huge mountain which for the past week or two has seemed to us the abode of mystery & bloody deeds. The haze began to lift & the trees showed up, then the roofs of a few houses came into view. At last we saw apparently nestling among the trees the object of our search, a steam launch about 45 feet long, with awnings spread. Almost at the same time we noticed a large sailing boat making in our direction. Rifles were brought on deck & the ensign was hoisted. As we drew nearer we could see that the boat was manned by natives while a European sat in the stern sheets. This proved to be Herr Schmidt whose plantation was raided some few weeks ago, on which occasion he himself was wounded with an arrow & one of his boys was murderously hacked with a tomahawk. As recorded in an earlier page of this diary the boy died from his injuries. Hr Schmidt came aboard & piloted us through the reef; we told him the object of our visit & he took us to the Missionary's house where we arranged for the temporary use
