boats &  small steamers  &  motor launches decorated with red, white &  blue also flags waving  &  flying about. It was a grand sight & very funny the remarks of some of the men to their friends.. We were quite entertained for hours.We sailed at 12.40 p.m.  &  the harbour was looking beautiful. We were enjoying nature but sorry when we were informed that  Mess was waiting for us, so we had to go down to lunch. After luncheon came up on deck  &  had a lovely afternoon, talking &  sewing. But my poor pal was feeling very ill. so had to lye down. Could not come down to afternoon tea. I am quite enjoying the trip, the weather is beautiful  &  can see the coast all the time. The beach is a white sand  & the cliffs are covered with green tree & grass. Dorothy was too ill to come down to dinner, so has turned in, she has been very sick so may feel better after a while.The dining saloon looked very gay at dinner. The centre table was very bright with the officers in full dress uniform &  the nurses in grey dress, red cap. badges & white caps. No aprons, to save washing. Dr Webb. our Major. said he was quite proud of his staff, we all look such a healthy fine lot of women.
