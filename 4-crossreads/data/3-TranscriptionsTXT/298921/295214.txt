August, 1915Tuesday 313 weeks today in bed, getting as far as a pig -Hear our Brigade is to come back to be reorganised - as so many casualties, this may mean I get my Captaincy & will not go back to Gallipoli for some time - or 90 Spencer Browne. Warm countries agree with me & Egyptian summers have no terrors like a Peninsular Winter.Tell Joe a Periscope would be a good thing for duck shooting our men use them to watch fights among themselves - I was amused at Anzac to see one chap on the outside of ring run away & come back with a Periscope so he could see the fight better - I mean fists
