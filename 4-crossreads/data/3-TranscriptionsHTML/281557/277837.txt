<p>Monday Jan 17th<br/>a bit cloudy : not a ripple on the water : Revellie 4 am : breakfast 6 am : disembarked at 9.30 am : picked for baggage fatigue &amp; had to load it into trucks. Suez is an artificial port made after the style of a semicircular breakwater. The natives were very funny with their yabbering &amp; seemed very dirty &amp; ill clothed. The children were there in hundreds &amp; all they seemed to do was beg: "Backchees cigari" even the children smoked &amp; a large number had sore eyes &amp; a lot only one eye. We were issued with twenty four hours dry rations before leaving. Left at 10.30 am. Men &amp; children chased the train begging : native police beat them with canes to keep them away. The town seemed to be built before the ark &amp; never finished : mud house : roof &amp; all : very dirty : every thing. The first couple of hours through barren sandy country : passed large camps of soldiers which we found out were men from the Dardanelles : eighty thousand or so of them : stopped at a few crossing loops one had a few huts &amp; the train was besieged with natives selling eatables : we are only told to buy things that we can peel so the oranges went well 12 for 1/- : then we passed for a couple of hours through the most fertile country imaginable : It was all irrigated by primitive means &amp; was one long field of green crops : no fences seen : passed a fairly big station Zag Zig also a lot of cemetaries which seem very quaint with their mud tombs painted queer colours</p>
