<p>I was picked out of 60th Bty &amp; transferred to 58th Bty. We find the Artillery hard work after having such an easy time in the details, but I guess we will get used to it sooner or later. The flys are bad here you see them leave a nigger &amp; pitch on your bread &amp; jam &amp; if you care to throw it away you will go hungry. I wish the heads would send us off to France as I am sick of sand &amp; want to see the lovely green again.</p>
<p>April 2/ On picquet for 24 hrs orders to be ready to leave for Ismalia.</p>
