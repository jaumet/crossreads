Thursday 18 July 1917 [1918]Sat in garden & enjoyed glorious green trees & bright sunshine.  Slept 10 a.m. 3.30 p.m. then town & fitted coat & skirt Chemla's, very good.  5 p.m. ices at Groppi's and back to 31st per garry.Have Lt. O'Leary in ward as pt.  He is a V.C. & has done wonderful things, now alas malaria & whisky have him in their grip & one feels sorry for so much fine stuff being wasted.Lt. Crosby Browne, T'ba, in ward.  Lt. Austin, 4th A.L.H. is another nice boy.Believe we really did some good in trying for more & better food for these boys of ours so perhaps my trip here has been of use after all.
