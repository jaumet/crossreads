<p>down in the car -  It was all so quick - and as the sun wasen't shining I'm afraid it will be a failure-  Colonel de-Crespigny was busy in the infections ward c his gown on- but on hearing the calls to stop- sent a bat man post haste for his belt &amp; hastened to be on the scene.<br/>We learnt later that L.K. inspected the men in the camp across the bay.  He gave them a personal message from the King.  How the King was very proud of them.  Then afterwards to the Officers told them that our boys were the bravest Soldiers in the World.</p>
<p>Sunday 14th.  Hip hip hurrah.  My luck was in c the snap.  Shot after all- and even though the party are on the point of starting you can tell who they are.  L.K. in the back seat on the R. side of the car-  Sitting beside him is General Munro &amp; General Birdwood in the front.  You will see Colonel de Crespigny &amp; Major Smith standing together after the final salute.  I will send you out one as soon as I can print them.  One and all are asking for one here &amp; I'm making a charge of -/6 to them- it will add to my hobby for the boys.  I am almost well again &amp; so thankful.  Yesterday was another mail day.  Such a number of nice letters coming now.  I think I get almost more than my share of letters &amp; papers.  Please don't bother to send any more note paper.  The Red X is liberal with it.</p>
