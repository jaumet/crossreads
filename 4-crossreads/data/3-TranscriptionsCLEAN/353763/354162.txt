  
 creek or behind a corner & a 3 pound shell plumped into her  -  An internal explosion - a Diesel valve going wrong finds most favor  -  If the Germans have got her it's a feather in their cap & the Destroyers will get beans over it  - 
 Now I must tell of other things  -  I mentioned heavy firing on Monday 14th about 6 am  -  Word had come that a German force was attacking Herbertshoe  -  Well  this  time there was no half hearted killing business - war isn't kid gloves  -  You must  stike  & kill & kill until every atom of resistance is over  -  Its quickest & best  -  Our  Tommies  were there  -  Down went the Encounter & shelled the bush properly - Lyddite shells - first exploded low on the hills - then gradually sweeping up  -  Everything went down before this hurricane of death - shrubs - trees - men  -  The effect was A1  -  By noon all was over  -  The white flag up  -  The Governor surrendered & I yarned to a man this morning who had commandeered & was wearing a pair of  his  the Governor's white boots  -  Brigadier Holmes was in charge of the Military operations  -  Not a single fatality  -
