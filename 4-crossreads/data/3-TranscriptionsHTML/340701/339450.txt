<p>Sunday  20-1-17<br/>Attended Mass today in the Village church (Meaulte).  Was also let in for Benediction.  Only about 6 Civilians in the church altogether &amp; they were [sentence not finished]<br/>Thursday  24-1-17<br/>3 days of clear Sunshine but cold as cold.  Several Cylinders burst in Engine room.  Baths put out of service by burst pump.  All due to intense cold.  Duck Boards like a skating rink.  Road dusty &amp; hard as steel.  A Taube came over at Midnight &amp; dropped a few Bombs.  The Search lights were trying to pick him up without much success.  It is so cold that when we are working, the nails freeze to our fingers.  Had a Slide today after getting paid.</p>
<p>Sunday  27-1-17<br/>Smashed another Finger yesterday.  Blizzard today.</p>
