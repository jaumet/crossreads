<p>7<br/>Near-by, about a mile away, are camped the 5th Field Ambulance. This is a NSW unit, and I have many old pals in it. They run a free buffet for men returning from the line, in which you can obtain hot cocoa, coffee, biscuits and corned-beef sandwiches. This is a great idea. The two Rice boys are here, &amp; I sometimes visit them. It always means a supplement to our poor rations, for they sympathise with the infantry, and are very good to us. Last night I got a tin of cocoa-chocolate, sufficient to make several drinks for the 3 of us, and a pound tin of butter, Tres bon. Marshal Rice also got me a complete set of underclothes which were a godsend, as we are in an unspeakable state of "chattiness". No bon. You see some awful sights here. The ambulances come all day</p>
