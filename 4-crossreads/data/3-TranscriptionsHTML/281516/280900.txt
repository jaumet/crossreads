<p><u>"The Boys"</u></p>
<p>It happened at Mouscau. It was a dark night and they had decided to sleep out. One had blankets and the other only had his greatcoat, so they determined to sleep together. This was the dialogue heard from an officers tent nearby :-</p>
<p>(1) "You take up a f----- lot of room:"<br/>Silence for 5 minutes but sounds of restlessness<br/>(1) "Shift you're a-----!"<br/>(2) "I won't shift my a-----"<br/>(1) "Shift your b----- a-----"<br/>(2) "I won't shift my b----- a-----"<br/>(1) "Shift yer f----- a----- I tell yer!"<br/>(2) "I won't shift my f----- a-----"</p>
<p>Crash! Plonk! Biff! The sounds of heavy blows kept up for five minutes as they fought it out with fists.</p>
<p>A pause &amp; they went back to bed.</p>
<p>Then in a most conciliatory insinuating voice came</p>
<p>(1) "Aw, Frank, shift your f----- a----- old boy. Don't be a cow."</p>
<p>1. "I'm tired of this ------ war ".<br/>2. Well: it's the longest job you have ever had, anyway".</p>
<p>Dr Craig suggests for concealment of patrols either carrying out a hole ready dug and getting into it or going out disguised as a sardine.</p>
<p>Rout had been fairly tanked all day and put under open arrest for AWL from parade. Pay was made late in the afternoon and by that time he was well oiled. He walked in straight and stood up to attention but had great difficulty in signing the acquittance roll. Having at length completed the operation he stood regarding the poor attempt and then pointing to his shaky signature cast a quizzing look at me and said with a gruis &amp; giggle &ndash; "Gh. Sir (hic) 'cs a hard case, this bloke"!</p>
<p>Heard on fatigue work at Boisgrenier &ndash; 11.30 pm at night after a hard day</p>
<p>1. "Eh, did yer hear about our doctor?<br/>2. "What did he do?<br/>1. "Old Joe &amp; Frank paraded sick to get out of fatigue and he marked Frank "D &amp; Y" (dirty &amp; treatment) but he marked Joe "P &amp; S"<br/>2. "What's P &amp; S mean?<br/>1.   "Aw &ndash; pick &amp; shovel of course".</p>
