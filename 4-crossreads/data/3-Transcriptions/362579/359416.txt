<p>a   <u>Tomato</u>. My it is cold   &amp;  wet today, am afraid we are in for winter now. I shall get out my Combs, glad I've got a good supply. Also woollen pyjamas. My cream cashmere nighties are not warm enough for winter here.</p>
<p>When we go on Leave shall make enquiries about Transport to Australia.</p>
<p>So glad you have bought some Equity Shares for me, that is   <u>just</u>  what I wished for.</p>
