  
 The raider continued her voyage south of Australia, passed through the Antipodes Group on May 5th, passed up the East Coast of New Zealand (the pilot says that he flew over Dunedin during a flight in this neighbourhood), tried to intercept (unsuccessfully) a vessel on the Wellington-Cape Horn track; sighting nothing she continued to Sunday Isld in the Kermadecs for an overhaul. 
 Arrived there 27th May. 
 The day before the "Wairuna" appeared the fires were down, the boilers being cleaned & not an ounce of steam was available! 
 Rough weather arose a couple of days after the stripping of the "Wairuna" commenced, the vessels were unable to hold the anchorage & put to sea.
