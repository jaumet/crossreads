<p>fine little chap, a hard worker that never grumbles.  We had tinned bully-beef made into beef-pie to-day &amp; it was bonza.  It is the first time I have eaten meat for 3 weeks.  We ran out of cabbage over a week ago so we only get haricot beans &amp; dried peas now.  The beans are all right but the peas are very hard &amp; it is awkward when they roll off your knife.  I use my air-pillow now as I am sleeping on deck &amp; it is very fine.  We are fixing up the ship now so that she will be ready as far as the wards &amp; pantry, etc., to take in wounded at once.  We have been very lucky in the choice of our sleeping quarters.  Our Portholes have never been closed.  Only to-day a wave came in through the Portholes on the other side &amp; dozens of beds &amp; fellows clothes etc. &amp; sopping wet.  Every other port-</p>
