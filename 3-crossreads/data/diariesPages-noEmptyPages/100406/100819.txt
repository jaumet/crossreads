Beautiful scenery all the way, the road running along the edge of the valley of the Avon River. For quite a while after leaving Sutton-Veney we could see the "White Horse of Westbury". I would like to know the meaning of that monument figure. After our arrival I visited the Roman Bath from which the Town derives its name, went from there through the Victoria Park and the tiny Botanical Gardens. I always thought that Bath Chairs were obsolete but I seen plenty of them plying in the Streets in the Park. There was a Concert after tea in the Sydney Gardens, an Orchestral Band some singing. I enjoyed it very much, out in the open air on a lovely Evening, in the Pretty Garden. Much better than being in a stuffy Theatre.
We left the town about midnight arrived home after a slow trip at nearly 2 A.M. As usual some of the Troops were full. These reckoned that Bath was a very fast Town indeed. They were emptied out of 5 pubs. As one (13 L.H.) remarked "We were fired out of the last Pub at 7.55. We went to the Theatre, entred at 8.5 and were thrown out at 8 o'clock (less than no time), at 8.15 we were in Gaol. Yes lads Bath is fast enough for me, and then some."
