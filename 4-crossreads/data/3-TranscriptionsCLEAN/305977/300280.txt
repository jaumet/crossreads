We got another lot of reinforcements 4 of the old men returned & we got 14 new ones mostly the 8th reinforcements.  Our troop got none as we are fairly strong.  Jack Garden, Charlie May Segt Beuzeville, Segt Smith & Sanders went away sick during the week.  The Segt Major was appointed RQMS temporary & Segt Alford is SSM temporary.  I kept on orderly sergt for the week  Among the reinforcements was Bert Ekin of Kogarah who was put in C Squadron.  We had a fairly quiet week.  On Wednesday noon the Turks shelled us solidly for a while but we kept up a good supply of bombs to Abdul & must have made it fairly warm for him.  We received our mail on Thursday & I got letters from mother &
