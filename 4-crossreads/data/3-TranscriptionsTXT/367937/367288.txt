 send a service card along as soon as I get my letters. A few days ago our section got leave and we rode out to the battle field to have a look round; it was not very amusing but I got some copper bands of some shells which had not exploded &ndash; They are rather nicely marked from the rifeling in the gun and if polished ought to make jolly nice serviette rings &ndash; a lot of chaps sent them home form the Peninsula they tell me &ndash; so I will send them home first chance Also I have a piastre broach which I bought in Alex &amp; did not have a chance to send home before &ndash; it was in my pocket all through the scraps here so I'll send it along with the bands &ndash; It has rather a cheap jewelry look about it so give it away if you don't like it. Next Day I went over to try and see Colin last night but he was away on some duty &ndash; so I enquired about Leycesters wound and found that it was slighter than they thought and he expects to be sent to his Regt any day. We have started Rifle drill again to keep us exercised - I suppose we want it but it is funny to be back on it again. "Not a move" is the order of the day and it is the joke of the camp.
