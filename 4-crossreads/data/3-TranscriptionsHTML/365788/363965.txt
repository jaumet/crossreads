<p>Belgium,<br/>9 July 16<br/>My dearest old Irene,<br/>Was delighted to get a letter from you a few days <strike>few</strike> back. &ndash; Poor old girl! I am sorry to hear you are to have another op. &amp; do hope that long ere you get this letter you will be well on the way to being quite recovered. We expect to move on again at any time probably to-night or tomorrow &ndash; Had the first game of <strike>Cr</strike> Football I have had for 10 years yesterday - &amp; my word! aren't I just tired &amp; stiff.<br/>It was an inter-section game &amp; the chaps were very keen on my having a game as there is a good deal of rivalry. - Never.more ! I am too old &ndash; but we won 27 points to 3. Am glad to hear that Will has charge as O.C. of the Details Camp at George's Heights Mosman. &ndash; Have they given him a star to add to his Crown? &ndash; No chance of leave to England now &ndash; Dear little "Tinysie"! I would love to see her at the Dancing Class. &ndash; am sure they all love her.</p>
