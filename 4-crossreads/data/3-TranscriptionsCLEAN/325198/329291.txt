  
 26 April, 1916 Romania [Romani] We had the usual stand to at 4.30 this morning, but I was up a 2.0 on picquet & feel a bit dozy on it.  We have watered the horses & are having a bit of a blow, there is only tibbin for our neddies & not too much but some one is going away for grain.  We had a laugh at too chaps coming in off out post this morning, they had two bints with them - All niggers are detained at the camp - After being on fatigue cleaning up the tents that the Tommies vacated I had some dinner then Joe Wood & I went down & had a wash at the wells by throwing buckets of water over one another - The water is not nice to drink but better than nothing.  Jack [Francis] Cheater our Q.M.S. has been out foraging & came in with a load of tinned stuff - evidently these Tommy Officers lived high.  Some of the boys found a god lot of whisky, not I however.
