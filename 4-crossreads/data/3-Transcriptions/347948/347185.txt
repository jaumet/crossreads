<p>And bravely though our boys did toil to nobly win the day<br/>The odds were with the dreadnoughts of the foe<br/>They little knew that retribution hurried on the way<br/>Till part of Britain's first line let them know</p>
<p>They came and joined our cruisers and commenced to pour in shells<br/>And at once the Germans doubled back for Keil<br/>They could hold their own with cruisers &amp; the children of the fleet<br/>But the fury of our first line made them reel</p>
<p>They blew the Huns to pieces as they fled towards their home<br/>And 18 ships were sunk beneath the wave<br/>They won't come out again to try conclusions on the sea<br/>The perils of our battleships to brave</p>
<p>So once again old England's proved "Brittania rules the waves"<br/>And let the Germans try as best they can<br/>They'll find Brittania's might is opposed to German spite<br/>And as able to defeat her on the land</p>
