<p>Monday 13 January 1919<br/>Squadron drill &amp; building Cookhouses &ndash; out of mud.  100 more Horses shot today, no one wants them when they are old &amp; their eyes have grown hollow.  Wood is very scarce &amp; we are now issued with a cotton oil seed cap &amp; fine coal neither very serviceable.  At Neby Musa near Jordan there is a shale depos. that burns very well when once lighted but the powers that be do not appear to realize it.</p>
