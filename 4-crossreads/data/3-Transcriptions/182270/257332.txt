<p>MONDAY, JANUARY 20, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine. Went down to Horseferry</p>
<p>Road in morning but got no</p>
<p>satisfaction, then out to the bank</p>
<p>&amp; got a lot of home mail. About</p>
<p>the flat all the afternoon. Went</p>
<p>to the &quot;Man from Toronto&quot; at</p>
<p>night, &amp; it was good but had</p>
<p>no music in it</p>
