<p>Let us hope that some day after all our losses some real advance will be made by our side in a war theatre. It is disheartening to be stuck up everywhere. Almost makes one swear to think of it. We can but hope.<br/>For some days I have been wondering if you were informed about the torpedoeing of the ship somewhere south of Salonika with a lot of New Zealand nurses on board. Rumour has been busy for ten days and, confirmation appears to be with us. Hard to believe anything, even when one sees it.<br/>Mrs Parsons is good to take you out so often. Please thank her from me.<br/>I posted the letter to Dr Fisher thanking him &amp; Mrs F. for being so kind to my Kitty.</p>
<p>Sorry to learn about Charley Regan. Must write to Mrs R. soon. R.I.P.<br/>Told you about Mrs Bacon in my last. Have not see her since Sunday. Mrs Sawkins has had a bad time with her savage. Wonder how she stands it?<br/>I knew Donald MacLaurin. often met him with his father in the gardens.<br/>You too forgot to end your letter.</p>
<p>A mail is expected Daily from Australia, &amp; letters from you will be of late dates.</p>
<p>This afternoon with two other doctors I went for a trip round old Cairo. We visited the Nilometer where for many centuries on the upper end of Roda Island [Rhoda Island] the height of the flood waters was guaged. Close by is the spot on the bank of the Nile where 'tis believed that Pharoes daughter found Moses.</p>
