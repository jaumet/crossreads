<p>at the Ballot Box, in consequence of their Patriotism.<br/>No vote was ever taken whether we should enter into the War, &ndash; was it necessary to keep the same war going? Never mind, I hope to have the satisfaction some day of asking individuals to shew me what part of the map they inhabited between August 4th 1914 &amp;  [dash]. &amp; why?<br/>I have had a new job the last few times our Division has been in the line &amp; it is my most responsible one to date. Also the most trying one on my constitution. At present I feel a wee bit run down owing to last time being too enthusiastic in the manual part of the job.  Hope to tell you more later.</p>
<p>This is a country of mud in the Winter. You can never imagine it. Twice I have been bogged &amp; had to leave my thigh rubber boots behind so as to get pulled out. There are shell holes everywhere &amp; in more places that not, they overlap each other.</p>
<p>My orderly, was killed by a shell the 1st day we came into the line, this time. Hard Luck poor chap.</p>
<p>Oh, it is cold, these times. Never mind, I hope to be with you all (D.V) by next Winter.</p>
<p>I must be careful not to let such a gap occur in my correspondence again.<br/>Will now conclude with Best Wishes to You All<br/>Yours Faithfully<br/>Clem Walsh</p>
