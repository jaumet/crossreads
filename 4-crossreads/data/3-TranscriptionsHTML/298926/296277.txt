<p>7 miles of troops and artillery, it being a divisional stunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <br/>Some of the band enthusiasts in A Co have shamed the officers and bought us 10 tins <br/>of polish for our instruments so we have made them look a bit decent again.</p>
<p>14th  Went for 6 mile march in the afternoon.  We are to have a march every afternoon <br/>now until we go.</p>
<p>15th I have sent mine &amp; Wal's clothes to uncle so we can get them any time we <br/>should come over on furlough from France</p>
