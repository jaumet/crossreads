At Stanthorpe the Chairman of the Council made a speech which I did not hear, thanks to a pretty girl with a tray of peaches, (more in my line) & also at Warwick Toowmba (dinner) & Helidon we got refreshments. At Ipsch Tom, Edie & the family, Joe Sheppard Chas. L. TG & Mrs Springall & a few others including Lil Handley met us. Tom said family would wait engine end of platform
Arrived at Central OK. & struggling with kitbags etc Molly was the first spotted. She told me where the family were & I told her Dave was coming somewhere behind me, & she left to look for him. Crowds of relatives very dense & almost impossible to work through. Eventually I found Mater, Dad, Aunt J. Billy & Molly Gunn inside Sturgy & Allan outside & after a few mins, we got in cars, passed down Edward Queen & went up Albert St to Market Square, where Goold Adams (Gover) Theodore & a few parliament & municipal authorities made speeches of welcome. We all wished they would cut it out. However we all met together & went out to Aunt Jacks & altho I was not in the slightest hungry could not resist the fine dinner & did it full justice. Tom landed down about ten min’s after our train. Next day we got fixed up at the Barracks, & about 2pm left for home, calling at Tom’s place en-route with cars Buick & [Indecipherable]. Ad. Fletcher accompanying us.
