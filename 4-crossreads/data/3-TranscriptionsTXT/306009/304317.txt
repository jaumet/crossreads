 1915 May. 11 Tue. In afternoon hired a donkey for 2 hours for  6  3 piastres &amp; went for a 10 mile ride round edge of delta, under palms, past natives at work on the soil, through green fields &amp; back to Mena around the desert. On my homeward way I urged my donk. to the top of a great sandhill from  the top of  which I had a splendid view of the delta area. After a lengthy gaze I descended to the flats, passed through the deserted camp which once contained over 20,000 men &amp; found myself back at my destination &ndash; where I handed back my donk. to its dusky owner &amp; strolled off to Mena House.
