<p>[Letter written on paper with Church of England Soldiers' Institute letterhead]<br/>2nd October 1916</p>
<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>Owing to lack of evidence to prove necessity of my going to Sydney, they turned me down quite flatly. I then applied for weekend leave from Friday night to 1 pm to-day but was again out-manoeuvered &ndash; they granted me leave from 6 am Sat to 9 today! - &amp; withheld the pass on Friday night until the Sydney train had gone!</p>
<p>I have now applied for leave without pay to go to Sydney &amp; stated, as a reason for wanting to go home, that you are ill &ndash; a semi invalid - &amp; all the rest of it. It's the only chance &amp; I very much want to get over to see you before I go.</p>
<p>It would look much more circumstantial,  in the eyes of our heads here, if I had an <u>urgent</u> wire to back me up. Ask father to send it , will you?</p>
<p>When I have more time I have quite a lot to tell you about the floods. We've been, literally, up to our eyes in flood &ndash; very enjoyable!</p>
<p>With much love  Harry</p>
<p>Writing to Betty next. If you wire, do so as soon as you get this.</p>
