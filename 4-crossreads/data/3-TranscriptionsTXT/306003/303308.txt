 1.4.16 Sat 1st Reid went away to the School of instruction at Zietouen this afternoon Forgot to take my watch out of my pocket yesterday when changing my clothes after the ducking in the Canal &amp; am afraid it is no good now as the water has gone through it; 
 The natives are on the phones again &amp; Abdul Moolah is back again to attend to any business for the Omdah of Hassan Pasha &amp; I am glad he is back again as he does all my washing (or his wife does) &amp; does it better than any I have seen  he also does any odd jobs &amp; expects no Baksheesh.  he is the only native I have met who does not ask for any yesterday I gave him 5 PT the only payment he has had from me yet; The troops do 2 hours musketry every morning
