I received a splendid Hot Dinner in the Sergeants Mess, I then laid down read for a while then turned in at 8 Pm slept like a top all night.
Friday 8th. I signed on again at 8.30 for another run to Bethune in glorius weather after an uneventful run arrived there on time at 10.44 am with two other chums we went for a walk up the Town until Lunch time, passing through one street another, eventually arrived back to the Y.M.C.A. Hut for Lunch after a cup of tea we made for the Station awaited the departure of the return train. I took up my usual position on the Eng at 1.37 Pm off we went, at nearly every station enroute a large number of Parcels were put in for French Prisoners of War in Germany at some stations there were 2 3 Barrowfull's, at one station Berguette a number of German Prisoners detrained for St Omer, they had entrained at two stations further back. They all looked well appeared Happy to be out of the struggle, we arrived at Hazebruick a few minutes late after a while we arrived back at the Depot, after I had Dinner I played Crib until bed time then turned in. Saturday's run was uneventful going coming with the exception of having to shunt the Passenger
