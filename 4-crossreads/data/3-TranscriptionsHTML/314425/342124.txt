<p>Thursday July 25. 1918. 1451<br/>A fine day with some showers in the afternoon.  It  is two years today since we landed at Plymouth England.<br/>There was a bathing parade today to the baths at Daours in an old mill worked by a waterwheel. The water was hot. We got a heavy shower coming back.<br/>Since we came to this camp there has been a great plague of horse flies though they have been in evidence all of the summer but not very bad until lately. Up North we were free from all flys.<br/>This morning the enemy put up a barrage, the smoke of which we could see on a line from the right of Corbie to beyond Merricourt where it was lost in the distance.<br/>The smoke of it was like a forest on fire and it lasted for a couple of hours. We heard this evening that he attempted to come over.<br/>I received six francs this evening for the match box covers &amp; C. P. Wilson &amp; J. Boon to pay. I have nearly finished making a cigarette holder &amp;amp: ashtray for C. Hinery out of a 6 pounder tank shell.</p>
