<p>been doing nothing but march for the last 12 months. The Artillery turned out mounted and looked very well.</p>
<p>I have been up this afternoon to see the 2nd Division Artillery which came into camp last week. Saw Maurice Lenehan there. He looks well. Is coming down to have dinner with us tomorrow night.</p>
<p>I think the scheme you mentioned of having soldiers' letters deposited in the Mitchell an excellent idea. They will no doubt prove very useful in years to come when history is being re-written.<br/>Well Father I am afraid this letter is awfully dull and uninteresting, but there is very little here to give one inspirations. Am trying to write Mum &amp; Pat also by this mail &ndash;</p>
<p>Hope you are keeping well &amp; with love I am, Your affectionate son, Terence.</p>
