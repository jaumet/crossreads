2 - E deMover the ferry as far as the G.P.O. Sydney. Left Sydney Wednesday at noon on Aug 8th & strange & fortunate to say we struck the same boat viz A68 "Anchises"There was a good crowd at the wharf to see the boat off we pulled out from the wharf about 9 am. & went into the saloon till noon - we had a good voyage to the Marquees Islands which we sighted 5 pm on the 21st. Saw no sign of civilization although I believe there is a population of 5000 inhabitants mostly French whose export mostly is guano. The coast we saw was very high rocky and dangerous. These islands are about half way to the Panama. Having had winds and fairly high seas doing about 13 miles an hour. We have averaged 310 miles per day the last 24 hours run has been the worst so far since leaving Sydney. What has struck me very forcibly is the almost absolute lack of bird life but to make up for this there are plenty of flying fish.Had sports on board which started on 18th & finished up about the 25th. So far all on board enjoying best of health & looking forward
