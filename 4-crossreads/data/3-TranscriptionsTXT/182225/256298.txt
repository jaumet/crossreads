 1916&nbsp;&nbsp; WEDNESDAY 28&nbsp;&nbsp; JUNE 
 Another rainy day. It cleared up a bit in evening. We saw the most gorgeous sunset I ever saw. I have see grander ones but never one with so many colours before. We had the King&#39;s regulations relating to punishments on active service read to us by Capt Campbel in the morning and no parade in afternoon. The whole convoy running up together in evening &amp; they say we get to Dakka in morning &amp; we may be staying till Sunday.
