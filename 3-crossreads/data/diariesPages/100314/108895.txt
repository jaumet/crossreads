2/3/18 Amiens
we then had the deuce of a job to find a room. All the hotels were full and we had to chase all round the streets from one place to another. Eventually a woman at a caf directed us to a place in a back street and we then left our luggage. She is to have the Rooms ready for us at 9.30 pm. Found other officers searching for rooms. Made for the Officers Club where we had a medium dinner. Did this writing in a cold room upstairs after dinner. All the old streets are very dark and full of civilians and soldiers. There are crowds of little girls but as the Madam of our Rooms say:- Beaucoup des M?Selles in Amiens sont malads!
