A Barge comes in from the Canal & is put into one Basin & the Doors are shut & up the Basin & Barge goes until it reaches the top where the gates are open & the barge enters one of the Bridge portions & proceeds along a canal passing through a Lock Gate & then continues on, when another Barge arrives it is put into the other basin & up it goes & the first one comes down & so on.   These basins are for Large Barges & the Lower Locks are for the small ones which pass under the Railway Line & up against the first lock, when the water then is released by the Gates opening & when the water is level with the canal the Gates behind the Barge is closed & the water coming over the other locks fills up the space & the barge rises to the hight of the next Lock when the Gates are opened & in goes the barge into No 2 Lock.   This is done repeatedly until eventually the Barge reaches to the Hight of the Higher Canal & then continues on its journey, passing through about 6 locks.   After satisfying our curiousty, & the stop signal was pulled off I went into the station yard at Arques & was kept there until 10.30 am when a French Shunter came on the engine & off we went to Wardresque, returning on the other line to about half way when I was put into the Observation Balloon Repair Siding & there met a R.E. Corporal who took charge of the engine, & after shunting some trucks out, I went along the the 277th Coy who were building a line, with a Track
