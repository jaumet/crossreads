I think he got lost, & at last several dropped out & lay down to sleep by the roadside. The pack was an awful load & it wasn't till 5 am. that we hit a village called Coineux, all tired & footsore. The 4th brigade was resting in this village,  & we immediately joined our battalions. Wedn. 17 April We were given a drink of tea on arriving, & I joined the 13th Battalion don't like it as Id rather be with the old 3rd, & I suppose I'll have to take down the good old chocolate & green colours now. The brigade is just out for a short spell from the line, so we are right in it now, & shall soon be in the thick of it. The trenches are 4 or 5 miles from here, & I saw one of our 'planes up & shrapnel bursts around it. I went to the battalion post office & found some letters waiting for me from Bon, Miss Tofft & Elsie; there were shoals for Boo, including 2 from Will but strange to say none for either of us from home. Could hardly keep my eyes open today after our night march, & had a snooze after dinner. I am attached to D Coy. 13th Bn. & took off the chocolate & green colors
