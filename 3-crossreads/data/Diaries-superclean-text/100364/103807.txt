Wilkins came over from France. He was awarded the M.C. I received nothing. I feel very much receiving no recognition as I took equal share and risks. I worked day and night to secure the results, and have made the entire exhibition. There has been string pulling . Wilkins certainly deserved the M.C. but there should have been no distinction. I have prepared everything in the Exhibition and have no acknowledgement, financial or otherwise.
