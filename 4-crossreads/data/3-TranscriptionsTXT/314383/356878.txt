 May 27 16 miles.  Food a bit short at village had two meals of chippatti &amp; dripping today.  Bread has long ceased to be our portion &amp; in lieu thereof we go in for the native bread called chippatti which is made of rough flour &amp; water shaped like a pancake only baked.  Our other food is mutton eggs &amp; honey and dried fruits.
