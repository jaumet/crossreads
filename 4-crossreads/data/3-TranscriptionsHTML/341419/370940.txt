<p>in our lines, rubbish everywhere &amp; literally lousy with fleas.  Yesterday I picked dozens off myself &amp; did not go to sleep until about 3 a.m. this morning.  It is absolutely the worst place I have ever been in for fleas.</p>
<p>The sickness is tremendous here, 300 have gone away sick from the 3rd Regt. alone &amp; only a slightly less percentage from the other two Regts. &amp; this in the last week alone.  All malaria.  There is some talk of us garrisoning this place which God forbid.  But anyway I think our chance of seeing Damascus yet awhile is very remote.</p>
<p>We took Beirut unopposed on the 8th so they are still going ahead in front.</p>
