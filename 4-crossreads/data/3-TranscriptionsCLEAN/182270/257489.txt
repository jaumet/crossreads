 THURSDAY, JUNE 26, 1919. 
 Fine. Down round the bottom end 
 all day. Got a ram out of my ewes 
 & put him in 4D. Put ewes 
 into Mountain, except a 
 couple with young lambs. They 
 are lambing very nicely. Took 
 the ferrets up to woolshed in 
 evening & got a few bunnies. 
 Jo & Peter took Jessie into the 
 9.30 train at night. The little 
 car seized up at Midway 
 coming home & they had to 
 walk. Met them in front of 
 Abbotslea.
