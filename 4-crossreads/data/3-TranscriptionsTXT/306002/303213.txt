30.6.15one was taken prisoner last night, another was found badly wounded during the night amongst the bushes, but he died shortly after they got him to the dressing station.  At 9 o'clock we were relieved by the 3rd L.H. & came back opposite the Supply Depot.  I came down early & secured a good dug-out.  One of our aeroplanes was flying over us again this morning.  I believe in front of the New Zealand trenches 250 dead Turks can been seen.  It is said that Enver Pasha was leading the Turks & intended to wipe us off the face of the earth, but we are still here & Allah has failed them once more.  When they charge they shout out Allah, Allah, Allah & so on, & the one that surrendered last night threw his rifle away as soon as he saw our men & said putting his hands up, "Allah finish, Allah finish".
