<p>Juillet 13<br/>No 2 Duty Section today. Consequently we had an easy day. Other Sections working on the Canal. The [indecipherable] Cpl Bywater &amp; I went fishing in the afternoon catching about &frac12; dozen fish each &ndash; very small tho'.<br/>Nothing of importance to note.</p>
<p>Juillet 14<br/>No 2 Sec commenced work at 4.30 am pile driving on the Somme Canal &ndash; today - &amp; worked until 12.30. Today should be a gala day in France but owing to the war everything is very quiet. A few flags may be seen flying from some of the houses but that is about all.</p>
