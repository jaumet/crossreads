 21/7/18 Edinburgh Sunday and until late in the afternoon it teemed. Remained indoors until after 4 when I walked down to the Caledonian Station with the Colonel and saw him off in the train to meet his boy Jimmy who is returning from Rugby. After dinner again went out and walked all along Princes St and round Waverly. The castle frowning down from its precipitous height and the high peaks of Arthur's Seat &amp;c are very fine. Looking down Hanover Street are views right over the Firth of Forth to the hills of Fifeshire &ndash; a pleasant prospect. There are private gardens fronting Abercromby Place and looking from there we get a tinge of green to relieve the drab of the surroundings. Talked with Mrs Craig &amp; Sheila all the rest of the evening and had a quiet &amp; enjoyable evening.
