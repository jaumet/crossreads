 Todays Patrol was along miles of Cotton crop just irrigated & Beans (Broad beans) quite 2 miles of them- used as cattle feed later on. We fill our Nosebags after the horses have had their feed Tried to get a c/- of Johnnie Walker from Cairo, but with so many soldiers about failed again- Stolen-  When the war is over some Hero's !!! will find it hard to be honest again. Bridge of Pontoons nearly finished across the Canal here so we need no longer share the Punt with Camels Donks, Water Buffaloe & Sore eyed kids.
