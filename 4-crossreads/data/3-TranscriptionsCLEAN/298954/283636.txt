  
 Mon. 15th Apl (cont.) The old colonel wound up the evening with a speech of thanks to our hosts (quite a touching thing of the "far-from-home" species, that speech) and forecasted undying friendship with our entertainers of the evening.   Poor old bird;  it turned out that prophecy was not his metier.   He was mad on "reform". 
 Tue. 16th. The camp actually improves on closer acquaintance - but it seems that food is not so plentiful as it appeared yesterday. 
 The two "spreads" were the result of a special effort made by the fellows from their parcels from England in order to give us a good welcome, bless 'em. 
 We have now to economise rigidly till our own parcels begin to arrive, although the chaps here are doing all they can for us. 
 It is impossible to obtain food from the village other than a few spuds & salads.
