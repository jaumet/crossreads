  
 March 10, 11 exhibition of fast perfect flying, sudden dives, climbs and feints, hell for leather they swooped over our station not higher than 150 feet, swept higher, across and around, machine guns barking and all exhausts open, and they drove him to earth, one swept mightily around him and then straight down over him, and the four slackened, climbed and drifted lazely in the even blue. 
 Today the first day of our leave:  passes came through O.R. at 1.30 yesterday afternoon. 
 210. In the compartment with us is one other Australian, an impish Aust. Cockney.  He's given the "Gheitz" an half a dozen war subjects, and against the [indecipherable] questioning last night English.  Boche raid being helped by the Aurora Borealis, he's of the opinion that "anyhow their spy system isn't as good as that!"  He is the first Australian I've heard refer to Haig as "Doug Haig". 
 Paris March 11 211. Midnight, and a raid on.  The programme of the "Folies Bergere" cut short and the house emptied:  by exit doors amateur auctioneers recited long lists of the places of refuge:  the streets black, filled with a hard darkness, by a series of miracles we found our Rue de Arcadie and our Hotel Belmont. 
 Last night we arrived at 8.30 - and in motors to reporting H.Qtrs. - a lecture, and a presentation of a mystery:  tube, supper at the Y.M. and to the Hotel Bretaigne, where we'd intended staying at the Hotel Grand Bretaigne:  2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, Bombs!  Left there early this morning, a day full of grey deep mists, even the opposite side of the roads' buildings were only looming shadows:  the sun over all, a clean cut deep orange ball, devoid of fire.  The Hotel Grand Bretaigne full, so to Hotel Bedford - a two bed'd room of red, gold and mirrors:  comfortable though and beds luxuriously linen sheeted and sumptuously white. 
 The morning passed walking about, and I have found a shop selling books of fine reproductions.
