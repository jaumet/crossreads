 Friday 28 March 1919 At Sea Still hot, no sign of Derbyshire.  Gen. Cox talked about putting me under arrest for visiting my wife but I chanced it &amp; if he had no court martial would have found me guilty &ndash; as the A.I.F. especially into that Husbands &amp; wives should see &amp; look after the women.  Today a kit inspection was ordered but the men simply struck &amp; would not. Then tonight we cross the line &amp; the men ran free all over the boat &amp; although I had a cold Jerry Weir had to go thro' the bath &ndash; dragging  men  officers out of their cabins etc.
