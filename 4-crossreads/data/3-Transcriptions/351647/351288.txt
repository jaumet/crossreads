<p>a mad old letter isn't it.  I must collect myself.</p>
<p>Merci beaucoup pour votre trois lettres (yes there were three not two, 39, 40 &amp; 41).  You really are a brick.  I'm sorry if my letters don't arrive regularly &amp; up to time but believe muh I do write to you every chance I get &amp; with ma petite merc much <strike>much</strike> oftener than anyone else.  The mails are mad both ways I think.  Things are fair as I said it has been freezy again but today was a thaw, a real spring day &amp; the feel of spring is here.  I want to write music badly &amp; simply beautiful things that no one has ever thought of before have been hurtling through my nut &amp; I have had to go &amp; talk about pay books &amp; allotments to wives &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>Things are still good with us but its no good talking of them as by the time you get this <strike>lots</strike> it will all be stale &amp; lots more will have happened.  At present things our way look pretty good and promising.</p>
