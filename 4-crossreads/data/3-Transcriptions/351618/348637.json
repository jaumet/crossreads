<p>I make my bunk up close to the wall they make me form a bridge as they go to &amp; fro you can imagine the feeling as these creatures run across your blanket. It takes a lot to get to sleep once you have felt them about.</p>
<p>Today I am sorry to have to note a Naval gun 4 point 5 which is on a ridge behind our guns &amp; the trenches had a premature burst. The early explosion of the shell wounded four Light Horse men just rear of my store.</p>
<p>Tuesday 19th Oct<br/>It was overcast again to-day and very cool. We were Subjected to a lot of shelling early in the day.</p>
<p>Wednesday 20th Oct<br/>Quiet &ndash; except the usual daily shower of Bullets &amp; shells.</p>
<p>Apptd Temporary Corp to-day.</p>
