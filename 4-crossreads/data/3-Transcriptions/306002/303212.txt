<p>30.6.15<br/>Wed. 30th.  We had no sleep last night, but had quite an interesting time instead;  at 9 oclock the Turks opened up with heavy rifle &amp; machine gun fire, a good many Turks also left their trenches &amp; came down the gullies on both sides of Popes Hill.  The 2nd L.H. met them between Popes Hill &amp; Walkers Ridge &amp; the Turk soon made back again.  They were threatening to attack right up till daylight &amp; I believe the only thing that stopped them was that they were too frightened.  Monaghan B Sqd. was killed last night &amp; 5 others wounded from the 1st Regt.  Major Nash of the 2nd L.H. was shot dead last night;  their casualties were 2 killed &amp; 3 wounded.  As soon as daylight broke this morning we had snipers out shooting any Turks that still happened to be out of the trenches, we can see several dead Turks this morning, &amp; one</p>
