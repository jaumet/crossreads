  
 June 1916 After having a most interesting & enjoyable time we proceeded to Waterloo station & returned to camp arriving there about 1 AM. 20th   We left Salisbury Plains at 12.30 P.M. to day after an enjoyable although short stay & arrived at Christchurch, a few miles from the seaside resort of Bournemouth & about N.W. of the Isle of Wight.  This place is the Royal Engrs Training Depot & we are to stay here, together with the N.Z. Engrs. for some time There are only about 400 of us & about 100 N.Zealanders here, all other details having remained at Salisbury.  A tributory of the Avon flows through the town & we have excelent opportunities for our training.
