  SHELLAL again  
 Our Y.M.C.A. have followed us up consequently Tinned Fruits & "Sausages" can be bought, also good old ENO's fruit Salts. Jim Ayre is still fit & going strong. Usual bombardment going on. Made overtures to the Tommies & used a Kerosene Tin bath along with many of the great unwashed. I was rather ashamed of my own dirty singlet.  My [indecipherable] Major Rank dates from 14/2/17.  
 Hear Cuth Fetherston Hough is alright - but ere this you will have seen the Casualty list. I will always cable if I get a crack, so don't worry we can't all be blown out. 
  The little wife is well.
