<p>16 May 1918 Thursday<br/>Judean Hills.   High, wild, hills round about 1 sheep to 7 acres through the summer &amp; watered by springs in Wadi's, Bedouins only occupants at present- very thankful to be out of Jordan Valley at this time of year.<br/>Only excitement here is our own Anti-aircraft shells falling.<br/>Moved at 8 o'clock in evening for near Solomon's Pools again, <strike>supposed to be having a rest</strike>, marched all night &amp; at sunrise passed Bethlehem once more-  These all night marches in the tremendous dust add to the wrinkles- You'll find me looking  older when I reach home again.</p>
