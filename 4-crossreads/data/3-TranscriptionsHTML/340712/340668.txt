<p>parcels of cake and fruit that persistently fell into the sea, or into someone else's hands, or burst open in the throwing.<br/>At 12.30 we moved out. Our boat is a fine vessel and can do 20 miles an hour at best and averages about 15. Electrically lighted, with hot and cold sea baths and showers (not fresh water), excellent food for men as well as N.C.O'8. Officers travel as 1st saloon, etc. Sergeants as 2nd (in regard to food), but sleep in hammocks downstairs same as men, except that their hammocks are wider and they have a mattress and pillow. Men travel as steerage passengers. As we all, or those who secure places early, sleep on deck the closeness of below is largely obviated.<br/>I ate a good dinner on the Friday, the day of embarkation, and a good tea, but lost the latter. That was the commencement. I ate nothing the next day and felt as though I were possessed of a thousand devils. Possibly you may have experienced the sensation. I know I turned yellow and a trifle green round the lips**&#151;in spite of my endeavours to blush.<br/>I remember how when the first spasm took me&#151;I was b elow deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and on deck and Hie-&#151;"Gott strafe<br/>Deutchland"-&#151; Hie&#151;-"This is the life"-&#151;Hie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Australia<br/>will be there", pointing to the sea. And so on throughout the next day. I went to my hammock that night at 6.30 p.m. slept in my clothes&#151;&raquo;I daren't take them off&#151;the next<br/>night,ditto. Saturday saw me lying on deck all day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I<br/>was sick, on an average, I think, of ten minutes for the rest of the day. However I managed to sing "Australia will be there", and "Gott strafe Deutchland" between the Hies, and it helped to cheer me and the others who were in a bad way round me.</p>
