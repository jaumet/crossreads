It would almost seem as though Fritz had stayed calmly out of harm's way perched up in a cloud as it were and watched the gyrations of those planes of ours and then when the coast was clear he just hopped off his perch and came soaring over the camps "wihitherso ever he liked" I wonder what would happen if he were a dozen!<br/>I have used the term "Fritz" because these enemy airmen are either Austrian of German: no Turk ever ventured so far from mother earth. A Turk does not care how high he goes so long as he has one foot on the ground</p>
