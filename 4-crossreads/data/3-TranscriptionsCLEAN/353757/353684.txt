 Dear Friend Vol 
 Xmas Day!  Up to our eyes in Sand, crook tucker, plenty work.  We are right under the Pyramids.  They are very fine. 
 A party of us climbed the Cheops or Great Pyramid, right to the top 451 feet;  it is worse than a hard day's work & very dangerous. We also climbed the Second Great Pyramid which is "out of Bounds" on account of the extreme danger involved in climbing.   They  This one is smooth at the top, as sketch.  [See image for drawing in margin.]  The black part is of granite & very slippery.  It was granite all the way down once, but someone shook thousands of tons of this stone from the sides to build a great cathedral with. 
 You should see the Museum here!  Mummies & smells a treat.  Rameses, the cove that iltreated the Jews, looks harmless enough now.  The old stone carvings, gold work & ornaments are unique, modern art looks silly beside these works of the ancients.
