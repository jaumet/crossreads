The other side of Roisel the road commenced to go upwards, & at the top of the hill we found the village of Herbilly & the A.D.S. This was in the grounds of what had evidently been before the war, just the a Chateau & then a manufacturing works, for installed in a big shed we found several engines or their remains. It is possible the the gilt topped railings (mostly gone) & the remains of the ornamental gateway are true criteria, & the place was a chateau, for there is a heap of bricks in one corner of the grounds that might easily have been one. As this place has been the German back area for some months, it is possible that he built the sheds & installed the machinery for some purpose. The main shed has a sand-bag protection round it, which is at least 8 feet high.
