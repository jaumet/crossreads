  
 June 1917 & at about 10.30 AM General Hobbs, G.O.C. 5th Div. arrived, attended by his A.D.C. & Staff Col. Wagstaff.   He inspected us in a body, and afterwards, the 8th & 14th formed two bridges in double time, across the lagoon.   As soon as they were complete the 15th doubled across & formed two bridges across the main river, one of 5 bags [bdgs?] was completed in 6 min. 10 sec.   The whole transport moved across the bridges & formed up on the off side of the stream, where the General congratulated us on our bearing & work, with which he was very well pleased.
