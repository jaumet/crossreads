  
 26 February, 1916 Serapeum We had to fool about the horse lines again & had to shift the tents 1 foot one way & two feet the other way.  I tried very hard to get leave to go up to see Bert but after seeing Capt Anderson, the Adjutant, & Capt White about three times each, I was told that no leave was to be given. Our troop was on [indecipherable] picquet but they did not have a bad go.
