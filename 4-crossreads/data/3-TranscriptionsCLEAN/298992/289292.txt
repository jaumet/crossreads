 As you will see, we are several days ahead of the time-table set down for us on our departure from Sydney, but knowing how anxious you were that we shaould be back at the earliest date possible, I think I can safely say that no efforts on either the Officers' or Engineers' parts were spared to ensure this quick return. 
 Yours obediently, 
 Purser.
