  
 After a little trouble with the ariels which are of phosphor-bronze wire, a kink being fatal, they were hoisted & gently drawn taut by means of a windlass. Teddy then took the watch from 8am to 2pm & from 8pm till 2am. My watch was from 2pm to 8pm & from 2am to 8am. I amused myself the best way I could until lunch. At 1pm the wind began to freshen up and increased as the hours drew on. The soldiers who had been drinking a lot of champagne that they found in a Kiosk at the Show Ground, where they were encamped, began to get sick again. At two o'clock that afternoon I took my watch and eagerly wrote down every message I heard. At eight pm I was glad to get outside & get some fresh air. I turned in about 9pm in the saloon as my bunk, (which was the lower one) in the Marconi Room was being painted. 
 In the saloon I had to sleep athwart the ship and was first "on my head" & "then my heels." At eleven o'clock the sea was so rough that it was necessary to ease the engines down. 
 24th September. I was awakened at 2am by the Sucani (pron. seekunny) a coolie quartermaster.
