<p>troops going on leave to Blighty. It was a huge building consisting of four or five stories and served the purpose very well indeed. We were each issued with three blankets and three boards to sleep on.</p>
<p>We were all too-much excited to sleep well that night.</p>
<p>Nov 26th. Sun.<br/>Marched to the wharf and sailed from Boulogne at 9 a.m. arriving at Folkestone at 11 a.m. There the leave train was waiting on us and soon we were speeding our way to <strike>Euston</strike> Victoria, London. I was a bit unfortunate and had to stand in the corridor all the way. Drove in a taxi to Euston and arrived there about 4.30 p.m.</p>
<p>The train for Scotland was due to leave at 8.50 so I whiled the time away waiting on the platform. I got settled down after a good deal of difficulty and had to stand or lie in the corridor of the train nearly all the way from London to Scotland, not a very pleasant experience, but worth all the trouble to get home for a few hours.</p>
<p>Nov 27th. Mon<br/>Reaching home about 8.45 feeling a bit tired out.</p>
<p>The thing that struck me in Stirling when home on leave was the scarcity of young men and the predominence of women.</p>
<p>Went to the pictures in the evening with Jane.</p>
<p>Nov 28th. Tues.</p>
