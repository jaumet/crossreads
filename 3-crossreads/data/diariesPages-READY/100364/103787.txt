and the Dead Sea. The descent into the valley itself is extremely steep, but the View! It's marvellous! The Jordan valley, here must be 15 miles wide. Jericho lay immediately infront and through the Eastern End of the Valley there were occasional glimpses of the River and of its debouche into the Dead Sea.
We took the main road, which leads close in under the Western mountains on the return, and joined up with the new track. The run home took a little over 4  hours. This will probably be my last trip for many a long day in these parts, and I feel both sorry and reluctant to leave this land of wonders and beauty.
