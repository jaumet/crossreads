<p>1915<br/>Nov. 24 Wed.<br/>Went for a walk before breakfast this morning for a bit of exercise. Pretty chilly &amp; foggy at this time of the day.<br/>I get out very little now &ndash; am so much tied down on this new job. Usually sneak out for half an hour's stroll through Gezira Gardens about 4.30 p.m. when the "Old Man" is out.<br/>Mail from Aust. to-day. Received 4 letters. Thankful for small mercies - but where in the dickens are all the letters going to.</p>
