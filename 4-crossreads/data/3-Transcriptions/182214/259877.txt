<p>We marched to Armentieres and we took over from a Scotch Field Ambulance at another school. The Scotties are fine chaps and like the Aussies very much. They had been on the Somme and we were told some breathless stories how they had been through such stirring times. Fritz used to shell this place they told us but strange to say while they were there with us nothing in the nature of shelling took place. They had only been gone a day or so before Ftiz started to give us three doses a day after meals. He dropped one big one in the street in front of the school and another one behind the school. In each case the shell demolished a house and one family were in the cellar of one of the houses that was hit and not one of them got hit or hurt.</p>
