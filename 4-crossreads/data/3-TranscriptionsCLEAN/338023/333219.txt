 My Dearest Mother 
 I'm just scribbling this to catch the pilot boat before she returns to port. By the time you get it we will be well out on old ocean & I am led to believe that it will be some time before we touch a port from which we can write. All day yesterday we spent in embarkation - there was a dickens of a crowd, including many Sydney lads & the ships looked fine.  Our boat is first rate though small. Fitted up A1 & tucker of the best. Heaven only knows how we will employ ourselves - I expect that we'll be bribing the stokers to give us something to do before we reach the cold country. Am very fit & well, like the rest, & enjoy the change in tucker especially. We expected to be hung up in port for a few days, but it did not come off thank goodness. Must close now with love to all & heaps for yourself - don't worry, we're going to have a fine time on this old tub or I'm much mistaken.
