<p>FEB. &nbsp; FRIDAY 4 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot again. I was detailed off among others of 15/1 to get the horse lines ready as 60 horses were coming to camp. We got fixed up &amp; away by 3 pm. The 15/1 was on duty &amp; I got main guard &nbsp;I was on guard at the gun park again. It was hard luck the 15/1 striking duty as I could not get in to Linda for two nights. The horses arrived about 6.15 pm &nbsp;They are not a bad lot, but too light for artillary horses.</p>
