<p>Dear Beat &amp; Family<br/>Just a line hoping you are alright as it leaves me at present. We arrived at Colombo on the 9th of Feb and sailed again on the 10th. Well Beat they would not let us go off the boat on our own but they took us for a rout march through Colombo for about 5 Hours it is the funniest place I ever saw in my life you talk about blacks their are thousands of them the first we saw of them were some right out in the ocean fishing they were in Canoes cut out of the trunks of trees two and three in each boat. Their would not be enough room in one for Annies big leg to go in side. But when we landed their were hundreds in boats selling bannayers and Cocoanuts for near nothing and others swimming all round us we would get some to climb up the side of our boat and somebody would throw them 3d and they would dive from the top of boat and get it. They would deafen you singing out me die master you trow in siler and the soldiers would throw in something and they would dive like blackshags.</p>
<p>Their was one of them with one arm he would come up and dive from the top and fetch some of the bottom of the ocean up he would be under for about six minutes. When i come home Beat i will be able to sit and talk to you about the blacks for a month alone. When we were on our rout march there were hundreds running after us selling every thing the kids licked me they all have their ears cut and a cork shoved in the cut</p>
