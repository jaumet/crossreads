  
 Letterhead as before 4.  Next morning we had Manx Kippers for Breakfast & they were lovely.  Uncle has interests in a Motor fishing smack & whenever the boat is in He rides down on the Bike to Ballaugh or Sulby & gets as much as He wants.  We had Duck for Dinner & Fresh Herrings & Mackerel for Tea.  I like the Kippers & mackerel much better than the Herrings.  Auntie pickles these fish in Vinegar besides getting the fresh ones & they are lovely pickled.  In the afternoon Marie & I drove down to Ballaugh for a new Bike that Uncle had bought.  It is a beauty & when we brought it Home He went away for a ride on it like a Boy.  He is 70 but was once a champion Cyclist & even now rides like a young man.  No sleep after 4 am that night again.  Up at 8 am we had Breakfast & then I went for a stroll until the House work was done.  The Pig developed Measles this day & one of the Cats had 3 kittens in the Dresser drawer so things were very lively.  In the afternoon Marie & I rode Bikes into Ramsay, 5 miles distant.  We just arrived there & a Thunderstorm burst over us.  We had to sit under a shelter in the Park for an Hour until the storm passed over.  We had Tea & a walk round the Prom. & set out for Home at 7 p.m.  The road was muddy & heavy & a very strong wind ahead so we had to go pretty easy.
