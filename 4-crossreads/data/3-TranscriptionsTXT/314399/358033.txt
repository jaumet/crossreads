 Wednesday 5 February 1919 Snowed last night &amp; part of the morning. Very heavy too. 
 Thursday 6 February 1919 Very cold again. Everything frozen. Got a job of walking to Harfleur see all diggers saluted &amp; were properly dressed etc  None saluted as usual but sad to say I didn't correct them. Went straight into Havre.
