serve to keep my memory green in the hearts of those I love so dearly. I will not have time to write to the "missus this time but give her my love and tell her to "make my remembrances" to all at Kogarah. Also give my love and a kiss to all at "Tyrol" don't forget Queenie.
Love kisses to yourself my dear SisterFrom Leo
