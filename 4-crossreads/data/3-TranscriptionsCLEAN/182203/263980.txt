My dearest Moth. & Sisters,. Oh, we have ha a sad time this week. One of our pals died  on  early  Thursday  Friday morning. She came with us in the S.S. Kyarra. and was awfully good to me when I was ill. She was such a fine strong girl. Last Saturday-week she was brought down to be warded, had been on duty Friday, she felt quite well until about 5. p.m. that day. She had a little scratch on her R. hand    & must have got a germ in there. She was operated upon on Monday but was septic &  did not rally at all. I had to help nurse her but she had a special nurse. Poor girl was buried at 4 o'clock Friday-afternoon    & we all went to the funeral. It was a military funeral &  I shall never forget it. Oh, it was most sad. We are all, especially we 12 Victorians, very upset. That is why I sent a cable to let you know I'm very well. Poor old Charlie
