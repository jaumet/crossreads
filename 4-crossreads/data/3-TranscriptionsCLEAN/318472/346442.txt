Arrived Sierra Leone about 7.30 A.M. & left about 5 P.M. about 10 fairly large boats lying at anchor & an old Battle Ship. The place does not appear to be very large but it is rather picturesque & pretty. High ridgged hills rise almost from the water & houses can be seen away up on slopes. There is a fair sized English Garrison The growth of course appears to be semi tropical. Natives rowed the canoes across with bananas oranges - mangroves etc 
 1918 August 6 Tuesday Cloudy with occasionally heavy rain & wind All awnings taken down in anticipation of a gale tonight [indecipherable] rising and a fairly heavy sea running.
