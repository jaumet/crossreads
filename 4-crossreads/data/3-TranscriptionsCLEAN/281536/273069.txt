  
 13/6/19 Sutton-Veny match this fine afternoon and then had tea at Greenhills. After dinner took a walk with Thewlis along quiet shaded leafy English lanes. Nestling back in one we found an old church, graveyard and an ivy covered rectory. Further on rising from a pool was an enormous shady tree of I know not what species and several tiny thatched cottages with the traditional rosebushes growing up outside them. The girls about are in most cases pretty and seem to be learning how to dress. 
 14/6/19 Another loafing day. Went to a Boxing Match in the afternoon and saw some good fights. In the evening took a walk with Capt L.H. Smith of the 2nd Tunnelers and went all through the wood which adjoins here. At 10.15 it was still broad daylight.
