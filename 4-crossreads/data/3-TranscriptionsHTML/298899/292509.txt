<p>half an hour. Saw several damaged guns go back also some lorries &amp; caterpillars which had been knocked &amp; burnt. Altogether a wonderful day, one to demonstrate our ferver &amp; the wonder of our organisation. What the result of our<br/>hopover was we do not know yet for certain. The noise of the artillery was fearful.</p>
<p>Thursday 27th Sept 1917 A much quieter day although we had a fair number of wounded through during the morning the night being much the same. Guns very quiet during the day but opened up on a counter attack of Fritz about 6 at night. Only had about 10 gas cases through &amp; spent my time controlling the loading &amp; unloading &amp; forwarding dressings &amp; supplies to the other posts.</p>
<p>Friday 28th Sept  A very quiet day, perhaps because Fritz was readjusting his gun positions our advance being close on a mile. Very few wounded coming in</p>
