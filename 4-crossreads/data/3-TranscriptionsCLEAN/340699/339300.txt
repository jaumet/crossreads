Peck who wanted to know how I was getting on. Fred Leist was evidently at his side, for he also spoke. Leist is coming out to see my stuff. In half an hour I am riding over on horseback to H.Q. to get my mail and a change of underclothing. That is the reason I'm writing now, tho' I have only just finished lunch.

Last night, owing possibly to the rain and clouds, was a quiet one and every one had a good sleep. This morning (Sunday) I didn't get up till noon and feel 100% better for it. It may be that I will be able to see Leist to-day and get some "good oil" regarding the possibility of special leave - anyway I'll give it a fly, DONT'T BUILD ON IT! I've just finished a book on American life called "Queed" by a writer named Henry Sydnor Harrison. It struck me as being "real" good; very American, democratic and decently optimistic. I need to borrow some of the last commodity.

I rode a grey mare I'd had before; an old mule for stubborness but easy enough to manage. I succeeded in finding no one I went to see but transacted my business and got back just before supper. The Hun obligingly waited until we just got out of the last village before we reached camp - our nearest neighbour - before he shelled it. He generally does this at noon or about 7. This time he began earlier. To-day again he was back at his noon stunts. After supper, it being still cloudy and feeling very tired I took a rest, until an importunate relieving Lieut, got me
