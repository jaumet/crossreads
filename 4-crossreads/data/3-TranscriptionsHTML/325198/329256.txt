<p>27 February, 1916<br/>Serapeum<br/>This morning we had to pull up the horse lines &amp; fix them again it was a lot of work.  I hope theyare OK this time. It is a bad place for water. the drinking water is brought here by train &amp; we get one water bottle full each morning.  For washing we have to depend on well water as in the water in the channel is said to cause sores &amp; "Nile fever" if it is used. It is an awful dusty &amp; windy day.  All ones food gets covered with sand.  This afternoon A troop rode over<br/>to the Suez canal for a swim, a number of us swam right across, so have been on both Africa &amp; Asia to day  Stable picquet to night, its not much of a job, have to go on at 3.0 in the morning</p>
