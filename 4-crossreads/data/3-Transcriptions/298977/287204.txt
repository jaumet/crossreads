<p>shortly and try and find Frank Eather.</p>
<p>Best wishes to Mr. Rose.  Have not seen Bernard yet.  I do not know what he is in so have no idea where to look.  Had a letter from Mr. Pauch last mail.  He tells me Gladstone has been home and left again.  I hear from Rita fairly regularly.</p>
<p>Please get into the habit of enclosing paper and envelope.  I am just about out of writing material now, so if some weeks you don't hear from me, you will understand how it is.</p>
<p>Hope everybody is O.K.</p>
<p>With love to all,<br/>From<br/>Roy.</p>
<p>This is written under difficulties, and May be hard to read.</p>
