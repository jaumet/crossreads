The deck space is very limited and we are only allowed sufficient for about one quarter of our strength from 9.30 am till 12.30 pm., and to keep the men fit we have to devote practically all this time to physical jerks. In addition to these parade hours we manage to work in about one hours signalling and three quarters of an hours bayonet fighting each day; and to Cpl. Brissenden's great delight the skipper has given us permission to use the bridge semaphone.
