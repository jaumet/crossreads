<p>5th February, 1915</p>
<p>After a very tedious trip we arrived at Durban at 6 pm on February 1st &amp; got off the Ship at 8 pm. Children &amp; all went to the Royal Hotel. Mr &amp; Mrs Sear &amp; the Le Hunt Wards fellow passengers also went to the Royal. It is a most comfortable hotel &amp; they gave us 2 double bedrooms &amp; 2 single bedrooms &ndash; Charges 15/- per day as it was out of season. Almost everyone left the boat &amp; went to different hotels, as we had to take on 21,000 tons of coal, &amp; coaled all night on both sides &amp; the Kaffirs make the dickens  of a row while working. After we had some supper &amp; put the children to bed the Sears &amp; Trixy &amp; I went round the town in Rickshaws. Durban is a pretty place with a magnificent town hall which cost about &poun;250,000 (nearly a quarter of a million).</p>
<p>The next morning the children had rides in Rickshaws &amp; Trixy, Mrs Sear &amp; I went round the town &amp; did some shopping. After lunch we got a car &amp; with Mr &amp; Mrs Sear, Amy &amp; the babies we went round the town for 2&frac12; hours, with a break for afternoon tea on the Espanade.</p>
<p>The town is a mixture of Zulus, Kaffirs, Hindoos [Hindus] Poorwhites &amp; Whites. Most of the houses are a very poor type &amp; ill kept &ndash; tops of chimneys falling off &amp; spoutings loose, lacking in paint &amp; repairs generally, but the streets are very clean, double decker electric trams, which carry natives &amp; white folk together, white &amp; native police (Zulus) &amp; we saw about 50 convicts (white &amp; black) working on a building with a guard of 4 white soldiers &amp; about 4 native police, the latter armed with a stick with a knob about 8eight inches from the point.</p>
<p>We drove round the Berea (rhymes with Morea) the fashionable quarter of the town. The soil is a most wonderful red colour, almost the colour of a coral tree flower &amp; everywhere are fine shady bright green trees, like a jacaranda in leaf but with dense foliage &amp; scarlet flowers. There were some nice houses here with plenty of grass &amp; palms &amp; hedges &amp; groups of shrubs, one especially beautiful one with bright peach-pink flowers, but practically no beds of annuals or small flowers. Some fine crotons &amp; some cannas, with the wonderful soil gave the necessary touches of colour. Add to these the many coloured robes of the natives &amp; hindoos &amp; toy have a gay scene.</p>
<p>We saw surf bathing, but it was a tame affair compared with ours &amp; the sand did not look nice &amp; clean &ndash; too grey in colour. The harbour is the work of man, two huge breakwaters being built out to from [form] a safe anchorage. I did not like the rickshaw man &ndash; too cheeky &amp; too importunate, but they certainly add to the quant appearance of the town, with gaily dressed heads adorned with horns, feathers, pampas grass, porcupine quills, coloured rags &amp; huge celluloid balls multicoloured glued to their caps.</p>
<p>Most of the rickshaws bear a notice "for Europeans only". They carry 2 adults &amp; charge 3d per person per mile &amp; go at a fair pace. The streets are nearly all level &amp; covered with asphalt or some such substance. They wear the same garments as Caidley only trimmed with coloured rags sewn on promiscuous like.</p>
<p>Except that the harbour is closed from dusk to dawn, that there was a small encampment at the foot of the lighthouse &amp; a few men in khaki about the streets, we would not have known that a big war was in progress.</p>
<p>The Bank hours are from 9 to 1 am [1 pm?] on Wednesday &amp; Saturday &amp; 9 to 2 other days. Shops shut at 5.30. the public are kept off the Bank Counters by strong brass bars almost at the edge of the counters &amp; each teller is further enclosed in wire netting, much after the style of dangerous animals in cages at a zoo. Most of the hotel servants were Hindoos &amp; seemed to despise the natives. There is a fine square in front of the town hall, &amp; there were statues &amp; beds of salvias. In the streets men were selling asters &amp; carnations. Fruit &ndash; pawpaws, pineapples, passionfruit &amp; pears were plentiful &amp; good, but the apples we saw were very poor. We were delighted to get the Newspapers.</p>
<p>We hope to get to Capetown to-night &amp; intend seeing as much of the place as we can. We have on board a Mr Daniel Crawford who says he is an Explorer &amp; Missionary, but none of the African passengers have ever heard of him. He is very bombastic &amp; incoherent. He says he had spent 23 years in the heart of Africa, but his fat oily skin belies him. [He was in fact a Scottish missionary of the Plymouth Brethren]. "Daniel" as we call him was seen going to the bath the other day in a dinner jacket &amp; socks with suspenders &amp; <u>nothing else</u>. My luck was out as I did not see the vision, &amp; he does physical culture exercises in his cabin with no clothes on &amp; with the door &amp; window wide open &amp; the lights on. He is in the cabin next to me, but thank goodness he leaves us at the Cape.</p>
<p>The little boys on the boat whose fathers are at the front are very funny &ndash; I heard one say the other day "My father's in the Light Horse" &amp; another who stutters said m m m my Father w a a s as in the " T t torch, b b b but now he may be in the N n n n n North Sea" &amp; the words he doesn't stutter on he says very fast &amp; it sounded so funny.</p>
<p>The Zulus who pull the rickshaws at Durban have their bare legs painted to represent socks, fancy or plain &amp; we saw several with imitation suspenders painted above the socks.</p>
<p>We are now passing along the Coast &amp; have just passed Simon's Bay which has 3 lighthouses at its entrance &amp; now Table Mt is in sight.</p>
<p>Best wishes to all &ndash; We are all A. 1 but will be glad when the voyage is over.</p>
<p>Nearing Tenerife.</p>
<p>18th February, 1915.</p>
<p>Leaving Durban we ran along the coast &ndash; a fine bold coast with mountains rising almost from the edge of the cliffs &ndash; &amp; we arrived at Capetown at 6 pm. As we drew in to the harbour a big cloud settled on top of the Mountain &amp; we saw the famous "Tablecloth" spread on the top of the Table Mountain which at a distance looks quite flat &amp; the cloud ran down the sides, about 1/8 of the way down &amp; then seemed to keep pouring over the sides to this distance &amp; yet never got any further down. Capetown is most beautifully situated, nestling under this huge mass of rock with various isolated peaks &amp; masses of mountain around.</p>
<p>After dinner we went ashore with Mr &amp; Mrs Sear, got a taxi &amp; went up the town. At Durban we found it hard to realize that a big war was in progress. &ndash; Here it was the opposite. As we entered the harbour a hospital ship left for German South West Africa &amp; every man</p>
