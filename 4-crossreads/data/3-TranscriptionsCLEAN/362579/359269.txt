  
 Wish this dreadful war was ended. 
 Received a nice letter from Annie Howard  written about the beginning of Nov. - it has been to Egypt. Shall try to write soon to my friends but tell then it is freezing - so please excuse. 
 Hope the darling little pet is quite well again. Heaps of love   &  kisses. Shall try to get a P.C. for him. 
 Fondest love   &  hope you are all well. 
 From 
 Yours lovingly 
 Edith.
