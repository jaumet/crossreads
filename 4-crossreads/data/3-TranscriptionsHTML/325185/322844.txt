<p>France<br/>21.4.18</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>Well have found my way to France again. Oh well I have nothing to complain about this time have had six months spell &amp;amp: missed the winter across here that is the main thing. It has turned rather cold here the last week or so. Not as cold as I have felt it in France but still cold enough. I dare say we have felt it more after the warm weather we have been having. But the winter is just about over here now. May it starts to warm up a bit. We had a few days at the M.G. Base before coming up to the unit. I have transferred to the 1st M.G. Battn now address all mail (No. 1 company) 1ST Aust  M.G. Battn A.I.F. I hadent a chance to get to Cambridge again before leaving England was expecting leave when warned for draught.Harry Cross was at the Base Parcels Office &amp;amp: dident know whether he was permanent there or not. All that went across with him</p>
