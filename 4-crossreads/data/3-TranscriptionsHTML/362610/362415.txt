<p>Tuesday 18 July 1916<br/>Another dull day with drizzling rain at times. Up at 4.30 getting men out &amp; my gear packed : early breakfast &amp; then a long wait until 11 o'clock when we went for a short march : roads fearfully slushy. In the afternoon company parade, &amp; after it had a practice in the use of the Lewis Gun. At night, lecture at Bn. H.Q. terminating in a discussion about the coming attack, particulars of which were given as far as was possible. Very glad of a couple of home letters which were waiting for me.</p>
