  
 who is getting it before me is only getting his due & Cairo will be many days the cooler, also I shall be here for the next pay, (I have stipulated for  18) & shall not have to borrow at all, I hope, as I can get another tenner when I get to Cairo & that should see me through all right. The only thing of which I am afraid is that this stunt will be coming off soon & may stop the leave altogether.
