<p>Dear Mr Justice Ferguson</p>
<p>I received both your letters by the same mail.</p>
<p>Although as you say when I wrote to Geoffrey I did not think you would see the letter. I don't regret it, I can't tell you how I felt about your Son. I wrote as I felt &amp; I held him up to Geoffrey as a pattern of a clean living Australian</p>
