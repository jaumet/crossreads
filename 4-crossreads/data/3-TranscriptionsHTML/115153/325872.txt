<p>I happened to acquire a position in the orderly-room, which afforded me ample leave from the camp, which was run on very strict lines in reference to allowing much leave.<br/>As it was July and the holiday season at Weymouth which was a favourite seaside resort, there were always crowds of people about, and nearly all from other parts of the British Isles. There was a good promenade on the beach front and entertainments, mainly picture theatres and vaudeville shows. The places of interest were, the ruined castle which had a prominent position near the cliffs away at the end of the promenade, and the White Horse on a hill a few miles from the other end of the Promenade and right on the beach. I went with a party for a picnic to the ruined castle and while we were there we had a very interesting cruise around it, for it still revealed signs of how strongly it was built in order to repel any foe that might have attacked it in olden times.<br/>We did not visit the White Horse, but could see it plainly from the Promenade as it was in the form of white chalk bed on a green grassy hill sloping up from the sea.<br/>We were at Weymouth when our turn came to leave for Plymouth, the port from which, we were to sail to Australia.
