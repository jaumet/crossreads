<p>29/1/16<br/>Dear Beat &amp; Family<br/>The captain told us yesterday that we would be landing at Fremantle at 4 oclock in the morning and we would be allowed off for 2 hours so i thought i would write this letter and post it myself the others they read them first so we dont know whether they send them or not. From Fremantle we have another 10 days trip before we land the name of the place is Columbo that is where all the Blacks are. Beat i was as pleased as punch yesterday when i went to put that singlet on and found your note pined on the inside. Beat no flap but i dont know what i would do without that photo of yours while i am writing this i have it lying on the top of this sheet i sleep with it under my head in fact i never move without it i will have it worn out with kissing it before i get back. Beat it is a very pleasant trip but i am full to the neck of it the one thing over and over again nothing but water their is any amount of enjoyment but you get full of it</p>
