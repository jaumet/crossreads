  
 After being at Abassieh a few days I joined up with the troop in camp at Maadi. Maadi camp is situated on the fringe of the desert. The Suburb is a European quarter. I had the pleasure of meeting Roy here & while in camp together had many good walks & meals together. The work consisted chiefly grooming & looking after the horses Had many very interesting rides over the desert The dead or placed in Tombs A native funeral is comical Professional mourners head the procession with songs. Saw ruins of ancient places  Old Cairo is an eye opener
