<p>France<br/>1/3/18<br/>My Dear Sis,<br/>Have just received another letter dated 16/12/17. That is the latest letter I have received. I had a couple from Laurel, her latest was 10/12/17, so you have at last been a winner, but not in numbers. It is a most bitterly cold day to-day, snowed all night  &amp; today it has rained  &amp; is blowing half a gale. About the coldest wind I have felt in France. Am glad to hear that my little niece is getting on so well. I   <strike>answ</strike> answered your last letter in a hurry  &amp; forget whether I thanked you for the snap. I do not think it can be a good one although it is very nice but I like the little one best (the one you sent cut oval shaped). Of course you know by now that I am back with my unit &amp; posted as stretcher-bearer again. At present we are out of the line for a spell but go in again on Monday. Am glad to hear your view of conscription. The boys never seemed in doubt over here</p>
