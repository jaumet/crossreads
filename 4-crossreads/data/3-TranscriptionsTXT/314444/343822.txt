 Dear Mr Garling 
 I received your letter in Melbourne thank you very much for writing to Mr Campbell. I saw him the day we arrived in Melbourne and he placed everything at my disposal. in fact he did everything that was possible for him to do. I had a splendid time in Melbourne, that stay there saved most of our horses. I was very short of men &amp; could not exercise them as much as I would have liked, my greatest difficulty was the want of halters they used to bite them through, half of them were let out and driven round the yard for 2 hours the other half in the afternoon I had 70 men altogether. 
 I have lost one horse since leaving Melbourne Mr Richards has also lost one. Terry horse
