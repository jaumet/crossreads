<p>Judges' Chambers, District Court, Sydney 5th June 1965<br/>Dear Keith, I was very sorry that absence in the country prevented my being present at your farewell yesterday. I shall always remember your kindness to me whilst I was at the Bar. After your long and distinguished career at the Bar and on the Bench, you certainly deserve the best in the years that lie ahead. With best wishes and kindest regards, Yours sincerely, Jim Pilcher</p>
