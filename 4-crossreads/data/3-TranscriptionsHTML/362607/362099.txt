<p>Dear George,<br/>We expect to arrive at Adelaide tomorrow  &amp;  Sydney about 21st July or after. Most likely after, The sea is very calm but this boat is infinitely worse than the Kuring-gai for rolling. Gee! I'm fed up with rolling about. I have not been sick once but it is very uncomfortable.<br/>Will see you soon Boy  Love Harry</p>
