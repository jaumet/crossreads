 Dear Mother. 
 I have a long letter to Dorothy here which I cannot post, because the censor has issued orders to the effect that all letters are to be of one page only. It contains all the news, so that it will have to wait til I can get ashore &amp; post it myself. Things are alright. The trip through the Canal has been most interesting. The Indians &amp; a few Englishmen and Australians are still on outpost duty there. They galloped down to the bank of the canal &amp; waved to us and a few who could, shouted "good luck". We are all very well. Jim is in good form. I'm feeling as if I could jump out of my skin, in spite of 3 weeks almost incessant work below decks in the isolation hospital. I have not been ashore once yet and am longing to go, but there is no hope. Well ma dear, give my love to all. I will get a letter with news through as soon as possible. Lovingly 
 Dene.
