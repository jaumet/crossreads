<p>Tuesday 28th Jan.  Busy all morning doing my washing.  Went skating in afternoon &amp; made great strides finishing the afternoon by being able to skate backwards, turning etc.  Had sundry falls &amp; collisions &amp; now nurse a stiff neck &amp; sore elbow &amp; right foot.  Frost still on &amp; snow everywhere.</p>
