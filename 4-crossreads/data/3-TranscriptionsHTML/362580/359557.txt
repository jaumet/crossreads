<p>&amp; was returning to France to-day, we tried to arrange to see each other somehow but unfortunately the Authorities over here are absolutely the limit on the leave question &amp; I could'nt get off at all.</p>
<p>Since our arrival in this country I've had quite a good time with the single exception of this leave business, and am just finishing off a course of instruction at Candahar Barracks, Tidworth.</p>
<p>I expect you get most of the news from "Wansley", so shall not repeat it all.</p>
<p>Fortunately have not felt the weather much &amp; am in splendid health.</p>
<p>Trust you are all well, with love to all</p>
<p>Yours affectionately<br/>Chas H. Copp.</p>
