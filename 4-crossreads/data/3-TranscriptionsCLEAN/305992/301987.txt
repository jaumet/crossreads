The last of the Omrah was seen with her boats full of troops around the ship.At 10 am sighted a large Deregible at a distance coming towards us from Malta travelling about 60 miles an hour. It rounded & lowered within 100 feet of overhead of the destroyer next to us & semephore & asked the position of the Omrah. Then disappeared in that direction it having a large cage under with 2 guns mounted & 2 propellers distance about 1/2 mile .At 10.30 am 2 Jap. distroyers came up to us as if from nowhere tearing along at 30 knots to replace the two that remained behind for the Omrah. S.O.S. & position of Omrah received by our wireless & also secret code messages from the Jap. distroyers there.At noon when relieved on the navigation bridge I asked our wireless if any messages came through re. Omrah (none). At 0.15 pm two destroyers & the dirigible was seen astern coming towards us & making towards Malta. So by apperaiances
