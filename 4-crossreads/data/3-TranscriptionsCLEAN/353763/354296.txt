Monday Oct 2  -  1914  Its grand weather  -  Perfect weather  -  Sunday morng   I put in quietly reading & writing but in the aftn  I went to the beach & called on Dr.  Montague the GMO  -  There are 5 medicos in Suva - GMO - Ireland Health Off & De Boissier - Senior Off at the Hosp  -  In addition there are 2 private practitioners - Price & Drake  -  These 2 latter I have not met - I called officially on the other 3  -  The GMO has been 16 years in Suva & from his verandah there is a glorious view over a big landscape & blue also a big seascape right to the reef  -  He belongs originally to St Thomas Hospital & we knew some men in common  -  As I belong to the Submarine push I think people are glad to see & talk to me for Submarines are still in the novelty stage & the loss of AE1 brought us pretty prominently into notice  -  About 5  - 30 I left & walked quietly back to my ship admiring on the way some fine, very fine  Dracoenas with their colored foliage - also some very fine Strelitzias at the foot
