Bertangles, Coisy, Rainneville
16/7/16
 along a white chalky road winding over high downs. Poor country with stunted crops and not very many houses in sight. Reminded me very much of some Australian landscapes. The tower of Amiens Cathedral is a landmark for miles and miles around. 
Approaching Coisy the pretty country starts again. In Bertangles we passed several little crucifixes set in the middle of a ring of trees like a Druidical grove. Just the other side of the village there is a fine long avenue of parralel rows of trees with a road running straight up to a chateau at the top. The trees are the chief beauty of this country the people pay very great attention to their culture. 
We came into Rainneville into poor billets ? the accomodation of the little village being overtaxed by so many regiments. We had great arguments with the very old dame at our billet she pointblank refused to allow the batmen to use her stove so after explaining that by law she is compelled to do so and greasing her palm a little we got on alright. 
Good news through from out in front but poor Mackay had bad news as he received a cable telling of his father's death and the boy broke up completely. Today is Sunday, we always seem to move on the Sabbath. Some drizzling rain tonight. There is some talk of there having been a rape down the street and a roll call being held. The old dame introduced us to strawberry and black currant bushes in her garden and we had a tin of Ideal Milk too. 
No mail is being accepted for transmission from us and correspondents at home will wonder. We march on again tomorrow. From here we are back to the familiar sound of guns once more.
