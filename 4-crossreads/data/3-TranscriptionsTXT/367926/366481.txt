 practically anything I like with him. I have just come back from my second furlough in England, I travelled about a lot this time, I left London for a place called Weymouth, stayed there for about 4 days, &amp; then went on to a place called Taunton, from there to Bristol. Stayed in Bristol for five days, &amp; then went back to London, so you see Aunt, I saw some of the Old Country. I spent my first leave in Edinburgh (Scotland), I  am now trying to get a look at Paris but I do not like my chance, &amp; funds are low, so I will have to save all my pennies. We have been having some wonderful weather, it makes one feel that it is good to be alive. I wrote a letter to Daphne three nights ago, I also sent her a photo.  I received the Eucalyptus &amp;  malted milk you sent and they were very acceptable too especially the Eucalyptus  when   everybody comes to me for a drop of it when they catch a cold, I managed to buy some in france, but it was not nearly up to the Australian make, just about half as strong. I do not get the same opportunity of learning French now that villages are always empty of people where we are. I will conclude this letter here Aunty and I cannot say where I am, I would like to tell you all about it, but I am not allowed. So trusting  it finds you in the best of health and of high spirits, I will finish with 
 lots of affection from your loving Nephew Doddin
