  
 Friday 7 May 1915 
 This morning at 7 a.m. we weighed anchor and [indecipherable] our journey to Alexandria.  Just leaving we got definite word from the Front that everything was O.K., the good position which we had obtained still being held and the Turks keeping very quiet.  So evidently they are beginning to find the place too hot for them.  Well for the time being, "Good bye Johnny the Turk, goodbye Gallipoli!" 
 Passed Lemnos at about eleven and shortly afterwards we stopped for a few moments to bury the dead.  This sad work being finished we again went on our way cheerful for the most part, and enjoying our holiday.  We have all received some pay, and as there is an excellent canteen (dry) on board we can enjoy many little luxuries such as cake or tinned sausages, condensed milk and sardines.  Prices are low so the almost convalescent Australian, broken only in body but not in spirit has a real good time.  Beer and stout are also obtainable and needless to say even against the medical officer's orders we all indulge in our little nightcap each evening.
