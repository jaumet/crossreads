<p>May your joys be as deep as the ocean<br/>And your troubles as light as its foam.</p>
<p>Think of all the kind words that have ever been said<br/>And of all the kind thoughts that ever have sped<br/>And of all the good luck that to you could befall<br/>And be sure that my heart for you echoes them all.</p>
