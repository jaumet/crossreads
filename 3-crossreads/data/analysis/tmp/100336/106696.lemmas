 and in the distanc we could see a number of tent . We knew this to be one of the Arab camp which our Greek friend had warn us of , so we gave this a good-by . When we had gone a littl further we came to a dri bed of a small creek with thick bush grow up all along . We decid to go in hide here till the follow even . It was about 3 a.m. and we were dead tire . It was not long befor we were fast asleep. In the even just befor sunset , the water question began to troubl us again , so we start to follow the bed of this creek along in the chanc of find water . When we had gone a few hundr yard two Arab soldier pass us not 50 yard away . We immedi fell down behind a bush and they pass on without see us so we decid to go no further till dark . When we did move off again it was not long befor we struck good water and then we knew we were right for the night . This night the travel was good and we did not meet anybodi so we made excel progress Toward morn we made our way toward a small hill which was our custom as we could take a bear dure the day of the surround countri .
