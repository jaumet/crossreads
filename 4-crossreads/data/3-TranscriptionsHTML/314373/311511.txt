<p>native streets of Cairo. The monkey cage attracted a great crowd and some of their antics were very laughable, for they seemed almost absurdly human, and we even saw one mother run up to the little one, catch him by the ear and pull him along to her corner, where the little fellow looking quite guilty and crestfallen received a lecture and a parting smack before he made a rather slippery escape. There were some fine specimens of girraffs and as they walked about with their little heads on their long great necks poked over the high railings looking at us almost as if we were the exhibits and not themselves. Further along the nose and eyes of a hippopotamus were to be seen just poking out of a large pond and as we wished to see him the keeper just spoke a few words and the great grey back gradually rose out of the water and to see the look of interest one would think it was a German submarine rising to the surface and viewed from a British liner.

I engaged a native guide but he lead us to a Jews place which was very dear and so we started wandering off by ourselves, going into all sorts of queer corners and seeing sights which fitted them.
