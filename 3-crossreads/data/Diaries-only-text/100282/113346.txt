over to where we thought we could see some turnips growing, we guessed right so we collared one each had a feed off it. Men are pretty hungry when they come at this I know I could have eaten anything. We finished the last stage of our march about 3 miles at a rattling good pace, pulled up in a quiet little village miles from nowhere, I can tell you the mob were glad to throw their gear off lay down we had walked since 8.45 the time we finished was 3 oclock nothing to eat between, must have covered 15 miles 
17th. The Battn are resting today they need it badly too.
We are all billeted on fine people here, give you nearly anything some of the lads had coffee brought in to them while in bed this morning apples were distributed freely. Last night I had a yarn with one of the French girls who work on the farm, she could talk a little English, I asked her a good few questions about one thing another, she told me that French girls work just the same in peace times on the farm
