  
 better than ten. Naturally we were all in ecstasy of delight. On arriving in the vicinity of  B----, we found that Fritz was shelling the town rather severely & we were told to report to C---- for the leave train. We then walked about two miles on the outskirts of the town, & then managed to obtained a lift in a lorry to C----   On arriving there we found to our dismay that leave had been cancelled for all troops as Fritz had started his offensive.  You can just imagine what disappointing news this was to all. However, we still had the leave passes in our possession & were not going to give in without a "fight". We obtained another lift in a lorry to H---- the next town, & here we found the same unfortunate state of affairs, so of course there was only one thing to do, return to our Unit. We were certainly very unfortunate but not nearly as bad as those chaps who were on board the boat en route for "Blighty" who were brought back to France, & told to report to their Units.  Oscar Hann was one of these "unfortunate beggars". 
 Thursday the 26th March 1918. -  27th & 28th March. 
 All kinds of wild rumours "flying" around in regards this great attack of Fritz that one hardly knows what to believe.  I must admit that I feel very depressed with the news, but it would never do to get in the dumps over it. This life is bad enough without that. 
 We expected moving orders every since Saturday & to-day they arrived, & at 11.45 a.m. the unit marched to G---- & are billeted in barns for the night. At 12.30 p.m. the following night we entrain (in cattle trucks, & detrain at D----- about 3.30 p.m. of the following day.
