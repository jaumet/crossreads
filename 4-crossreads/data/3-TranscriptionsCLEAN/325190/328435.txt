  
 some of us to the tram terminus, where, unfortunately we left him, & that was the last I or any of those on the tram, saw of poor old Dingo. He may attach himself to the American camp, or be picked up as a stray, it is hard to say.  I do hope & pray he will be well-treated, for his  faithfulness  fidelity, [indecipherable] in all dogs, was beautiful. Poor old Dingo.
