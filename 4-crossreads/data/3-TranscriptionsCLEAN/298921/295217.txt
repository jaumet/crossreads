September, 1915Friday 3Do not think because I am still in Hospital I am seriously wounded, I am A.1. &  only waiting for the flesh  to fill up the wound Of course being in bed has made me a bit weak,  but very fat & soft.With these notes I send you snap shots of our Position at Anzac - if I sent you negatives, a Photographer might strike off prints for sale at your Bazaar affair to help your friends eh? I see by the Papers that old [indecipherable] has married again!!!Will sort this love to all.F.W.
