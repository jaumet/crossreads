<p>enjoying it immensely &ndash; on the balcony, on a stretcher writing home letters. It is beautiful here this morning but is warming- up, so shall have to go in about 10 o'clock.<br/>The hospital (general) is not so busy just now, so one Sister has been spared to relieve me. We are awfully busy in the Officers Ward &ndash; mostly Tommy Officers &amp; some of them <u>poor things</u>.   <br/>Was delighted Saturday night to get Ethel's nice long letter of May 8th  &amp; Belle's from Talbot of May 10th . So glad Belle is having a good holiday. Wish you could afford to go to a decent place together &amp; do it comfortably. Had a nice letter from Alice Bower too, she is a good old sort, making time to write to me. Tell her I had a nice letter from Norman May 30th from France. He was very well &amp; expected to go on furlong in a day or two to England.<br/>Dearest mother must get a p.c. for dear little Eddy &ndash; so with the best &amp; fondest of love &amp; kisses  I am                             your loving daughter                                                                                                                                                                                                                Edith.</p>
