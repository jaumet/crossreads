 18 September 1918 Wednesday Making good progress with fair weather and a smooth sea Nothing of importance to note. No war news. In sight of the coast all day. 
 1918 September 19 Thursday Passed Cape Otway about 8.30 A.M. Entered Port Phillip Heads about 3 P.M. Anchored near Port Melbourne about 6.30 P.M. Excitement seems to be running right through boat. It is a fine homely sight to see the numerous lights along the foreshore of a house. Port once more &amp; a relief to know that we are at our sea journeys end.
