Friday, 19 March, 1915Left camp at 10 a.m.  Rode Ginger as Sammy6 has a cut fetlock we winded our way through Heliopolis thence through Zeitoun to Koosoos where we had lunch by the great canal, then all the bearers had to ride ahead and run a relay back to the waggons to report the state of the road we each had to gallop about a furlong.  When the waggons arrived we journeyed about two miles and then unhitched and picketed our horses at the bivouac site which was ideal for the purpose, being sheltered by date palms and close to water.  We erected the waggon tents fed our horses and had a good tea and then turned in, two men each doing an hour's picquet through the night.  Reveille
Saturday, 20 March, 1915Was at 6.30 and we fed up at seven had breakfast and then cleaned up the camp and saddled our horses and rode home after a most enjoyable outing.  Two of our men have been transported to Hospital ship Cecilia.
Half holiday spent in turning out my kit bag as it is so full that I cannot get any more into it we are still getting issues of underclothing & flannells, the latter are a burden and you can buck them for 2 PS. each in the camp.  Issued with a new pair of boots.  Went to O.'Rs at night.  Three British cruisers have been sunk to-day in the Dardanelles.
