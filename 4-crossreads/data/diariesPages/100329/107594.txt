When in a smile her baby lips were parted,
The sun shone in my heart, life grew less grey
And like some careless boy I’d feel light hearted
The livelong day.

As thrills the harp beneath the minstrel’s fingers
Her little hands upon my heart-strings did play ed
And when upon my lips her pure kiss lingered
Night turned to day.
