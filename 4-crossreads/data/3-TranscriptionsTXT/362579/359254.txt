 Alice for her birthday. Hope she had a real happy day   &amp;  will have lots of joy   &amp;  luck this year. Trust to be with you for next birthday.

Have you quite decided to send him to school, where   &amp;  when &ndash; the poor little pet, will be quite a big boy when I return. Oh, what a pity we grow old.
