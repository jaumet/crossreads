 13th Oct. &ndash; Friday Bugles blowing all night &amp; morning &amp; troops moving out in every direction up the line to the front.  Reveille 6 a.m. &amp; breakfast (Sergeants' mess) 7 a.m.  Still miserably cold wind &amp; drizzling rain.  No further news or instructions regarding our next move &amp; just hang around all day.  I, at least shall soon apply to go straight to the front instead of waiting to be sent up in the middle of winter.  Camp life in this place far removed from any town is not pleasant.  Plenty of firing going on all day &amp; attacks practised.  Parade at 2 p.m. &amp; still raining, seek shelter.  Good news
