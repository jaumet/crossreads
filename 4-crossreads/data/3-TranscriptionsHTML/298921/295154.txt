<p>July, 1915<br/>Friday 2<br/>Paid all hands yesterday a cheque for 300/-/- in Piastres = 29,250 &amp; seems such a lot of money but L.s.d. goes a very little way in Cairo &ndash; 5 P.T. or 1/- for a drink &amp; soldiers call them disasters.<br/>I have been lecturing every afternoon lately on<br/>Entrenching<br/>Supply of ammunition<br/>Musketry etc:-<br/>I hate it but endeavour to interest the men we are training. Lectures <u>can</u> be made interesting &amp; the men you can feel are interested &amp; keen to learn &ndash;<br/>We are all working hard &amp; trying to do our bit to fit the fresh arrivals for their jobs &amp; keep the Horses in nick.</p>
