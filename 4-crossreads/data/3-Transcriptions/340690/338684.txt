Met Laurie and worked till 3 o'clock and back same way salvaging an old woman who was evacuating on way.  Home tired and fowl etc. for tea with pudding afterwards.

Hazebrouck heavily shelled last night and this morning and I believe with gas shell also.  Moved out about 12.30 and had to go back for rations so followed Jacobs who was on limber.  Quiet going out but many places badly knocked in Hazebrouck and a lot of shops manifestly broken into.  Took wrong road going out and had to wait for limber's return.  However arrived about 2.30 and settled down as we are not going to work.  A farmer &amp; his son came back to collect the remnants</p>
