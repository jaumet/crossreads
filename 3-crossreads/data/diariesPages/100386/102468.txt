Instead of accepting an old hat on being issued with a new article, authority has been obtained for each man to use his old hat in the bakehouse, in lieu of caps, "White, linen, Bakers." Therefore two hats are in possession of men, one for rough use, such as in the bakehouse or camp fatigues, and the other for out of camp use. 12 caps. SD have also been returned to A.O.D.
