1917Tue. 13th Nov.We returned to the Carcados at about 9 am.   "Ingotz Mendi" following and tying up alongside.   She is one of the new standard ships and deplorably dirty at close quarters.
On the afterdeck is quite a farm-yard &ndash; a couple cows &ndash; ditto pigs &ndash; and a number of fowls strut around led by a bedraggled chanticleer.
The Germans got busy at once, the coal commenced to come over to "Wolf's" bunkers.   Wireless was fitted on the Spaniard and the poop is being fitted with accommodation for the women and their husbands.
Wed.  14th.A wireless scare in the afternoon.   Cruisers in vicinity.   Axes were laid alongside the mooring ropes, the 'plane was hastily re-assembled and rose at 3 pm.   The 'plane is now covered with thin tussore raw silk.    This was, of course, a complete failure &ndash; on the return of "Wolfchen" the new covering was in huge rents.
