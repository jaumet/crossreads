Dear Mrs Ferguson
Your beautiful message- and Dorothy's- touched me very deeply- and from Pat.
And I want to tell you at once- while your sweet flowers are fresh over her, that, although she distrusted herself too much to respond freely to your many gentle and sympathetic offers of friendship, she was never ungrateful, and in your deepest sorrow she had tears for you.
What a debt I owe to you and yours-
very sincerely[Orwell?] O'Reilly
