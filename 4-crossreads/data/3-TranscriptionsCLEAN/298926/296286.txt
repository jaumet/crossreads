  
 23rd  We played a few marches which were appreciated by the inmates of the hospital.   At 7 o'clock we took off our packs which were placed on the transport and we played the  troops to a rest camp 7 miles from the wharf.                                                  Havre is a large seaport where there is a tremendous amount of shipping. We did not get a very emphatic reception but rather a respectful and quiet welcome that  was more heartfelt than expressed.
