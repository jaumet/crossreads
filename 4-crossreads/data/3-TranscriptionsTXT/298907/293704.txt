you are, it will be interesting just to see how I get on, for strikes me I shall be a long time forgetting her & I'm sure I shall be wondering if she ever thinks of me, but what a fool I am getting worse every day I think & me at this age its time I knew my own mind, but things seem in a whirl tonight, so please make allowances for me dear reader if you were only in my position you would perhaps understand me better & have a little patience with my foolishness, for such it appears to me, but I will close now for morning might find me in a different mood & I daresay I shall be sorry for what I have already written but somehow I feel like the Scotchman for "I hae me doots"
