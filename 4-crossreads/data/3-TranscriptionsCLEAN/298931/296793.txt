  
 Friday 15 Back at the ramparts of Ypres, feeling O K and enjoying myself, to day we hold our hands out Saturday 16 Here I am with 40 Francs and without any means of spending it Today I met Lieutenant Reg Gibbons he looks well Sunday 17 A nice quiet day, on a nice quiet front. Rather be home, it would be quite alright Letters from Elsie, Kitty, Emma, Maggie, Miss Caro, Valerie, & Eileen a busy day
