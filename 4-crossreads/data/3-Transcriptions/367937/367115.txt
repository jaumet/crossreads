<p>never can tell but it would be better to leave it till after the Easter holidays dont you think.  I am still wondering what Father got for the sheep and whether he is coming down for the show.<br/>I did not see the boys this weekend as they were up at Springwood with Charlie but I managed to drag on a blighted existence without them in fact we had some great fun on Saturday night.<br/>We went to "So Long Letty" and it was pretty and funny and at the interval Aunt Katie drank a glass of the ice cream soda.  I had a somebody [indecipherable] to me and I cant think what I had.<br/>I have been thinking seriously of starting smoking again; often in the evenings here you cant see to do anything after tea and you have just got to sit still and listen to the other chaps talking and you nearly bust for something to do.<br/>I don't want to become an habitual smoker but just a smoke in the evenings would not hurt do you think?<br/>I told Mr. Sams that I thought I would start and he immediately gave me a pipe; one he was given, a real beauty cost about 12/6.
