  
 sleep till early morn. Very early our officer Mjr P.J. Ross with Howarth & Matt & ohs[others] left for Imbros Isld for a short spell. So far I am left in charge of the gun & detachment. I was inoculated yesterday for cholera epidemic. 
 A German Taube dropped several bombs over our camp this evening. Luckily one of them did not explode. The one dropped on the beach exploded without incurring any casualties. 
 Sunday 18th A quiet day. Bought a tin of Nestles milk today for 2/-. Some of the soldiers bring over a packages of goods in their trips and can get anything they ask for them almost. Fancy 2/6 a packet for envelopes. 
 Monday 19th July Harvey Turton[?] arrived. Of course it meant plenty of chats about our drivers at Alexandria etc. 
 I must say candidly my health & the weakness which came on me has interfered greatly with my nerve just now. One requires perfect health to be in good fighting trim.
