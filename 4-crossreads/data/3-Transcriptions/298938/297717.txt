<p>Saturday 14th Oct<br/>Chief happenings of the week are that I have applied for commission, but failed hopelessly on the eyesight affair.<br/>Major McWhae, who did not seem disposed for me to leave here, told me he thought it hopeless for me to send the application in.  Only 3 Australians per month are sent to the School.<br/>He offered to do his best to get me promoted to full corporal after Corp. Binger's is confirmed. That will probably be some time ahead, but he is a man of his word is McWhae.</p>
