<p>Saturday 4 August 1917</p>
<p>No. 14 A.G.H. Very Hot in Cairo but good for lungs, no DEW or FOG.</p>
<p>Am enjoying clean beds &amp; Baths etc., tho' feel a bit of a SCRIMSHANKER <strike>not sick enough for a Hospital one meets so many malingerers.</strike></p>
<p>SLEEP is the great thing that I excel at.</p>
<p>Old "Ally" the Native in charge of Officers Mess remembered me coming in on a Stretcher before, but very few of the old No. 3 staff are here, all in France. Colonel Blackburn is my M.O. he was locum for Bronowski in HAY years ago. As for the Sisters, we all love being "managed" &amp; spoilt a bit, all part of the cure.</p>
