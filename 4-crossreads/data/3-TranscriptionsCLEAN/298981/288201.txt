  
 From Anzac to Suvla 
 Altogether we marched nearly ten miles that night and met very little opposition. 
 In the morning we could see the English regiments, which had disembarked at Suvla Bay, were late in developing their attack to join hands with us, so the help which we were to receive from them was not forthcoming.  We waited and hesitated which was giving the Turks time to reinforce & consolidate his positions. 
 A golden opportunity was  lost  being lost - a fact which we recognised as the fighting progressed.
