We write a couple of letters & get no answer & are then inclined to stop writing for a while.
I am glad that all things are right with Mrs & Miss Niness.  Dane told me long ago when you first wrote about it that it must be lies.  He said His Sister & also His Dad were too much of good sorts to be concerned about anything so trivial.  I was a bit reassured because Dane aught to know His own people but now I can quite forget all about it & will write when I come back from the Isle of Man.  I am going over again to-morrow for 4 days 21/2 days extra for travelling.  I do not know Ray Phillips.  I guess she was one of the Comforts Club.  I am enclosing a few snaps.  You have them all I think.  You can give them away to Bess or Nette or anyone you like.  Also some X'mas Cards.
Well, Mum, Dear, I have to write to Dad & George because I won't be back till 9/1/18.  I suppose you have a fair collection of P.C's of the different places we've visited.
Fondest Love & Good Health, Happiness all the year.  We may soon be Home again.
YoursHarry
