he presented several men with the Military Medal ribbons; it was beyond his power to give medals he said. There were two men of the 2nd Battalion decorated, both of "D" Coy. The Company has now, one V.C., two D.C.M.'s, and two M.M.'s We got the "straight griffin" from Birdwood, he says there will be no rest for anyone while the "push" is on. He uses some very endearing terms, this fellow; today he called us his; "Dear old First Brigade, the boys with hearts of gold";. The chaps don't like this sort of thing; but I think he is a good General.
14/8/16.
Parades as usual in the morning. We received our overdue pay, and then we marched to Contay and camped at the wood. Rained all day.
