people themselves I doubt it, they are killing themselves & their religion as fast as everything can by these methods of preaching at the boy's, it simply wont do with the Australians but they don't seem to realize it, in 9 cases out of 10 kakhi & the firing line is their proper place same with all these saintly parsons, bishops, priests & so on let them look at the record of the French priests & either follow their example or shut up & let people alone.At any rate the Australians have no more vice in them than the Home troops, & what they have they show, & don't attempt to hide it in any underhand way such as other troops employ.
