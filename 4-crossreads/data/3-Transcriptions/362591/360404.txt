<p>France<br/>24th April 1916</p>
<p>My dear Father,</p>
<p>Having written to Mother, &amp; told a perfectly true yarn, reminds me of another.  A day or two before going into the trenches, we took over some reserve <strike>trenches</strike> billets.  They were in range of hostile artillery but had not been fired on for donkeys years, so Lt. Connor &amp; myself turned in at about 2 a.m. without any worry.  Connor is 2nd in command of the Company &amp; has two Boer War ribbons.  At about 10.15 a.m. in the morning I was awakened by several reports followed by nasty swishy noises.  It was some way away, probably over a hundred yards, but when it didn't cease to continue, I sat up in bed &amp; looked at Connor, or rather a heap of blankets.  Another report opened my mouth.  I said, "Did you hear that Con?" to which civil question &ndash; "Do you think I'm b&mdash;y well deaf?"</p>
<p>Its rather funny, that before we came here everything was very quiet, &amp; the party we relieved said that as long as we were quiet they (Germans) were quiet, &amp; by practising what they preached only had one or two casualties per month.  I can't say how but things have changed since.</p>
<p>An enemy plane was brought down right in rear of our lines this morning &ndash; a most glorious sight.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son<br/>Arthur</p>
