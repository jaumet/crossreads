<p>My dear Mother<br/>I got your letter (Saturday 3 p.m. just befor leaving camp and I received Fathers on Thursday.  I have just come down from camp and have not had any dinner yet so can only write you a line.<br/>Of course sell Gaida if you think you can get a good price for her, but I dont think they will buy her for the military as all our horses are ponies like Galina.<br/>Next week 150 horses are coming up to camp and we are going to start mounted drill.  I am glad you got the rain, wonder what the sheep brought?<br/>The boys wrote saying that the proofs of my photo had &amp; I need not be afraid of showing them to people as I looked quite hansome which showed how much they are faked.  Cheeky little devils. It is raining slightly here &amp; I am hungry.<br/>With love from Rob</p>
