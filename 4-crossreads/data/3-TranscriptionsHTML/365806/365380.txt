<p>27 December 1916<br/>My dear Ferguson</p>
<p>I got yr letter today &ndash; with two type written enclosures about dear Arthur &ndash; I got yr previous Sept letter safely.  From all I hear &ndash; and I've heard often from various types of men &ndash; probably from 7 or 8, Arthur seems to have made a wonderful impression on his company for capacity courage and sweet reasonableness &ndash; I wish to god that the old, <strike>and</strike> the sick and those who have shot their parochial bolt could have died &ndash; and let those others live.  I am sending you a book on loan &ndash; keep it till I come back &ndash; it quite pleased me last night &ndash; although I fear that even the vague consolation of [indecipherable] the author himself believes in cannot find a mental balance in [indecipherable] to such as us -</p>
