1915Aug. 28 Sat.Went for a walk through Gezira Gardens after tea & then went round to the French Scout Headquarters - had a yarn with 2 of the boys who  spoke very good English (& who did not have need to avail themselves of my rotten French) - after saying good-bye to the boys & promising to visit their clubroom again shortly, trotted off into town to the Soldiers Club in the Esbekieh Gardens where a fine concert - given by the Aust. Army Pay Corps - was in progress & walked home on conclusion of Concert - typed Corps Orders for the following day & then after a shower (my usual nightly) went off to bed.
