me an authority to draw on his account. Will you tell Arch what I have done. I also asked Mr Walton to send my black Kit bag, which I left at Cook's Cairo, (with many things which I don't want to lose) to Arch with Ralph's things. inI am afraid it is only too true about poor old Ralph because Capt Storey who used to be one of the Doctors at Chezireh was over at the front for a fortnight & he told me one day here on Lemnos that he was often up with the 19th Batn. & knew Ralph personally & said he was killed.Cheer up old girlMuch love to you allYour loving brotherFred
