<p>Tuesday 5/9<br/>Beauval inhabitants fairly decent.  left there for Doolan [Doullens] about 9.30 PM had a noisy night march &amp; were kept in the street outside the Station for about 2 hours.  Quite a number of our fellows were Drunk.  We were in the train all night &amp; are in it now.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6/9<br/>Left the train this morning at a town called Proven in Belgium 18 K.M. from Ypres, it is 4 miles over the Belgian Frontier.  Had dinner &amp; moved on 4 miles to Poperinghe [Poperinge] over those cruel cobblestones which are such a feature of Belgian towns.  This town has been shelled the churches as usual catching it hot.  The Sanitary conveniences are very open.  It is a great little town &amp; I would not mind staying here a month.  I bought a <u>good</u> pencil (American) &amp; saw a good picture show &amp; altogether had a good day.  The people also will suit me nice looking girls too.  Glass roofs here are painfully common so are summerhouses.  Beer Gardens with tiled paths.  Vines</p>
