 Dear Colonel Fulton 
 I have hopped in here & propose working at studies of men & horses for 2 to 3 weeks after which if you are still in Cairo I trust I shall have the enjoyment of winding up my own little war with a few Egyptian sketches and your society. 
 I hear dreadful rumours as to the handling of my Plastescine child but have complete trust in you and do not anticipate much more than an ear or two or a head or two having to be replaced on my return. 
 Will you Sir please give orders for the case of materials left in War Records cellar to be put in right order that is a cover nailed well down & the case sent or conveyed to Moascar as soon as possible. 
 Thanking you for your kind offices, 
 I remain Yours truly G.W. Lambert
