Mess in the evening was a happy meal and it was good to see all the officers together. The old order changeth. After mess promenaded once more and parted until all the family went to the Benediction. A couple of men ill today with trench fever possibly carried by lice. However we have baths and clean clothes tomorrow. Behaviour is excellent and much smatening up apparent.
