<p>Friday Sept 22nd <br/>Trenches: fair day: got a "P" of Sanctuary Wood: plenty of our planes about &amp; one was very daring &amp; gave Fritz some target practice: our guns bogged a few heavy ones over in return for some whizz-bangs he gave us: Fritz put a flare into our "posi"</p>
<p>Saturday September 23rd<br/>Trenches: good day: quiet day few shells etc kicking around at night: Fritz put a flare into our "posi" again &amp; our dug out almost caught fire: Jack Coulter got sniped</p>
<p>Sunday Sept 24th <br/>Trenches good day: carried poor old Jack down so as he could get a decent burial: it was hard luck for him after going through that Pozieres hell &amp; carrying all the time: trench mortar &amp; artillery dual in afternoon: our "apples on the stick" &amp; stokes's shook him up &amp; he replied with "rum jars" &amp; torpedoes: our bombers also gave him a few "mills grenades" to play with:</p>
