 Dear Mr. Layton - We are sending Mrs. Lehair who has had some assistance from you before. 
 She has one debt 3-15-0 to the Bon Marche which she seems unable to meet otherwise she can get on alright on the military pay. 
 She has three young children & is paying 12/- per week for rent of room - 
 Perhaps you may be able to help - 
 Yours truly B. Booth.
