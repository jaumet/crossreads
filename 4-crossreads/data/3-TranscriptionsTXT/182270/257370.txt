 THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1919. 
 Dull &amp; Snowing at times. 
 Round the camp all the morning 
 and walked into Warminster 
 with Heenan in afternoon. 
 I cant realise that this is my 
 last day in England, but am 
 jolly thankfull&nbsp;that it is all 
 the same. Got everything 
 packed up ready to go.
