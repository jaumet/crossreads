Still in Gulf of Aden at 6 a.m. Pay (10/- per man) distributed at 6.30 a.m. Several ships in sight when passing through Strait of Babel-Mandeb about 7.30 a.m. Two auxiliary cruisers are off Island of Perim, bailing up all shipping. At 11 a.m. an auxiliary cruiser passed going towards Aden. The town of Mocha in Arabia was clearly discernable from the ship about 3 p.m. The Kyarra passed between a high, jutting mass of rock and a couple of small, lofty islets, on the top of one being a lighthouse. (4 p.m.) Steamer Freienfels has been close to us all day. Picked up some lamp signalling to and from her. Did some washing in afternoon.
