<p>Anzac Possy<br/>1.6.15.</p>
<p>&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &amp; families &ndash;<br/>Very windy &amp; papers blow about &amp; dust lodges every where so cannot write much &ndash; Theres not much to say except continued good health &ndash; Have slid down the hill to a new bivouac in the <strike>Valley</strike> gully &ndash; very pretty. Relieved on top for some days. Must send a photo of our new Hdqrs &ndash;</p>
<p>Slipped on board the "Sicilia" the other day &amp; had a glorious lunch with Graham &amp; 2 nurses &ndash; Every thing <u>so</u> clean &ndash; had beer at lunch! Capt is D. Shone &ndash; a cousin &amp; very nice. On board they have pillows, serviettes &amp; I actually saw the use of handkerchiefs, wh unnecessary conceit I have long since done without. Came back with 2 bottles of Irish whiskey &ndash; coffee &ndash; 4 envelopes &amp; a tighter belt.</p>
<p>The food here however is varied by the supply splendidly &ndash; a good achievement &ndash; sometimes dried figs &amp; prunes &ndash; fresh beef &ndash; lentils. A canteen ship is coming with everything, &amp; life may now be devoted to cooking in earnest &amp; handfuls of pills from the drs.</p>
<p>I left with Graham, to be sent to you,</p>
