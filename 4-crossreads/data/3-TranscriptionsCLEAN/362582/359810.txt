be next to go there. We quite expected to be away long before this - but no good worrying - things will soon come wri right. "Anzac Day" on Tuesday & Fred is giving a dinner I was to have gone but have had to ring up & tell him that I could not go. We shall have a little dinner of our own. They have not met yet but shall soon. I'm sending a few more snaps home soon. Hope you get them safely. Trust you are all well & had a good holiday. Fondest love & kisses to you all. Hope you all & Lucy are friends now. From, your loving sister, Edith
