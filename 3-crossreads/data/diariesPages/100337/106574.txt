I also went to St Pancras Station & inquired about a train for Nottingham & Mansfield for the morning. I returned to Headquarters on the Underground Railway. For the night I put up at the War Chest Club opposite army Headquarters at Westminster.

On Saturday 9th of December I was up at 7.30 am. I had a little Breakfast & was enroute for Pleasley Vale by 9 o`clock.
At St James Park Tube Railway Station I took the Tube to Kings Cross Station, From here I caught the 10.20 am Midland train & arrived at Nottingham at 12 noon. I changed trains at Nottingham & caught one leaving for Mansfield & arrived there at about 1.30pm.

The country from London to Mansfield is in places very pretty, The grass was beautiful & green, But the trees were in most cases bare of leaves, They, having been shed in the early winter. The scenery is not so beautiful or so rugged as it is along the railways in Australia , The land here is for the most part cultivated & can boast of very little virgin timber
