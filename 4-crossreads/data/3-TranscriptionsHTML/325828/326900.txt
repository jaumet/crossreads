<p>In train en route Alexandria.<br/>22.3.16.</p>
<p>Dear Father,<br/>Have just received this this morning and can only hope that the Censor will pass it through for you will be so glad of the news.  Have kept a copy in case you do not get this &amp; next time will convey the news to you if possible in a less direct form.<br/>Had another telegram from Rid first thing this morning &amp; am catching early train to Alexandria to say good-bye.<br/>Much love.<br/>Olive.</p>
