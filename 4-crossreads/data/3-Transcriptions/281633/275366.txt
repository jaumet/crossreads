<p>An M.P. who carried his badge in his Breast pocket pulled me up in Charleroi today &amp; asked to have a at my Pay Book.  This is the first time I have been stopped by a M.P. without his arm badge on.  It is a good idea because previously the Shrewdies could always see an M.P. some distance off &amp; Hop it while the going was good.</p>
<p>20-3<br/>Went to the Concordia to see the "Dinkum &amp; Blue" Diamonds.  Very poor show.  While coming home I was passing a Motor Car, a M.P. called on the Driver to stop, he took no notice, the M.P. called once more &amp; then fired two shots from his Revolver, one shot went through the Bonnet and damaged the Engine.  This took place in a crowded street.  I don't know whether I have mentioned it before but two Aussie Deserters have been shot in Estaminet brawls since I have been here.  Some of our "strays" have been "Holding up" people &amp; even Estaminets with Revolvers.</p>
<p>25-3, Tuesday<br/>Blew out the Murray-Prior combination twice last night but have a strong suspicion that the first game was not genuine.  Company had to Parade today owing to the Slack Gaurds they have been putting up lately.  We are to parade twice a week untill there is an improvement.  This morning's parade was no joke.  It was snowing and the wind was enough to cut a man to pieces.</p>
<p>26-3<br/>Was advised today that I was on the next draft for Aussie.  Seen the Q.M.</p>
