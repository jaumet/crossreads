<p>Dear Sir,<br/>At the last Meeting of the Society, on 30th ult., the President made sorrowful reference to the sad news of the loss of your gallant son, Mr. Dene B. Fry, who joined the Society in 1913.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Members present, I was asked to convey to Mrs. Fry and yourself, an expression of their great regret, and of their sincere sympathy.<br/>We mourn the loss of a young man, and a rising biologist, of great promise. The war is depriving the nation of many promising young men, &ndash; nevertheless, the fine spirit, the whole-hearted response to a sense of duty, and the readiness for self-sacrifice in a great crisis, which have been evoked in the hearts of so many of them, are a greater national asset even than accomplishments in business or science.</p>
<p>I would like also to express my sympathy in a private capacity. I have been interested in Frogs for a long time; and when your son met with difficulties, he would sometimes come down to see me, to inspect my collection, and to enlist my help, which was always gladly at his disposal. I had formed a very high opinion of him, both personally, and from a scientific point of view; and I deeply deplore the untimely fate that has overtaken him.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours faithfully<br/>J. J. Fletcher<br/>Secretary</p>
<p>Arthur Fry Esqr.<br/>Northcote Road<br/>Lindfield</p>
