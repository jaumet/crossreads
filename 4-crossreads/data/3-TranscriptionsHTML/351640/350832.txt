<p>II<br/>Dear Girls:/<br/>This is an original account by Captain Williams of the 10th Battln. Infty [Lieutenant John Williams, 11th Infantry Battalion].   He is <strike>a friend</strike> of the best Australian.  Joined the force in Queensland.   Was in South Africa.  He will make a name for himself here if luck favour him.   He  starts for the front in a few days.  I shall be sorry because he is a manly fellow honest, and fit for the Company of Men.   Such a change from Martin, Springthorpe &amp; Gray.   He left Brisbane as Liutnt &amp; is now Captain; &amp; he will soon be Major, he has capacity for any position.   A natural soldier whom any Senior officer of fighting instincts must push on.<br/>J B Nash 10-5-15<br/>11 a.m.</p>
