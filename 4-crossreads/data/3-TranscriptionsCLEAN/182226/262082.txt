Tuesday 29 February, 1916
Pay day (2)
We finished off our Gun pit alltogether this morning & went out on another job in the afternoon.
I am feeling very tired. All the hard work is beginning to tell. Thank goodness today is the last time we will be digging.
We are moving over to brigade Headquarters tomorrow.
