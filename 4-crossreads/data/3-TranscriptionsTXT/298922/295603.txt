 Wednesday 31st October 1917 
 Dolly stayed in bed. I went to Red Cross &amp; took Dolly to see Mrs. Granville for lunch who is also going to Egypt &amp; is our O.C.'s wife. We sail on Monday via HAVRE, MODERNE, TARANTO in ITALY. 
 Had dinner at Frascatis, Oysters, Steak, Partridge, Sweets, ices etc. so you what rot food restrictions are but you must pay for it. I write this as a Raid is on, special Constables blew whistles &amp; everyone goes to the Cellar or ground floor if possible.
