<p><u>June 8th</u></p>
<p>Sunday -</p>
<p>While on deck reading an essay on &quot;Eloquence&quot; by Emerson, a great change takes place.&nbsp; From afar, a storm can be seen sweeping up from the South, and shortly after we are passing through torrents of rain and the oppressive air grows cooler, as the seas grow more tempestuous.</p>
<p>How wildly, madly eloquent is a storm</p>
