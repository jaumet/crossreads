<p>8/12/15<br/>on a quarter ration of water made things hard.  A fairly quiet day with a moderate dose of 75s and about twilight a number of heavy 8.2's crashed over.  A 5 inch howitzer levelled a portion of the parapet and tore up the ground thereabouts but no casualties resulted.</p>
<p>With Major Smith inspected the new tunnels forward from old dressing station site.  Fine tunnels they are and perfectly safe.  Places for Regimental office and other dugouts (Adgt Slc. in command) also either commenced or marked out and I think it splendid safe place if C.O. will only move in there.  Some of the 25th attached on engineering work mostly repairing damage done in L.P. but just restoring things as they were &ndash; a recurrence of same sort of thing will occur on any subsequent bombardment.  All say that affair had every appearance of having been mathematically worked out.</p>
<p>Warships doing some shelling  Sea very calm and any moving boat making long trail.  Imbros looking dim and enticing.  Tallyn to hospital.  Poor old Bert Curnow went in this morning full of septic.   Bed 2015</p>
