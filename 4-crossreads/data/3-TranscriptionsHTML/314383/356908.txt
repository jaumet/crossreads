<p>Got the first idea of our job from Read.  It appears that one of our airmen flew from Baghdad to Miana in stages &amp; thence to Urmiah with the message that Slalty would send to the Jelus &amp; Armenians surrounded about the Lake, a number of officers  &amp; Sgts to organise their Army of 15000 men also money. M.Gs  &amp; ammunition.  Their contract is to break thro' to Sain Kala where the cavalry are to escort me to &amp; from there we push into Urmiah before the Turks again block the road.  Capt Read who lived there in prewar days is to do the political work while I organise the army.</p>
