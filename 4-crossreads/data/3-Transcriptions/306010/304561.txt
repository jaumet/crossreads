<p>Feb 10th 1916 Thurs.<br/>Got a late pass last night and went to the "Tops" Performance at the opera  House. Good entertainment by a band of pierrots. Got back to Gezira about 12.30 a.m.<br/>Feb 14th Mond.-<br/>The sewerage system of the Hospital has broken down (over 1300 souls at Gezira). One of to day's orders reads :- "<u>No.140,Water Supply</u>. For the present Officers, N.C.Os. &amp; men are not to use the baths and the Nursing Sisters are requested to be as sparing as possible" Seems to be as bad as being in the trenches.<br/>"Rumour has it" that a move of No.2 G.H. is contemplated in a month or 6 weeks. Let us devoutly hope that this is correct.</p>
