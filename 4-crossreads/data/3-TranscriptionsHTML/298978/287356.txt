<p>worse.<br/>It is true things are getting merry, but the snipers don't seem to get the strength of me. I find that the signallers have been relieved, that I was not supposed to have returned until the following morning. "Stretcher bearers on the left" is the ceaseless cry.</p>
<p>Apr; 30<br/>I cannot write &ndash; it is all too terrible, too sad &ndash; later, if I'm not killed, I shall write these experiences. More despatches to run to Headquarter &ndash; one chap named "Toc" said to me, "Well done , Slilas, I must try to get a V.C. myself." He is such a good natured fellow and very keen to distinguish himself.<br/>Fighting still continuing with unabating fury &ndash; the men are commencing to look very weary, they do not look as if they can last much longer &ndash; how long will this Hell continue?<br/>To Battalion Headquarters &ndash; when I get there, Lieut. Curlewis pulls me into the Headquarter's dug-out , saying "Come in , Silas you'll get killed."<br/>On the way back I guide Lieut.Geddes to Captain Margolin &ndash; "You're going too quickly for me, Silas; I am very weak" &ndash; I then discovered the poor chap has been wounded. I hear our losses have been very heavy.</p>
<p>May 1<br/>We are relieved from the firing line &ndash; the battle still raging; every nerve strained. Australians have done splendidly, holding a very difficult position have been much troubled with snipers. Am glad I have done my duty. First</p>
