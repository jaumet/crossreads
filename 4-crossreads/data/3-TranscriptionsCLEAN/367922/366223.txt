  
 and although we deplore the loss of these loved ones, we can still solace our minds with the manner in which they have laid down their lives. Your son, like mine, had a brilliant career in front of him. Still it is not the length of a man's live that counts, but only, what he puts into it. Your Dene, & my Oscar, put in their  all . "Dulce et decorim est pro patria mori" was their motto. 
 May the great Master watch over you & yours as He has over us. 
 In deep sympathy, Yours most sincerely N. J. Rambour
