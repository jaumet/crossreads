 May 30  th    We cleaned the engine up thoroughly & generally tightened up loose bolts etc  a Sergt was put to work fitting a new bearing & taking up the other three big ends. I found the valves in terrible condition  two of them almost burned away & absolutely no seat. I got four new valves & ground them all in - We went for a swim in the evening  I received a parcel - fine day - 
   
 May 31  st    We worked all day cleaning the lorry as they intend to paint it - we went down for a swim in the evening - the weather is beautiful.  
   
 June 1  st    We worked on the cleaning process all day & in the evening went for a swim, we are making plenty of use of the springboard which works very well - Jno & I practice life saving the first time he practiced on me he put the wind right up me & I fought him & he did'nt realise that I was in earnest till we were both pretty well exhausted with struggling. then he left me alone & we went in quietly, I was more played out than he was - after that we practiced it regularly & got on very well -
