I got across to the City alright &amp; pumped the tyre up again which lasted me till I reached the G.P.O. when I had to do it again.  By these stages I arrived at Ol's via Crown &amp; Cleveland Sts.  I was glad enough to reach Dowling St, too for I was beginning to be tired.  I found Ol's phone out of Order, so went up to Crown &amp; Oxford Sts. Post Office &amp; rang up.  I also got 3 Census Cards for Ol &amp; Emily &amp; myself, but we soldiers don't have to fill them in do we Father, I have asked a number here &amp; they say that the soldiers don't have to fill them in.<br/>I caught the 8.30 from Sydney &amp; arrived here in nice time to go on duty at 10.  I was very sleepy &amp; tired when 6 o'clock came but as soon as the 6.45 parade was over, I went over to the Orderly Room to report myself, but neither of the 2 men were in.  After breakfast I went to bed &amp; slept right through till 5.30 to-night.  Then came tea, &amp; I went over again to the Orderly Room but neither of them were in.  I found my blankets &amp; port where I had left them, fortunately for me.</p>
