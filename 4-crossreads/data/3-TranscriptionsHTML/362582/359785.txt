<p>I have applied for a week's leave of absence, so if I get it shall be able to answer all my friends kind letters etc. I received such a lovely lot of letters, papers &amp; cards on Saturday. Fred is back in Heliopolis. He came to see me last Thursday, and I'm glad to say he is looking so well. Is busy reorganising his regiment. May be off to the firing line in a few days, so we are making the most of our spare time to be together. I had dinner with him on Friday night at Shepheard's and we had a jolly time, had a lovely motor spin afterwards &amp; returned at 11.30 p.m. I went to "The Kursaal" with George on Friday, we had afternoon tea &amp; then to the matinee performance which begins at 6. p.m. &amp; enjoy it very much. George came round with me to meet Fred, so he will be alright now. George could not stay to have dinner with us because he had to be in camp by 9.30. p.m. Anyhow Fred called to see me last night</p>
