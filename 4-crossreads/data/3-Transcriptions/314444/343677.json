<p>[Continuation of letter from page 396.]<br/>I wonder how much longer the war is going to last. Wonderful where all the money comes from. It can't last very much longer surely.</p>
<p>I have not recieved the parcel yet but am anxiously looking forward for it. My word it will be welcome. I am just longing for something nice to eat. No mistake we have to put up with hardships here. We have had no reinforcements for a long time. I know this when I get back I am going to have a good spell &amp; plenty of good tucker. My word how would one of the good old evenings go now. There would no sandwiches left I can tell you.</p>
<p>Hope you pick some winners at Randwick. Would very much like to be there myself.<br/>How is Bannister getting on. Have not heard from him yet. Get a good few from the girl in the shop. Did you do that message for me Dorothy. Don't forget.<br/>Give my kind regards to all friends &amp; tell them my fingers get to cold to write even if I had the paper.<br/>How is the garden. I hope the chokos are on when I get back. One thing we can have a few bottles, &amp; enjoy them. Even water is cut down at present to quarter rations. Oh well it is all in the game &amp; I will manage to see it through.</p>
<p>Hoping you are all well.<br/>With all my love<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom.</p>
