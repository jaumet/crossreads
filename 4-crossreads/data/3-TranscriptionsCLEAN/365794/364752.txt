  
 Friday 14 December 1917 Another 1/2 day and very enjoyable too.  Went Mouski with S. Leed, bought brass bowl 7/-, 2 runners at 3/6 each, busy scenes and oh such a medly of human beings & donkey carts & vehicles of all descriptions through narrow streets & doubtful looking quarters. Paid Pt. 4 for garry to Liptons, had 4 p.m. tea then - alone - went shopping, etc., back 6.50 p.m. & no convoy duty!! This has been neglected lately but one day is so like another that one never knows how they slip by. Another anniversary of Kath's leaving us has come & gone - 15 years ago - & yet it hurts as much as ever only, thank God! one does not think of it so much or so often as in bygone days.
