<p>14th Nov 1914<br/>My dear sister<br/>Just a short note to let you know I am in the best of health and am having a good trip. Tell Ralph his remarks about troop ships were absolutely true. There is a strict censorship on all correspondence, hence this brief note.<br/>I hope you and Beres are in good health.<br/>Well Lizzie I will ring off with fondest love from<br/>Ken</p>
