  
 Sisters court. Had a great time. Then a Stroll after dinner with my pal again. 
 Charlie's friend Lieut Cutherbertson was here for dinner, he is such a nice kiddie   &  simply loves to come here - he is the little brother, so has a good time with all the Sisters. He also plays tennis rather well. We shall be leaving all these dear boys   &  goodness knows what will become of us. 
 Dorothy sends her love but her market value is a little lowered by a mosquito bite on the end of her nose. Fondest love   &  kisses   &  hope you are all well.    I'm blooming   &  happy . 
 From Yours lovingly Edith
