It is very cold here & wet tonight but hope you will have a fine day, to be able to get out & enjoy the country. I went home yesterday afternoon & Mother & Alice were getting along quite nicely. They had a very quiet day Sunday. Alice has a sore throat but better to-day. I ran home for a little while this afternoon. Went to Melb. first for some black wool for Mother for mittens but Mrs Capp is making her a pair. She & Marion called in to see them Monday night - Annie Thomas was there for tea - To-day Miss Bennett was there, so they are not very lonely. Alice will be writing & telling you all their doings. She told me she had a letter from Lea this a.m. & that you were all enjoying
