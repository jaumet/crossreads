<p>thats its not hard to die, its much harder to live at times.  When I was wounded I heard the shell coming nearer &amp; nearer &amp; made absolutely certain I was going to be killed, in fact it was the greatest surprise to me that I wasn't (it only landed 5 yards off on a road just behind me) &amp; the only thing I kept saying to myself was "now I musn't lose consciousness, I musn't lose touch", in fact I think I was almost disappointed to find myself still alive.  I did not see before me a panorama of all my past, nor did I recall all my sins in that moment (that would have been to big a task for the time) &amp; I had not the slightest fear of death which I was certain was imminent, but it all seemed to be rather an adventure, something to be experienced &ndash; of course my mental attitude towards death was one arising from continual thought &amp; <strike>wonder</strike> speculation as to its nature &ndash; often I have thought, when I've been in a place where a shall might come along any minute, now what will it be like?  Is there really</p>
