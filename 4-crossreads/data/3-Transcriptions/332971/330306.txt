And on the Station to meet me Mr Thompson &amp; my nephew &ndash; I try and not think of tiredness and sit up until 2am talking &ndash; I feel so sorry to curtain my stay with three kind friends when they invited me for the fortnight &ndash; but I feel I must See Scotland and Can't be persuaded.  Mr T takes a holiday from business next day &amp; Takes Rose &amp; I around first to the City Hall &ndash; and beautiful it is too with its sunset marble Halls.  Next to the Museum &amp; Art Gallery &amp; thence to Robinson &amp; Cleavers &ndash; the great Manufacturers of Irish linen &ndash; We are shown over the works &ndash; The other Sisters are there too &ndash; Some of the things are esquisite &ndash; the daintiest of handkerchiefs ranging up to ?10 each.  We are shown a sample pattern of the Royal train that the ladys of Belfast presented to Queen Victoria.</p>
