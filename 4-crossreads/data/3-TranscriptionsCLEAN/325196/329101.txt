  
 up by English & Aust. soldiers into a street, a few shots were fired & 9 of the Egyptian reserves were killed but everything was very quiet tonight. 
 31-1-16 Mon 31st This morning I left Stan just before breakfast, went to the A.V.C. to see Arthur & Bottomly, & then went to Maadi & saw Les Regan. Ted Oates & Mabray & came back to Wardan by the 5 oclock train & heard another version of the demonstration yesterday & a more probable one; it is said that the Egyptian Reserve were called up for the Camel Corps. they paraded before the Sultans Palace making a demonstration, they said they objected to Australian Officers over them & wanted their own officers & they dispersed quietly after the Sultan had spoken to them
