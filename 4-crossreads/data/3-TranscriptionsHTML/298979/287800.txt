<p>back, (excepting of course places like Ginchy which was so churned up with over 12 months shell fire that not a single brick can be now seen on its old site, although perhaps many could be found by digging,) till the village of Fremicourt was reached.</p>
<p>This was to be the base of the 56th Battalion till their turn arrived to do the work of driving the Huns the distance to be allotted by the Staff. The line at this time was about 1&frac12; miles beyond the village of Morchese [Transcriber's note: Morchies] which was about 4 miles in front of the base. Had any doubt been existant in the minds of any of the Battalion it would have been dispelled by an order issued at the stop before reaching Fremicourt, that any one who had anything at all wrong with them should attend sick parade that morning. Amongst these was the Sentry, because when working on the dug outs on the Transloy front he had just before leaving slipped on the ice covered duck boards when turning a sharp corner, at "the double", &amp; fell striking the edge of the boards so heavily that two of his ribs were slightly fractured, &amp; he desired that they should be "strapped" by "Iodine" (the Doctor).</p>
<p>When his turn came to be examined the Doctor angrily asked Why the [dash] did you not report before this!<br/>How could I report to you when I have been working in the line for 3 months during which time I never joined the battalion once &amp; when my ribs were hurt there was not a doctor within 7 miles, to my knowledge?<br/>Oh! You were in the working party! Why did you not come back to Head Quarters?<br/>Because I managed with a little pain at first, to get through my work, &amp; now as an action will soon be on I want you to strap them up!<br/>Oh! said the Doctor quite sharply You can't go to a hospital here!<br/>I'm not asking to go to a Hospital I'm only asking you to make me</p>
