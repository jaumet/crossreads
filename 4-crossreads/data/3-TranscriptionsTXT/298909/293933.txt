2.30 pm - Paraded at 2-30 pm & were dismissed, but still to be readiness to march out.  My old Friend Bill Bedsor came over & dug me out at 3 pm very pleased to see each other - We pushed off to Cairo - Visited Native Bazaar & several other places. Had Tea at a very flash place.  After Tea Bill introduced me to some Gypo Friends. The two girls took us for a drive in their Gari all around Cairo & then to their Home at Helliopolis. They spoke very good English & rather enjoyed the evening. Got into camp rather later than regular time.

Very cold last night - At the 6 am Parade we got orders to stand by & march out at a moments notice.  1.30 pm got marching orders to Report No. 1 Heliopolis Hospital - Only a rumour myself
