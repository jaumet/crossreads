but saw nothing all day
We are in touch with civilization again as at this camp there is a telephone connected line to Matrugh & I have am at present on duty at it (time 8.30 a.m) just learnt that our No 4 Coy has had a small scrap a few miles the other side of Matrugh with one man killed & one officer wounded.
The roads were very bad for the last five mile yesterday - & 2 of our horses were played out, hadn't a pull left in them, so had to hitch on a spare pair of mules from the Middlesex Regt Transport who is along with us They gave us a pull into camp through the thick dust.
Foster gave the 'Tommy' driving
