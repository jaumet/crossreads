<p>on the Town of La Vinte, where the 59th &amp; our artillery are billeted, it is only &frac14; of a mile in front of us. 3 stretcher Bearer squads from each section moved out to the trenches at V C Cutting. A woman in the Village had collar bone broken by anti air guns &amp; came to our Station to be dressed &ndash; Sailly show signs of the Huns unfortunately &ndash; A Great number of the inhabitants are still in the Village at their own risk. We took over operations from the 13th F. Ambulance today, they are due at Ypres &ndash; Had to tear the Cross &amp; Brassard off our arms &ndash; so we have no protection at all. I for one will shoulder a rifle straight away, if the Geneva Convention cannot give better protection. Men are wounded in the trenches here in the morning &amp; at sunset they are on the way to London &ndash; Some very stirring air duels immediately near us &ndash; Immediately our planes get near their lines for observation purposes they open fire &amp; can safely say they fire hundreds of shells at each plane &amp; there are dozens of planes &amp; yet they say the Germans are short of ammunition, most of the shootings is rotten.</p>
