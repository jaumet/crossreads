A Bucks Dance (Plain & Fancy Dress) & a sing song was held in the Recreation Room on Monday the 28th October at 7 p.m. The affair was a great success the room was crowded & every one present enjoyed themselves. The first item on the programme was a Grand March in Fancy Dress, six couples participating. The Unit Orchestra under the baton of Staff Sgt. Bender, rendered excellent music right through the evening. Vocal items were contributed to the programme by a number of chaps from other Units. Eric Herford's item was much appreciated.
Two lectures were given during the week on Tuesday & Friday evenings by Private Kelsey. The subject was an interesting one - The Australian Constitution. There was a good attendance at both meetings.One hundred & fifty tickets were issued to the Unit for the pictures at Rambruelles on Wednesday evening. The programme was good one & was much enjoyed. Driver Saunders of our Unit was the pianist. The personnel conveyed their thanks to Mr Kitson, who was responsible for the evening's amusement.
