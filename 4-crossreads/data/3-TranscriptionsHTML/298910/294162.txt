<p>I've always wished to see the world, I ad no chanst 'before<br/>Nor I don't suppose I should ave, if there and't been no war<br/>I used to read the tourists books, the shipping news also.<br/>An I ad the chance of going, so I couldn't help but go,</p>
<p>We ad a spell in Egypt, first before we moved along,<br/>Across the way to Suvla where we got it &amp; strong<br/>We had no drink when we was dry, no rest when we was tired<br/>But I've seen the pyramids an Spinks which I had oft desired.</p>
<p>I've seen them little islands too, I couldn't say their names<br/>An Towns as white as washing day &amp; mountains spouting flame<br/>I've seen the sun come lonely up on miles &amp; miles o' sea,<br/>Why folks have paid a undred pounds, an seen no more than me.</p>
<p>I always wished to see the world, I'm fond of life &amp; change<br/>But a bullet got me in the leg an this is passin' strange<br/>That when old Englands shore all wrapped in mist &amp; rain'<br/>Why its worth the bundle to be coming home again.</p>
<p>When we recall fond memorys dear<br/>Which cling to us from year to year<br/>Of by gone days, in lands afar,<br/>Those memories sweet how dear they are Remembrance.</p>
