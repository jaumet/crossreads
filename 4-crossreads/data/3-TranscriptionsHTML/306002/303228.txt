<p>14.7.15<br/>Wed. 14th.  While cooking breakfast this morning 120 reinforcements turned up for this regiment, we came up to Popes Hill at 9 oclock &amp; relieved the 2nd L. Horse.  A Sqd. signallers took over the Phone so we had nothing to do but cook decent meals for ourselves.  Went for a swim soon after tea.  A couple of shells fell very handy just as we arrived &amp; just as we were dressed ready to leave a shell whizzed just above our heads &amp; exploded low on a barge from which dozens of men we [were] dressing &amp; undressing on;  one lad had both legs blown off at the knees, another had one foot blown off &amp; all the lower part of his body peppered with pellets.  I believe 5 men were hit altogether, if the shell had had burst higher it would have got more.  Penny put pinchers on some more Indian meal tonight.</p>
