<p>Friday Evening. Pulled into the wharf after all &amp; enjoyed a brief route march through the slums out round the fortifications. (No chance to get any cards or post letters &ndash; the authorities being , for special reasons, specially anxious to limit correspondence. This will be posted in the 'Old Dart' in about four weeks' time so I can tell you that the reason referred to is a proclamation dated 13th Inst &amp; issued in Natal and other parts of S.Africa and also there is an easily understood disinclination on the part of High up to let the world at large know the truth about East Africa. All the way from here we will be one of the lightless ships on Lightless Coast. It will make things rather irksome, but its better to live in blackness than to meet the [indecipherable] whales.)<br/>Cape Town so far as we saw it, is a dirty city with rich surroundings. The docks are very fine, but reek like all the sinful smells of Kiplings wildest dreams.The railways run straight along the streets on the water front just as our trams do. They are not very up to date railways. I saw several engines that looked more like 'Foden' tractors than locomotives. One thing we saw that deserves record &ndash; the Evelasting Silver Leaves of Table Mountain. I'm sending you one &ndash; having (at great risk!) secured three specimens. It's the most beautiful leaf growing &amp; actually everlasting if properly dried.</p>

<p>PS. Dont say I cant write letters &ndash; 6000 words in this one.</p>
