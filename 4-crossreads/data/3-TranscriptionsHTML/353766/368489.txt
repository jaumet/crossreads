<p>straight for us with phosphorous wake is thot. to be a torpedo! Guns closed up. A Turret's crew "Stand by". But the next order "Fire" doesn't come. Moon rising shows us no worse foe than a bank of clouds. We all laugh &amp; go to bed. Hizem chased some clouds this morning. Weather lovely. We all lie full length on F'cstle looking up into the stars.<br/>Dec 10 During the night news comes of smashing of the G. Fleet, by Admiral Sturdee's squadron off Falkland Is. Alas! For the frailty of human judgements. I believe Jap. Admiral was convinced that the G's were within 200 miles of us, &amp; we were in the 1st degree of vigilance. We feel that that victory belongs rightfully to us, &amp; that we have been robbed of<strike>f</strike> it. We drove them out of the Pacific, &amp; in the vast stretch of waters we guarded, the G's did no harm. Ours is only a small affair, but it has cost some 3500 lives, friend &amp; foe to straighten it out. Everybody listless &amp; fed up as a result.</p>
