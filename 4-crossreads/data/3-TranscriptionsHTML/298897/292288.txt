<p>I know you will already have made up your minds on the subject, and all such I earnestly beg to do what is in their power to look after their comrades, who may not have the same strength of mind as they have.</p>
<p>Remember that a few black sheep can give a bad name to a whole flock, so let there be none such among us &amp; let us make up our minds that the Australian &amp; New Zealand Forces are going to prove themselves second to none in the way of discipline, as they have already done where sheer hard fighting was concerned.  See to this boys!  You know you are capable of it, if you will only determine that it shall be so, and if you will do this, you will be able to return to Australia &amp; New Zealand after peace &amp; victory with an unsullied reputation, which will go down for all time in your home.</p>
<p>Signed W.R. Birdwood Lt. General.<br/>Earl Kitcheners message.<br/>You are ordered abroad as a soldier of the King to help our French comrades against the invasion of a common enemy.  You have to perform a task which will need your courage, your energy, your patience.  Remember that the honour of the British Army depends on your individual conduct.</p>
