<p>for Calais, Dunkirk &amp; Watten, at 7-45 am where the Train terminated &amp; I had to wait until 8.30 for the Calais Dunkirk Passenger Train, so after having a drink at an Estaminet &amp; a chat with the R.T.O. Staff I left Boubourg on time passing through Loon Plage, Pettite Scynthe Goodekirk which is the Junction of the Calais &amp; Hazebruick lines &amp; passing through the Iron Gates which is known as the Ramparts, these Ramparts are a large Wall &amp; Gates &amp; are built around Dunkirk for Defence purposes, the Country between St Omer &amp; Dunkirk is all under Cultivation &amp; looks very pretty, the Peasants working everywhere &amp; are very busy, there is plots of Wheat, Barley, Oats, Potatoes, Beans, Peas, Sugar Beet &amp; lots of other Vegetables everywhere, a drop of Rain would be welcome as the ground is fairly dry &amp; watering by hand is carried on everywhere. The Train arrived in Dunkirk at 9. am, I then showed my Pass &amp; out into the Town, which is fairly busy, but nothing to what is was when I was last there, After passing over a Canal Bridge I walked up a narrow street</p>
