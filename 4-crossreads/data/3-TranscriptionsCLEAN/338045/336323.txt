  
 equipment & kits eventually find the 4th Div. Base Camp, our objective, allotted tents & afterwards blankets, then look around at 11 a.m. for some tea & breakfast.  No drills or parades to-day & wait for instructions.  A fine Sergeants' mess here, which costs me 2 francs admittance & 4 francs per week.  Have a good lunch & dinner & at 8 p.m. tired out, through walking round in the sand, turn in to a sandy bed.  A cold miserable day, blowing hard, a biting wind, which blows the sand, on which the camp is built, into everything.  First night under canvas for some time but sleep well.
