<p>had to stay till her lop-sidedness was righted. After a <strike>stretch</strike> while we were told that we would have to wait till the afternoon we went ashore again and spent the day around the Port.</p>
<p>At last we pulled out and after what seemed an interminable time landed at Port Melbourne early on the morning of the 19th July &ndash; Peace Day &amp; the Anniversary of our Division's baptism of fire at Fleurbaix. Troops other than Victorians got into the trains and at about 2 pm we started for Sydney &ndash; and civvy life.</p>
<p>Thanks to the multiple jobs I had filled while on board the trip had seemed very short &amp; peaceful so I had not been worried by anxieties as to loss of speed etc.</p>
<p>The train journey was remarkably well organised &amp; comfortable. Everywhere on route were we given a welcome home. They were most welcome to us on the whole, but at Yass, at about 3 am we were nearly all sound asleep so the brass band &amp; fireworks were not as well</p>
