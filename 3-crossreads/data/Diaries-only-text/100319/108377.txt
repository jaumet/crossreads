26/9/18 Cappy
Early reveille and marched to Herlieville where we did a practice with tanks. A fine day, keen air and an enjoyable march. The tanks were lined up on our old battle ground and the troops followed them. Noticed in their wake several horribly decayed and rotten German bodies. It says something for the callousness we have when corpses can lie on a training ground that has been used by the troops of two Divisions. On our way back we called in saw the big German gun near Chuignes. Salvaged a big Hun minnie. After mess received warning order for a move forward tomorrow and that Thewlis Fulton have M.C.s and Jack has a Bar to his M.C.
