Sat by brazier yarning until late in afternoon. No prospect of getting off until sea much abated and new boats arrive. They seem to be pulling a lot of troops out of the peninsular for Mudros Two French divisions from Helles sent to Alexandria and fresh English troops arriving probably for Servia. 
This camp is shockingly mismanaged and everything seems upside down right throughout the whole island. Ordnance and the Canteen seem to offer a very fine field for waste and loss of money. All because England doesn't get these things organized in peace and have a trained army so every man can get to his post and carry on with work he is acquainted with instead of the present mixup where a solicitor's clerk does his best as a canteen sergeant while the manager of a big grocery firm is perhaps pioneer sergeant
The temperature last night fell to 11 deg below freezing point. Boisterous night but nothing like as bad as last night. Turned in at 2100 still in tent of O.C. Greek Labour Corps (Lieut Hannan Notts Derby) and with four blankets and 2 overcoats slept warm and well except for dysentery. Froze hard during the night the water in mugs going solid and elsewhere over half an inch thick
