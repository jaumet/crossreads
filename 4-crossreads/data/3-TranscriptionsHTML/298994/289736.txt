<p>now (25/9/18)</p>
<p>On the evening of the 26/3/18 our old friend the cruiser said goodbye to us for ever. She was moving fairly slow, about 400 yards from us now. After great cheering being exchanged the band on board the cruiser played "Auld Lang Syne" and turned in a new direction, leaving all alone on the wide wide ocean.</p>
<p>We are still making our way towards Capetown. One of the sailors on board died last night (1/10/18). We buried the poor chap today. A lonely burial!</p>
<p>Albatrosses are still our close friends. Their graceful flying is simply marvellous. The sea was very choppy today.</p>
<p>About 7.30 this morning, Oct 12th 1918 land appeared about 10 miles away In a couple of hour's time, we were sailing into Capetown, after 26 days at sea. We were destined for disappointment, no leave being granted! The influenza epidemic had proved disastrous to the people here.</p>
