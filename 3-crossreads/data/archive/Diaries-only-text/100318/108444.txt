Edinburgh
Our next point of interest was the now familiar Forth bridge which being high arched on the cantilever principle is a very imposing sight. The fleet was lying ranged in lines above and below the bridge and some U.S.A. ships with their latticed masts were conspicuous. Electric signal lamps blinked conspicuously from the mastheads of some of them. Hereabouts a fair crowd of naval officers gay in gold lace and buttons joined our train and the remainder of the journey was without event. We cabbed to 27 Abercromby Place and just in time for afternoon tea and had pleasant tete-a-tete. The Colonel and I after dinner lingered over the walnuts wine and it was late when we turned in.
