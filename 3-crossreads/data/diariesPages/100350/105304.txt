10th Turks made an attack at daybreak along our front, but were repulsed, we lost many men. We were relieved at 6 A.M. by A and D Coy,s were only out of the trenches about an hour when we were hurried back again, as Turks were massing on our left in large numbers. The Wilts Regt on our left command approaches to Water Wells. About midday things got very lively on our right which is held by K.O.S.B Regt, supported by 15th Battln. The boys are properly worn out with fatigue. Water very scarce, what little one did get was like mud, Pitifull sights to see around the water holes in the "Dere" were scores of soldiers hang around almost famished.
Our cruisers open fire on Turkish reinforcements on "Hill 971 and smash them up properly. The slopes covered with dead and wounded.
11th. Everybody very weary. 13th Battln ranks very thin. We are haveing few hours out of Firing line will now have a sleep. Woke after 5 hours sound sleep feeling very refreshed. A wash quite out of the question, so walk about covered with dust as usual. Drinking water hard to procure (Oh, to be among good water again.) The Battle still going strong on 971 and the "Chocolate Hills. The Turks go for the "Imperial Troops like one thing. They are mostly lads of the new army and are brand new at roughing it, but will soon be broken in. We go into fireing line at 9P.M relieving A and D Company. Capt. Salier in command of B. and C. Coys with Lieuts Brierly and Boccard.
