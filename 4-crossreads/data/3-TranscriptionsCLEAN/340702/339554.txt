  
 plenty of Bombs dropping just now. Between anti aircraft    &    Machine Guns & Bombs there is an awfull clatter. 
 Friday 12/4 Sure enough although we put all lights out a Big Gotha dropped 4 Bombs rather close to us. That settled it we had to go to bed in the dark which earned much bad language ( by the way our beds were duckboards) there are rows after rows of trenches from here up to the line and extending back up to about Amiens and a few miles behind it. Fritzs aeroplanes are over us in ones & twos practically all the time which does'nt look like as if we have the air supremacy which we claim. There are actually 4 in a bunch right over me now. We're winning alright. One of the cheeky planes mentioned above has just come a glorious "Gutser". He was shot down by one of our own and landed about 21/2 miles away. I started to walk over but it was too far. 
 Saturday 13/4  We left Steenwerck dump on Wednesday. It was captured by the Germans the following Wednesday just 7 days later. 
 Sunday 14/4  Working at La Motte yesterday.  There is a French armored train here The Camouflaging on it was very perfect. The 6th Company U.S.A. Engineers is working here also some 5th Divvy Engrs. 
 Monday 15/4  The last 2 days & nights have been very stormy windy & cold, but we like stormy nights
