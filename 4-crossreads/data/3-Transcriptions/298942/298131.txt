<p>hot piece of close fighting when the Germans first captured Meteren.</p>
<p>At a time when I was on my way back from Harve to the line, the division arrived back from the Somme via St Pol to Hazebrouck.  It was bombed at Amiens, bombed at St Pol, shelled at Hazebrouck where it detrained, &amp; then sent straight into the line. It went in one night on the Strazeele Nieppe front line, in open order.  Shortly they advanced meeting groups of wounded</p>
