These are memorable days.  Enemy prisoners arrive continuously, and we are able to collect many souvenirs.
Remain here for about ten days and then move to the ruined village
VILLERS BRETTONEUX.
We arrive here about the middle of August ' 18.  There are a few houses - a very few - which have escaped ruination, only one or two buildings which remain untouched, but they may yet go, as "he" is still sending a good many over.  We take up our position in a house which has been partially destroyed, and make ourselves reasonably comfortable therein.
While making the place habitable a shell bursts just outside the back door, killing one and severely wounded another of our fellows.  I was knocked silly by the same shell, but there was no grievous bodily harm inflicted on me, although the shock was a bit paralizing for a time.  This was the last shell that arrived in Villers Brettoneux.  With this last shell went also "his" last hope of ever getting to Amiens.  He realised this fact, or should have done so in the previous April, but he must at the same time have realised that so much depended on his getting through to Amiens, that "he" was very loth [loath?] to give us the chance of securing so great a prize.  However the fact remains that this was his last shell into the place which had caused him so much hope and such great despair, and this shell very nearly "got" me.
I walked over the old battlefield, through the old trenches, and came across the bodies of some of my old comrades, hidden in the long grass.  There was a kind of mist over the whole place, like a fog, but it was no fog, it was the mist of death, the smell was beyond description, caused by the bodies yet unburied and the fumes from the dugouts which also contained the bodies of the slain.
I shall never forget those evening strolls in the "field" round Villers Brettoneux.  I wonder how many are aware of the significance of the victory here.  Very few no doubt.  No! very few after all cared how or by whom
