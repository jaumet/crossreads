 Signal ? Gilbert Frankau The hot wax drip from the flare On the scrawl pink form that litter The bench where he sit : the glitter Of star is frame by the sandbag atop of the dugout stair And the lag watch hand creep And his cloak mate murmur in sleep ? Form he can wake with a dick ? And he hear as he play with the pressel switch , the strap receiv click , On his ear that listen , listen , And the candle-flick glisten On the round brass of the switchboard , where the red wire cluster thick . Wire from the earth , from the air ; Wire that whisper and chatter At night when the trench-rat patter And nibbl among the ration , and scatter back to their lair ; Wire that are never at rest , For the linesmen tap them and test , And ever they trembl with tone .
