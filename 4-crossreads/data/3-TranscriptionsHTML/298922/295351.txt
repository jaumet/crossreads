<p>Thursday 25 January 1917</p>
<p>Moved out to <strike>El Burj</strike> &amp; took over Command of B Squadron the old Squadron I had on the Peninsular <strike>as the late Major has been sent back for a mistake he made.</strike></p>
<p>[The remainder of the page crossed through]  I am in Order as a Tempy. MAJOR at last, so am not keen to go to Col. Meredith now.</p>
<p>However we will see, but I'll wear a Crown while I'm here any way. Received letter from home &ndash; Wife &amp; Mrs. Ferran also Papers.</p>
<p>Don't put much in Papers about my majority till I tell you it is in Orders, it takes time to come back from the Base.</p>
