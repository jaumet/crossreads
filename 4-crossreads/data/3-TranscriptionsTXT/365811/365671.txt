Here the Fords are the cars. The amount of work capable drivers can get out of them is extraordinary & they'll go where another machine would never have a chance. I dont think anyone over here will have a bad word for them after this show. The Ambulances are no good - body is too heavy but the touring & box fords are it
I was very pleased to know that Keith is looking well & improving. I should think time is the main factor & I hope to hear of his good progress. It will be a long business I expect but he is alive & he's home. My mother tells me she was going to Sydney about Christmas time & I am hoping she went out to see you - I know she intended to if you were in Sydney.
I have not yet received any of the Current History's but will be really glad of them when they do come - good reading matter is scarce. I have not heard from Caesar or W.P.M. for ages but now & again see their name in orders. I too hope both came through the last show alright & that Caesar has got his Battn.
My very kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson & yourself
Yours very sincerelyR.J. Hunter
