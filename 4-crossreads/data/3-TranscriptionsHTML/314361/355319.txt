<p>the miniature shooting.<br/>Last two I &amp; two friends went to a picture show in Cairo. The pictures here start at 6 pm &amp; finish up about 8. The pictures were very fine mostly French productions. The operating is good. The charges are 3 Pts &amp; 5 Pts. The hall we went to, was very pretty inside though not a very large place. The seats like all seats in Egypt have straight backs.<br/>Saturday 15th 16<br/>Last night I paid up for the second month at the Burlitz school. Am getting on well.<br/>Yesterday I got a letter from Lou, &amp; sent one to her last night.<br/>Sunday 16th 16<br/>Yesterday afternoon I went over to Matarich to see the Virgins Well. It is a very old fashioned looking place. This is said to be the well where the Virgin Mary drank on the flight to Egypt from Jerusalem. <strike>Ac</strike> The well before was salty, but turned into fresh water when Mary drank. This we got from the guide. He also told us that all the water round this place was brackish the well being alone</p>
