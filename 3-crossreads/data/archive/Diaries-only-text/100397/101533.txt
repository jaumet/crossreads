[Letterhead of Y.M.C.A.]
On Active Service
With the British Expeditionary Force
S.A. has done a very great deal to help the forces and they have followed us wherever it was possible. I guess that there are hundreds of men today who have learned to appreciate the Army "S.A." I mean and have given up judging and condemning them as they were in the habit of doing before the war started. I myself think that they do more good from a practical point of view than many of the other Institutions. But still I dont advise you to join the Ranks on that account. I have not heard from Harry for some time but that is not to be wondered at. we have been so much on the move that letters might take some days to reach us after
