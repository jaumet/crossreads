<p>16-2-16<br/>here when H.Q. move; This morning we saw a jackal from the camp amongst the tombs, also a fox; All men who are not of fatigue work here during the morning put in their time digging trenches on the ridge just above the camp; This morning a horseman was seen to ride in close enough to observe that a party of men were trench digging he must have also seen the guard on the well &amp; then turned &amp; rode off into the desert again; he is a mystery but must have been an enemy scout .The Mayor of the village presented us with 2 steers &amp; two sheep, also some native bread &amp; some eggs today, the bread is not up to much but better than biscuits it is made of native meal. This afternoon I went out with the troops on patrol &amp; went 3 or 4 miles into the desert, &amp; saw nothing but jackal tracks. Reid is on duty at the well tonight</p>
