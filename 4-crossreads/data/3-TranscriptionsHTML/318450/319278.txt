<p>called Camp's Bay, you go over hills and down dales, round the sides of the mountains before getting to your destination.</p>
<p>The trip back was a different direction and was not quite as mountainious but was just as pretty as far as scenery went.  The population of this place, to me seemed mostly dark, of course you could not class them as black as their skin just showed the streak, but never the less they were good to the boy's.</p>
<p>This place I may say is a pretty place as they have a range of mountains runing just behind the town, and with the red tiled houses showing against the black background made it show out a lot.</p>
