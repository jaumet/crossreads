<p>Got leave and went into Melbourne for a final visit.  We went to see the comedy "The Girl in the Taxi" and enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>Dec 6th Sat.</p>
<p>Early this moring the P.O. came down to our sleeping quarters and found a large number of the men in hammocks after Reveilie" had sounded, half an hour previously.</p>
<p>He went upstairs in a rage and ordered the bugler to sound the "fall In".  The result was a large number failed to put in an appearance. Those who turned up were taken out for a march.  Those who did not turn up were paraded before the O.G. and given a word of comfort.</p>
<p>Some of them discovered that they were put on extra picket, later, and put it down as a punishment for being late.  After dinner we paraded in full dress.  Marched to the Royal Park and treated to drinks by the Officers.  Got back to the ship about 5 o'clock and found a large number of people waiting to see the ship go out.</p>
<p>Moved off from the wharf at a quarter past six. The send off was partially spoilt owing to the people being kept off the wharf.</p>
