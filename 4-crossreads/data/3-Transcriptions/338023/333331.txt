<p>particularly we enjoyed the final biv. in a pine wood &ndash; from 8 pm to 2 am. These pine woods are some places wherein to sleep during the fine weather. Your oil sheet keeps the damp down &ndash; the thick branches keep it up &ndash; and, if  you're lucky enough to have the sort of blanket that will overlap N, E, S &amp; W, you may keep out the bulk of the earwigs, spiders etc that flock to the attack. It is wonderful how so many insects can live in such a small island. The earwigs are common as flies in Egypt, spiders are more like an element &ndash; a sort of secondary atmosphere &ndash; and midgets at times would hide the sun if it weren't for the clouds.</p>
<p>The summer having been most unusually fine &amp; warm there is a great show of flowers everywhere &ndash; mostly wild varieties</p>
