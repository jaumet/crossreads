 Extract from letter from above named firm dated 10/4/1919. 
 &nbsp; 
 &quot;Captain Peters came to my business to gain touch with 
 &quot;the London end of the business.&nbsp; (I am an Agent and 
 &quot;Buyer for Melville &amp; Mullens, his principals in Australia) 
 &quot;to visit the trade houses and investigate the latest 
 &quot;English methods in the trade and future tendencies and 
 &quot;intentions. 
 &nbsp; 
 &quot;All this he has done and I am quite satisfied that his 
 &quot;time has been fully and advantageously used.&quot;
