6th Had a good nights rest. Great Artillery duel on this morning Warships takeing part, a great din. There appears to be great activity out towards Suvla Bay. We are having beautiful weather this last few days. But "Oh the Flies" Flies" they are nearly maddening. Great wonder is that there has not been more cases of serious illness among our Troops. I took another Patrol out towards enemy trenches about 7.30P.M and returned at midnight nothing of a sensational character took place. Pretty risky job.
7.) Usual artillery activity goes on this morning, doing more or less damage ion either side. Some of our Battleships using their big 12 inch Guns, there is an awful thud when they fire. B. C. Coy came out of trenches at 4P.M. being relieved by A. D. Coys. Things very quiet all night.
8. Artillery haveing another great Box-on this morning. Our boys out again on fatigue work, majority of men very weak. Out on Patrol work again to night with a party of 12 men also Major Johnson of the Essex Regt Lt Gardiner of our own Coy, after doing the usual creeping about among the bushes like youngsters playing hide seek, we returned to fireing line at 11P.M.
