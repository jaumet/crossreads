After dinner Len McKeown, Frank I went had some dinner, after we went down to the jewellers in the Boulevard de Sebastopol got my watch which was being repaired, from here we all went to the Casino de Paris to book seats for I wanted them to see this performance at all costs, when we got there, there was a frightful crush all on the same job booking seats.
As we were leaving here it started to snow lightly when I left Paris that same night it was snowing heavily quite 4 inches were laying on the ground. I would have liked to have stopped that night for it would have been very pretty next day but my leave was up I had had a splendid time so I thought it best to get back not spoil things, so at 7.20 that night I said goodbye to gay Paree the finest holiday I have ever had the biggest eyeopener of my life, I will never regret as long as I live the money I spent here for I had the full worth of it many times over.
