Wednesday 10 May 1916A beautifully bright clear day, the camp consequently being a busy scene with men drying clothes &c. Up at reveille & going hard during the day fixing up company matters with the exception of 3/4 of an hour taken up at the dentist's. A block in the railway traffic occurred in the early morning & it was very astonishing to see how the trains backed up.
