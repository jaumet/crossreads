<p>supper, two Eggs &amp; Bread &amp; Butter &amp; Coffee for 1 Franc which was fairly reasonable considering the times, on coming along the road back to Camp we saw Fritz having a lively time from the Air Craft Guns he was making for the town but was driven off, shots flying around him everywhere he turned &amp; made off up towards our Camp, still being chased by our Guns when it got too hot for him, he turned off &amp; made for his own lines, we arrived back at Camp where everything was quite &amp; turned in. Tuesday 26th/6/17.  Fritz awoke us up at 3 am with his usual visit but although he dropped several  Bombs near by he did no damage, Fritz with his big Gun was quiet all day I signed on at 8 Pm to take up Amunition for the Guns, we left here at 9.30 Pm for Pottonhook Siding &amp; after a quiet run we arrived there at 10.15 Pm after picking up a Construction Gang in case the line is blown up. We remained at the Amunition Dump while the Boys unloaded the trucks, as the Shells were unloaded &amp; stacked they were covered over the leaves</p>
