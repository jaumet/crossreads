<p>Sunday fine though Cloudy, Rottnet Island sighted about 9AM we arrived off Fremantle about 1PM &amp; hung about outside till 2.30PM. Fremantle is a small harbour made by breakwaters, it is very narrow. We drew in to the wharf &amp; we were given a fair reception by the people from the shore. A band played tunes on the wharf. Red Cross Ladies came on board with papers &amp; eatables &amp; goods were sent for our Xmas dinner. We had a nice large piece of sandwich for tea</p>
