Had a 9 course dinner today went right through the menu (cost 8 francs) then I felt hungry they dish up such small paltry dishes under all sorts of false names 
9th Did not get up till 9 oclock this morning had a lovely bed I was very tired last night, another chap I went for a stroll round some of the little side streets, in one little caf we struck we had a bit of fun with some girls, there were all sorts French Belgian Spaniard Italians etc they were hard cases you can bet, we stopped there drinking coffee sweet wine till dinner time then we came back to our hotel had a good dinner, here we picked Frank Forder up he had followed me down after dinner we all went up to see if we could get a seat at the Comique Opera a magnificent theatre,
