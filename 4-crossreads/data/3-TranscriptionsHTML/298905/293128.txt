<p>to go to the stretcher bearer's he is going from there to the A.M.C.<br/>The weather is still keeping ideal.<br/>22nd  We played the return match yesterday evening &amp; this time No. 10 turned the Tables &amp; beat us by 5 run's. To-night another chap &amp; myself took up a collection for a cricket set for our platoon we got enough money easily. Last night Len &amp; Holme's were up again &amp; after the match we had a rubber or so of bridge. This morning on parade they called for volunteers for a raiding party, &amp; nearly half the platoon stepped out, but strange to say they would not take old Anzac" men, we were disappointed but nothing could be done for it</p>
