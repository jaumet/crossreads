<p>Dear May<br/> I received your and Beatric very welcome letter yesterday and was very pleased to hear form you and I was very much surprised at the nice long letter you write. I feel real ashamed to think I can't write more but of course we don't get much news over here and of course censorship prohibits telling war news. Well I must thank you for your very kind wish regarding my stripes well I'm pleased to say that I have got three now and if all goes well in the near future I hope to have the pleasure of pulling them down and gaining a commission and that will be tres bon wouldn't it.<br/>I have read in the Hay paper of the grand reception they gave W. Jackson V.C. it must have been very nice I'm sure and the money would be very useful to him with his arm off poor lad. When you write again don't forget to let me know what lot your</p>
