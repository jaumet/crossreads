<p>Oct 21st :-<br/>Unusual outbreak of Mumps  Precautions taken to prevent spreading   We are turned out of Top Hospital to make room for them  &amp;  have to sleep on deck. Our kits &amp; equipment taken to different parts of the ship. Everything is topsy-turvy  &amp; we can get at nothing conveniently. Have at last one fine night on deck &amp; enjoy sleep.</p>
<p>Oct 22nd:-<br/>No home &amp;  nowhere to sleep. However I am busy in Dispensary    &amp;  relieved of floor washing. Very hot day but cooler night. Boxing concluding bouts of tournament. Our most miserable night. After being deluged with rain about 2 am we have no retreat &amp; get practically wet through. Continuous rain until reveille 6 am. Very little sleep.</p>
<p>Oct 23rd &ndash;<br/>Very hot &amp;  wonderfully calm</p>
