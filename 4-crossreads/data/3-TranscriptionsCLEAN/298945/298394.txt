  
 From here we reached the top of the hill, saw Sailly le Sec, & Corbie church distinctly through glasses, & made a short cut across an erstwhile no-man's land which had suffered a barrage, to the Corby-Bray main road. Then we went along the road towards Corbie, passed a couple of chimney stacks that had suffered three direct hits between them & still stood, until we reached a clump of trees behind which Roy informed us much might be seen. 
 It certainly was a wonderful view. We had left the Somme in the valley from which we had climbed; the main road ran along the top of the hill, & from this clump of trees we looked down the opposite side to the Ancre River.
