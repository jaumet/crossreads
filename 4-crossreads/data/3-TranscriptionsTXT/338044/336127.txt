 4th Dec. Saturday &amp;  we have the afternoon off. I determine to visit the Citadel    &amp;  wend my way there, per tram about 2 pm. Arrived outside the walls I first enter the ancient  &amp; large mosque of Sultan Hassan. On the walls are still visible the holes &amp; even cannon balls where Napoleon bombarded the Mosque &amp; city. this mosque is over 600 years old    &amp;  is considered very sacred. Its dome is the highest in Egypt. Cost over  &pound;3,000,000 to build. One huge door inlaid with 22 ct cold &amp; copper  is valued at  &pound;17,000. Sultan Hassan's tomb rests in the inner temple, where is also a red flag stone marking the spot, on which he slew the Mameluk. We noted the huge Koran book &amp; cupboard, the Coronation chair (ancient) &amp; Sultans pulpit
