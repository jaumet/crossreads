A march of 2 &frac12; miles from Sutton Warminster brought us to Sutton Veny Camp where all we soon installed. Met General Robertson after lunch and again at 3 p.m. when he arrived with General Rosenthal who gave an address to the quota. Spent the remainder of the afternoon in the Camp. Dined. Early to bed.
18/5/19Batman Scotty Watson is not satisfactory and was late this morning. Afternoon went up to No. 1 A.G.H and passed the afternoon with the sisters finishing with a stroll in the woods of the Marquis of Bath. Very lovely shades of green as usual. Being Sunday the camp was more quiet than ever.
