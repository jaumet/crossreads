 Sun. May 20   Snowy &amp; I shared a double Room.  After a wash &amp; Brush up, we went for a stroll around the City.  It was glorious to know that we were free, &amp; we wandered around till about midnight.  Then it commenced to thunder &amp; lighten &amp; the Rain poured down.  This made us think about Bed, but we found that it was too late to get a Bus or Taxi, &amp; just had to dodge back from from doorway to another.  It was in the early hours of the morning that we arrived back at our Hotel.  We soon turned in between the sheets &amp; were asleep in no time. 
 Monday May 21  Woke up by a bang on the door &amp; a voice informing us that it was "9 oclock"  We hopped out of Bed &amp; opened the Door.  The Girl asked us if we'd like Break in Bed.  Of course we jumped at it.  Went back to Bed &amp; had Bacon &amp; Eggs &amp; Coffee.  Then we had a Bath.  Got dressed &amp; went out.  London is some Town alright.  After wandering around for a couple of hours we went into a Place &amp; had Lunch.  After Lunch I went to a Tailor &amp; got him to alter my tunic.  A girl from Paddington was working in the shop, &amp; she had a great yarn with "Snowy" Atherton  Returned to Shaftsbury &amp; had wash &amp; "brush up" After Tea sat gazing out of window for a time. Then we went to Palace Theatre &amp; saw Vanity Fair.  A jolly fine Show.  Nelson Keys, funny as a Circus.
