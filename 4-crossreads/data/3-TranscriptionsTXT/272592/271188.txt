little Belgian town waiting for deliverance from the German yoke
2nd.   8 hour day in Australia &amp; I can picture the crowds going to the races &amp; etc in our "Sunny land of the South while here we are cooped up in our muddy &amp; cold trenches &amp; rain is falling falling as if it means to flood us out, but never mind its not going to last for ever &amp; theres a "silver lining to every cloud"
We got 32 reinforcements for the Coy. last night, &amp; 3 of them were hit on the way to the trenches, for they were unlucky for a machine gun fight was in progress as they were coming up its a wonder more of them were not killed for they rake the tracks they have to come up
