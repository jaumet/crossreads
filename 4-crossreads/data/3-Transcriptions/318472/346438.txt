<p>1 August 1918<br/>Thursday<br/>Nothing exciting to mark the incoming of the new month. Sighted a Spanish boat coming from Sierra Leone. Thousands of Flying Fish to be seen &ndash; some of them of very brilliant colors. Weather very hot. Making a good voyage.</p>
<p>1918 August 2<br/>Friday<br/>An uneventful day. Very hot &amp; sultry. A boat coming apparently from Sierra Leone passed close by. About the only thing of interest is to watch the Flying fish of which there are thousands here about.</p>
