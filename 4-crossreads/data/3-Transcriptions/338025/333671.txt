<p>Thursday 26th April 1917</p>
<p>Bapaume<br/>Left camp about 9.30am and went up to Death Trap Gully (near Vaux) to one of the Battery's for a load of empty shell cases and brought them back to the forward dump. Gully very quiet. Arrived back about 3pm.<br/>In coming home I met one of my old ship mates (Jack Taylor) who left Glasgow the same time as myself, in1910, but lost the run of him in Melb. 2 years ago.</p>
