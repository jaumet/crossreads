<p>khaki.&nbsp; It seems like a lifetime! - it seems but yesterday!&nbsp; All men who are to disembark this day are wildly excited and we can but look on with envy, and of course a great amount of joy.&nbsp; After we are cleared by Customs &amp; Health Officers we put into the Outer Harbour of Adelaide.&nbsp; A letter from Mrs Bice is brought to me, but unfortunately I am unable to comply with what it contains.</p>
<p>A cheer goes up as</p>
