Snow fell at Bethlehem<br/>Allanson is here still doing despatch carrying he is a good soldier.<br/>We do not anticipate any fighting for a couple of months, too wet for transport, by that time the war may be over.  Absolutely soaked to skin, no bivouacs &amp; no blankets or food tonight as all transport is hung up in the Black Soil-</p>
