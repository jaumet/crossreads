Concerts 3 times a week are now the order, a piano having arrived from Australia. Am now by myself the dentist being in Hospital with the usual fever, temperature etc. The Doctors are of the opinion that only inoculation saves us from serious complications with these attacks. One night we had a heavy storm of rain but there was practically no damage done bar a few broken guys. Camp now better managed &amp; worked, we having 120 extra men Infantry, light duty men, who have cleaned up &amp; formed pathways etc. Latrine accommodated has also been much improved but very late in the day, we having been here now 5 months almost.
