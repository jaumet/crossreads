<p>all day unloading lorries &amp; getting cases up stairs.  There is more room here than in Alexandria &amp; the mess &amp; quarters are much more comfortable.  The hours of toil have been altered from 8.30 to 1, &amp; from 5 to 7.30. with the afternoons free for sport.<br/>Work has increased a great deal  Casualties have been coming in freely &amp; we have also had to prepare copies of nominal rolls so have had to work extra hours for fortnight or more.  I have visited several of my friends.  Called on Mrs Warner &amp; Mrs Rice &amp; have also been out to Briggs several times.  The first 2 or 3 Sundays we had off, but now we have to work on Sunday mornings, which none of us like a bit.  However it gives us a chance to deal with our private letters.<br/>I go out to the 14th AGH a good deal as quite  number of 6th LH boys are in there wounded &amp; sick  &amp; I got full accounts of all the recent fighting.</p>
