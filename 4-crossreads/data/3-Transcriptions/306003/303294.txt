<p>20.3.16<br/>Mon 20th<br/>This morning we had no trouble to get on with Tukh-El-Khail &amp; lucky we did so, as the 'phone was out of order this morning &amp; we received a couple of messages which I brought into camp at dinner time;  15 reinforcements for this Sqd arrived this morning.  Colin Cameron &amp; Peters amongst them</p>
<p>I left my tunic at Tukh-El-Khail yesterday &amp; made arrangements with Leask to have it sent on for me   my diary, also photos &amp; pen are in it;  The natives are getting a nuisance &amp; while I was away today one helped himself to the water bottle, another started to smoke my pipe.  so Reidy gave them moving orders with the bayonet behind them to put life into them</p>
