You will be wondering what next will become of me, I am wondering that now.  Maybe when allowed to leave here I will be sent to our base and then back to my unit, but where that may be God only knows.
As my movements have been so weird since leaving the first camp in the East I cannot expect to get your letters.  I am keeping cheerful expecting someday to receive a great bundle of them.  Only three in 6 or 7 months is not enough, when I know you and mother write every week.
Do not be fearsome of the dreadful that I mention when writing of the front, for I can keep no notes and must make some records in this way, besides I prefer that you should know in some measure what my surroundings are
Before showing mother this letter I ask Grace if such would be right or not. Myself I think mother would understand me quite well
Dearest love to allGeoff
