<p>Thinkest thou there are no serpents in the world<br/>But those that glide along the grassy sod<br/>And sting the luckless foot that presses them?<br/>There are those in the path of social life<br/>Do bask their spotted skins in fortune's sun<br/>And slay the soul.</p>
<p>I see thou has't pass'd sentence on my heart<br/>And I'll no longer weep nor plead against it<br/>But with the humblest most obedient patience<br/>Meet thy dear hands, and kiss them when they wound me.</p>
