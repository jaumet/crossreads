Sunday . 21/7/19 Got up and feel weak but it was good to go out on deck and see the mile of blue sparkl Equatori sea . The Atlantic run in long roller and though the sea was calm and no white hors yet one could see the steadi underlay breaker come along . It was dark at 6 pm and then Padr Fox gave a lectur on the South Sea Island . A dark cool night with bright star . No doubt the Southern Cross is on view but I could not find it .
