 Dear Father Have just received another Aust mail & as usual I have received a fair share. Had a letter from Louie saying Uncle Will Brewster had died. Oh well it is for the best I suppose it wasent much comfort to see him gradually getting worse. Louie said the end came very suddenly that was a good thing. Aunt Florrie will be very upset that is only to be expected. I haven't written her as there isent anything one can say that would relieve her & it takes such a time for a letter to get across it would only be adding to her trouble. I also received a letter from a Mrs Belchambers saying she had called on you & left a photo with you for me. One of Ted Belchambers photoes. I am glad she dident send it across here as I may not have reached me or I should have lost it now it will be there when I get back.

The Arch Bishops address was in French
