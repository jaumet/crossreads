As we came into Codford from Southampton we could see the "Rising Sun" quite plan from the Train and little did we think that our Camp laid at the foot of it. After Dinner strike>Thursday</strike> Wednesday our Coy received their pay before going on leave. Whatever we had in our Pay Book to our credit</p>
