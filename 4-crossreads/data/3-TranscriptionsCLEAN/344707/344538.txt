 Dear little Mother 
 This is anniversary of my wound last year but I'm not at all bad - & will be about again in a month & will go England then & later Australia if possible, anyway I am safely wounded now & I hope you got my cable saying "Nothing serious shrapnel ribs flourishing" -. My notes will give you some idea of what went on. The Brown horse Albert [indecipherable] was killed by a bomb on the Lines - the smaller horse HLAustin gave was killed under me by a shell before I was hit myself - the Cables will have given you the military news, but we well & truly stoped the Turks & there are now 4500 of them safely interned in Cairo. After being hit I lay in the sand with the wind knocked out of me & a N Zealander came & offered me his horse which somehow I rode to the Field Ambulance put on the table a dose of ether, bit of shell taken out bandaged up, given a whisky & a cup of Bovril - Mrs Norman Robertson, one of the Playfairs
