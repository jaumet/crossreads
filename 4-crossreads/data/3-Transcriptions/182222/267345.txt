<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; The Flanders Night&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Again we take road &amp; the moon is full. The trees are gone. Only a blackened stump shows here &amp; there. A&nbsp;<s>crater&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</s>&nbsp; few heaps of rubble mark<s>s</s> the village; Where the church stood is now a great mine crater . All the earth is pitted and scarred and dead , save for men who move swiftly and warily, and Guns that crunch wherever the eye seeks -- their fan shaped flames spewing across the mud,<s>momemtarily</s> revealing each moment straining sweating shapes like demons of the pit&nbsp; Along the road we stumble on nameless things -- that the guns have slain yet will not leave in peace. There are no bells. They were melted down &amp; fed to the Guns long ago. There is not even a blade of grass. Only the Guns and we who are their slaves &amp; will soon be their prey. HWP</p>
