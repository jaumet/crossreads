  
  W  31st. Weather looks to have taken up, but I suppose it will be raining before the days out. Have been off parade all day the result of what we call "working our head" Johnny Nicholson & I work together & we can do it easily we had no men at all on parade, so we could not see the sense of us going out & drilling, & besides Capt. McGregor is a good chap & he knows all the overseas N.C.O.s. & therefore overlooks a lot of things, but we do take some risks, & there are some funny incidents at times. The Coy were paid last night & judging from the number of drunks the canteens must have done a good trade. 1st September Very windy but
