<p>28 August 1918 Wednesday<br/>Not much of interest to tell you- enemy planes come over every morning, have a look at us &amp; clear out.  Great controversy as to arming us with swords- all the more for the men to carry- up till now we have left them behind.  General <strike><u>Allenby</u></strike> C. in C. inspected us again today &amp; presented me with D.S.O. among others made the usual speech it was very hot &amp; boring "for everyone" except the recipients-  I told you the C in C inspected us at Richon but did not give decorations only said-  The more he saw of us the better he liked us <u>as a fighting Unit.</u> - <strike>a quiet way of rubbing in re "Saluting etc"</strike></p>
