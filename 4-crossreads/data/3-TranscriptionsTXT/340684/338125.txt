A sister from this hospital is going to N.Z. next week via Sydney - she sails on the 20th in the "Osterley" She is going to call on the mater if she gets time between arriving in Sydney and leaving for N.Z.  she will be able to tell you all about my operation and about my eye-Fondest love to the Mater and yourself -wishing you both a jolly happy ChristmasYour affectionate sonGibson
