<p>and detained the night a prisoner. He was sent ashore again under escort the next day.</p>
<p>Later in the morning relief was sent to Bowen's party, 100 men from the troopship being landed. The Germans were found entrenched possibly 250 or 300 of them either in trenches or in other ways assisting. Soon after the firing commenced, Lieut Bowen was wounded in the scalp, the bullet piercing his helmet and grazing his skull. Others supposed he was killed. Surgeon Pockley was shot in the abdomen by a Schneider bullet and  Williams A.B about the same region and both badly wounded. These latter men were taken aboard the troopship and attended to, still alive and conscious but both succumbed later on.  The surgeon was shot by a native (so it is said). The natives were sent up to the treetops and fired down upon anyone they could see. Each German (except those in the trenches) had nine natives up the trees whilst he directed their fire from below. The general organisation was that each German should have a company of 9 trained natives. Bowen sent word that the chief danger was from the natives in the trees. He was attacked immediately he landed but received cover from his force and captured a few prisoners. One declared he was disarmed</p>
