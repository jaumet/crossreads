<p>3rd January El Arish 1917 Wednesday<br/>Had very little sleep last night I was awakened by a loose horse galloping about [was it Lady Barratt?] and then the rain came down very heavily for goodness knows how many hours the blanket which I have stretched over for a roof began to leak and hey presto! the water commenced to ooze through and dripped through However I got over to one side and dodged a considerable portion of it but some of the "bedclothes" [ahem!] got wet. "Bedclothes";  - good word that. Sounds homely.  My mattress is a good one there is plenty of it in fact is spreads over the whole face of the Sinai Peninsular &ndash; SAND! And I have had same mattress now for many a long month now and may have it for a long time yet I was awake until close on 3 this morning and during that period I did a most extraordinary thing [to me extraordinary] I sat up during the night and consumed 4 slices of bread and jam. The reason for such an extraordinary thing is this. Since we have arrived at El Arish we have been on what is officially known as "Mobile Ration" which consists of Bully Beef Biscuits [army pattern Huntly and Palmers No 5 armour plated, fitted</p>
