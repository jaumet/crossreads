<p>Hundreds &ndash; no, - thousands &ndash; watched us being carried, pushed, or helped into the waiting motor-waggons.</p>
<p>When we were all inside these the canvas flaps were dropped and we rattled away along a cobbled road.</p>
<p>Cobbles!  with <u>iron</u> tyres!   Ugh!    Our drive was in a circle;  we returned to the water-front again on entering the gates of the big naval hospital.</p>
<p>We were taken to portable papier-mache barracks erected in the hospital grounds, some 16 patients to a hut.</p>
<p>In our hut are Cuthill, John, the Jap. 3rd officer and Nagayama, and some niggers.</p>
<p>A  continuous procession files in to look at the latter, niggers being apparently scarce in Germany.</p>
