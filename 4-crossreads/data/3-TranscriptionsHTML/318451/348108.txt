<p>actual facts for a few miles away one of the bitterest battles of the war was being fought &amp; in the ebb &amp; flow of the tide of battle whole Divisions were submerged in its crimson flow.<br/>We rode out to the quaint old town of Liques in the afternoon.<br/>Next morning we were away at 7 oclock for our 40 mile treck to the front again.  We marched 14 miles &amp; billetted in a suburb of St. Omer.  Next day we did another 15 miles to a place outside Hazebrook &amp; yesterday we came on a similar distance to our present billet in Huts at Steenwerk.<br/>Tomorrow we move up to the line, we are once more within the sound of guns.<br/>I met Col. Green at Alquines &amp; we had a day together at St. Omer.  We had fine weather the latter part of our time &amp; marching up which was good.</p>
