front just now, we only stay here a few weeks when we get orders that we are to pull out for a long spell, rumours are that we go down near Eatables not far from the coast.
Well after five days march along frozen slippery roads we arrive in billets in the little Village of Beuton, 6 kilm. from "Eatables" arriving the day before Xmas. Here we stay till February the end of January, having in all a [very good time, plenty of sport],
