<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>Fancy this being the anniversary day of the commencement of the War. Here we are nearly there. Bit Irish but perhaps you will understand. I have several letters nearly finished which will be posted at [censored] but this may be put through from the other and of the [censored]. We are all well, or since we have run into monsoonal weather during the last 20 hours. I should say "nearly all. In fact Im a bit off myself. Jim is a good sailor and never gets ill. I have been put onto hospital work in the meanwhile and so have done quite a lot of work in stuffy localities. It's no good but I suppose someone must do it. Ran is O.K. I have had a chat with Goog Tyson, but he's an officer. Our unit is going to be a very happy one. I'm liking the chaps more &amp; more. Well, the mail time has closed now so I simply have to rush off.</p>
<p>Whips of love to all.</p>
<p>Your loving son.</p>
