Kohn left today for England to join the 6th T.B. and naturally full of commissions to execute for the other officers. The news from the Soissons front is serious in the extreme and things look most serious. The Boche shelling on this front has been slight the last few days. Our aeroplanes flying all the time ? his are seen rarely. Sent up our advance parties to the front line to billet the fellows marching in tonight.

Wrote a few letters and then walked around and had an inspection of the trenches.
