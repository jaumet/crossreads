Firing Line (Needle Tr) 26/12/16 covered with papers and books whisky & mugs, cigarette tins & tobacco knives pencils candles electric torches & enough rubbish to drive a good housewife mad. Artillery liason officer reported and as they put a few shells into us I asked for retaliation and our guns sent over beaucoup. On the left our artillery put up a four hours concentrated bombardment -quite a good shoot. Only normal shelling round us. Yarned during evening in intervals of telephoning and fixing up ration difficulties, with Rodda & McGregor. Talk turned on very few topics as War is our be-all and end all and absence so long from other interests leads all conversation into that of fights, past & present, Gallipoli, trenches, Pozieres, mud, wounds death trench mortars, officers men, shells, our own & Fritzs &c. &c. Toujours la guerre! They all turned in fairly early and I took up the night watch and sat up alone close to signal buzzers. A dark night flares not over frequent.
