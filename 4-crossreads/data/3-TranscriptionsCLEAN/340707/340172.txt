We breakfast on bread & butter & salt & chocolat & then I return home & sleep to 2 pm. 
 I look up Capt Rouquerol & find he cannot dine with me, this is fortunate as my fortune consists of 70 fr. & this must last till goodness knows when. 
 Then I run across for Duke & find that he has not been in his office & is sick I profess my intention of seeing him at once & the Colonel gives me a U.S car & away I speed to find him. 
 He was simply exhausted & we set out to buy for tonight's dinner 6 small veal cutlets cost 7 fr 50 - Sardines are 2.25 f a small tin a small cauliflower costs 3 fr. Unfortunately our guests do not arrive but send a little note We eat the dinner ourselves & then I visit Mde Brisson & have some difficulty in finding the place but it is only within 1/4 hr walk from my home.
