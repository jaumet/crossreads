<p>Should there be any doubt of my word one has only to try all-night duty on A.I.F. Headqrs.</p>
<p>8th January:- Saturday<br/>Today I spend a nice outing (after duty at 1pm) in the Gezinek Acquarium Gardens. This to my mind is the only nice little spot round Cairo.</p>
<p>9th Jan:- Sunday<br/>Raining slightly for a few hours in the early morning. I am on duty until 1 pm. In the afternoon a few friends &amp; I spend some time listening to the band in Esbekia gardens</p>
