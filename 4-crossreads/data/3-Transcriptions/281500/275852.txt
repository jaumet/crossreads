<p>I did not have much of a dinner just a slice of buttered toast &amp; a mug of tea, &amp; for tea tonight, a chop bread &amp; butter &amp; a small piece of plum pudding, so our Xmas has been nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>There was some heavy firing today our big guns were dealing it out properly Xmas day or not.  The 1st Pioneer Batt. are having a big spread tonight.</p>
<p>"Xmas night".  Have been playing "Bridge" nearly all the afternoon, we made ourselves nice &amp; comfortable fixed a table up &amp; had quite an enjoyable time, &amp; this continued until tea-time, after tea, we started again &amp; played until Len came home with his party we then set to &amp; cooked some meat &amp; had a good supper, &amp; so ended our Xmas in France.</p>
