<p>MONDAY, APRIL 7, 1919.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Fine &amp; calm. Sighted land at dawn</p>
<p>&amp; got into Albany at 12.18 pm &amp; dropped</p>
<p>anchor in the Sound. It was a very</p>
<p>poor homecoming for the Western</p>
<p>troops as there was not a soul</p>
<p>to meet them. They were taken</p>
<p>off in barges &amp; put into quarintine</p>
<p>for three days. We got away</p>
<p>again at 6 pm. About 740 troops</p>
<p>got off&nbsp;&ndash; over half the number</p>
<p>on board. Got a wire from</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>Days run 325 miles</p>
