<p>10 THURSDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny. The horses all went</p>
<p>up to Steenweck to be dipped in</p>
<p>morning, but someone else took</p>
<p>mine up. I camped in my dug</p>
<p>out &amp; read. We had till 4 pm</p>
<p>off in afternoon &amp; I wrote letters.</p>
<p>General Grimwade inspected the</p>
<p>place in afternoon &amp; was very</p>
<p>satisfied with things I think.</p>
<p>Old Fritz was putting some more</p>
<p>over near the battery, but</p>
<p>no damage done. I got a few</p>
<p>papers &amp; some socks from</p>
<p>Linda.</p>
