  
 this was the Adjutants fault at any rate I was not sorry for had he tried to get away we would have been too tired to offer much resistance, but we would have filled his hide with lead for I had special instructions to shoot him if he attempted to escape & he would have got it too for we were all well armed 3 men with rifles & I had a nice little squirt, loaded & ready  but happily there was no need for this , so we jumped a car which took us nearly home & right glad we were for tea was ready & we had our whack. This evening a batch of details arrived from the Base some of them have been away for 2 years & more.
