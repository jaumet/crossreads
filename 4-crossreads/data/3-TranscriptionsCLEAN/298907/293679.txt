  
 I see the dear old school house Where we spent some happy days As bathed in golden glory From the suns last glowing rays Those days I cant forget dear Oh could they with me only stay What things I would as different As I go through each long day. They are the happiest days of memories golden store And could I but go back again I would not ask for more But still the years go by my friend And seasons come & go, Many lives are made & marred In this world of weal & woe But the sunshine & the shadows, they both walk hand in hand Until our cares & sorrows Pass unto a better land But the memories of the past
