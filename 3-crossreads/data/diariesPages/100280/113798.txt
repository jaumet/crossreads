after the great bombardment they have been putting up.
22nd Beautiful this morning the sun is shining brightly. Had 48 hours rations issued to us biscuits bully form the greater part of it.
Left camp about 10 oclock after a fair march pulled up at Bazentin Le Petit, a place I have been in before, on the way up we passed fairly close to "Pozieres" what a difference there is now to when I first knew "Pozzy"
