case of emergency's & if  I can't fix them, then have to rouse up Doctor. Going on tonight with 3 N.S.W. AMC men, think we will get along alright - got out of sight of land about 10 pm, saw land again about daylight. Went down to the Cookshop & had a large argument, result can get anything in the eatable line for self & orderlys at midnight & coffee at 6 am.Very cold all night - with a fair swell on, have learnt to always give a man a free passage, who is approaching with hand anywhere near his mouth. Still feeling tip top. Have a few cold footers on Board crying to get back to Mother, etc.
