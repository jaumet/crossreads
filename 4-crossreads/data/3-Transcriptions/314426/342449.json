When I came back a new patient was in my bed, so I had to draw my kit, and hunt up a bed in No 4. Company.I was first put in a corporal's bed there for the night as he is no leave. Previous to that I was allotted to a bed in No 50 ward but as that is an isolation ward I refused to go in it.<br/>Wednesday Feb. 12. 1919. 94<br/>A fine morning. I had a good bed last night.
