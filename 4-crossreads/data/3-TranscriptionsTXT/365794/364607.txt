 Wednesday 24th July 1917 [1918] The Officers invitation for all Sisters to Luna Park now being allowed to all, we go 5 p.m., leave 7.15 p.m., enjoyable time &amp; pretty scenes.  A ride on scenic railway makes my cardiac organ quell.  Must not repeat it.  Water shute, I leave alone.  Pts. are interesting now.  Have Lt. Col. Williams, Vic., Capt. Evans, Ipswich, Lt. Matheson, Cowler, [?] Lt. Macauch, Longreach, McIntyre, Goondiwindi &amp; many others back &amp; forth.  Good boys all, very thin &amp; "Jordan Valley fired", tired out.  Major Dudley, Lt. McDonald, Capt. Jamison go today for Blighty. Letter from Angus Bell sent to 19th opened by my namesake, sent on to Eng. &amp; finally back to me.  Find that my predecessor in this ward turned lights off &amp; could then be heard being kissed behind screens.  No wonder I was dragged off from G.x.  Visit from Dr. Wilson, fine woman.  Mrs. Belcher asks me to tea.
