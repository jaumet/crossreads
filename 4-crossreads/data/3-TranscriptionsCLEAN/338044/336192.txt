  
 around a few streets. On arrival at the camp I find the others are receiving pay    & after receiving my 25 francs we take leave & go into town, have a good dinner & view the city until 7.30 pm. I think Marseilles a very nice          indecipherable  town & rather pretty. The people treated us very well. Parade in camp 8 pm & at 9 pm march off through the town singing all the way, to a rousing send off by the population. They cheered    & waved to us from every window & along the streets. Such a scene one could not forget. Arrival at the station 9-45 & after a great deal of marching about & entraining, steam out at midnight on our long journey. Eight in one small carriage compartment with all our equipment is not conductive to comfort, but at 3 am I turn in, having eaten a great deal of the chocolate issued to us from the comforts committee & sleep soundly.
