<p>Aug 1918<br/>no small amount of amusement, dinner then to Mrs Chisholm's to await train &amp; before leaving had P.M. tea caught train 3.15 arr Ludd about 6.5o &amp; came home by a Ford. Big party waited till next day</p>
<p>18.11.18 <br/>3 days out from Suez.<br/>Big &amp; final stunt against Jacko started on Nov 19th &amp; finished on Oct 31st by Jacko signing an armistice on our terms. Troops had advanced about 20m. beyond Aleppo &amp; destroyed 3 armies &amp; all their equipment captured about 90,000-100,000 men &amp; approx 500 guns, all his dumps, rly systems, lorries &amp; transport of all descriptions.</p>

<p>Nov 1916<br/>trouble here, waiting re-equipping etc &amp; at 9.30 left for train, travelling in usual military fashion, goods trucks failing cattle trucks. Very cold, no blankets &amp; not sufficient room to stretch our legs out. However we are accustomed to this &amp; not at all surprised at it, in fact we anticipated it. However about 4.30 before daylight we got to Suez &amp; spent the next hour being shunted up &amp; down one or two sidings &amp; about daylight we pulled up near the pier The "port Darwin" one of the C'wealth steamers of about 8,000 tons. About 200-300 inf from France also waiting. Report vary saying 800-1200 aboard. Dave aboard too, also many old faces that I have not seen for years. Nearly all 1914 men &amp; a very fine class too. Very different to those met in brigades. Quite safe to leave</p>
