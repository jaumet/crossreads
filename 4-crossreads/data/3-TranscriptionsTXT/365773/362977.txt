love to Beres & RalphMy dearest Sister,Your cake to hand two days ago & believe me it was lovely - I have five officers with me in the company & we scoffed it at afternoon tea - we all bow to you as a cook my dear, it was done beautifully & so rich - you know one cannot buy cake nowadays, that isnt a request for more I dont want you working for a hulking loafer like me - Purdon is still with me he remembers you & the 'fat girl1 quite well & wishes to be remembered to you both.
