<p>B.E.F.<br/>3.5.18.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Justice Ferguson,<br/>I had a mail in from home a few days back &amp; the [Paler] mentioned he'd seen you so I thought I'd drop you a line.</p>
<p>It is now, thank Heaven, the 23rd hour of my 24 on duty at an observation post which is in a very cheering spot, viz the undertaker's house just outside the &ndash; graveyard, &amp; at this moment I have come down to cellar because I can see nothing for ground mist.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I had much pleasure in putting a battery onto a pill box around which were many Hun working parties &amp; believe me it was pleasing to see not all of them ran away. I've grown bloodthirsty on Fitz's lately, &amp; so is everyone; the general attitude being to curse him when he strafes us &amp; then do one's uttermost to kill a Fritz someway.</p>
<p>In this part of the front we held him &amp; he hasn't fancied another try &amp; from what I know about the locality he'll have a rough time if he does. This morning early he was putting gas across here but not enough to worry &amp; a new stint of his also, balloons</p>
