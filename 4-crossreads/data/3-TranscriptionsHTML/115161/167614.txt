<p>were available, so we had to use our small entrenching tools, our hands, or anything with which we could remove the awful clay from the marked out space, throwing it up in the front, to make the &quot;parapet&quot;.&nbsp; We had to work pretty hard as we must be out of sight by daylight.&nbsp; We would take it in turn to use the spades.&nbsp; It was terribly hard digging, the soil all being of clay, which sticks so much.&nbsp; We were very quiet all the night, working as hard as we could, so that we should be able to conceal our bodies during the following day, while we still continued to dig.&nbsp; The whole proceeding was very weird and uncanny, but the enemy appeared to be in ignorance of our close proximity to him.</p>
