Wet cold night again, my trouble better but face still like a Pie Melon.
Scotties have taken over our outpost line once more further out. We have always been in the front line. I could not help notice how clean the Turkscamps are, far better than ours - I suppose the discipline of the Germans do it - Even Al Arish when they cleared out was left perfectly clean.
General Chauvel our Divisional Commander has been Knighted. We are all pleased at sound recognition, & no doubt he deserves it. Col. Meredith got his D.S.O.
If Day sent me a Khaki Tie some time ago am afraid it never arrived, I can buy one in Cairo now, many thanks.
