<p>Sept 1916<br/>13/20 &ndash; because there were no Taubes to receive us &amp; the 9th L.H. got right round &amp; cut the enemy communications. About 8.30 am Taube appeared but no bombing done. Two or three of our 'planes very active. Difference of opinions as to strength of Turks generally believed to be from 3 &ndash; 4000 &amp; supposed to be 13 a.a. guns. Evidently no field pieces. 5th L.H. 7th L.H. &amp; 3rd bde attacked but did not press it home. Turks considered too strong. Men were quite certain of their ability to take same but Genl Royeston did not consider the benefit to be gained commensurate with the sacrifice of life necessary to take it. Our artillery believed to have put in some good work. Camel corps also there but did not fire a shot. Our casualties very light. About thirty in all. Young Midgley from Lowood hit in knee.<br/>13/20th &ndash; Stunt well organised, the distance over 60 miles about forty of which had to be done without water for horses. Some horses got water meant for other horses amp; they had to do without. About 15 prisoners &amp; 6 camels captured. It was about 11.30 am when regts retired &amp; all returned to Salmana by 9pm. Long dreary stunt but caravan route over their side much better than ours &amp; their feat of bringing 2 ,000 across does not (?) appear great. Rumours &amp; counter-rumours as to repetition of stunt. Everybody glad to return. Four battys of artillery with us. No sight of Taubes on way home. They missed a splendid target. Following morning (19th) they bombed working railhead or thereabouts. Bill Pat &amp; Bob Handley out there. Saw them on way back.</p>
