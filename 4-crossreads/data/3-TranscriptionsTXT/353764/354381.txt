 we played the 7th ASC. Cricket &amp; won by 5 wickets &amp; 20 runs. Still no mail. 
 14th &amp; 15th Have not been out of Camp.  Weather very nice. Played the 7th Infantry Battalion Cricket &amp; won easily. To-day I had the great pleasure of meeting a few of the old Warren Boys who arrived early this morning having left Sydney on the 4th Dec 15.  They told me a lot of news, also that there had been rioting at The Warren, &amp; several arrests made.  I saw Reggie White &amp; had quite a long chat with him. I also heard that uncalled for rumours   lies had been spread about the City to the effect that The Persic was quarantined with Small Pox etc, &amp; that she had been Sunk. 
 I received 1 letter to-day, the first for a fortnight &amp; am wondering where the devil all the rest have got to.  I intend visiting an ancient Mameluke City to-morrow &amp; will write an account of same after my visit.  Have heard that we will soon be shifted from here
