  
 our mess went to an evening at the big farmhouse of the village.  We decided to dress up in some new pierrot concert costumes for the occasion, & it was a great success.  About 8 oclock we all marched in, one behind the other with hands on shoulder into the room where all the girls etc were sitting, circled the table then turned & bowed with a Bon Soir.  The effect was great, & the dress, pink & black looked well.  It was an extraordinary night.  First some music & singing by the girls, fairly rough, then some dancing until about 11 oclock we began to look for supper.  12 oclock came & still no sign & we were famishing.  By this time we were saying fearful things  to one another about coming thuds etc & made much fun of it.  At last at 1 A.M. we were conducted to a room & received coffee & tart so all was well again & we went home quite happy about 2 A.M.
