<p>we shift the Huns a bit more but they fight well and their morale is not yet broken:  and a lot more of good fellows one knows go under.  It can't last much longer as the winter creeps on;  but the Huns realize now they are beaten and I'm sure peace will be made by them on terms acceptable to us during the winter &ndash; say about Xmas.</p>
<p>I have had lots of home news, lambing was rotten, poor old Lloyd was much disturbed about it but I didn't expect marvellous returns after the bad times the sheep had.</p>
<p>So the Wheelers also are gone from Hay:  how will the old man get on without his work.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to getting home next year:  this rain has probably allowed a lot of us to hang on a bit longer, but its only on sufferance if this goes on, but the Hun now catches it properly and everyone is full of glee about it and doesn't mind what happens:  our troops have been wonderful though the Huns are brave enough.</p>
<p>Goodbye, and best luck to you all at Toganmain.</p>
<p>Ever yours sincerely<br/>John Chute Ellis</p>
