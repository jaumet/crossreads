<p>44<br/>taking part. We march out to Hocquelus a straggling little hamlet with entrenched houses &amp; picturesque tree edged pool in middle of verdant paddocks.</p>
<p>Afternoon diary. It is tedious work this recording of events but its now nearly up to date. I have not written it up since 27/12/18 when I received orders to move &amp; these 44 pages have been an effort especially as it is some time since the events happened &amp; there are many impressions &amp; events that I have left out.</p>
<p>19-1-19 (Sun)<br/>Orderly officer to day &amp; in honour of the event the sky is clear &amp; sun bright while the ground &amp; hedges are white with frost. Even the ground mud is frozen. Perhaps my ill luck has turned at last. I visit every part where battalion is billeted &amp; often climb up ladders into lofts or wander thro orchards now destitute of leaves along some winding track to the billets.</p>
<p>All the cooking is done on the travelling kitchens which are detached &amp; put on ground under cover. Scotson has kindly offered me the use of his billet which has a stove in it. This is not the first</p>
