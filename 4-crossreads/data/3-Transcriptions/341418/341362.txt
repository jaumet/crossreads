<p>"Dubarbos"<br/>Thursday May 30<br/>The great "Stunt" is on! We left our pleasant little retreat at Romaneh at 10 pm. It was a fine sight to see the start lines of horsemen passing by &ndash; we had to wait for a brigade to go by &ndash; they looked very well passing by, rather impressive in fact,  as they stretched as far as   <strike>you</strike>  could be seen in both directions, always moving past without a  sound or a light; In short it gave one the impression of attending a phantom review. We started out shortly afterwards  &amp;  getting about 5 miles out of camp we lagged behind a little for some reason or other  &amp;  the result</p>
