  
 Wednesday 14 November 
 The weather today had every indication of being bright  but  when we awoke, but at 9 a.m. a heavy mist fell and remained all day.  Before 8 o'clock I set off to the Main Dressing Station half way between Kemmel & Wytschaete passing through Reninghelst, Westoutre, La Clytte & Kemmel.  My next job was to run back & meet the main body on the road.  I met them half way between Poperinghe & Reninghelst.  Got returns & despatches from the clerks and proceeded via Reninghelst, Westoutre, Mont Adaigne, Mont Noir & St. Jans Cappel to Bailleul.  Had dinner at 5th Div. Hd. Q. then continued on to the C.C.S. at Oultersteen.  From this place I returned to the M.D.S. via Vieux Berquin, Neuf Berquin, Estaires, Steenwerck, Neuve Eglise, Wulverghem & Lindenhoek.  In Estaires I met numbers of old friends made 16 months ago.  Our Bearers are now in the line.  This M.D.S. is a safe & rather comfortable place.
