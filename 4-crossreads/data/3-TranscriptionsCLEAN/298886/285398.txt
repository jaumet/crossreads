  
 If they "pinch" them to morrow morning there will be "something doing" The regiment goes out every day at 9 30 AM and returns to Camp at about 1.30pm. but to day there was a contretemps the horses of two squadrons stampeded and galloped about 5 miles through soft sand for Camp most of them had their nosebags still on and through galloping and breathing the fine chaff out of the nosebag into their lungs some of them are in a bad way tonight they are bleeding freely through the nose. poor devils. Tonight is very cold there is a gentle Zephyr blowing across the LIBYAN. DESERT. 
 3rd Feb. Thursday 1916. 
 Sent out long distance Signal stations this morning on a large triangle about 20 miles around and later I personally inspected them. A good deal of practical work is still necessary yet before they can be considered fit. They must have some more short distance work yet. The weather this evening is cold with a very cold wind and one must wrap up.
