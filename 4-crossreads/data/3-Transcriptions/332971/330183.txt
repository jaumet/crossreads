<p>taking baby to Italy where the Colonel's sister is going to take charge of her &amp; Mrs Fiaschi proposes coming back &amp; rejoining the unit at Lemnos to continue her nursing.  I will wait &amp; see her safely off from here then go on to Lemnos.  Sometimes I wonder if any hitch will crop up to prevent me going, but I do trust not.  All being well we leave the Hospital to-morrow week, stay a few days at the Majestic Hotel waiting for the Italian boat which goes on the 7th of October.<br/>To-day am dreadfully home sick for letters.  Tomorrow afternoon Sister Burns &amp; I are looking forward to a happy time at Abonkir Bay.<br/>I am so glad that you have had such a good winter.  All must be rejoicing at the promising harvest I can picture the spring time out there &amp; with everything so beautiful around you it is difficult to realise all the suffering that this terrible war involves over here &amp; I feel heart sick when I think of Australia being drained of all its best men.<br/>Good bye once again- I'll just say how very glad I am that I came &amp; when our work is done how very very glad I will be to get back again- there's no place like home.  Hoping all is well c you.  With the best of best wishes<br/>Sincerely yours<br/>A.Donnell<br/>My future address is- Sister Donnell<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3rd Australian General Hospital<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.I.F.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Point<br/>Lemnos<br/>Via Alexandria<br/>Egypt</p>
