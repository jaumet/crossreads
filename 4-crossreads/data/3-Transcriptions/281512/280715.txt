<p>superb. Round Zonnebeke, the battlefield is now a succession of miniature ponds &ndash; pitfalls for the unwary, as they are as treacherous as quicksands. It is a fair hell of a prospect if our fellows or any others have to pass winter in this muck. [Photo No 54]</p>
<p>Early morning I visited the "Birdcage" at Hoograaf; where about 600 prisoners are interned from yesterday's battle. Mostly they are mediocre physique, though one notices an occasional fine specimen. They appear right glad to be in our hands, &amp; their general opinion is that Germany is done. They expressed great wonderment at our vast artillery resources &amp; so they might, for the guns stretch in lines over the country &amp; the ground is paved with shells. I took a number of photographs amongst them &amp; they willingly submitted; except a brigadier, who turned his back on the camera. I did not press the point out of courtesy.</p>
