I read several books <u>\"For God and the Czar\"</u> a story of Russia, and the methods of dealing with any who were unfortunate enough to offend those in Power.   <u>\"The Servers\"</u> another rather good Story of Russia.

Australian Politics being one.   Mrs. Horton is a dear little woman and did everything possible to make me at home. and she told me to tell you if I got back to Aus. how much she looked forward to receiving your letters.  Harold, a rather Keen student of Chemistry, etc  also very keen on getting into the Flying Corp.   we got on well together.   Edgar is rather a queer youngster loves Botany, and nature, but is not over fond of school and I dont fancy he is very smart so far as lessons are concerned.   for my own part I dont fancy that will do him much harm.  he is very quiet but a nice youngster.   Elsie, is sometimes quite the young Lydie, but Mrs. H. has not spoilt her.   she is a regular live wire and full of life and is not the least bit shy.   now I dont know what else to say about the family so I'll just stop.   when you see any relations just give ?em all my love and tell them I'm still well.   also the Goonigal Folk.   say that Photo of Dot holding Babs.
