<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>I am writing to tell you that I received your parcel quite in good order a few days ago. I had almost given up hope mother of it ever reaching me but it came along alright just in time for my birthday. Everything in it was OK. And the cake was a real good one by jove we had a great tuck in the night it arrived.</p>
<p>We are again out of the trenches for awhile and if we have any luck should be out for Xmas and the New Year. So far we have been very fortunate in having fairly decent weather, it has not been cold at all so far. I only hope it lasts for a good while.  I had a letter from both of the boys</p>
