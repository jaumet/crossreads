<p>September, 1915<br/>Friday 3<br/>Do not think because I am still in Hospital I am seriously wounded, I am A.1. &amp;  only waiting for the <u>flesh</u>  to fill up the wound Of course being in bed has made me a bit weak,  but very fat &amp; soft.<br/>With these notes I send you snap shots of our Position at Anzac &ndash; if I sent you negatives, a Photographer might strike off prints for sale at your Bazaar affair to help your friends eh? I see by the Papers that old [indecipherable] has married again!!!<br/>Will sort this love to all.<br/>F.W.</p>
