<p>January, 1915<br/>Sunday 24<br/>After all I did not post these notes at Aden as we only stayed a few hours &amp; did not go ashore.<br/>This morning we are in the Red Sea &amp; many boats of many nationalities pass us including a patrolling Cruiser, keeping the trade Routes open.<br/>A P &amp; O Mail boat also passed, we exchanged greetings &ndash;<br/>The Coast is rugged &amp; date palms grow at intervals.<br/>Patients in hospital are better I am glad to say</p>
