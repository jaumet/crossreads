<p>Bertie is mad</p>
<p>please burn this. The Nurse who looked after me in Hospital in England is a dream pretty as a picture and as good as she looks as innocent as a lamb <strike>upta</strike> upstairs. She would have been in Australia now, only for the War. I visited her mother and father whilst on furlough. They are a real good old Church of England family and they are fine. This girl (Nurse) is a bonny girl. When I left the Hospital she broke down. So I kissed her, and, well never you mind. I will tell you all about her and heaps of good things when I come home.<br/>Good night Mum XXXXX</p>
<p>PS  The snow is falling out side, we are going to have a snow fight as soon as I finish this letter.</p>
