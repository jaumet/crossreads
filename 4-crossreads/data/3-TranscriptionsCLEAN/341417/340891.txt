  
 some friends where I met a young fellow who was on final leave, strange to say I next met him on board the same transport as we are. 
 Monday. Reveille 4.30. Parade in full Marching order at 8 A.M.  9.30 A.M. w   & marched to Southampton West Railway Station, at 9.30 A.M. we entrained. not one of us knew where we were going to. at Exeter we were all given a mug of tea & a bag containing a Sandwidge, a piece of cake & some fruit & a packet of Woodbine Cigarettes, in it was a card enscribed with the Mayor & Mayoress of Exeter Compliments wishing you Good luck, we were all very grateful to Mayor & Mayoress. I understand they meet all troop trains & treat them the same considering that hundreds of thousands troops pass through Exeter it is very good of them. We next found ourselves at Devonport (which is quite close to Plymouth where we landed) & marched on board this old hooker we remained at the Dock for about 24 hours & then put to Sea. 
 Well Dearest I will now conclude as my borrowed pen has run dry. Trusting that you are enjoying the best of health also that you are doing well for yourself. I Remain Your ever loving [indecipherable]
