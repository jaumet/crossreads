<p>There was a great bit of excitement here tonight, some of our aeroplane's were being shelled directly over our head's &amp; most of the boy's were scattered about outside yarning &amp; lousing themselves when all of a sudden pieces of shell &amp; nose caps started to come down fairly fast you should have seen the scatter they all made a break for the cover of the billet quick &amp; lively you can hear them coming hundreds of feet up but you have no idea where they are going to lodge, &amp; if one hits you well it is goodbye"<br/>Last night we could hear the whistles in the German lines quite plainly, they say they use them for "stand to's" they were evidently in great fear of being attacked for the whistles travelled as far as we could hear on both</p>
