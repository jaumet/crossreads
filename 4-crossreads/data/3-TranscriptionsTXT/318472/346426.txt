 Left Monte Video in Motors &amp; went to Weymouth Station &amp; left there about 2.30 P.M. Arrived at Bristol about 5.30 &amp; "Avonmouth" 6 PM. and next straight on board of the Boonah. The country we travelled through from Weymouth to Bristol was very fine &amp; beautiful &ndash; every thing looking at its best The country after passing Upway and again about "Freshford on Avon" &amp; at Bath was particularly beautiful 
 Had a good time.
