  
 Gillespie and an A.S.C. driver who was with us. Five in all. The wounded were carried & helped out of the line of fire & taken to the Hospital while  we got  the rest of us took away the horses & mules further up the road. Later we returned and took away the limbers and later still our blankets & made a fresh camp half a mile away. We had no dinner & appreciated our tea. The enemy kept on shelling at intervals for several hours, and the batteries replied vigorously. One of the shells fell on the track from my tent to the cook house which I had travelled a few moments previous and  another  two others equally as close to the tent riddling it with holes. 
 Our camp is now situated in an old quarrie half way between Heilly and Corbie and some dg holes in the bank & others slept in the open. 
 Saturday April 6. 1918.1342 A fine day. 
 Between 11 & 12 o'clock the enemy droped bombs near us evidently in quest of the artillery & turned the machine gun on. The bombs fell in the swamp between us & the river & some near our old camp.
