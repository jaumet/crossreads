 Dear Old Dad. 
 Mum went to Church and we stayed at home Grandma did not go to Church only Anna and Mum.  Frank is painting for you and I spose I will be doing some drawings for you. 
 11.7.18 I did draw a few things for you that night and I tried to draw a Voielet.  Frank has about 4 or 5 letters writen and not sent them yet.  Anna went home to-day and she is going to a Wedding to night and they are having a dance and Anna said that she was not going to dance but I can see her dance.  There is a Soldier getting married that Anna knows.  Mother seems that she is writing a lot.  Frank  has  is starting his letter again.  I got a whole lot of post-cards and I love those that you have put on the back this is what I feel like the day before I get the letters.  And the other has on it.  This is what I feel like the day the letters come.  I stayed home from school 2 days they were Monday and Thursday That is to-day it is knitting to-morrow and I do not know what to take Frank said he would start me a scaf. 
 [Note from mother.] You will notice how Ruth has gone back in writing & spelling.  Pa is too careless it would make you hair curl if you could hear the way he carries on. A.B.
