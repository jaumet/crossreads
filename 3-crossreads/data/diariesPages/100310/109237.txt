25/7/17 Aveluy
The morning was devoted to cleaning up the camp and salvaging the stuff round it. It was remarkable what was raked up round the camp. At 10 a.m. rode down to Villers and attended a conference presided over by Genl. Paton. After lunch specialist training. Dealt out some pack drill to offenders against march discipline. About 4 went over to Bouzaincourt and met the old patron of the chateau in the street. The rest of the family were in the fields towards Millencourt so we walked out and in a beet patch busy working we found them all. The little Chretian kissed us and Marie the servant was hard at work. At the Bureau we found Madame some of our lads were evidently there as we heard a scatter as we entered. At Dubray's place I had a glass of wine and waited until a shower passed when we took our horses and rode back to camp. A cool night the air having been well washed out by the afternoon's rain.
