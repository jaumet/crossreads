<p>morning, Dene actually getting up to let him have some breakfast &amp; see him off.</p>
<p>Everyone asks about you &amp; sends all kinds of messages for good luck &amp; Mrs. Lovegrove is knitting you a pair of sox. Didn't you take any pyjamas? I found the ones I bought for you in your room.</p>
<p>Well my dear old boy I must stop this isn't a very lively letter but I have been so closed up in the house with Hazel in bed that I'm dull. The barracks people told me to address you Egypt &amp; that your letters would be forwarded as very likely you were going on to England.</p>
<p>War news is still very dreadful, though slightly in our favour &amp; the Turks seem to be in for a father of a beating. Uncle Jim thinks you may go there to fight first &amp; he says it will be a softer thing than in Belgium.</p>
<p>Adieu dear we all miss you very much &amp; wish you were safely home again.</p>
<p>With much love from<br/>X Mother X</p>
<p>My love to Eric &amp; kindest remembrances to Mr. Thompson.</p>
