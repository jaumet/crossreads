 A beautiful day but rather warm at midday. An order has come out to get all the limbers cleaned oil painted also the harness in readiness for a competition. Today I was busy making lids for the tool boxes on the limbers. This afternoon I went with Alick Holmes to the adjoining village of Pont Noyelles to the canteens but they were sold out of beer, matches etc. Coming back we kept on the far side of the canal and at a Battery canteen Alick bought a bottle of champagne. He paid 9/ francs for it which was very dear but it was very good & strong. We drank it and then came home.

 A beautiful day. I am carrying on with making the new lids for the tool boxes. There is a lot of work in each lid for at each end a piece of wood has to be dovetailed in to keep it from splitting and hinges has also to be fitted on. Today I finished reading "South Sea Tales" by Jack London. A series of tales of the South Sea Islands, mostly of the blood curdling sort.
