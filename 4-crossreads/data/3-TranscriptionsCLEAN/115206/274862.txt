 Bty Pos. left of Ribeaville 
 Weather wet. Packed up kit and left Bty at 0600. Advanced to a position in the above village but was shelled out of same during the afternoon. Picked up a fresh possie pretty rough too. Laid a line 1./2 long to Bttn Headqrs, and have had a hell whilst maintaining it. Fritz barrages everywhere and has had a few wins today. Weather wet right through, dug another dugout and am absolutely done up. - dead beat.
