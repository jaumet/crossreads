<p>Along the Nile, past the Pyramids in the distance &amp; past all the dirty hovels that abound round Cairo. In Cairo we went to the Y.M.C.A.tent &amp; had afternoon tea. Inside the YMCA is a skating rink &amp; every amusement .</p>
<p>On passing the Sultans Palace we saw the guard fall in &amp; all the soldiers [native] in their perfect uniforms of blue with red braid &amp; facings saluted &amp; the bugles blow. This is done whenever the Sultan goes out, &amp; the way they drill &amp; do sentry go is absolutely the prettiest sight one can imagine, They are perfectly uniformed  &amp; it is a magnificent spectacle. The mounted soldiers sit at attention on their horses like statues &amp; the horses shine as though polished. Every button glitters &amp; the bayonets glitter like flashes of fire. It is the most glorious sight one can see. We then saw the native quarters by night until we were that tired that we could not go any farther, so Eric &amp; I got in a garry &amp; drove to Bab-el &ndash;Louk &amp; thence home.</p>
