  
 13/4/18 given a clean change of clothing before we go into the line.  Bourke and Hunter came up when the rations arrived and some more canteen goods came to hand.  Dealt out 28 days to a couple of A Co. absentees.  Owing to unsettled conditions it is hard to get anybody court martialled - witnesses &c are all to blazes.  Very little shelling here today.  All my men well dug in and cheerful.  We keep a cow here and milk it!  Most of the artillery batteries also have a cow.  Poultry, veal &c have varied the troop's [sic] menu.
