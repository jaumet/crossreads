This is caused through a badly fitting helmet &amp; same is condemned. The ill effects pass off in a few hours.

The only inconvenience is a little suffocation.</p>

<p>Weather still dull &amp; windy &amp; very cold nothing of any note occurred. We  have heard unofficially that we move from here in 2 weeks time, leaving a man in charge of the camp so evidently we will not be away very long.</p>
