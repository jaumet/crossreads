<p>In hospital<br/>13th June 1917</p>
<p>My dear Judge,</p>
<p>It is five weeks since last I wrote to you and I have meantime received your three letters dated 12th March, 2nd April and 2nd May, the last of which (with the enclosed cutting of the scene in the Equity Court between Conroy and the C.J. in E.) reached me this morning.  I expect you have heard by now that I have been having a rather "thin" time in hospital and will understand that conditions have not been very conducive to letter writing. In fact except for my weekly letter home, my Australian correspondence has been totally neglected. Now that I am able to sit up out of bed it is clamoring for immediate attention.</p>
<p>Your letter of May 2 (via America) came alone this morning and is the only one I have had from Australia for about three weeks. There is probably a large mail overdue; I am hoping it has not been sent to the bottom.</p>
<p>I was relieved to hear your good news of Keith on the date on which you wrote. As that is over six weeks ago I hope he is now convalescent &amp; well on the way towards complete recovery. Now that you have given me his London (bank) address  I shall be able to get into touch with him.</p>
<p>It was gratifying to see both the State (N.S.W.) &amp; Federal elections' results: a very definite reply to the contemptible party with the "don't-give-the-boys-in-the-trenches-a-chance" motto. I think, with you, that Bavin is the best man of the host of candidates for the Gordon electorate, and I am glad he got in.</p>
