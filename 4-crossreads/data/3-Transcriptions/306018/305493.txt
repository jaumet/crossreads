<p>February 1918 &ndash; March<br/>enclosed, also letters from Doug &amp; Ada &amp; Edna Ferguson.  Latest letter I received was dated 12/1/18.</p>
<p>Friday 1st March<br/>Usual days work.  Had a game of billiards in the afternoon.  Stayed in the quarters after dinner &amp; played bridge in the music room.</p>
<p>Saturday 2nd<br/>Went to the races at Gezira in the afternoon.  It was a beautiful day, nice &amp; warm  &amp; there was a good turn out.  The Sultan was present, with his bodyguard.  It was quite a spectacle seeing him arrive.  He is rather a fine looking man &amp; seems to be very popular.  He occupied his private stand.  He had a horse racing in the 2nd race which came second.  I managed to pay all my extras with a few shillings in.</p>
<p>Sunday 3rd<br/>It was quite a spring morning.  The air had a warm glow in it.  Wrote 2 letters, one to Arthur Blomfield &amp; another to Carrie, afterwards went for a walk.  It was great in the sun.</p>
