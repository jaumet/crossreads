<p>Feb 1918<br/>left they seem to have been much overrated buildings mostly plaster instead of carved stone as I expected. Even today 3 shells dropped on the main street near the Hall &amp; although there <strike>are</strike> were a lot of men about none were hurt only 2 horses killed.<br/>Got a very useful parcel from the Victorian Patriotic Fund containing, Tob, Cigs, Biscuits. Creamy curry powder, Soup cubes Ham Paste, Boot laces Chocolate &amp; Chewing Gum Each man got one &amp; there was some difference in them all</p>
<p>Sunday 17th<br/>Work. A couple of H.E. shells dropped close to our job just before we left. A lot of Arial Activity today. Fritzie got well over our lines several times &amp; got abay allright. One of our machines came down &ndash; hit with one of our own shells I believe</p>
<p>Monday 18th<br/>Still working. Fritzie came over per Plane the same as he has been doing for some days but did not get back</p>
