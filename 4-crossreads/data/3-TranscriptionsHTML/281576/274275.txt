<p>Wed. Sept. 19.  I was enjoying a nice sleep this morning.  The rest of the chaps in my Tent all got up &amp; had Break. but I though a few more minutes sleep would do me more good.  Was just rolling over to sleep on when Serg. Mathieson came into the Tent &amp; informed me that I was Orderly Corporal.  Talk about being busy &ndash; I was rushed off my legs &ndash; &amp; on top of it all I had the Photos to give out.   Just after dinner I was sent away in charge of 30 discharged Tommies to report to the R.T.O. at Poperinghe Station.  It was a rotten march as we had to thread our way through the traffic - &amp; there was some traffic. Guns, ammunition, Ambulances, motor Bikes &amp; the Lord knows what.  We got to the Station alright, but the R.T.O. refused to take them over, so we had to return to the Rest Camp.</p>
