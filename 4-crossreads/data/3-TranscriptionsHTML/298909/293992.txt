<p>evening &ndash; one horse fell &amp; made an awful mess of a fellow.</p>
<p>10/6/16  Saturday</p>
<p>The G.O.C said that while here he wished us to have as good a time as possible &ndash; in regards to leave he said our movements were too well advertised &amp; known to the other side &amp; it was better for us to be heros alive than dead heros in the Mederteranian. Rumoured that the Managers of "Shephard's &amp; Continental Hotels have been arrested as spies &ndash; A Spy was also caught today in Ismailia. Had Brigade Sports starting at 6.30 am &ndash; some of our boys scored &ndash; on the whole the records were very creditable &ndash; especially on the tucker &ndash; Have picked up several curious if not valuable stones &amp; petrified wood, but it is out of the question for us to try &amp; carry them around &amp; as far as the 5th Division are concerned all outgoing mail has been stopped for the past week, so we cannot post anything till we get to the other side - Had one of the best Concerts under the circumstances I've ever attended at night it was given by the 15th Field Ambulance, all the other units greatly appreciated our efforts</p>
