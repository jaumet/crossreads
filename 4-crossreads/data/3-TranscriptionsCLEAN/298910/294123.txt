 Dull & very cold - Very few casualtys. 
 28/3/17  Wednesday 
 Dull - very cold - several snow storms. Very quiet day & few casualtys. About all the missing have been recovered from the Town Hall, which is now hard to recognize as once being a fine building. I visited the Bapaume Cemetery - which is very fine & some beautiful Tombs & Headstones of marble & granite are to be seen. The Huns here have further outraged the French people & civilization by tearing up French graves & burying some 1000 odd soldiers - also obliterated head stones & re painted. The French have erected a monument in honour of her fallen soldiers also to commemorate the Recapture of Bapaume in 1871 - The Huns have erected a monument some 50 yards away as a set off against this to the memory of their dead, also to celebrate his taking of Bapaume 1914-1915. No doubt
