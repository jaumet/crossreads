 144 Thursday March 7 Moving on 13 March. Direction said to be Jerusalem. Friday March 8 Raining today. Had sports in afternoon to relieve monotony. Saturday March 9 Demonstration of Sanitation given by Capt Sutton to the Jews of Richon. These people seem to have no idea of sanitation. This to my mind is why there are so many flies among these villages. Sunday March 10 Made application for separation allowance today. Saw Air fight by our planes &amp; Jacko's. One of our Scouts attacked by four Taubes.
