29/1/19 Gourdinne
Stayed inside all the morning nearly and handed out some severe Orderly Room punishments on account of some prisoners who escaped last night from the guardroom. Stewart came in for a talk and I largely rewrote the last chapter of our History. Afternoon cold and foggy. I walked down the valley to Thy le Chateau which was quite like an Alpine scene. The snow thick over everything and all the ponds around the foots of the trees were frozen. The village of Thy le Chateau has been fairly busy but the Hun removed all the machinery from the factories there. Came back to my billet and read and wrote. Irritable today. Had a talk with Jack Cowan and little Turner. Supper with Madame Crochelet.
