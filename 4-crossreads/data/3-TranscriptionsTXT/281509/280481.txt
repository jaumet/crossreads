15 September 1916Friday
Cut a few pegs for guy ropes. Bob, Keating & self leave to Poperinghe in afternoon.  Nose round shops, picking up trifles here & there. Hot tea & tinned pears. 3- tame Belgian flies. Gourmands at next table - tin fruit each. Pictures & home to Y.M.C.A. coffee & bed.  Bob alright again.
