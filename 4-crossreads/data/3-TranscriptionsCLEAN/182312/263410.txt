though they would capsize, and then off they go in another direction
     We must have had nearly 1000 men on guard duties on the ship.
It was estimated that with every porthole closed, the quantity of
air thus imprisoned in the vessel would have the effect of keeping h
her afloat half an hour longer than would be the case were she tor-
pedoed and all portholes left open.  In consequence of this a
"Porthole Guard" was put on one man to each two portholes.  This
guard was on day and night and their duty was , in the event of an
alarm to screw down the ports and then get on deck.  This acted very
well, the whole ship was inspected at each alarm and we never found
a porthole left open.  I dont know how many portholes a big passenger
ship like this carries on either side, but I should imagine that it
necessitated a guard of about 400 men.  At each lifeboat and raft,
day and night were stationed three men with loaded rifles and fixed
bayonets.  They were there in case of a rush on the boats and their
instructions were very short and to the point.  Each Officer was com-
pelled to carry a loaded revolver to be freely used in the event of
panic.  Guards provided with glasses were placed at numerous points
on the deck to watch a given sector of the ocean for periscopes.
     By night, not a light was allowed anywhere where it could be
seen from outside.  The first night out the men were allowed to sleep
on the decks, but despite warnings, they would strike matches to light
their cigarettes, consequently they were all bundled down below and
never again allowed on deck after sunset.
