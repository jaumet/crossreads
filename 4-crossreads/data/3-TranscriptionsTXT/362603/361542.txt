5.  Bombs I think.  As soon as I reached Waterloo the "All Clear" signals blew, so I went & had supper & got to bed about 11.30 pm.  I was up betimes & caught the 6.25 am train to Salisbury.  I arrived at 9.45 & went to my Friends for a wash & brush up, the first since 5 am the previous day.  I arrived in camp at 12.15pm, 3 1/4 Hours over-due, but nothing has been said.  I had a delightful Time all through except 2 Hours sea-sickness.  I am feeling the benefit of it though.  I have got all the nasty stuff out & start afresh a new man.  The only things that I kept down were my Boot-laces & that was a strain.  Ellis went away on Duty last night, so I have not seen Him yet.  He is going over next week for 7 days.  Dave can't go this Time.  Well, Dad, Mum & George, I think I have given You all the news.  I went away with all the leaves still on the Trees.  I come back to-day & there are hundreds of trees as bare as the sky.  Winter is here.  It is raining hard now, but it is not cold yet.  We have had 3 frosts last week, so we'll soon be having snow down here.  We are both well, as is Dave also.  We all send best Wishes for X'mas & New Year.  Give my Greetings to all my old Friends.  Best Love to You all, & trusting that You are only half as well as WeI will again send Loving wishes & say au RevoirHarry
