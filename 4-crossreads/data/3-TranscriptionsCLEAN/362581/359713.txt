My darling Eddy,I received two letters yesterday from you also kisses   &  rose petals in Auntie Annie's letter. You are very clever writing such nice long letters   &  I do enjoy them.
the camels here are very tall   &  are not very comfortable to rise but the little donkey's are lovely   &  I should just love to bring one home to you. We go for long donkey rides   &  do enjoy it. I like the nice white ones   &   usually get a good goer. Fondest love   &  kisses from Auntie Eadle XXXOOOXXXOOOXXXO.
