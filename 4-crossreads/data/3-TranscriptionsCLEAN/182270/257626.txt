 MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1919. 
 Fine & very hot. I went into 
 Quirindi with Al & saw Doc Grey 
 about my leg. He says there is an 
 oil sac bruised & I must rest it 
 for a week or more. Got home for 
 lunch & drove Hobsons pony 
 over to the Ridge & got her shod 
 afterwards. 
 Tickle lopping in Top & Boundary.
