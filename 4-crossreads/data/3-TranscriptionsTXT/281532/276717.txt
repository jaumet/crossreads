had to dig in with the aid of their groundsheets. From this ridge we look down on Bellicourt Estrees & Nauroy - Hindenburg Line citadels now in our possession. A beautiful sunny panorama. The sound of guns is continuous here and the whole air vibrates with it. Aeroplanes are active. There are many Americans about. Walked over to an adjoining Quarry where we found five or six 6 inch German guns abandoned. The Americans had evidently jumped off from here as a number were lying about dead. Two were lying together in one place - one a fine big chap was lying on his back half resting on the other who was like a heap of butchers meat having received a direct hit that had dismembered him. A rumour was very persistent among the troops that there was a corpse boiling down establishment
