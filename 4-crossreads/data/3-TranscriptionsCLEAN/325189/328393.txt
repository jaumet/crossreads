 Tuesday 
 Wounded being taken away in shiploads.  Mine Sweeper sunk in shallow water (they come in close to draw enemy' s fire).  Airship (captive) getting ranges for battleship.  Aeroplanes constantly going.  About 30 of us including 2 corporals of our coy. lead by a S.M. rushed up to support our compy. but had to come back as there were already too many in the firing line.  The S.M. had disappeared somewhere en route.  Coming up 3 of us had been [indecipherable].
