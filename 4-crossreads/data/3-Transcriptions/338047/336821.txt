<p>1918<br/>Sept<br/>Lieutenant here, but used to sneak back at night to have a yarn with the lads. We had a bath one day. While the redoubtable private Best was having his bath, his Sergeant said (there was about a dozen of us having a bath at the same time) "Why! you've been wounded, Best". He had two holes in his buttock. best replied "Yes, but I didn't think that it was worth bothering about". he didn't seem to be quite sure where he had got it, but it must have been about the 29th August. he was a bird allright. We had a look through the village the day after we arrived. it had been well battered. I got a small shutter fastener with a girl's head on it, as a souvenir. Fritz had a nasty habit of coming over every evening in his big Gotha planes. They used to go right back, drop their load and return a long while after. One night there were several coming over. The searchlights had their long fingers interlacing all over the sky,</p>
