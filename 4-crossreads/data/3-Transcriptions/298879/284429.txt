<p>August 1915<br/>Monday 30<br/>Warm day   Had a good night's rest. Rather a quiet day except for a few shells and bombs in the evening. One shell unfortunately killed two of our stretcher bearers, one being literally blown to pieces</p>
<p>Tuesday 31<br/><u>Fine.</u> German aeroplanes are busy overhead. One dropped several bombs on our gun positions. A lot of talk about a relief for us I Will be very disappointed if we do not get ours soon</p>
