<p>cut a passage right through, leaving in tact a piece of flesh midway between the holes of entrance and exit.  Two had their faces half shot away.  One died and the other was surviving in Colombo hosp.  Others were turned black by shell fire.</p>
<p>One man showed them much kindness, several of the volunteer sick bay party being exemplary in their activity.  We had them partly in the wardroom and partly in the starboard passage and waist deck most of time but later [indecipherable] on the quarter deck.  Fortunately the weather was fine which added to the comforts they could receive.  The decks looked like an improvised hospital.  But it was a horrible experience.  Suffering was everywhere, men groaning, men dying and nothing more could be done for them.</p>
<p>The starboard passage began to smell most disgustingly from the emanations of septic wounds.  We used disinfectant freely but the odour remained for more than a week after the men had been removed.</p>
