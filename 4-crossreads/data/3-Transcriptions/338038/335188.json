<p>Some the Euphrates, some France, and plenty more wild statements are flying about as to our next   [indecipherable]  At any rate we (the Artillery of the 1st Division) are certain to go the Egypt for a start as we must have a reorganising and refitting, every Battery being only a remnant of what it was when the Division landed in April last.<br/>I will post this letter from Alex or sooner if I have the chance of getting it away from here.<br/>Personally I will be mighty glad of a few weeks spell. I don't know whether I will be given another aircraft gun &ndash; I expect I will when we go into action again but meantime I will be with the 8th Battery. No mails have been delivered since yours of Oct 17th which I acknowledged last mail, so I expect I will get a large bag when they do reach me.</p>
