It was suggested to the officer that this was a matter that should have been reported to the officer in charge of the Sector, who would no doubt send a message to our artillery to open fire on it, so that at least its accuracy would be affected.
Much to the mens surprise, the subaltern answered Oh! I could never do that! That is the Brigadier's work! The Sentry said. Its pretty rotten to see ones comrades falling when one gun would stop the frightful loss to the battalion. While the officer was present the Hun battery enfilading shells started screeching behind us, on their way to come down with unerring regularity & his attention was drawn to the fact so that there could be no mistake about this battery causing so many casualties. Oh! said the officer, I have been watching the effect of its work! & then had to go to his "bay" on the right.
This enfilade fire continued till 8 am on Thursday (20 July/20) when its punishing effect was almost nullified by the fire from our guns. If the Hun artillerists are being shelled, while shelling, they appear to become very nervy, for the accuracy of their fire deteriorates immediately
