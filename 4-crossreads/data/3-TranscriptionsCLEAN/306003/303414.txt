  
 1-7-16 Sat 1st The 3rd, 6th & 7th Regts returned today from their jaunt to Bir-El-Abd & they did not get in touch with any of the enemy;  The formation for the railway line is now out some miles in front of this camp (Romani) & the work is going along lively,  Strong posts have also been made of any hills here that will be of any value in case we are attacked;  Nothing out of the ordinary happened today. 
 2-7-16 Sun 2nd Church Service again this morning & nothing out of the ordinary happened today;  Tonight Batty (Lt) raided the two-up school & took several names;  Too much gambling goes on in camp & it would be better if it was cut out altogether
