quite plainly for he came down quite low, all of a sudden there was a series of heavy explosions almost on top of us, there was a shower of flying metal stones dust amp etc. I thought he must have caught a truck or two of our chaps for the bomb fell right across the station, I jumped out of the truck run along the line but luckily he missed the train though the bombs fell on both sides of the line we were on, there was 4 or 5 casualties, the engine was holed all over the water was spouting from her boiler like a fountain.
