Punch
To a False Patriot
He came obedient to the call;He might have shirked like half his matesWho, while their comrades fight & fall,Still go to swell the football gates.
And you a patriot in your prime,You waved the flag above his head,And hoped he'd have a high old time,And slapped him on the back and said;
You'll show 'em what we British are!Give us your hand, old pal and shake;And took him round from bar to barAnd made him drunk - for England's sake.
That's how you helped him. Yesterday,Clear eyed and earnest, keen and hard,He held himself the soldier's way-And now they've got him under guard.
That doesn't hurt you; you're alright;Your easy conscience takes no blame;But he , poor boy with morning light,He eats his heart out, sick with shame.
What's that to you? You understandNothing of all his bitter pain;You have no regiment to brand;You have no uniform to stain;
