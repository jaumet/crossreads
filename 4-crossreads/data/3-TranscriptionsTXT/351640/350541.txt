 P.S. Taking up a small edition of Hy. [Henry] viii by William Shakespeare, it opens at converse between the Lord Chamberlain and Anne Bullen, maid of honour to Queen Catherine:/ 
 [Act ii, Scene 3, Lines 57-73] Chamb:/ You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings Follow such creatures.  That you may, fair lady, Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's Ta'en of your many virtues, the King's Majesty Commends his good opinion of you, and Does purpose honour to you no less flowing Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which title A thousand pound a year, annual support, Out of his grace he adds. 
 Anne:/ I do not know What kind of my obedience I should tender, More than my all is nothing:  nor my prayers Are not words duly hallowed, nor my wishes Worth more than empty vanities; yet prayers &amp; wishes Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship, Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience, As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness, Whose health and I royalty I pray for." 
 Note how simple and straightforward each is made to speak, as bearer of a gracious message from one most highly place, and one poor in worldly wealth returning thanks.
