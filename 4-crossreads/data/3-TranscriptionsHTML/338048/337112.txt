<p>Wednesday 26th<br/>Slept in rather late but had a swim in Y.M.C.A. baths (about 30 yds long) before breakfast afer which we booked beds for the night &amp; went out again <strike>with a Scotch Canadian who was very sociable</strike>. Made for the Army H.Q. &amp; met Harold &amp; arranged a meet at 5.15 p.m.</p>
<p>Went to Westminster and had a good look round. It is a marvellous place a mass of solid carving. Innumerable graves etc every where. I think we saw all. The most impressive thing was the memorial to a beautiful lady who died suddenly in the arms of her husband The figure was of the husband with the lady in his arms <strike>tried</strike> trying to fend off "death" (a skeleton) who is escaping from the door of the tomb beneath &amp; endeavouring to attack the lady. [Note in margin] A great piece of sculpture. Intercessional Service is held there every midday &amp; we stopped in for it. A good many of the figures are covered with sandbags.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went to St Pauls &amp; was amazed by the beautiful ceiling dome &amp; altar. In the whispering gallery which is inside at the widest portion of the dome you enter on one side &amp; the attendant tells you to go around to the opposite side, sit down &amp; he will whisper to you. He whispers into the wall &amp; you hear it very distinctly just near your head. Very marvellous.</p>
<p>We then went up more steps to the stone gallery on the outside from which you can get a good view of the city Visited the crypt saw Wellingtons Nelsons Roberts graves &amp; also the huge vehicle (built from captured cannon) which carried Wellingtons coffin at his funeral. I stayed half way through a service starting at 4 p.m. at St Pauls &amp; went to meet</p>
