[Saturday 29 April 1916]
Court again.  These Sikhs have a conspiracy of Silence, & it is a slow biz dragging out evidence.  I rewrite all the evidence every night 2 hours work.I found tonight what can be found in many wealthy Eastern houses- An old English Governess who had been for 30 years in Egypt  She told many things about the rotteness of the Rich Pasha's homes, & the way in which they endeavoured to Copy the English being the sincerest form of Flattery.Truth, Honesty-Morality are sadly lacking in Egypt & they are quite unfitted to govern themselves.
