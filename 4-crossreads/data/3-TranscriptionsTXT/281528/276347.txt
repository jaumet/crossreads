24/4/18 &ndash; LavievilleA busy night with bright moonlight.  At 3.20 died very bravely young Barker a good boy, upright, capable, brave and everything that a gallant young officer should be &ndash; and one of our originals.  With Waxman he took our a patrol to endeavour to cut off a Hun post.  He was reconnoitring and had gone forward about 250 y. with Waxman.  They were half-lying half-kneeling listening when suddenly two Huns appeared on them.  Barker halted them and fired.  They also opened but had automatic pistols and a full burst ripped into Barker's groin.
