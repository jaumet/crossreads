In the dark at 3.30 AM, passing the QM Store they heard a Primus Stove burning which sounds exactly like a Bomb falling thro' the air, our Wireless Oil engine was also working so the Combination made the Natives leave their Camels &amp; run in all directions-<br/>Our hours are long 16 a day so as of old SLEEP is the greatest pleasure-<br/>Last night a poor devil was dreaming of Bombs etc &amp; he yelled so loud he woke the whole Camp-</p>
