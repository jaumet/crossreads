8 July, 1916KantaraIts drab after Cairo  We arrived at 18.0 last night the kits had not arrived so we looked about for some where to sleep.  At last we decided to put in the night on a small pier which though hard was clean & had the advantage of being covered so we could keep out the dew which falls so heavy this time of the year.  I slept well & this morning went to the V.M. Corp & [pratted?] in with Harold for tucker.  My hand was sore so I got it dressed & when I came back in the after noon I found that Harold had gone to Port Said on Escort so I went up to where the Sergeant was with the Trans port to put in the night there.
