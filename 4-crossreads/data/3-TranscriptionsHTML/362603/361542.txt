<p>5.  Bombs I think.  As soon as I reached Waterloo the "All Clear" signals blew, so I went &amp; had supper &amp; got to bed about 11.30 pm.  I was up betimes &amp; caught the 6.25 am train to Salisbury.  I arrived at 9.45 &amp; went to my Friends for a wash &amp; brush up, the first since 5 am the previous day.  I arrived in camp at 12.15pm, 3 &frac14; Hours over-due, but nothing has been said.  I had a delightful Time all through except 2 Hours sea-sickness.  I am feeling the benefit of it though.  I have got all the nasty stuff out &amp; start afresh a new man.  The only things that I kept down were my Boot-laces &amp; that was a strain.  Ellis went away on Duty last night, so I have not seen Him yet.  He is going over next week for 7 days.  Dave can't go this Time.  Well, Dad, Mum &amp; George, I think I have given You all the news.  I went away with all the leaves still on the Trees.  I come back to-day &amp; there are hundreds of trees as bare as the sky.  Winter is here.  It is raining hard now, but it is not cold yet.  We have had 3 frosts last week, so we'll soon be having snow down here.  We are both well, as is Dave also.  We all send best Wishes for X'mas &amp; New Year.  Give my Greetings to all my old Friends.  Best Love to You all, &amp; trusting that You are only half as well as We<br/>I will again send Loving wishes &amp; say au Revoir<br/>Harry</p>
