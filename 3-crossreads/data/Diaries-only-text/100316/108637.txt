 Warloy
In the air this morning is a touch of summer and we were early astir to the waking sounds of our band. The house we are lodged out at looks from the street just the same as any other typical village house but evidently the people have been persons of some importance for the house is comfortably ? almost luxuriously ? furnished. Why the people do not shift their belongings is hard to say. Only five or six short kilometres away is abundant evidence of what will in time happen to this place too. Warloy was one of the most delightfully situated villages in the Somme. No mention of it would be complete without recalling "The Belle of Warloy" who was far better known on the Somme than any other woman on the British front. Her scarlet stockings, her afternoon teaparties and the crowd of visitors made her very well known. Entertaining of platoons "the flag days" were known to all the Army in these parts. This morning the village streets are full of troops. Such a mixture of units of our Force and thenTommies as well. Transport passing and repassing. All night long there was in the streets the sound of tramping feet as troops marched in from the trenches. A steady muffled tramp that recalls the same sound heard in many places in three years past. In Egyptian streets in old red Flanders and Picardy villages. A changing and endless flow on the highway of Death. It never ceases.
