whole thing.&nbsp; The sausages first burst into flames and then
exploded and fell to earth.&nbsp; Each would contain two expert
observers so their loss would be no small one to Fritz.&nbsp; That
night the Germans were evidently very angry for they threw
things at us for hours.&nbsp; We didn&#39;t mind his shells that night
though, we were so tickled about his bal^loons.&nbsp; The Boche
still shows a preference for Churches when he starts shelling.
Only this week he picked out two tall steepled edifices in
Armentiers - he didn&#39;t touch anything else, he just wanted to
try a new gun or something.&nbsp; Mind you a church steeple makes a
fine target and must have the same impelling fascination for an
artilleryman as a window in an empty house has for a small boy
with a stone in his hand.&nbsp; The man behind a gun seldom sees what
he is firing at and therefore does not get the satisfaction of
observing the damage he does.&nbsp; An opportunity to knock over
something visible like a church steeple must be very inviting
and after all there seem to be plenty of them to spare.&nbsp; Every
little village, every hamlet even, has an enormous church with an
equally big steeple.&nbsp; I won&#39;t go so far as to say that the
country is over churched but there are a great number of them
vacant.&nbsp; The rectors are at the war - not as chaplains but as
combatants - the male portion of the congregation is at the
war and the women folk are far too busy working to go to church.
The Germans do not often trouble Armentieres but when they do,
we have only to plunk a couple into Lille and they stop at once.
Lille and Armentieres are within about six miles of each other
and it is said (I give it for what it is worth) that British
Engineers tapped the Electric supply xxxx cable feeding Lille
and for four months lit Armentieres at the Huns&#39; expense.
