<p>My dear Father,</p>
<p>A letter just received from you reminded me that I hadn't written this week.  The only change that has taken place, is the move which we were preparing for when I last wrote.  It is distinctly a <strike>nerve</strike> change for the better.  Last night our Colonel took General Holmes &amp; the Company Commanders to dinner at a Club in Ismailia where we had a very enjoyable time.  Talking about O.Cs reminds me that you asked who had the Companies now.  Here they are:-</p>
<p>A Coy Capt. Ross<br/>B Coy Capt. Ferguson<br/>C Coy Major Paul<br/>D Coy Capt. Roper</p>
<p>Major Fitzgerald is second in command of the Battalion.  There is no doubt that he is the man who made B Coy the best company in the Bn., &amp; I think that it still holds its reputation, I hope on account of good management as well as good fortune.  Walter is well &amp; expects to come back to us any day.  I'm sorry that this has to be such a short note, but I know you would rather hear just a word or two from me, than nothing at all.</p>
<p>Give my love to Mother &amp; Dorothy.  I'm afraid I won't have time to write.  We are waiting for orders to move any minute.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son<br/>Arthur.</p>
