7All our people on board are very well and in good spirits, even including old Toomey, who seems to have recovered from his fit of loneliness.Well I think this letter will have to be wound up. I could go on writing for ever about the trip would time permit of it, but it will have to keep. Give my love to all the Killara folk and D'arcy people too if you are writing, and with tons for yourselves & Pat.I am, Your affectate SonTerence W. Garling
