<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 23.12.16<br/>19th Oct 16</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>By last nights mail I received your very welcome letter of 3rd Sept. also Ols of same date.  Thank you both for news &amp; letters they are very eagerly looked for I can assure you.<br/>As I write the rain is pouring down, &amp; has done so on &amp; off for the past 48 hours.  As a result the ground &amp; roads are very sloppy &amp; wet<br/>A very pretty picture presents itself as I write here for we have only been here a few days.  Looking away over cultivation paddocks in the distance is the village church with its big square tower looking very grand &amp; imposing.  A white, (though at present muddy) road winds from the church past my billet, on one side of which is a combined hedge of holly, hawthorn, &amp; blackberries which by the way are quite ripe now, &amp; many a feed  I've had in this country during the past few weeks of ripe blackberries.  Dotted among the paddocks which are green with horse-radishes, &amp; a kind of very coarse turnips, are the red-roofed farm houses   In one corner of a paddock, now lying fallow</p>
