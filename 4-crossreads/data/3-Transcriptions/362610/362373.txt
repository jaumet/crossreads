<p>Tuesday 6 June 1916<br/>Raining steadily when we woke, &amp; it kept on pretty continuously during the day. Parade from 7 to 8 was changed into lectures indoors. There are abt. 40 attending the school, of whom 5 are officers : did not know the others previously but we soon got to know each other. During the forenoon it was too wet to do anything outside, so the time was spent at lectures. There was a break in the afternoon &amp; we went out for our first lesson in throwing bombs by hand, an hour at this &amp; an hour at further lectures. Quite a strong cold wind blowing &amp; no sign of aerial reconnaissance during the day. A cold night, altogether quite a windy snap. The people at the farm house here were busy emptying the drainage tank from the stable &amp; cow stalls to water over the fields, &amp; the smell was awful.</p>
