via Melbourne. Within an hour of sailing I was sick, 3 times in all during the afternoon but was well by the following day. The boat was very light and rolled considerably, the propellers coming out & racing occasionally. We are quartered in the Hospital & are extremely comfortable, good beds, bathrooms & Latrines to ourselves.
Friday 12th Feb. It was the 18th. Feb last year I sailed for England & now the 11th Feb. 12 months after I sail again this time round the North of Australia but with what a different object in view We spent the day doing light duties such as laying out beds & recovering from seasickness & also had our first operation, As was rather painful, CHCL3 was administered with full success the patient swearing & carrying on through it all four of us holding him down.
Saturday we arrived at Brisbane but were not allowed to land. I wrote several letters & gave them to various people to post, one to a girl, threw some to a man & some to a soldier going ashore. We took aboard our two transports some 600 odd men making our total about 1200 men apiece. We received 3 more a.m.c. men making 9 in all. The Seany Bee sailed about 6 P.M. & we followed on the Choon about 20 minutes after after having taken aboard more cattle sheep & vegetables etc.
Sunday 14th  General cleaning up in morning. Spent Saturday afternoon unpacking drugs & felt quite at home.
