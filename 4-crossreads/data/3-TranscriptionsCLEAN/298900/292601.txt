Monday 31st December   Feeling pretty fit.   After breakfast went along by bus to S.M. & Co to collect some money & mail which would let me know where D.W.A. was.   Weather very mild & did not wear greatcoat.   Drew 10 to start with.   Had a walk round, London pleasing me muchly as usual & came across a margarine queue, which was rather depressing.   Had lunch at the Y.M.C.A. Aldwych again & sent off a letter to Mum.   In the afternoon I went out to NottingHill Gate to see D.W.A. & Aunt & spent the evening there.   Reached the Hotel at midnight being just in time to join a dance with which they brought the New Year in.   Danced till 3 A.M. but the show was a poor one being dominated by some wild Russians from the Embassy who carried on in such a way that it spoilt it for others.
