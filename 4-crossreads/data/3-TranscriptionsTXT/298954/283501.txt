The Juniors are a cheery lot - we amuse ourselves with leap-frog, "rough-houses" & singsongs on the poop.   The Germans have given us a small awning which they took from the "Jumna" & we rig this daily between the dummy wheelhouse & the disguised gun.   As there is no room for all under the awning a wild rush for places takes place after lunch.
The starboard side of the poop is reserved for officers, the port for the men, and these limits are kept moderately strictly.   The seaplane is being repaired as quickly as possible.   A gang of mechanics are making an entire new under-wing in our hold.
Sun 5th Aug.Persistently rumoured for the last week that we are waiting for a Burns Philp steamer loaded with coal.   The 'plane has been repaired for some days & makes regular patrols twice a day.   We are in the vicinity of land, as the number of butterflies going over the ship shows.
