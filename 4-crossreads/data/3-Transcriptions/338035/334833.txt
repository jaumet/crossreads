Saw some very historic specimens in the Tower including the room where two princes were murdered and Sir Walter Raleigh's prison.  Back by Tube to Temple (Aldwych).  Afternoon.  Concert in Albert Hall, Kensington by Royal Choral Society who gave the "Elijah".  There were 2000 performers including Ada Crossley, Ben Davies &amp; Ruth Vincent.

Exactly opposite in Kensington Gardens is The Albert Memorial a beautiful piece of work.
