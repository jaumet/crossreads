<p>&amp; British soldiers. At 8 am we left for the town of Suez for coal &amp; water through the Suez Cannel. The weather being exceedingly hot.<br/>Along the banks are the remains of the barbed wire fences, dugouts &amp; trenches, observation posts etc used by the British troops 3 years ago when the Turks came &amp; fought &amp; were badly beaten with a loss of about 7000 dead. As we steam through this Sunday we sighted the camel troops on patrol in batches of 100 men &amp; sentries posted every few miles. Thousands of pounds of light railways tanks etc rotting &amp; of no use just now after the former defence in 1915. Also the crosses on the banks were 8000 Turks were buried.<br/>5 pm We arrived &amp; dropped anchor at Suez. Quite a treat to be away from the submarine zone &amp; safe as far as they are concerned, after 9 continous months running across the Mediterean with troops both ways.</p>
<p>16.9.18<br/>The Canberra arrived here from Alexandria. This transport is also going on the same run as us.</p>
