<p>Saturday 8thJuly.<br/>had a rather busy morning plenty of dressings &amp; evacuations the result of the route march the day before.  Blistered feet &amp; chafes were the order of the day.  Received orders for moving off next morning about 10 A.M.   B section to proceed to Lynde.   A &amp; C destination unknown, so started  to pack up, a big job as we had a lot of extra stuff, 8 cases in all.  Finished the day at 11. P.M. &amp; cracked a bottle of champagne before retiring.  During the afternoon we said a few reluctant farewells to some of our civilian patients.  Rather a strict order came out about men falling out during a march.  Many men have fallen out during a march just because they feel tired &amp; it was becoming quite a serious problem especially as it looked serious when a battalion where marching to the firing line.  The order read that men offending would get 2 years hard &amp; officers were instructed to insist on the men keeping up even tho' their feet were blistered or legs chafed.  'Tis quite a common thing to have read out in orders the names of men shot for desertion &amp; refusal of carrying out of an order.</p>
