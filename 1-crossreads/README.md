Crossreads 
==========

This software is a prototype that develops the idea of transversal-reading, or  derive-reading, or cross-reading. This is about to read a text in  alternatives orders. 

Initially, the text or collection of texts is divided in pieces (almost paragraphs),
then we calculate the similarity among pieces.

With all the pieces we build a web interface [javascript app] that allows cross-reading by jumping from one piece to another according the pieces similarity. 

[April 24th, 2014]: Active development. Code and usage not yet documented.  Expected launch late May 2014.
