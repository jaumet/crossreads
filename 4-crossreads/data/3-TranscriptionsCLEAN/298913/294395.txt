  
 are many & strong. He says he will look it up - Saiseda Wireless station WA2; leaves for Dueida 
 25/5/16 fitting itself up at the expense of WA3 on which station I am left. Take over WA3 & set about knocking it into shape, taking up 8 to 12am & pm 
 26/5/16 Tune up WA3 & get good results. Make the place like home & make sandbag couch. Have a glorious feed with Chatty. Blanc-mange smoked - & a la cocoa flavouring with rice & raisins & marmalade jam & peaches which makes a good salad when liberally covered with condensed milk. Hourly calls with WA1 & WA2 cease. 
 27/5/16 Told that we are to be put off WA3 station & let other operators  take place. No supper  owing to the tanks being dry & no water on Hill 40. Issued with tinted glasses

 29/5/16 Aeroplane again about hanging very low. 
 30/5/16 All quiet ready for the attack. Night time code messages come through referring to the time of attack.

 1/6/16 Turks get back one by dropping a bomb on Romani near the sig office killing Lieut Kerr & wounding Lieuts Braithwate &Smith all of the Signal Squadron. Causes some excitement. 6.30 am enemy aeroplane signal sent out from WA1 reporting plane going west. 
 2/6/16 Girlie  returned to camp wounded inside by piece of bomb. Looks rather sick. WA2 dismantles & moves. 
 A3/6/16 Another stunt being prepared & insistent rumors of France. 
 4/6/16 Dust storm that nearly chokes us. Feeling very crook - overeating I think as Chatty & I have had four eggs each each meal, besides the usual fruit & custard.
