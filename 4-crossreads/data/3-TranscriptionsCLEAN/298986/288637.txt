the woodwork just over my head keeps creeking.  A good many sick.  Warmer to day some rain.  Passed C. St. Vincent about 10 A.M.  Lights on the coast in sight at bed time.
Wednesday 26th
The day perfect went through the Straights of Gibralta last night & are now in the sparkling Mediteranean.  Warm bright & calm.  Can Could see the mountains in Spain clearly in morning.  Enjoyed the warmth & read most of the day.
