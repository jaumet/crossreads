worst luck, if there was I would be very soon due, it is just on 6 months now since I came over.  There is one satisfaction now & that is the fact that there is something doing, the Germans trying there hardest to break through in fact I think we are at deaths grips now & it cant last too much longer & America coming in makes it a cert that we cant loose but she seems a long time coming & giving the present fighting Army a long needed rest.  We have been having beautiful weather lately
