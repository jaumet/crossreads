Part of the "Matunga's" crew came on board tonight, including the Purser and Assistant in immaculate whites.   I made George Pyne's acquaintance in a bath towel & almost blushed at the contrast.
It is absolute hell in the hold of a night.  This bay has a close, muggy heat that one never gets on the open sea, and to be herded in the filthy hold all night is positive torture.
None of us can possibly wear any clothes and the decks are sopping with sweat.
We have a roll-call at 8 each night.   (Rees reminded all and sundry within hearing distance of "the pyjama incident" when the Amiable One toddled out to roll-call in an old bunk-curtain.    Garments consisting only of a small curtain do not suit the middle aged and portly, as Rees cruelly remarked.)
