  
 Some sweets I had in my pocket & she was exceedingly pleased, she having a sweet tooth like all the Roddas. She is a real Cockney & uses a little slang in her talk. I promised to see her again if ever I got to London once more. 
 14/10/18 Up at 7.30 am. After breakfast and shave went down Oxford St to Holborn &  sent away p/cards of Barrow &  Kendal & new book of London to Mother. Then went to Gamages & bought razor strop & a hone. Brought them back to lodging then went down Shaftesbury Avenue &  bought chocolates for Ida and Auntie in Barrow.  Then went via Leicester Square & Trafalgar Sq to the Strand to a cafe near Charing Cross Stn & had a good dinner of grilled steak & potatoes & cabbage. After dinner went along the Strand to Australia House to see the building. It is a good building really going to waste to my idea. 
 Then came back to Trafalgar Square & got No 15 Bus to Paddington via Piccadilly, Regent St, Oxford St, Edgware Rd & Praed St. Had look round Paddington Stn then took bus to Victoria Stn via Praed St, Edgware Rd, Marble Arch, Park Lane & Grosvenor Place to Victoria St. After seeing station there walked to Horseferry Rd enquired about the morning sick parade, then walked along Victoria St & Whitehall to Trafalgar Sq & the Strand.
