 The Square at Alexandra is the centre of the best shops & warehouses in the city. Shaded with palms & different shrubs, together with bright red flowers the whole blends very well with the pale grey buildings surrounding it. The old Sultan occupied a prominent position in centre on Horseback. 
 Working at PO all day not feeling too bright. 
 The square is filled to the overflowing each evening with all conditions of society. It is a gay spot, & everyone is out to make the very best of life. The children revel in their games & the older folks are bent on enjoying everything that comes along. It is a scene once seen never forgotten.
