<p>March Thursday 8 1917</p>
<p>No word yet of when we are to be relieved;  on the other hand we have been attached to the 2nd Div, pro tem. Looks like as if we are in for some days yet.  <br/>All are thoroughly tired of the long spell in the lines, no opportunity of a bath or change of clothes, &amp; the constant strain of being under fire tells on the strongest nerves.  <br/>On duty at 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.   Nothing much doing.</p>
