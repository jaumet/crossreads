 [In 1922 a Memorial Scroll, and later a Memorial Plaque, was presented to the next of kin of those soldiers, sailors or nurses who died while serving in the Australian Imperial Forces during the First World War. The  Memorial Scroll bears the Royal Coat of Arms and the following message] He whom this scroll commemorates was numbered among those who, at the call of King and Country, left all that was dear to them, endured hardness, faced danger, and finally passed out of sight of men by the path of duty and self-sacrifice, giving up their own lives that others might live in freedom. Let those who come after see to it that his name be not forgotten. Major. Terence Ward Garling 10 F.A,B., A.I.F.
