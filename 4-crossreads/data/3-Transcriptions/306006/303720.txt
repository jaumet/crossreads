<p>26-1-17<br/>Fri 26th.<br/>Kater turned up &amp; took over this morning; Frank Hobson (his groom) came with him. I went in to El Risa camp to straighten the gear up in there. Sgt Maj Wright, Sergt Chivers &amp; Sgt Hayes went in with me on their way to the School of Instruction coming back to El Burj we halted to watch the Scottish Offficers playing our Field Ambulance football; Two enemy planes came over much lower than any I have seen for some time, they dropped no bombs &amp; our Anti Air Craft guns were shooting well but failed to score a hit; The Field Ambulance won the match by 14 to 3;</p>
