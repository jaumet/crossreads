The other morning whilst up testing a machine I felt the wind &amp; cold pierce like a knife altho' clad in the usual leather coat &amp; fur lined cap.<br/>Did I tell you, Dad that the application that I put in a fortnight ago for a Pilot was turned down for the 3rd time.  I was heartily disappointed, &amp; when <strike>I</strike> the Major was in a good mood a few days later I asked him why he had turned me down.  He explained that as I had a somewhat difficult &amp; responsible job, &amp; I had thoroughly grasped &amp; understood my work, (as he found out when I was away on 6 days leave) he couldn't afford to lose me.

I am going to try again this month for a Pilot [torn page]</p>
