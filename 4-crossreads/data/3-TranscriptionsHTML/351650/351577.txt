<p>Course if one got invalided home, or started in Territorials or even Kitchener's Army, you could get on quicker, specially by waiting for the 2nd Line Territorials where it would not be so difficult even to become Major.</p>
<p>However that is impossible for me as I started as a Special Reserve Subaltern as they get a reasonable training and go to better units.</p>
<p>Regarding what one does its much the same for us, the last four months we have been almost continuously in action, which is rare for cavalry units like we are.</p>
<p>As we are mobile, however we get many shifts and moving jobs although otherwise our guns and work in the line is the same as the field artillery:  the moving jobs are wire cutting, sniping with guns up close, detached guns to draw fire &amp; attention away from batteries and so on to make the Germans shell bogus positions to annoy them.  Really the work is not worth telling off, and in many instances are depressing even to remember.</p>
<p>Goodbye Mrs. John for today &ndash; with best of luck &amp; health to the three of you.  I got the photo of 'Little John' &ndash; how that boy has grown tremendously.</p>
<p>Cheer ho! across the foam.</p>
<p>Ever yours sincerely<br/>John Chute Ellis</p>
<p>I have got all your letters except No. 4, I think any address finds one &ndash; Ind. Cav. Div. the Best, B.E.F.</p>
