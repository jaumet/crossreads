not like the idea of travelling on Christmas .   Great preparations on for our dinner here & would be sorry to miss it.   Frost still on but the thaw commenced during the day.   Had a 5 mile walk after 4 this afternoon & it was beautiful coming home in the moonlight over the snow.   Orders out now which definitely make dispensers Staff Sgts so that it will surely come to me now without anymore delay.   Heard a report this evening that the referendum was going for No, it made me feel quite bad.
Sunday 23rd Dec   Very cold frost on.   Went by car to the 15th Field Amb to collect drugs which they had drawn for the division.   Had a few minutes in "Samer" & returned in time for tea.
Monday 24th Dec   Christmas Eve.   Worked hard making mixtures etc for the Battalions & sorting out their requirements for issue with the car in the morning.   Had a bad bilious turn so did not feel at all jovial.   Thaw set
