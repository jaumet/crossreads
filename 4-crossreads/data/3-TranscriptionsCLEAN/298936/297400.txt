  
 September 1915 
 Wednesday 1 
 Put on job at outpatients dept. as L. Corp: off every afternoon. 
 Meals at N.C.O.'s mess which is very nice. 
 Piloted down the Wassa district by an infantry man & vastly surprised at what I saw. 
 Rather a disappointed afternoon. 
 Likely to leave for front any day. 
 Rather depressed at not receiving letters at all, especially from Rita. 
 Heleopolis is a new clean [indecipherable] suburb of Cairo. Only built a few years where once was a desert.
