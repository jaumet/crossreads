<p>one Captain.  He is a rotter but the men hoot him &amp; throw rocks on his house &amp; if he goes down to the wharf he is greeted with cat calls &amp; cock-a-doodle-doos.  He wants to drill us before 7 a.m. but our Sergeant takes us all down for a swim &amp; so does him in.  Billy is well &amp; is at present helping in the surgery where he was sliced up.  Two of our tent mates are on the washing party to-day, i.e., washing sheets &amp; pyjamas, towels, etc.  So I got one of them to wash some of my clothes.  Ellis has just brought a bucket of hot water so I will go &amp; wash my handkerchiefs &amp; a couple of other things that I have left.</p>
<p>Well I will close now &amp; Hoping to be home some time next week &amp; Hoping also that you are getting along alright in this hot rainless weather.</p>
<p>I Remain<br/>Yours Lovingly<br/>Harry only</p>
