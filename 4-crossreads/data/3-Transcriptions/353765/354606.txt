<p>June 1916<br/>5th &ndash; the Defence, Warrior &amp; Black Prince &copy; &amp; eight destroyers. Ten German ships known to have been sunk, &amp; more very probably also sunk. Total of 15 believed sunk. B.C. squad. Engaged German High Seas fleet, when they attempted to break the blockade &amp; fought it. When our Battle fleet appeared Germans imshied &amp; evidently chased on to their own minefields as some (2) of their best boats blown up. Aust main in. Usual letters papers etc.<br/>[Note in margin:] Tuesday<br/>6th &ndash; Busy squaring up. Wild rumours of another big naval battle. Germans supposed to have been enticed out of Elbe &amp; rushed on to their own minefields losing 50 ships more or less. Nothing authentic. Letter from Jeannie &amp; Bert yesty. A letter of mine recently sent thro P.O. blocked &amp; returned. Consequences amusing.<br/>7th &ndash; Heard that man with <strike>fractured</strike> shattered jaw from Bomb wound died. Inoculated again. Paratyphoid this time. Wrote Dad Mater, Molly &amp; also a baksheesh tart in Tasmania, a Miss Henry of Ulverstone.<br/>8th &ndash; Rumours re Kitchener being drowned, heard very early in morning &amp; reports later in day confirmed it. Supposed he &amp; his staff aboard cruiser "Hampshire" &amp; she sank off Orkney Islands. Kitchener enroute to Russia. Feared all lost. Our luck seems dead out. News appeared to be incredible &amp; men absolutely refused to believe it. Rotten end for one who had such abilities &amp; had done so much. At present, nothing known as to what caused cruiser to sink. Nothing official yet received. Hear that B'de thought my letter amusing</p>
