 I fancy that it will not be long before Newmarch returns to Australia.  Cairo is not much of a place for women unless they be old stagers, or walk about the streets as material, in human for, upon which to hang clothes. 
 I should love to have one or all of you with me were the circumstances other than they are, but no one knows what will turn up next, nor to where one may be ordered next, therefore Australia is one of the best places wherein to reside in this year of grace 1915 A.D.   Jerome looks after me first class;  it is a man's job and he fills the place well, I fancy that his people will find him to be much improved by his time away, he has even been saving money.    Last week he sent home several presents to his family.   He was awfully flattered and pleased at the letter which you wrote to him, and which was brought to him to day. 
 For the mens clothes and all the other accessories we have sterilisers and native washerman, and all other things necessary.  Jerom gets my things attended to by natives at so much per month, and there is no trouble in that regard.   I bought myself a new pair of boots this morning in Cairo, if they be as good as they look they were very cheap at 85 piasters, i.e. about seventeen shillings.  The pair I bought at Higgs just before leaving are amongst the best I have ever bought, for the first time to day I sent them to be newly soled, and they cost but 17 shillings, I have often paid him 45 shillings for boots that were not half as good. 
 A letter came from Buddie this morning.  I shall hardly be able to answer it by the outgoing mail which closes here tomorrow about 4 p.m.; The Orsova is the ship I think that will carry this and other posted matter.   I wonder is Weston still on board? 
 I received a note recently from Mrs. Franki to which I must send an answer soon.   As you have written she is a dear old girl.   Her boys have turned out to be a trouble, none of them ever exhibited any sense that I know of, clever enough they appear to be when it is a question of examinations.   I certainly never expected that Noel would get through his examinations.   She was very much concerned about the girl he intends to marry.   The girl is probably good enough for him, unless he has altered considerably. 
 Several bundles of papers have reached me recently.  Please accept my thanks and convey them to Mrs Franki from me; they have kept Jerom and me fairly well up to the happenings at your end.  The treatment of Mr Holman at the Stadium and the Exhebition build is somewhat inexplicable to me, at either place he should have been in favour.  Some where I learned that the trouble was the sequel to some action which he took in regard to the totalisator bill.  Is this so?   I wrote him a note telling him that I was sorry to read of the event.  I must weigh at the first opportunity, but I am sure that I have picked up much of
