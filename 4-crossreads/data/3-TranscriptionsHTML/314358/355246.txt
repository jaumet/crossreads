<p>To feel that the finger tips of death are not close thrust towards one through day and night</p>
<p>To fall to sleep with the full satisfaction of knowing that neither bomb nor shell will break in to shatter or to slay.</p>
<p>To see and feel and know all this is blessedness itself.</p>
<p>At first there is a strangeness about it all, which rather bears the resemblance of a dream.</p>
<p>The mind wonders how men and women and children can exist as they do, apparently quite unconscious of the war.</p>
<p>Does it matter to them that men are being broken and blown to pieces up there, that men are enduring maddening terror, suffering and fearing.</p>
<p>Yes the mind wonders in this manner for a while.</p>
<p>But not the mind of each</p>
<p>Then in a little while one fails to remember intensely. The scenes of up yonder become faint.</p>
<p>Resilient nature takes poise and finds temper for the recreation of her normal cheerfulness and desire for freedom from care</p>
