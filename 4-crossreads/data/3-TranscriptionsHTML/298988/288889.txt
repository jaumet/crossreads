<p>July 4th (Sunday)  Arrived &amp; anchored at Greenhythe in the Thames at 7 a.m.  Went ashore 11 a.m. &amp; got a train to Cannon St Station, London, 16 miles further up the Thames.  Beautiful green fields &amp; hedges all the way along &amp; they looked magnificent it being a nice spring day.  Had lunch in the city &amp; got in the Tube Railway &amp; shifted to somewhere or other, then got on top of several buses &amp; had a look about.  Saw Bow Bells Church, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Commons &amp; Lords &amp; St Paul's Cathedral where the pigeons feed out of your hand.  Also saw the City of Londons only tree, Nelsons Monument in Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace &amp; Cleopatras Needle all the way from Egypt.  Of course also had to go &amp; see Piccadilly &amp; Leicester Square &amp; the Tipperary bar.</p>
<p>July 5th  Today being my birthday anniversary (I suppose it was on that account) I spent it busy with customs people.  A man is very near pested to death with them in this Country.  However I got ashore late in the afternoon &amp; spent it there till midnight</p>

I think that a man would need to become suddenly paralysed to get run over here.</p>
<p>July 6th  Went ashore 2 p.m. with the Captain.  We got a Taxi &amp; drove around the City, through Hyde park &amp; Rotten Row &amp; also saw the smallest house in London, and</p>
