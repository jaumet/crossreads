<p>of collecting a few things. Must try &amp; save money &amp; then buy necessaries. I had a day in Cairo on Wednesday. Two of us left by the 6 a.m. train &amp; returned by 6.15 p.m. train &ndash; it was a rush also very tiring, shall not do it often. Did a little shopping in the morning, luncheon at Shepheard's &amp; spent the afternoon at The Empire Nurses' Club entertaining my friends &ndash; some of the sisters who have just returned from transport. We were very tired next day but went to bed early so soon got over it. It was much warmer in Cairo &ndash; glad we are here. It is fairly warm but nothing like last year's heat. Had a nice letter from Consie Murray &amp; Dorothy this week. Consie is not very happy but Dorothy rather likes it &amp; wishes I was there - <u>not more than I do</u>. &ndash; It is only 3 weeks since my dear boy left &amp; it seems years, also no cable nor letter yet.
