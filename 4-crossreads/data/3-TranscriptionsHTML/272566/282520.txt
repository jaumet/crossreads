<p>Sunday 18 March</p>
<p>Up at 6 a.m.  Left Bellevue Farm at 7 a.m. marched to Meaulte Railway Siding and entrained here.  On arriving at Bernafay Wood we were put into a hut where we remained all day.<br/>The quietness here now is very remarkable.  No guns are to be seen anywhere.  We do not go out to the line until tomorrow.  Observation Balloon taken up to Delville Wood, along the road.  Men walked along the road holding the ropes while the balloon floated along in the air.</p>
