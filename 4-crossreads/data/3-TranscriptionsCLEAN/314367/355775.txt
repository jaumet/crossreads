  
 they tell me to get a discount but I thought differently & got it by patient talking & a silvery tongue - The days fly - unloading a warship - you wont  be surprised to hear that my Stoker friend Darmody is adrift again - All goes here just as at sea - Liberty men fall in & get leave from 4.30 pm to 7 am - Darmody we noticed was shaven & polished up & in great spirits - His stay of leave had run out at sea - He was adrift with the P of W you'll remember - He was cautioned to turn up - "Yes Sir - I'll be most careful - I'll not miss the boat Sir" - Darmody has been away - for certain - 24 hours - I fear that the world, the flesh, & the Pub are far too strong for Darmody - Did I mention that at Matusi, one of the bunkers got jammed - This was due to Darmody trying to introduce a native maiden thro the port hole when he should have been working in his bunker - Fitz  has gone to Melbourne to see the Naval Board on business - My future is quite undecided - I shall go for a drop of leave on Saty - We travel free now so that's a bit of all right =
