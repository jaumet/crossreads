Le Sars Shaved in bunk in a messy fashion and once more feel unwell owing to this dugout life and the rotten feeling of nausea that the vitiated air in these places always gives me.

Went over to Duggan at the line headquarters passing over snow covered ground, a clear sun shining but a wind that was below or at any rate little over zero. Men at work with pick and shovel filling sandbags with ice in order to use it for making tea. "Getting a bag full of water" as one put it. An excellent trench and a fine dugout as HQ .. Not far off is a good O.P. and artillery officers were doing a shoot. The village of Le Sars is the usual mass of ruins. From here we look right over Bosche lines and can see him moving about freely. The whole scene is dominated by the Butte de Warlencourt an old tumulus or burial place which is about 50 feet
