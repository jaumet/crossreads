 The weather is getting fresher now. I don't know that there is much more to mention so will close at present.  My letter to Mum tomorrow may not be a very long one if at all, for the mail has not come along yet. 
 I hope you are in the pink of condition, going strong at all points 
 Fondest regards from 
 Your affectionate cousin 
 Jim
