<p>[13th April contd]<br/>returned safely  Wrote to home etc in Coffee stall in the "evacuated" area Houplines.  Was just hopping into bed when word came that I was to proceed to Houplines again with the night working party &amp; get the bricks.  We drove down as far as it was safe to go in with Waggons.  Then each wagon was to dash along the road on its own &ndash; with ten minutes interval.  Arriving at the post we loaded very fast &amp; got away again smoothly as Fritz sprays machine guns on the post occasionally.  However things passed O.K. &amp; we proceeded to Steenwerck where the building a huge Dressing Station was in progress.  We eventually got back to billets at 3.30 am &amp; had breakfast then bed.  Houplines by the way is in Belgium.</p>
<p>Saturday 14th [April]<br/>Our slumber was rudely awakened at about 8.30 by the whizzing of shrapnel &amp; perhaps nose caps and as the roof was only Ruberoid I thought it best to get up &amp; put my tin helmet on.  On investigating I found that a Fritzs aeroplane was about 100 ft above us &amp; soldiers in streets had a machine gun (Lewis) &amp; rifles playing on him but without effect.  Aircraft shrapnel was going dangerously low too.  He got away.<br/><u> Afternoon</u>   Visited Divisional Baths &amp; had a 'bon' bath.</p>
