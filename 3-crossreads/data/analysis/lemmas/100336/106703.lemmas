 were n't game to face them although we were so hungri . So we went well clear of the town and select a spot to spend the night after eat half the raw onion between us we lay down to sleep. the weari night away , footsor , raven hungri and dead tire . I do n't think either of us will ever forget the night we spent just outsid the old citi of Tarsus when we share half a raw onion , the remaind we kept for breakfast . At daylight we were awak and ate the remain half onion . Veri few peopl in Australia know what it is to be proper hungri . I know I did not until that occas and I never do want to again . We had not gone far when we sight the Tarsus river , ( The Seihun R. ) a small rapid run stream . The next thing that troubl us was how to cross it . Howev we found a place where we thought we would be abl to cross . It was the widest part and for this reason we thought it would be the shallowest We ship off and wade into the stream . The water was bitter cold . We were just abl to wade over without be swept off our feet . A littl higher up the river we could see soldier with pack hors draw water from the river so we knew there was a camp close . We pass well clear of them .

The Turk were veri particular that none of us should meet for what reason we could not find out . It was a parti of these men that we want to find for we knew that we would get food of some kind . We made off in the direct which we thought the railway was . We had not gone far when we came to a small creek and we notic three men sat down . They were dri some cloth on the bush . Immediat they saw us one of them came toward us . He ask us who we were . On this occas I do n't know whi , we repli that we were Austrian . He said he was a Greek and his two friend were Austrian . Naturalis Turk have live in Turkey all their live . We thought that at last we had made a blunder , we decid to tell the Greek who we were , which we did . He was great surpris and so were we when he commenc speak to us in fair good English . He said he would not tell the other who we were . He said they were great friend of his . They had been work on the railway for sometim togeth . They had just been on a visit to Tarsus . The first thing we did was to ask the Greek for some food . He said he had plenti just have left Tarsus that morn . He gave us a big piec of bread each and a good portion of chees . I will
