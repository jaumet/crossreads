8th September. Saturday
All day with the 28th Brigade, 2nd Division, near Renescue. Col. Reid gave me every assistance in his power and arranged routine drill for the camera Cine. The men are practically all W. Australians. Their training reflects credit on their commanding officer, the men are well disciplined, their evolutions resembling a great machine. They performed exercises with the bayonet, Physical drill, Lewis gun exercise, Signal Exercise etc. with a perfectness only attained by continued training rigid discipline. The men are in fine fettle will give an account of themselves in the very near future. Wintry conditions are beginning. The leaves are turning Autumn tints the atmosphere is assuming the typical fogginess of winter. The Hay is being stacked the ground retilled. The country looks beautiful.
