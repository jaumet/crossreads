<p>It has been another lovely day &amp; the old tub is making quite good progress.  She is averaging just on 12 Knots an hour which is far better than any of us ever thought she would raise.<br/>Saw some big waterspouts just before dinner today they went away up in to the air &amp; then followed a heavy downpour of rain, there is land in sight tonight on our starboard, fancy it must be the coast of Algiers.<br/>They are putting a stop as far as they can to all gambling on board &amp; quite right too for wherever you look there are schools of "two up" crown &amp; anchor, dice roulette &amp; etc., this sort of thing is all right in a way but there are too many sharks who are living on the game for in our returning 1914 men we have numbers of wasters who have scarce fired a shot in this war &amp; this sort of thing if allowed to flourish is a regular harvest to such as they, so down with them by all means.</p>
