27th July 1915
To The O.C. "C" Coy
from Captain [P.J. Murphy?]
Report on N.C.O.'s of No 12 platoon.
Sir.
In accordance with your instructions and acting in consultation with Platoon Sergt. Norris, in the absence of Lt. Shaw, I beg to submit my report on the N.C.O.s of No 12 platoon
X Platoon Sergt. Norris
An ideal platoon sergeant. Perfect control, smart & reliable always. In any ticklish job, I would recommend him in the certainty that it would be carried out as well as any N.C.O. could do it.
X Sgt Mc.Clure
A good reliable man. Lacks dash and initiative. If asked told to carry out a job requires too many particulars, as to how it should be done. Health not too good, would never recommend him to act as platoon Sergt.
