  
 France 19.7.1917 My dear Father & Mother, 
 I fear this letter must appear frightfully dull. Fact is, the same old war topics still fill the day, and I am sure you don't want to hear these -    We having been having a pretty rough spin lately, not in the way of fighting so much as being constantly changing position, and all means work work, work, constructing gun pits etc - 
 We always look forward to a good long spell out of the line to do some training but of course something is always doing
