  
 Sunday 11 August Our front lies about 800-1000 yards east of the village of L&ecirc;hon, about five kilos along this road, Nesle-Amiens. Last night or this morning our people moved up again some distance capturing a few prisoners, some M.G.s & about six 77's. Fritz replied with heavy shelling especially about here & our casualties were three, Groves, Ridgeway (serious) & Sgt. McRae.  Also Sgt. Sellers was hit whilst we were coming in last afternoon.  All day Fritz has been shelling the ridge ahead of us & his planes have been active downing one of balloons.  Our people brought down two of his 'planes in flames yesterday on this sector. Possibly move up further to-night & it is rumoured that there is a big stunt in the morning. 
 Monday 12 August Last night was fairly quiet, except for the four 6 inch guns in front of us, about fifty yards from us. Fritz shelled a bit using gas & H.E. but not much, last night & to-day. The stunt did not come off. Australian mail very welcome. Another casualty.  Prewer wounded, making five to date in this salient.
