Built when people were not in a hurry set in very fine grounds. Quite a good Zoo. Australia is well represented & the 'Roos etc look very well & have plenty of room. Went on to the Memorial It is some clime but well worth while one sees right down the valley over suburbs part of Town & harbour & out to see. The Memorial is plane & massive with a bronze Bust of Rhodes guarded by two huge lions There was a very takeing little Tearoom behind the Memorial  of  as usual we were hungary but were doubtful if we could finance a feed. Decided to risk it They did us very well & being quite cheap our cash stood the strain. Only have 6d left tonight & it is borrowed
