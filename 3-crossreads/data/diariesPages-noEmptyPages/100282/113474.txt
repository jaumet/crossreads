only have seen the push falling over one another the NCO's myself getting boxed up, but we got the grip of it at the finish
Lens promotion was read out today also Sid Harris McKeowns.
This afternoon I reckon our officers done the most unsportsmanlike thing as ever I have seen, there are 2 football grounds here, 1 of them was allotted for a game of Soccer the other for Rugby, the officers were playing Rugby but when they got down to their ground they thought it was too wet so they decided to come up to the other ground where the Soccer match was in progress, so up they come after a terrific argument they hunted the players off, the chaps called them for everything I believe, then left the ground in a body. This I reckon was a dirty rotten piece of work instead of encouraging sport they are going the right way about things to kill it properly
