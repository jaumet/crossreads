<p>I wasn't in it, I'm water cart driver &amp; water carts weren't wanted in the procession.  It seems a lowly job &amp; I'd rather be in a gun team but there are better drivers than I in the battery &amp; a water cart is very necessary &amp; some one has to drive it.  So I'm not growling.  It has compensations.</p>
<p>I have seen Alison twice, also Martin Gibbins who looks splendid.  I'm sorry I didn't see him again but we have so little spare time.</p>
<p>I haven't seen old Duncan but I hear he'll be out here soon.</p>
