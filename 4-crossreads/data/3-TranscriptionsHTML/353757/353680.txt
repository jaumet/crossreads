<p>Dear Vol,</p>
<p>I received your letter and delayed replying on account of pressure of work, - nearly 2 a.m. every day &ndash; worse, - much worse than campaigning in the political arena.</p>
<p>I received printed matter and other particulars in ample time before the election, and same had my attention.  Coming back to camp late one night, I saw a man from the P.L.L. giving out "How to vote" slips, and immediately buttoned him.  He said they would not let him in, so I volunteered to distribute for him.  This I did, first writing on each &ndash; "If you live in Nepean, vote Molesworth".</p>
<p>I was extremely sorry to see that all the work of your supporters, and more on account of the immense amount of work you yourself put in, <strike>that it</strike> was of no avail;  you did well, however, and it is a cert for you next time.  I hope to be able to assist you.</p>
<p>Regarding any business you can fix up for some of my wives during my absence, I would say you should know that moderation in everything is one of my characteristics.  I have only one wife, and have asked her to communicate with you re Starr-Bowkett, Will, or Shares, should she be puzzled at any time.  If you could assist her at any time, your best friend would appreciate it.</p>
<p>Would like to see you or hear from you ere my departure, sort of "Look for last", feeling.</p>
<p>Remember me to your parents and sisters, and remember me your friend, -</p>
<p>A. Hine</p>
