28.9.16I was fortunate enough to get a tent to myself here, I dine in with the R.S.M. Frost, & have mats all over the floor, a table & a bed in my own tent & as I brought a blanket with me from Romani I should be comfortable. We had a decent trip across, & as the day was cool it would have been good only we got a fair amount of dust; put in some hard work at stables this afternoon making some improvement on the horse lines.
