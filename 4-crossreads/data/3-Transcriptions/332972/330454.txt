<p>[Continued from page 39]<br/>Letter to Harvey Protest of old Internees<br/>25/3 19 To the Official Visitor. Re internees over 45 years of age, who by agreement with Great Britain wher to be repatriated over 2 years ago. I wishe to bring under your notice the following: In this Camp are some hunderts of men above that age, suposed  to have gone from these shores over 2 years ago. Day in day out we hear  &amp;  read about liberty, humanity, civilication, christianity,  solemn treaty-obligations ectra. All this nauceating prattle seems to be intendet to catch the unwary  &amp;  the fools. Here in this Camp are hunderts of men, who haive done no wrong but for accident of birth being incarcerated, very many for over 4 years,  &amp;  who by solemn treaty were to be sett at liberty over 2 years ago, still have to endure the indignities  &amp;  degredation worse than criminals. Even those Australians captured by the German auxcilary cruiser "Wolf" have returned to Australia still We are hier. Shurly if the Australian Government knows something of the truth "wanted fair play" it would have found  &amp;  will find new ways  &amp;  means get us away, We who are only too glad to shake the dust of this country from our shoes. I trust your Honor will bring this matter to the notice of the authorities again we sincerely hope speedily to see the last of this inferno. Yours respectfully Serpenthat 5 Co. 2 Messe.</p>
