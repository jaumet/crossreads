<p>16.5.15<br/>Sun. 16th.  Last night the boys in the trenches thought the Turks were charging once or twice, but nothing happened.  The noise of the guns affect us not a scrap &amp; we (signallers) did not wake till sunrise.  We are all supposed to stand to arms at 4 a.m. every morning, but we have escaped it so far.  Paddy Moy of B Troop was shot dead this morning, he was shot through the left eye, he was a fine fellow &amp; very popular, he received a D.C.M. in the South African War.  The 1st L.H. are holding the extreme left of the trenches, &amp; are consequently farthest inland;  we are about 4 miles from the beach.  It was reported yesterday that six German Submarines succeeded in getting into the Meditteranean Sea.  We have a grand view from here looking</p>
