 18/8/19 A fine day. Boxing in the afternoon. This journey has now entered into its monotonous stage. The sea blue and calm and greatly in contrast with last week. All kit bags issued today for Customs Declarations. 
 19/8/19 The question of fresh water wants looking after as the troops waste a lot. 28 tons daily is the allowance. 47 we used the other day. Inspection found all pleased and contented today. Weather has much to do with morale. Rolling waves this afternoon. Band playing Evening Concert.
