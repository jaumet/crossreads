<p>31/5/17 Bouzincourt<br/>Formed up at 9.30 and carried out a few rifle exercises prior to the companies carrying on with their specialist work. Switched a few surplus officers on to the Lewis gun under an instructor. Found another small parade ground after a pleasant town round leafy shady winding lanes. The grass full of the hum of bees and no sound or sign of the War. Later saw a poor old demented woman walking in long grass under trees raving &ndash; her 4 sons are all dead. A pretty futile business. Bombers, signallers and scouts all hard at work on the job. The guns were firing live stuff on the range. N.C.O.s class putting in some instruction. Dr MacMahon took Craig's place.</p>
