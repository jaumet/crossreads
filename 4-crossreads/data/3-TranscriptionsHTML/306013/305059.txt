<p>After breakfast I met Les Dimond &amp; had a short chat with him. Later in the morning all the new-comers had an inspection parade &amp; after that we were given a new web-equipment in place of the one which we had brought from Australia.</p>
<p>The weather is rather cold just now. Ice &amp; snow abound everywhere. The taps a frozen up &amp; in order to wash we have to get some ice out of the water-troughs &amp; melt it on our hut stove. However everything seems to indicate that we will have a very happy time here.</p>
<p>After tea Alan &amp; I visited the Y.M.C.A. Camp Hall and spent an enjoyable evening there. It contains a canteen, writing tables, billiards &amp; concert hall etc. etc. &amp; is nice &amp; warm &amp; cosy, having a fine large stove in the centre. We were just in time to hear a very good concert there.</p>
<p>I was almost forgetting to note that we received our first mail today at dinner-time.</p>
