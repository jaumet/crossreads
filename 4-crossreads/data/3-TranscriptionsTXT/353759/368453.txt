 132 Tonight"s mail "Responsibilities" by Yeats and a letter from Phyllis. 
 133   May 1 Yesterday"s morning parade &ndash; Prizes 3 for each section for the "nicestly dressed".  Paddy a winner and all his boys borrowed:  result &ndash; he"d a day off.  Consequently leave to Amiens &ndash; and he"s not back yet. 
 Today parade at 2 full pack and gun up &ndash; all stuff left in Marquee [indecipherable] &hellip;.  Michael Hunt, M.C., again doubly proved himself an active member of a family barren of marriage for the last century. 
 134 Reading lately the short tales in Tagore"s "Hungry Stones".  Of short stories though almost all take their place with any of the great short stories.  "Victory" and "Life and Death" are beautiful and "Life &amp; Death" all terrible. 
 135 Sunday morning Toby, Clarrie, Nick, Murph and self started out to walk to 'where Thiepval was, and dead men are":  Nick and self discoursed on little green patch and lay savouring this hour &ndash; while the others went horror hunting. 
 136   May 2 A big stunt"s in the air:  the oil is, and has been since Sunday, that 1000000 men are 'going over" &ndash; 20000000 in support and on a 90 mile front.

 At 5 p.m. squads were made out, Billy, Hagan, Max and self.  By 9 we were in the second sunken road in the fighting area, alongside an aid post waiting again.  In a cloud of gas that the Boche sent over, Hagan and Medcalfe were gassed &ndash; so the squad broken.
