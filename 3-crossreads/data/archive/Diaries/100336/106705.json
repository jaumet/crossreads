We were marched off the verandah before we had gone far we were called back and after the Commandant and police officer held a short consultation the ropes were taken off us and we were locked in a spare room next to the commandant's office.  The room was infested with mice.  There was a hole in the wall close to my head and I amused myself trying to catch the mice as they went in and out of this hole.  Eventually I caught one by the tail just as his body disappeared.  I could not pull her out but kept letting her go as far as I could in the hole and then pulling it out with a jerk.
