<p>This was received in absolute silence but after lunch I pointed out that the situation was changed  -  We were not hosts <u>at all</u> but were asked as guests  -  In the long run this view obtained &ndash; I said it wd be discourteous to Commander Cumberledge &amp; Captain Warren &amp; Stoker &amp; others not to accept this invitation &amp; regard all else as washed out  -<br/>Of course there was the usual discussion but all came right &amp; the lot of us went save those necessary for the ships watch  -  Two launches went from the beach at 8 pm &amp; our own launch pushed off at 7.30  -  Several ladies were most unpunctual &amp; got blessed by the Officer under their breath but by 8.30 we were all aboard the Destroyers  -  The 3 had been lashed together  -  The Yarra was in the centre &amp; a stage had been rigged aft &amp; draped with palms &amp; flags  -  Each Destroyer has a complement of some 86 men so the work went forward merrily</p>
