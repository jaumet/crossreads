Wiesbaden
Slept in this morning and then took a bath in the saline waters of the town down in the hotel basement. Promenaded after breakfast in the Kurpark which stretches for more than a mile back from the Kurhaus. Here the trees are delightfully green with the young shoots of Spring, the grass is spangled with daffodils and the garden is well tended by curators. It is in the garden arrangements that this place surpasses Monte Carlo. I did not reach the end of the gardens and evidently they continue until the green fields come. Walked back to the Wilhelmstrasse and was looking in a shop window when Herr and Frau Gesswein came up and took me off for a 'smile". Cracked a bottle of Rhine wine and ate a couple of sardines on Kriegs-bread. Then went with Herr to a Biergarten snugly concealed behind a barber's shop
