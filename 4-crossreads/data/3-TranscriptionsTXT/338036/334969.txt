 [16th Oct. contd] advised travelling back by 8.0 train from Abbeville.  In the meantime I could have a look round &amp; finding the YMCA I left my coat &amp; proceeded to investigate the place.  The Abbey &amp; Cathedral are excellent buildings.  The town was quite busy &ndash; many civilians were shopping etc.  The river Somme runs thro the town &amp; at this point is very pretty.  Called at YMCA again at 7.0 &amp; caught the 8.0 pm train from Abbeville to Noyelles &ndash; changed &ndash; thence to Cayeax &amp; from there I stumped it back to Camp.  Reported at guard room.
