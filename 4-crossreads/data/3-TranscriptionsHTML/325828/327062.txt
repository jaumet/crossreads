<p>The elder brother later on went to Hawkesbury College, and when War broke out was an Assistant Experimentalist in New Zealand somewhere.  He came away with a Commission in one of the N.Z. Infantry Battalions, and Sid got word here not long ago that he had just been killed on the Armentieres front.  I got Sid into the Office here (after the S.H.S. he went in for Surveying and was also a Draughtsman) as Mail Orderly, and what spare time we have, we spend it in roaming over the countryside together.<br/>There are some magnificent views round here and the English Scenery is really lovely as you know yourself.<br/>And that brings me on to the next topic; after a lot of serious thinking I realised that the War has so altered and twisted things about that I decided to give up the thoughts of ever getting married, more so lately as I see very clearly that to be an efficient Pilot, a man doesn't want to hampered, so to speak, with a wife and family.  I have got my life work in front of me at this game, and I am going to become a Pilot, if it takes me ten years which I don't think it will.  However at the same time that I wrote to Ol, I wrote to Joan telling her how things were and practically ending it for good and for all.  No doubt she thought it pretty rotten of me, but it is no good keeping a girl hanging on and on, so I put an end to it.<br/>And now thank goodness, I am too taken up with my work to trouble the question of marriage.  In a lot of ways I think I have altered a good deal since I left Australia, as you will notice when I arrive back home, unless I succeed in cracking my neck, whilst fluttering about in the air.<br/>Flying is absolutely the finest sport going, Father; everything else seems tame by the side of it.  There is nothing that can thrill the blood so much as being up in the air.  I was so glad to hear from your letter that Walter was so much better, and I only hope that the good progress continues<br/><u>Mother.</u>  Thank you so much for your interesting letter to hand yesterday,  By this mornings mail I received a pair of brown knitted socks; I don't know when they were despatched but probably just after your letter as you speak of a pair drying by the dining-room fire.  I only wish I could get a peep at you all at home there, but I suppose I wouldn't be satisfied with merely a "peep".  Like every one else I am heartily sick of the whole thing, &amp; am looking forward to the day when we leave for home again.<br/>We have been having awful weather here for some weeks past now,- heavy driving rain with strong S.W. Winds.  The mud round the camp is awful, but I suppose I must not growl, for things are infinitely worse over the other side of the Channel.<br/>We have at present something like 150 Hun prisoners working round the Camp at different jobs- making roads, drains etc.  The work the Authorities are putting into the Aerodrome here, is very substantial and is intended to be permanent.  One or two of the Huns who can speak English fluently are absolutely convinced that it is only a matter of time before all the extensive works at which they are now engaged will fall into the hands of Germany.  There is one phase of this prisoner question that personally I think is an absolute disgrace to, England.  A few weeks ago these prisoners were being paid at the rate of 1/6 per day.  Evidently they reckoned they were treated badly, for they actually WENT ON STRIKE, and refused to do a stroke of work unless they were paid higher wages.  As a result, they are now getting 2/3 per day (1/3 from the Govt. and 1/- from the contractors.  While they are getting this rate of pay, the average British Tommy is fighting over in France for the princely sum of 1 /2  per day.  Mind you they have huts exactly the same as we do, fitted with electric light, and stoves etc and get exactly the same food as we are issued with, so that the biggest part of their earnings is hoarded up and eventually will find its way back to Germany, to be used perhaps, against the very people who were fools enough to pay it.  I am not saying anything against the prisoners being paid wages, but it a Scandal that they should be getting so much, whilst our own Tommies are only getting their 1 /2 to 1/6 a day.<br/>I am keeping in splendid health and am feeling ever so much better than when I was in London; the air up here is so much fresher and purer, and is really very beneficial.  I must thank Ol very much for those snaps that she enclosed in her last letter to me.  I am getting a fine collection of photos from home and am very proud to have them.<br/>I must wish you all Good-night now, hoping this finds you all in the best of health, and that Wally is still making good progress with the arm,<br/>With love to all at home,<br/>Your loving,<br/>Leo.<br/>R 11.10.17</p>
