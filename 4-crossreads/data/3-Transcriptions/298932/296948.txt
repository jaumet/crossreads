<p>Monday 3<br/>A great battle is raging troops running to and fro. All night long I have been listening to the fierce bombardment<br/>Tuesday 4<br/>A glorious day with a lull on the battle front not a sound to be heard, excepting a tune "Dixie", from the band<br/>Wednesday 5<br/>Basking in the sun with a stook of hay for a pillow, my thoughts are good and my mind content<br/>Thursday 6<br/>They are fighting like hell, the big guns are roaring unceasingly "Ah" it is cruel.</p>
