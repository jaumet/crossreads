<p>two days after I haven't any ambition that way unless I win them I don't want them that is my way of looking at it.  I was told this evening Oram was getting a commission I don't know what truth there is in it one hears so many reports.  Fancy Orchard turning up at Liverpool he is a gentleman of many sides isent he.  The public shall have to be careful or they will loose some of their belongings.  As for the other [indecipherable] nothing I heard of him would surprise me.  I expect he stays in one place until he makes things too hot then moves on.  I have a letter here from Dick Bell he is working in the Commercial Bank Dubbo he said he thought Wallace was going into camp about the end of the month.  Alick is very keen on enlisting but said they wouldent pass him on account of his age.  I don't suppose Aunt would give him consent.  He said he thought his Father was going to sell out with a view to going to Queensland.  Alick said the land wasent very good to him.  Too much hard work &amp; no return I think Narran would break</p>
