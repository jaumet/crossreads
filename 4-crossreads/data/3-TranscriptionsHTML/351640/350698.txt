<p>Extra sheet<br/>P.S.  I hope that in case of necessity, or indeed that sometimes you speak to Mr Finney at the bank, about your finances, he will be your best guide, and in the interests of the bank to whom I owe most money he will act for yours and their <strike>best</strike> advantage, at the very worst you should be able to struggle through for a couple of years, what, after that, will happen, none can tell.</p>
<p>It has been announced, &amp; probably correctly, that the Federal Parliament has passed a law providing pensions for the widow &amp; younger children of men who may lose their lives during the course of the war.  If so &amp; such fate should be mine, it may be that your Mother will be provided for.  All depends on the clauses in the act.  I have written to Mr Watkins asking that he will be so good as to send to me a copy of the act of Parliament.  Under my will there is no provision for your Mother.</p>
<p>The grey pyjamas that you Joe were good enough to make for me have been very serviceable &amp; comfortable.  I like the stud and catch much better than the button &amp; button hole.  This sentence should have been on the other sheet, but I did not note "extra sheet" on the top when I began to write</p>
