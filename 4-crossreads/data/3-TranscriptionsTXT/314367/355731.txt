In the evening I went to the Warrego & talked to Cumberledge - Commander D - He's the oldest man in Destroyers - 14 years - He showed me a lot of things he had collected bracelets - hair combs - necklaces - He knows a good deal & is very interested - I spoke to him about the Sea scapes we had seen & he was very enthusiastic - He said it beat Alpine for in the Alps unless you were on a summit the view was limited but in sea scape the tremendous infinite fading distance impresses one immensely -I asked him if his nerve failed in a Destroyer & he said - not - so far - He said I am very cautious - In navigation in strange waters I take very possible precaution - I take no chance at all - Of course in war time you have to take risks but there's no good even then rushing at a stone wall - He said Englishmen had great caution - innate in them -
