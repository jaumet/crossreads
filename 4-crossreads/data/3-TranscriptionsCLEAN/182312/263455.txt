as it does through the garden county of Kent.  A pretty little
village here abouts is Orpington.  It had never occurred to me that
our well known domestic hen had received her name from the village of
her origin.  But here she is in thousands, supplying the British
breakfast table with eggs at 4/9 per dozen.  The whole village appears to be given up to poultry (which is not hard to understand
with eggs at that price) and the arrangements of the runs and shelters
appear to be on a model plan and one which should leave no room for
complaint from the hens.  In the days when eggs were plentiful,
before the Zeppelins came over and put the hens off their lay, nobody
would buy an egg that wasn't a fair size, but nowadays they are not
sorted and one has to take the small with the big.  Whether the
poultry farmers are taking advantage of this and exploiting a breed
of hen which will lay two small eggs ber day instead of one large one
I don't know, but the proportion of small eggs seems to be on the
increase.  Some of them look as if they had been laid by a Willy
Wagtail, and rattle about in your egg cup in a most elusive fashion.
And when you do manage to secure him and cut a slice off the top
sufficient to insert a spoon, you find there is nothing left of the
egg!  We are delayed a day at Folkestone whilst the mine sweepers get
busy.  Fritzland had made one of his destroyer raids the night before
and it was thought that possibly he may have left a few mines behind.
The route is at last declared clear and away we go leaving the darkened
shores of England behind at the rate of over 20 knots.  On either
side of us can just be discerned the long low hulls of our convoy
racing along on a parallel course to our own.  Soon we are in France,
and now the rush begins.  Officers and men are here who are bound
for every position of the British line - from the Sea to the Somme.
Perhaps their unit has been moved since they left it.  Where is it now?
