 Several Taubes came over today & a party of us narrowly missed being smashed We were standing on the dump when we heard a shell hissing towards us. We dropped down behind a  sand bag wall &  it just missed the top striking earth a few yards away. We went to the spot & after digging down a couple of feet, got the shell which was a dud. It was a narrow escape, & we were all thankful it missed us.

 I have made a bag of my bed by sewing a covering of bags over my blankets & although very rough it keeps me warm of a night. I received a mail of newspapers but no letters & am wondering where my mail has got to lately
