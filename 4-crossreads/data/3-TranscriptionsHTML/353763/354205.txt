<p>tried to catch a brilliant butterfly  -  I've seen him at Bellenden Ker in N Q before today &ndash; &amp; there was also one of those big dark butterflies who flap largely &amp; then settle &amp; instantly vanish from your ken  -  Imitation I presume for life's objects  -  The cliff was dark &amp; dank &amp; aroids &amp; ferns were thinly scattered over its face  -  I got a stick and looked where I went among the dead leaves &amp; stones for snakes here are numerous &amp; deadly  -  However we saw none &ndash; nor did I see any ferns or small plants new to me but it was dry vry dry, save just this cliff face  - = All vegetation is waiting expectantly for the rainy season  -  One thing I saw &amp; warned my pal against &amp; that was a cluster of bees on the surface of a large laurel like leaf  -  Let sleeping dogs lie  -  We looked &amp; then retreated  -  On our way back we took another route &amp; presently spotted a yard with two fine water buffaloes in them  -  Chaps I'd seen</p>
