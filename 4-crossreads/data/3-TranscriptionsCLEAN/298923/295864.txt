  
 17 July 1918 Wednesday Talet et DUMM Marched all night The war office knew 5 hours after scrap how many prisoners we had taken-   it was entirely the 1st LH Brigade did it-  with half men down with fever. Germans "KAMERADED" in approved fashion, but I regret to say they got a lot of the AJC Comforts, but we retook it-  One big German had 6 Tins of fruit & 2 bottles of Limejuice on him! I carried 250/-/- of Squadron Pay in my pockets all thro' scrap, the perspiration was so great it was pulp.  It's over & Im alive still but very tired sore & stiff.
