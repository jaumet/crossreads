  
 in Australia so far as I have seen  -  Sea birds are rare  -  I've seen a gull or two & that's all  -  On the beach there are no end of Indian Mynahs - a kind of starling of the same species we see in Melbourne & likewise an imported ? pest  -  By the way the mongoose was imported to Fiji to clear out rats 2 & has become a pest  -  Father Fox told me they had wiped out wild ducks & were a great curse to farmers & all who kept fowls  - The first thing we saw this morng were liberty men being towed by tenders from the war ships to the beach  -  Some of them had not been ashore for months  -  Suva was chock a block with men from the fleet all day  -  In the aftn I was off with others & had a vy fine walk to the Signal station with Blayney & Herbert  -  We went up hill right at the back of the township & when on top got a fine view of the encircling barrier reef - 3/4 mile off the land  -
