<p>McConaghy is well but he has had two narrow escapes - a bullet tore the sleeve of his coat in four places making two wounds about the size of vaccination marks. The night before last a bullet just grazed his ear, drawing blood but doing no other damage. To bring the narrative of our doings up to date. We remained resting on the beach till Saturday afternoon when we moved up to our present position, relieving another battalion. The changes in our battalion have been many. [ ] [Bennett?]&nbsp;our second in command was early appointed to command the 4th Bn; then [ ] [Brown?], our first adjutant, was appointed to command the 2nd Bn; this left McConaghy next senior to the Colonel. He had previously been appointed to command C company. Yesterday the Colonel was appointed to Brigadier, I think only temporarily, so now McConaghy is, for the time being, in command of the 3rd Bn. As for B company, our second in command, [ ], broke down after the first few days, Lamb was wounded about 10 or 12 days ago, McConaghy was transferred, MacFarlane, Goldring &amp; [Hinde?]&nbsp;were wounded</p>
