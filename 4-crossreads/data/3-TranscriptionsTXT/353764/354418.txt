 by Australian Lady Volunteers where you can get a cup of Cocoa &amp; Cakes for a few piastres.  It is quite nice to hear them speak the good old language as one gets tired of all the jargoes you get here. It seems to be certain that we will shift by the 15th of this month, so we are all looking forward to it. 
 6.3.16 Monday  7.3.16 Tuesday Two days of heavy transport work &amp; very little time to spare. To-day we took over 7 more wagons &amp; also 16 Horses &amp; 34 Mules.  These Mules would kick the eye out of a needle &amp; they want watching, although they are great workers.  They come from Peru &amp; Argentine mainly and are of a very large size. I think I am doomed as regards my Commission for there has been some more leg pulling &amp; strangers are getting the Commissions.  This fact is filling me with discontent &amp; I will be very pleased when I can get into plain clothes &amp; leave the life behind me.
