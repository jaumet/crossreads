the whole thing surprised me. A nice comfortable bed at the Ivanhoe Hotel at 11 pm, the first for some time & a good hot drink for my cold which is worse - "this is the life".
27th July: ThursdayFirst thing is to pay the bill (costs - one day 8/6) & this completed we make a hurried departure at 8.30 am for Kingsbridge station for the 9.15 train to Killarney. No time for breakfast. My feelings are running high (very high) at the near prospect of seeing the land of beautiful lakes famous in all the world. Breakfast at Limerick Junction. The country is really beautiful, grand old farms & the truly quaint Irish houses  So small. Green, green, abounds everywhere. It climbs over the fences  Then there are the many bogs, for which Ireland is so famous & even men are now working on them excavating the bog-oak for fuel. One mass of cultivation & one could not imagine anything more prosperous looking. The air is grand & but for my cold which is slowly pulling me down, I should glow in the pleasure
