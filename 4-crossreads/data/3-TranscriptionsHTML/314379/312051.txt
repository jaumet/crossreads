<p><u>Deck games</u>: Deck billiards, deck quoits, and bull board.<br/><u>Deck competitions</u>: Hitting the bucket, are you there, chalking the pig, greasy pole over water, Three legged race, - cigarette race, Thread the needle, apple bobbing, and a bun and treacle contest.<br/>The entrance is free and prizes are given to the winners of the various events.
