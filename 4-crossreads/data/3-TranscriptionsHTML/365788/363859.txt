<p>3<br/>Saw Capt. Embleton the other day &amp; had a few words talk with him. Capt. Fletcher was at Angal for a little while &amp; when the troops all left he was a bit sick at Lemnos  I did not see him. Then we came back to Egypt &amp; as Mrs Fletcher was sending the Capt. a parcel, Beatrice R &ndash; G &ndash; enclosed the one for me in Capt. Fletcher's to Lemnos &ndash; so it must have been on its way to Lemnos when I was on my way to Egypt. But no doubt it will turn up soon.<br/>You will note the address. I think that address should find me. It is very hard to say what address is a correct one. With very much love to you all.<br/>Ever your loving brother,<br/>Fred</p>
