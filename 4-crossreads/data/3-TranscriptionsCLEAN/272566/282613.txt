Tuesday 26 June
down hills, on a bright day of course.  Then I often have to run to Edgehill C.C.S. either through Albert and Dernancourt or on the return from A.D.M.S. branching off at Warloy and running through Henencourt and Warlencourt, Aveloy, Mericourt, Ribemont, Bray, Bellevue Farm, Acheux, Belle Eglise and numerous other villages are amongst the daily trips.  Also, I have twice been to Amiens on duty.
