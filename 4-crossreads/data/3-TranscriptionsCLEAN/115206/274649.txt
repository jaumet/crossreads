 Messines 2 am Fritz putting a few across the road, very little gas. Rained throughout the day until 4 pm. Went down to Regt Battl to see "Wireless" Cooked the breakfast and was M.O. all day, had a clean up on strength of it. Pill box leaks on top, caused plenty of amusement and discomfort. Russell and Adey went out to O.P. the former relieved Gun of his duties. Charlie Adey went across to L'aison. Not feeling very brilliant
