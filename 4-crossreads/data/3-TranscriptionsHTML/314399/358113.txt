<p>Saturday 26 April 1919<br/>Raining this  morning. Bill &amp; I wandered everywhere looking for flats or rooms. Went to see The Very Idea. Gee it's rough. Still we enjoyed it. Moved to Bill's hotel for a day or so. Its in Blomsbury Street.</p>
<p>Sunday 27 April 1919<br/>Nice &amp; sunny for an hour &amp; then rain. Snowed later on &amp; lasted all day. Very heavy too. Went to Twickenden to see Mrs. Aveling but she was out. Then went to Marie's flat &amp; stayed there until 7 pm when we left to meet some girls. Took them to the Stoll Movie house &amp; then home. Missed the last train &amp; had to walk from Kings Cross to this place (in Blomsbury St).</p>
