27.4.18Stayed in bed most of day as feeling very tired and had an argument with Jensen.  Had to go out with Sarre and Kernot at six and went to 11 B.H.Q. and waited there till nearly dark.  Sarre fired shots at aeroplane & burst his rifle.  Out with works officer and marked out trench for connecting up and also found where our wire was to go.  Sarre waited for party and I went down to cross roads dump to wait for them.  Slow in coming and then growled continually when they did come.  However did strips of carrying wood pickets and wire.  Rotten mob to work with.
