<p>November, 1915<br/>Friday 26<br/>Nothin doin!!! All quiet in front. So far as one side goes, but the Turks bang away, rifle, Bomb &amp; Shells in between if you listen you can hear the Grouse calling to each other &amp; an odd jackal barking &ndash; at night I mean &ndash;<br/>One would think the cannonading would have frightened all animals away &ndash;<br/>The jackals pull the dead Turks about like a Fox would a sheep.  Of course we bury all possible.</p>
