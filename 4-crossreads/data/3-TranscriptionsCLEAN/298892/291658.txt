  
 I would give anything for a good Australian Summer's day. I think I could relish any amount of heat now. I am forwarding with this letter a small packet containing a small bracelet for pet, and two small brooches for mother. One is our battalion badge with the motto "Strike hard" underneath. I intended sending it with my last letter but could not get it away at the time. 
 We frequently witness exciting aerial duels between artillery and aeroplanes. The shrapnel can be plainly seen bursting about the 'plane but although I have frequently seen 'planes surrounded by countless some of which appeared to be certain hits I have not seen a 'plane brought down. The shelling has the effect of frightening them off anyhow and keeps them from venturing too close.
