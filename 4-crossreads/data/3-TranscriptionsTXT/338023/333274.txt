This is for the signalling school where I must put in about ten weeks on the 'buzzing masheen'./ In one of your letter cards you mention a photo of some 'mate' or other - I cant remember who it is referred to & I cant recall the private addresses of any of the 4th/9th  MGC. - From a long continued close study of the varying characters in the section, I fancy that any relatives they may own, still alive & unhung, must be either in gaol or the various asylums. This includes the six pommies who don't own Australia as their home. More next week. Have to pack for the long move north. Love from Harry
