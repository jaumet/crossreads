<p>this morning with military movements.  We marched out at 10.30 a.m. passed through Sailly, Bac St. Marn &amp; Font Rompu to a farm house in Erquinghem.  Observation Balloons and aeroplanes busy overhead.  We made ourselves comfortable on the straw in a barn.  Milk butter &amp; eggs are plentiful and the Farm People are very nice.  Guns hidden amongst the trees nearby opened up but had not fired many shells before Fritz returned a few which landed so close to our guns that they remained silent for the rest of the evening.</p>
