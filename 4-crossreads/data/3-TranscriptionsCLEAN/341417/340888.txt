 My Dearest Doris 
 After a fortnight's holiday in England we are again travelling this time it is for the Dardenelles. 
 The first half of our holiday I spent at Tidworth I have described this beautiful place in my last letter, the latter half I spent at Southampton & I might say it was the time of my life, the people simply lionized us. I made quite a lot of friend, I also managed to visit a Lodge meeting & spent a most enjoyable evening. I will endeavour to detail how I spent the week. 
 Monday. Arrived at Southampton Dock Station 4 P.M. was conveyed  in Motor Lorries to the Rest Camp, tea 5 P.M. spent the evening with some people my Pal (Eric Mills who was stationed at Southampton all the time we were in England) had met. 
 Tuesday. I was detailed as N.C.O. in charge of piquet, managed to get into town for a few hours. 
 [Private, later Lance Corporal, Eric Thomas Clargo Mills, No 4429, 3rd Australian General Hospital.]
