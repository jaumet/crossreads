<p>XOXOXO<br/>France<br/>10.6.17<br/>XOXOX<br/>My darling Eddy,<br/>I wonder if you play cricket yet? the boys of our Hospital (Orderlies) are very clever at the game &ndash; lately they have had Matches with some Battalions camped about here. It is a good thing that the Australians are fond of Sport. They soon forget their troubles. Fondest love   &amp;  heaps of kisses. From XXXXOXO Auntie Eadle X</p>
