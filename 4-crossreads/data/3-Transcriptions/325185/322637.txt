<p>Liverpool<br/>Aug 11th 15.</p>
<p>Dear Father.<br/>Am writing to tell you we are to have three day's Musketry at Long Bay. So I won't be here on Friday. The new man we have here says all troops should have three days shooting at the least. Kirkland has gone from here left on Tuesday. I am afraid no one shed any tears without they were for joy at his going has been called back to Melbourne &amp; may they keep him there. I arrived home alright on Monday night. No one questioned the pass. Nearly broke my neck though. I had a hard job to keep awak to Granville. I changed there as usual. Dont remember the train leaving there. All I remember is getting into the Liverpool train there. The next I was on all fours on the ground here. I must have gone to sleep as soon as I sat down. Whether some one called me at Liverpool or not I don't know. Have a faint recollection of seeing</p>
