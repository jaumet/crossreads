<p>Belgium<br/>26.7.17</p>
<p>Dear Dad<br/>Still going strong, after a 12 days march, and another week's hot action.  We seem to have left the Bapaume sector for good now, and are making a tremendous effort on another part of the front.  We will probably stay in action till the stunt is over, and it is expected to go 30 days without a stop.  Great results are expected.  In fact it is looked upon as a decisive battle.  So far no infantry action has taken place but the artillery work has been particularly heavy.  My own branch of course getting its full share.  This note must be brief, but it will be better than none.</p>
<p>I am in the pink, and am confident of coming through intact.</p>
<p>Your affect. Son<br/>George</p>
