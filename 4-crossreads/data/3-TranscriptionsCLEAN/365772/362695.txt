  
 Give my love to Dad & Mother I never write to the former but I know you give him all the news & tell the Mater I will very likely miss her this mail & as for Ulmarra I havn't written for months so will have to be careful anyway when it is all sifted out there is only you Dad & Mother worth writing to, a chap drops a lot of sentiment etc. here & gets rather hard & callous so forgive me dear if I dont write too affectionately, but we know one another dont we Lizzie you are sweetheart sister & all to me. I will close now with fondest love to R B & self from Ken
