Moresby went out last eveg  for Sydney & carries a letter to you  -I was on the beach on Monday aftn & spent some time in the Carnegie library looking up the flora of this part  -  I wanted badly the name of a very   fine, very common, tree with a trunk & fluted like a Greek column & with a most [indecipherable] head & branches & often with ferns & mistletoe covering it  -  No doctor man knows anything here but his job just like the N.O.  - that is perhaps I shd  say in natural science  -  However I got the name it is the Polynesian or Tahiti chestnut - (Inocarpus edulis)  -  At once I found out all about the tree  -  You see them round the huts of the natives in low lying ground  -  What grand shade trees they are  -Ferns in this island are everywhere  -  Fancy a total of 246 species of Ferns, Lycapods & Selaginellas
