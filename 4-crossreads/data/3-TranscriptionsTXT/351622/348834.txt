 26 May 1916 Fri Herbie is now two days overdue from London. Spent most of the day getting the tent in order later on adjourned to Steenwerck visiting our friends &amp; also several new chaps belonging to the Cameron Highlanders. Bill Buck comes home well oiled. 
 27 May 1916 Sat B-Section plays A Section football. A certain amount of jealousy exists between the two Sections &amp; it looks on paper as if A Section will win. Surgeon General Portus visits our station &amp; is highly pleased with the way everything is going on. Football postponed till tomorrow on account of his visit. Went to Steenwerck again to-night with Marsh 
 [Text continued in margin]  &amp; Keith. Marsh tanked up &amp; gets lost among the incinerators.
