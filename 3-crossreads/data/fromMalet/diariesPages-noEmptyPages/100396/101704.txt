he's a real giant. I wish you could have a look at him now. his great frame is properly fleshed up. I had great go with me not long ago, he became very excited, after a good deal of chasing round a big paddock. (most of the nags on this station are as bad as old biddy to catch) having at last cornered my noble steed I saddled him and mounted, he then did all he could to unseat me nearly succeeding three or four times. had I been less strong in the arms no doubt he would have succeed but I would not let him buck. I do not want him to become second Snips. he now goes along all right; I long ago decided to part with him having come to the conclusion that chap without land can also do without a horse unfortunately there are not good seasons horse paddock such as we have had here all the time, available for the Wallaby shooter where ever he likes to travel. I am giving up the game. the life is too strenuous.
I am going Inverell way where I will try to sell old York. if successful I will then offer my services as an expert shootist to the military officials, that is if the ranks of this second force are not by that time filled let us hope for the best (you see I really want to be put on a war footing. which ever way things go I am comming to town when I sell my horse so as the Chinese would say you must not expect to see till I arrive.
