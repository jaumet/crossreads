 Aug 20th. Sun. A raid took place and the men who went over did not find anyone in the trenches but on their return to their own trenches they were shelled and had a good number of casualties. 
 Fritz is becoming wide awake to these raids now-a-days. When there is a raid on he is clearing back from that part of the line, and when the raider returning to there own trenches he lets them have it with a vengeance. 
 There seems to be more losses than gains in these raids
