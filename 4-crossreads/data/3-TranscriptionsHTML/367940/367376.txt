<p>[Page 5 of letter.]<br/>the Roma girl quietly she is getting a bit too keen on things I have had several letters from her. but am not answering too suddenly, and pretty cold ones then.</p>
<p>I got a letter from Will and he told me all about the fancy dress ball, he also mentioned that it took a couple of whiskeys to get him to enter the dance hall. I can imagine the smile on the double lip as he was shuffling in feeling I suppose "a damn fool" He reckons the old tarts present gave him a grand time.</p>
<p>Frank &amp; Will are lucky to be getting holidays I could do with one myself just now but there does not seem to be much chance. I am sending you out with this a cutting from the paper giving a description of a raid, by the canadians, just insert the the old Battn name I used to belong to, and you will have the particulars of one carried out by the Battn. Do you remember that fine chap I introduced you</p>
