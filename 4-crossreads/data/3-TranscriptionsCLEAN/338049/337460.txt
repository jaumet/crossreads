Saturday 7 Sept.Things easy for a while then moved off immediately to past Peronne which is knocked about thoroughly. Then ordered out on 11th Bde line to Tincourt. Went well until cable ran out.
Waited about for cable to arrive. Officers "forgot" it. Harrassingly shelled. Rough time. Finally cable arrived. Commenced work but shelling put us to flight. Henderson severely knocked.
Finally finished line returned home. Put up camp.
