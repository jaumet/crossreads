 Thursday 18th Oct '17 We left Parkhouse on Wednesday (yesterday) &amp; caught a train at 2.25 p.m. from Tidworth which landed us at Southampton at tea time.  I kept with two original 3rd Fld Amb. men, who, being in the 1st Division of the draft, were always with me.  They were Clough (in A section of the 16th with me) &amp; Eva, both decent chaps. At Southampton, instead of embarking, we marched 3 miles through the town to a rest camp at the common on the outskirts north of the town, on the way we noticed plenty of American troops, &amp; our rest camp proved to be an American one.
