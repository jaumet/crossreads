Friday 22 November
Move on again about 8 miles to Prisches, a good march on a fine day. We have good billets at Prisches. were a walk to other villages where we were objects of curiosity as Australians had not been seen before. Move on to-morrow again.
Saturday 23 November
Move again to Avesnelles, on the outskirts of Avesnes. The march was good, nine miles and day fine. Avesnes is a rather fine town, shows little sign of being knocked about, except railway lines. The country here, Nord, is very fine, intense orcharding appears to be main industry. Of course business is not normal. The rumour that we don't go to Germany, but only to Belgium, still holds.
