Valley & am disappointed about leave & poor Dolly too still it cannot go on for ever & she must be a brave soldier's wife.I think our Brigade are coming out of the front line for a rest so may get away then-All my love to you at Home.  F.W.Always glad to read Diary it is a record when printed for me too.
