My dearest Father,You will be surprised, no doubt, to find me writing from this address, but when I tell you I am on my way to England on leave you will understand.  Things were running on smoothly much as usual a week ago, last Monday to be correct, when a notice was posted up at H.Q. saying that those requiring Leave had better apply.  I saw the Colonel about it & receiving his permission, put in wrote out my application in writingto our Camp Commandant, handing it to Colonel Sturdee before putting it in to the C.C. at the Colonel's request.  He endorsed it & adding a note in which he strongly recommended it.  This was on Tuesday morningOn Wednesday at 12 o'clock I was greatly surprised to be told my application was granted & that I was to go on leave the following day.  At 1 o'clock (an hour later) a despatch came through from Army H.Q. canceling all Leave for the Division.  I didn't think any more about it until 7 o'clock that night when the Colonel called me aside & told me he was trying to push my leave through for me, as he was very anxious I should go
