19/10/17 Paris
At 9 o'c got up and went round to the A.P.Ms office to report and then to a theatre office and booked up for some Opera Comique. To Cooks and made all inquiries re an Italian tour and then promenaded. The view looking towards the Opera in Avenue d?l Opera is very fine indeed and many are the magnificent buildings. Returned to the Hotel and met E. and her father and with them made the Bois. There the autumn has not yet smitten the leaves and it is still green. The crowd does not come out until 12. A few horsemen women ? some of the latter looked exactly like men as they cantered along. It was very beautiful among the trees and the people seemed to feel the freedom of the country. Returning we enjoyed the excellent view towards the Arc de Triomphe. Went for lunch to Caf de la Paix and had a splendid dish of frogs served with vegetables.
