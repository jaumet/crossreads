Dear Mum, Dad & George,
I have received Mum's letters of the 18th & 25th November just lately & I have not answered them so far.  I returned to Bulford last Wednesday.  I left Auntie's place covered with snow & ice, & Douglas was 3rd covered with snow even out on the Tower of Refuge.  It was only a stern sea & not bad crossing so I wasn't sick.  We reached Liverpool at 2.15 p.m. but the "Vaterland" took up all the Prince's Landing Stage except a little space occupied by an Irish Boat, so we had to cruise all over the Mersey looking for a landing place.  Anyone would have thought that we were a plague stricken ship.  No one wanted us.  Eventually we got through one of the Locks & at 4.15 p.m. we landed.  I happed on the overhead Railway to the Pier Head & walked up Dale St., & around Church St. to have some "mungaree".  I had nothing since leaving Auntie's place at
