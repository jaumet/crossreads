1917 Wednesday 5 Sept.
Yet another brilliantly clear night.   as anticipated Fritz planes over again.   Several more bombs dropped & some damage done.   They flew right over the hospital.   We almost had "Wind up".   Great activity of anti air craft guns & search lights in vicinity.   Nose caps fall in grounds.
