<p>Notes For 1916</p>
<p>A Soldier's Prayer</p>
<p>Sing me to sleep where bullets fall<br/>Let me forget the war &amp; all<br/>Lousy my clothes are &amp; dirty my feet<br/>Nothing but bully &amp; biscuit to eat<br/>Sing me to sleep in some old trench<br/>My only cobbers ground lice &amp; stench<br/>Stretched out on my old waterproof<br/>Dodging the raindrops from the roof</p>
