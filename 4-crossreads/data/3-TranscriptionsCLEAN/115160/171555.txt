 Darling Mither, 
 Sunday again, a glorious fine day and yesterday too, but everything was white with frost this moring, and thin layers of ice on the puddle-holes.  I hope the fine weather continues. 
 Last night I sent Dad an "Aussie" and you and Bess some cards, which I hope you will receive safely. 
 Well, the war is not over yet, and it looks as if the Hun is doing as much hoodwinking as possible.  There is a limit tho' and he will come a horrible gutser yet, I'm thinking. 
 I haven't had any mail during the week for none has reached us from the Column.  Last week we received our extra blanket and winter issues.

 On our way to Germany. 
 What great news it is - the war is over!  We are victors, and have come out on top at last. 
 I have not much to say at present.  I hope you are all in the best of health and spirits. 
 I will continue at the first opportunity.  I am OK. 
 Fondest love to all, 
 Your loving Son
