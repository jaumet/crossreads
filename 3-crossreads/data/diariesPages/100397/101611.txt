It was in the early stages of the war the Germany made here great mistakes, and now she is paying for them .. if you could just take a stroll along behind the lines here, and see the playthings of all calibres that old John Bull has sent over for the troops to carry on with you would first find yourself amongst the heavies, and if you did not know where they were, you would suddenly wake up to the fact that all things are not what you think they are at first sight, camouflage takes very many strange forms, after the heavies you would bump a mixture of all sorts from 10 Inches down to the new 60 pounders. They are bonny guns, and easy to work, up ahead of them you would find a fresh lot from the 60s down to the little 18 pounders 4.5 Howesit, they are wicked little devils! when you stand out in front, of them the shell is visible for a couple of seconds, as it leaves the the gun, afterwards. you only hear it, as it goes on its way to fritz .. and if you could hear the lot firing, when the "S.O.S." is sent up from the front Line, you would not wonder, that friend Fritz does not try to make a similar push, to that which he has just made in the Land of the Organ grinder and monk. he knows that, to push on this front means that, several hundred munition factories will be hurled over amongst his men, and the men dont like it, I dont blame them either!
