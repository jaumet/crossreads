 Mena House The Pyramids Egypt 19 Febry 1915 
 My dear Car. Joseph. &amp; Kitty:/ 
 Letters from you date the 22nd &amp; 29th Febry [December] 1914, reached me yesterday.  Many thanks for them. 
 If you were to purchase a block &amp; arrange for each of you day about to make an entry of current events political, personal, medical, atmospheric, social, &amp;c., each would be of much interest, and would keep me in touch with what is doing in Australia.  Unless you do this I cannot understand the occasional telegram which appears in the Newspapers at this end.  There is no leisure to go through files of back papers midst my numerous duties, and a little time given to me each day by one of you would save me a lot of trouble.  No words scribbled off while waiting for dinner, or the post, or when on a visit to Neutral Bay, or other place can contain what I want.  Your letters are very welcome but if they were an earnest of some time devoted to me daily they would be still more valuable as well as being instructive for me.  Tell me of course about yourselves &amp; how you are managing, what the doctors are doing, the local prospects strikes, military, besides the above mentioned.  You have a wealth of material which can only be utilised by doing a little daily.  Again do I ask it, hoping that one or all of you may acceed to my request.  The morning newspaper or converse with your friends will provide you with much that will be of great use to me.  Let me know too how you are managing financially?
