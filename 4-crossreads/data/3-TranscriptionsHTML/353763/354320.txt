<p>Sunday Nov 8  - 14  I'll just narrate the sequence of events up to noon  -  At 5.30  we were to go alongside &amp; take in water  -  We got under weigh &amp; then got orders to go back to our old position  -  We did so &amp; anchored  -  Immense fuming on the Captain's part  -  At 10 we heard that Patterson was to go inboard the Parramatta &amp; the P &amp; Warrego &amp; AE2 to proceed to Sydney &amp; we to remain where we were  -  At 10 .30 we saw &ndash; from the deck of the Upolu &ndash; the Pta  &amp; Wg  &amp; AE2 steam out of the harbor &ndash; bound for Sydney  -  Immense &amp; loudly expressed disgust by Captain &amp; Chief Officer  -  Silence by everyone else  -  <u>It is said</u> the original idea was &ndash; for the Upolu to join up this convoy &amp; if we were slow AE2 wd go into Noumea  -  Let her men go ashore &amp; then wait till we came up  -</p>
<p>Well it's the other wy  &amp; now here we all are waiting for fresh orders  -  Its glorious weather &amp; all is well on board  -  I am as you see shorn of both my Submarines &ndash; one lost &ndash; the other leaky &amp; must be docked &amp; overhauled before she dives anymore  -  You people will wonder where we are if its generally known that AE2 is at Garden Island  -</p>
