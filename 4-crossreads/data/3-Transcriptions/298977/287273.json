<p>Southmead Hospital,<br/>Bristol,<br/>England, 16th Nov. 1916.</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>Well this is a treat to get in between clean sheets etc., for a while, after the mud and slush of France.  It's awful over there now as regards weather conditions, and I reckon I'm very lucky to be out of it.</p>
<p>After all these months I've at last managed to get a bit of a crack.  A small piece of shell in the chest is the trouble, but it is not at all serious, and as a matter of fact I am walking about in the day time and scarcely notice it.  Have not had an operation yet, but as it will only be slight am not worrying about it.  Went under the X Ray to-day for second time and will probably have it out to-morrow or the day after.  Have written to Billy and am expecting him to come up any day now.  He is not so far away.  Have several pals from the Gun Company in the same ward, so am not lonely.  Harry was all right when I left, in fact he walked down nearly as far as the Dressing Station with me.</p>
<p>This is a very decent Hospital.  The Sisters are O.K. and the people of the town are always arranging motor trips, Concerts etc., for the boys, time never hangs heavy.  The first trip I had in a motor car I thought I was a public hero or something, the way the people line up and cheer is most embarrassing, but suppose will get used to it in time, and will soon be expecting it everywhere I go.  That's the worst of it.  Next time I walk down Pitt Street, if half Sydney doesn't turn out to cheer, I'll want to write to the papers about it.</p>
<p>Address all correspondence as usual, as only expect to be here for a very short time.  Am sorry in a way that I won't be with the boys for Xmas, and I'm sorrier still that I'll miss all those Christmas parcels, which you all so thoughtfully sent over for me, but still I'm sure you're far happier to think I'm away from danger over here, and will not mind the others having them.</p>
<p>Best love to all and please do not worry at all, as there is nothing in the least to be anxious about.</p>
<p>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
