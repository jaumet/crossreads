<p>Abdul.</p>
<p>Abdul as we saw him was not a bad fellow to meet.  He was generally well built, and sometimes fat &amp; glowing in health.  He was a clean fighter, and a very brave man, and under the leadership of their German masters he made an admirable and an excellent soldier.  The majority of the prisoners were badly clothed especially their boots which were worn out in many cases &amp; sometimes only wrapped in bandages.  He has the reputation of being cruel but we certainly never experienced any ill treatment at his hands during the Peninsular Campaign.</p>
