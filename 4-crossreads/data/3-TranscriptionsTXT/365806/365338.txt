school [indecipherable] in Scotland. Bart Finlay was in the original 17th with Caesar.  He was promoted in the field.
I have seen Cullen, but at present he is at some school or other at Tidworth. Ned Raine has his commission, & should be here, but is away with a picquet at Lark Hill.
In your last letter, by the way, you were wondering where Rollestone was.  It is merely the name of a camp at Salisbury Plains.  I think "God was tired when he made it".
I received notification the other day from Horseferry Road that Arthur's effects were forwarded to Australia per the H T Wiltshire on Nov. 11th.  Everything was sent back, as I did not have a chance of getting in to London.
My fingers are too cold to write any more, & anyway there is no news.  Remember me to everybody & Catherine.
Your loving son, Keith.
P.S.  I received my third warning to proceed to the front today, so something is sure to happen about it this time.
