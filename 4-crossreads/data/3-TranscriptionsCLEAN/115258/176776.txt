  
 however they are issuing us with plenty of oil and grease for out saddles and it makes beautiful slush lamps, I am writing this by the light of a piece of rifle rag stuck in a tobacco tin full of castor oil, and it is quite as good as a candle. 
 We are still all wondering how conscription went - there have been two or three rumours about it, but as they have ran[?] both for and against; one cant believe anything. 
 The country is beginning to get very pretty round here now; the early wheat is coming up and the niggers are all at work in their fields with their little wooden ploughs  and   with donkeys, and cattle and camels pulling them and their wives hoeing up the hard patches. I'd like to own some of the big flats here; a six furrow plough going round them; the niggers would wonder what had struck them when they saw their whole plot turned over in one act - they only scratch the ground about 2 in deep and dont plow out any weeds, so their crops dont get a very fair spin, but it is wonderful how ^ well  they grow. 
 Hope you are getting too dry a summer. 
 Love to Mother and the boys 
 Your loving Son
