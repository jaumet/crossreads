 18.12.15 hill &amp; Nelson works the H.Q. 'phone  When I heard that there was only one Signaller to remain to work each 'phone I naturally concluded that the rest would be going away tonight &amp;  as Les &amp; I have both been here from the start we came to the conclusion that we were not getting a fair deal by being sent away before the 'final flutte', so I went to Major Granville who explained matters saying that only a certain number of men are to remain here after tonight &amp; Les &amp; I are staying, but go into the trenches tomorrow, Les goes away with the first lot tomorrow night &amp; he thought I was to remain with a few others to the last so I am satisfied once more; the Officer responsible for the lighting of the fire last night cannot be located there is trouble awaiting him if it can be found out who gave the order; 2 German Planes flew over us tonight soon after dark 
 All who are remaining till tomorrow handed in their blankets today, to lighten our load if we have to fight. Fortunately the night is warm for this time of year&amp; since the snow we have been having lovely warm weather not even getting any frosts to speak ofl It was my turn for the trip to Bde tonight.
