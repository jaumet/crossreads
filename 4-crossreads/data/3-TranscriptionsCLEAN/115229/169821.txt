  
 Just as we finished dinner, each Australian was given a tin of comforts sent by the Red Cross Society of Australia. At night an engaged party gave us a good concert.  On the night of January second we had a great spread, given by the British Red Cross Society. Plenty of cakes, fruit, nuts and sweets. A concert was held afterwards which caused much merriment.  On January 16th there was a very heavy fall of snow which continued next day. I left on the 17th
