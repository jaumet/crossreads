<p>Tuesday 30th April 1918<br/>10.30 a.m. comes the Colonel, Sister McCulloch &amp; a new M.O., Capt. Murphy.  I rise, Col. jerks out "getting out a little these last few days &amp; that is better isn't it?", looks at chart, "quite satisfactory" &amp; they all troop off leaving me in doubt as to my going tomorrow or not, however I never worry about that knowing it is useless in a military hosp.<br/>Put on my silk frock &amp; enjoy a quiet evening in the grounds &amp; talking a little to Miss McLean, nice woman.<br/>During afternoon I borrow from 2 "scarlet" boys in next room book on Patience &ndash; it is swung in on belt of dressing gown &amp; all germs mingle freely.</p>
