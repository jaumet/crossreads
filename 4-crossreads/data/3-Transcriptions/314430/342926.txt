<p>situated in what had been a woollen mills. Here we camped in one of the large store rooms. Outside the Divisional Wing Orderly Room I saw posted <strike>up</strike> the following notice from the Intelligence Reports of 4th September, 1918:-<br/>"A recent Intelligence <strike>Report</strike> Summary<br/>"of the 185 German Division contains<br/>"the following extract: ' The latest identifications<br/>" 'show that the 2nd Australian Division<br/>" 'is in the line from North of Rainecourt<br/>" 'to half way along the Framerville-Lihous<br/>" 'road. South of this is the 1st Australian<br/>" 'Division. <u>Both Divisions are</u><br/>" '<u>known as first class Assault Divisions."</u></p>
<p>September 5th:- We started along the Corbie-Bray Road, the morning being very hot, The sun-baked highway was littered, in fact carpeted, with pieces of iron. I saw <strike>the</strike> Villiers-Brettoneaux with its ruined <strike>villages</strike> buildings, and the battered ridge where I had sat under the enemy fire for days. Later we marched past "Death Gully", that terrible place where I had endured a terrific bombardment for two hours on the 14th May. As we proceeded, the road led us across the old Morlancourt Sector, and there were numerous evidences of the battle fought around this area. German shrapnel helmets could be seen scattered in profusion and confusion. Dugouts and trenches and shell</p>
<p>* From this date until I went into battle on 3rd October, I marched over the country across which our fine Divisions, starting on 8th August 1918, made that glorious and triumphant advance, which was the turning point of the war. I was privileged to share in this honour, and fought in the great battle which destroyed the final defences of the "Hindenburg Line".</p>
