<p>From the Dugout<br/>France<br/>15.5.16</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>Well I am still alive &amp; feeling just OK that speaks for itself doesn't it. I don't think I have had a letter from you since last writing Have received  five old letters lately cant find your last one you know it is hard to keep things together we havent any writing desks etc. I received a letter from Bert but am not writing him as I haven't his address. Ask him to give me his No &amp; Comp as soon as he can I can keep in touch with him then. I received a letter from Miss T Smith the other day you see now I have transferred from the Comp I was in it has messed my mail up again<br/>Aunt Kate also (cottorn) wrote &amp; said</p>
