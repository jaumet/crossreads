  
 12 - morrow - who knows I may be sent - quite soon. But as long as I'm strong and you & Father are well I'll stay where I am, till I'm sent elsewhere. Much love precious Mother. Thank you Father for you lovely letters. I am looking forward to having the shoes from Callaghan. I got the note from them this mail. Very much love to Constance & Jim Cousin Lily & Percy and to Miss Hungerford and Mrs Ed & Maggie. Love to Bill & Edith & family. I long to see them all. Ever dearest Mother & Father. Your loving daughter Betha McMillan My love to kind Mr Arthur Allen. I'm sure he must go through hell of anxiety about dear Dennis - such a precious boy. I do hope he will be spared. I have sent you a letter from him to me amongst others to read & keep - Sister Thompson
