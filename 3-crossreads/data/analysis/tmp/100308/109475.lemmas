 24/4/17 Favreuil A perfect day still . In the afternoon went out to our practic ground and carri out a two Brigad attack practic one of finest sight I think that I have ever seen . About 7000 men in wave as relentless as Fate sweep across countri with set intent . Rode along in rear then attend a pow-wow at which the Gener was present . Just like a big field day at home both in the oper and the surround . We rode out through Sapigni which had been most systemat and thorough destroy by the ruin . The Church is a high heap of rubbl and noth els fring with a few still upright tombston of grave and respect burgher . Some Indian camp in here . The tree round have been chop down and left lie . The men carri out today 's exercis well and show how onc they have a thing explain and discuss they can do it . Bun lame by a kick mule
