 20/4/18. Disembarked from the "Kenilworth Castle" this morning. Entrained on the wharf and went about two miles to "Cornella Camp", where we camped in Huts. Not much chop of a place. Took a Rickshaw and went into Durban. All the trams are free to troops. A very pretty, clean, town. Met "Tiny" Hanlon's brother, spent the evening at his place. Stayed the night at the hotel in town. 22/4/18. Having a great time here, they have not found a ship for us yet, to take us on our way. I am staying in town and several people are giving me an "insight" into the place. The zoo here is a poor place, I expected to see something out of the common. Splendid weather continues and I like this town fine.
