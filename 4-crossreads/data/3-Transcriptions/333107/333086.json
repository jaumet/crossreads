<p>Wed Jan 8<br/>O Lord, back in this miserable hole again with its eternal mud and rain. Got letter from Mother and <u>1 from M.S.</u>, which cheered things up a bit. Mother says that Lill is looking very well, which is mighty good news.</p>
<p>Put in for a day pass to go to Weymouth tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thur 9<br/>Got a ride out to Westham in Ambulance. It broke down several times on the way, but it was much better than walking, anyhow; as it rained in torrents. Saw Perce Taylor and Jack Cox, both of whom had just returned from Leave. Also saw the Q.M. who gave me a note to say that I handed in my waterproof cape.</p>
<p>Took the letter I got from Ted Sutton to Serg. Travill in the S.M.O.'s office. He said I was too late for the "Ulysses" but he would put me on the "Euriped" [Troop Ship Euripides] which sails about the 26th of this month. So I returned to Littlemoor feeling that I had done a good days work.</p>
<p>Fri 11<br/>Visited Q.M. this morning and handed in my note, but he said it was useless, as it did not have an officer's signature, so I've got to go thro' it all again.</p>
