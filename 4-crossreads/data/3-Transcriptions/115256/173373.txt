<p>Saturday 24 April 1915</p>
<p>I spent an interesting day studying the Australian soldier, the typical infantryman of the A.I.F., on the eve of the prospect of going under fire for the first time.  At present, before the grim realities of War have been brought home to him, he looks at it in the light of a football march on a large scale, an affair with plenty of cheering, plenty enthusiasm and plenty excitement.  He does not realise the gravity and deep seriousness of what he is about to undertake.  He is confidently optimistic and delightfully cool-headed.  He is taking everything now with that good old matter of fact nothing-out-of-the-ordinary style distinctly Australian.  In this spirit, be it as you decide, good or bad, the men of Australia prepare to do battle for her honour and glory.  Nor when the time comes will Australia have any cause to complain of her representatives.</p>
<p>This afternoon, I managed to obtain a glance at the Operation Orders for the Gallipoli campaign.  The principle feature of the whole scheme is its completeness, the throughness of its operations.  A masterpiece of detail, it will, if carried out to the letter, go down as a model of constructive skill based on sound strategic principles.</p>
