<p>Mrs Wilkinsons woollen helmet or whatever it was hasn't arrived at least not yet-<br/>Young Allanson came to see me re transfer into combatant Reg instead of A. Medical Corps so am trying to get him into <strike>Life very tame</strike> 1st L.H.<br/>Life fairly tame here, we here 5000 Senussis are about 30 miles West but nothing doing so far.<br/>[Following paragraph crossed out]<br/>We will all be a bit old fashioned when we get back to civilization &amp; not know the latest Fox Trot or Hesitation Waltz, but perhaps our partners will excuse us.<br/>Picket talked so much owing to the cold, I got up &amp; dressed thinking Reveille had gone instead it was 2.30, I sent the whole picquet to a hot place</p>
