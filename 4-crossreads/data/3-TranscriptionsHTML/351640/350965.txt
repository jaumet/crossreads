<p>-ance of the Holy Family has happened only once in the history of mankind.   But thirty three years were those of Christ, and during them so much was crowded in that the most intelectual of the human race have been occupied in copying and teaching the lessons which He thought, and as the days are farther from the date of His existance so becomes more appreciated and pronounced the words that He spoke.   Is it not wonderful to think upon?   Deo gratias.</p>
<p>Dr Hollywood took tea with me tonight. He is in the best of health and spirits, though he told me that he sometimes becomes low spirited, and that when his twelve months have ended he will hurry back to sunny N. S. Wales.   We talked about You and, our friends near to you.  He left about 10.30 p. m.   Since I have been doing work in the office, and have been ending some letters, that they may be ready for post in the morning.</p>
<p>A package was posted to you this morning containing the beads.  It was registered and should reach you safely in due course.  Let me hope that you will like them; they will be uncommon.  The specimens are said to be genuine, having come from the tomb of some ancient Egyptian.</p>
<p>Large numbers of troups have moved out from the camps this night.   What pity they have not had time to be better instructed, then had there been greater chance for them to show the mettel of their breeding.   The game of war is one that cannot be learned in a day, they who understand the game best being the ones who are most likely to win, and they have often, adown the pages of history succeeded against great odds.   Numbers if they be sufficient can do anything, but for few to achieve much each individual must be trained to the highest degree.   Let us pray that the men going forth to day may have full measure of good fortune.   Keneth Garrick will have been of them.   A good looking soldier he was when he called to see me yesterday.   Good luck to him.  Jack Paton and his crowd may move off during the week.</p>
<p>Good night now my dears.  I shall expect letters from you during the next few days, I do not think that there has been a mail during the week just ended.  Please convey my best wishes to my many friends, hoping for them good luck.  I have asked for an opportunity to visit Galipoli, should it be given to me I may have some interesting matter for future letters.  If I go you will receive a telegram from me on my return.  Good bye.  God bless each one of you, and keep you from all harm.   Heaps of love and loads of kisses from, your loving and affectionate father.<br/>John B. Nash</p>
