<p>Tuesday August 28th<br/>Exceptionaly windy all day. It was very difficult to walk outside, rain also came with the wind, &amp; it was like getting hit with small stones, to be caught in the rain, the wind was blowing that strong. Just as we were about to start breakfast, our tent blew over, upset all our breakfast, &amp; blew everything all over the place, there was a terrible mix up; as luck happened it was not raining.</p>
<p>Transferred from "A" to "B" Group, &amp; from the tents into the barrack huts, no one was sorry either I think. The huts are very comfortable. Twenty men &amp; a corporal is in a hut, so we have plenty of room. Everything in the hut is very convenient, &amp; beds are provided.<br/>Everyone one was put on pulling down tents, it was a very rough job in the wind, I soon done a get away. Most of the tents were pulled down, but a good few still remains.</p>
<p>Received another Australian letter today.<br/>Rumor of another boat roll coming out this week, it is still the general talk in camp, &amp; is like a fire it soon spreads.<br/>I met a couple of fellows from Katoomba in camp here today. No matter where one goes, he always finds somebody he knows.</p>
