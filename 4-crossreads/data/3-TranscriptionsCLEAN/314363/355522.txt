This Cheer Up Society is very good, provided us with meals, drinks & as much fruit as we wanted. On Saturday we were taken by the Red Cross for a  picnic on the mountains, by train. During the morning it rained a little but cleared off later on in the day. We had a grand time, had everything we wanted, ate fruit all day & drank soft drinks. We had two very fine meals, we left the mountains 6.20. The Ship sailed at 5 AM & expect to arrive in Melbourne in a couple of days.
