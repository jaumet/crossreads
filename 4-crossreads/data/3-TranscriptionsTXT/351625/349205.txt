up to the front line almost.  Ken has written to Aunt Greta to get her to cable to you & Uncle Frank to let you both know we are here.  I hope you don't receive it before Christmas as it may spoil Christmas day for you & I hope you have as merry a one as usual.  Give my best love & kisses to all with whips to yourself.
FromYour loving sonDouglas
