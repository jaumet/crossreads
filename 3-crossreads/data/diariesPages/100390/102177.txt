Night at Matrooh.
The little mosque across the ink blue bay
Gleams in the moon, an alabaster toy:
Like golden fireflies the morse lamps play
Where line on line the pallid tents deploy
The Moonlight's fingers linger on the sheen
Of silent planes, like giant gnats asleep
A Cross of blood above a bar of green
The Ship of Pain steals out across the Deep. 
Matrooh, Jack Sommers
