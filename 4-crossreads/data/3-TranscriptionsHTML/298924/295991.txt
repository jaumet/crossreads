<p>Thursday 9 January 1919<br/>Went Belah to get evidence from a man in Hospital.  We had a Ford Car &amp; ran along the netting road which was put down over 2 years ago &amp; is still in good order.  By netting road I mean laid flat on the sand.<br/>We are just on the Boundary of Sinia &amp; Palestine &amp; altho' sleeping on the ground it is softer than the black soil, but more lice.  We have a delousing parade tomorrow using Boilers captured from the Turks.</p>
