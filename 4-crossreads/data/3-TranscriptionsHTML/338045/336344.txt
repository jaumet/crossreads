<p>we disembark &amp; are given seats on Dover Station.  At 9-30 a.m. go on board the Ambulance train &amp; move off.  Don't see much of Dover, mainly the "white cliffs" as we came in harbour.  A fine journey through grand old English country, people waving to us everywhere as we move along &amp; one only now realises what it means to be back in "Blighty" (England).  At 11-15 a.m. reach Orpington, about 15 miles from London &amp; the reception is to be appreciated.  A nice drive of about half a mile by motor car through a few beautiful country streets &amp; into a Canadian Hospital (Ontario Military Hospital).  What a change!</p>
