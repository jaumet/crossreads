  
 trial, but never no more, it tasted like a bag of rust & squashed ants horrible stuff, & it was full of mites, Stilton don't appeal to Australians I can tell you & I don't think it will grace our tables again in a hurry, the English couldn't make out why we detested it they thought it just the thing. 13th. Half holiay this afternoon & I went strolling round as usual got a few nice snaps & just scraped out of a row with the "red caps" nice amiable chaps these "red caps". Saw Les Clark this afternoon he had been down this way on a funeral by Jove he looks a hard case does old Les. Had a General round inspecting today so everything has been turned upside down to get it clean
