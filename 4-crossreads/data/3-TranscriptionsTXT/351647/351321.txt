mind to do likewise but I'm wedded to Australia & even the prospect of unlimited grand opera doesn't detach me.
Home is where the heart is.
Well & how are you & Graham & the Boss & Mac.  I expect Graham is getting huge & is quite a man.  I would like to see him.
I hope the Boss is well, tell him I saw Claude Nowland yesterday he is all right again & back here.
I haven't been to Paris yet hope to get in September D.V.
What sort of a winter had you & how is the garden.  Is the diminutive jackeroo still there & is Sarah still tripping about.  The dear old soul, she was good to me.  And Ma Gibbons & Paddy how are they?  You don't know how I'm simply hungering for all Tog & its works.
And the things I'm dying to tell you & can't on paper.
Well I must flee, I'm getting busier every day.
Good luck & best love to you all & specially yourself.
Yours as ever,Wilkie
