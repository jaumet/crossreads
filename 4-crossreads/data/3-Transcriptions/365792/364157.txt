<p>Mch 21 it; a glorious spring night &amp; we of the are bivouacked on the bank of the Suez Canal. Merrily blaze the camp fires against a background of pines &amp; River oaks. Immediately behind is the railway with its siding &amp; splendid lights. Men &ndash; hundreds of them pass in &amp; out of the trees &amp; everywhere there is life &amp; movement. To top everything the 3 Batt Band is playing like one thing &ndash; and &ndash; we had a jolly good tea  And this, perhaps will be our last night in the 'Land of the Pharaohs" How many of us will ever pass again through the Suez &ndash; I wonder?</p>
<p>22 Cold as blazes last night. Left for Alexandria at 1.45 am &amp; did a freeze until about 9 this morning. Travelled on top of baggage in an open truck &amp; minus an overcoat or blankets Bought fresh cooked eggs &amp; bread for breakfast.</p>
