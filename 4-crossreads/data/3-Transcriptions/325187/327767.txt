<p>This side of the Wardan railway in years gone by had been cultivated  a little but the Desert has triumphed in the end &amp; covered everything  even the railway has to be protected by fencing  Further out on the Desert the going is hard &amp; the surface covered with small stones but transport once off the road has to be done by Camels<br/>Roads are made by laying Bulrushes &amp; reeds from the Nile first then manure and rubbish &ndash; better roads are macadamised but the stone has to be railed a long way &amp; then per camel.  We hear that the 3rd Regiment has had a bit of a scrap with the Bedouins, but news is unreliable-</p>
