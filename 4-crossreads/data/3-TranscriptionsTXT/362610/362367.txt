 Wednesday 31 May 1916 A gloriously fine day. All the morning was kept over a minor court martial case at which my part actually took abt. 3 minutes. In the afternoon had a parade to take, &amp; coming back from it I found Leo waiting to see me. While we were talking who should walk in but Jocelyn &amp; Arnold Hazlewood. It was a lovely surprise. We went down town to have tea together but Leo had to get back to his work so that the three of us had to make the best of a snack in a little French eating house, &amp; after it had a great old yarn.
