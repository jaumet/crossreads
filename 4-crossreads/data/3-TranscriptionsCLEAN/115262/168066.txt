  
 Friday 26 October 1917. 
 Taube flew low & bombed us. 
 Casualties 2 camels & 1 native by one bomb thrown at the H Qrs & Brigade officers. It landed 30 yds from them but they were uninjured although 80 yds away 1 camel was killed. Fantasis (water) near were riddled with holes. 
 Rifle fire altered his course & thus other bombs fell in open country. 
 Taubes visited us again during day and bombs had no effect on our position (We have all got "Taubitis" now) 
 On picquet all day and night. Got several pieces of bomb in bomb crater. 
 Visited the old ruins & took snaps of graves and some skeletons that were taken from an ancient well.
