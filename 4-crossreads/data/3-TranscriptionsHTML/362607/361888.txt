<p>Dear Mother, Just another Oriental Scene. You will notice 2 Mosques &amp; that they are coloured with red bands. There are hundreds of places done the same way. Some are green &amp; blue but most are drab coloured. Some of the richer people have huge baskets of flowers painted in the porch on either side of the door. There is invariably a donkey in these Pictures. You will notice a chap with a large urn thing on his back. He sells lemon drink. He carries a little tine tumbler rack &amp; a bottle of fresh water to rinse the glasses. We do not touch this dope at all but the buy of it. Just write a letter now.  Harry</p>
