<p>March 18<br/>Was shell-chased from Brandenmolen to near Voormeziele today.  Fritz's observation balloon must have noticed us working, for shells landed right amongst us.  It seemed that some of us must be got by the first; but the boys came running right out of the smoke, &amp; noone was hurt.  But Fritz lifted his fire &amp; commenced to range right onto the old artillery positions (abandoned) behind which we had taken cover, &amp; we had to get. I had two sandbags, filled with broken ammunition boxes for the brazier fire tied together &amp; slung over my shoulders; they must have made me a mark for the whole party, for when we scattered, the shell fire followed me.  Each new shell appeared to land just where I had ducked down when the previous one came. I only got out of it when dead-beat. I lay down under a haystack near the White Chateau, feeling that, whatever happened I couldn't make another run.  I had been jumping into shell holes, &amp; against tree trunks as each shell exploded, &amp; I was wet &amp; muddy &amp; bruised.  A sympathetic Corporal in charge of a battery Canteen opened it up &amp; gave me a dixie-full of beer.  Don't remember ever tasting anything so glorious.  Mine was the satisfaction of being the only man to bring back any wood &ndash; the others who got home long before me, &amp; reckoned I was gone,</p>
