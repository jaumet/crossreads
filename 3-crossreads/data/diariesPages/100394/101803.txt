Captains Davenport & Frizelle left us yesterday, and Major Moseley is leaving shortly probably for Australia. We will be under new officers. Notified to be ready to parade before General Howse in regard to transfer tomorrow.

March 10
General Howse didn’t see us after all. There are other applications than our own and Col. Barber is selecting. We are doing absolutely nothing just now. Sent some photos home and a letter.

March 11
On Q.M’s fatigue all morning. Sent long letter home in afternoon. Nothing doing. Went to pictures at night with Jack Dexter.

March 12
Spent nearly all day writing long letter home from time we left Australia to the evacuation. Also got some more photos ready and sent some photos to Miss Montague. Aubrey came round to see me tonight. Am studying French diligently. Cabled tonight for 20£ for Bob and myself and also wrote Cook’s per favour of Aubrey.
