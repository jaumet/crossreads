Thousands of troops everywhere, coming out & going into the trenches, Australians, English & Scottish soldiers, the latter I consider are the finest set of men  that we have come in contact with. We read a lot about the brilliant Anzacs, but the Scots will do for me, we look squibs besides them. We pass motor lorries by the thousand, we are certainly in for a big stunt by the look of things. At 4.p.m. another halt is made & fortunately we do not move on till to-morrow, hot stew served out for tea, it was delicious, slept in wooden huts, & before morning it was terribly cold.
