<p>Peace we all hope and according to the signs of the times peace it will be.<br/>About 9.30 this morning 3 Taubes came sailing overhead and one of them was directly overhead before anyone saw him. Fortunately he didn't "let go" our first intimation of the visit was the machine gun started rattling away we thought they were testing one of their guns. We are used to   them and rarely have 2 made their appearance but this time we had 3 of them There was a strong wind blowing at the time and consequently we could not hear their engines. The horses were all the way down near the beach at water and the Taubes went over that way and dropped about half a dozen bombs they went off with deafening crashes No one was hurt as far as we can ascertain at present and no damage done. One of our planes was up at the time and we went after them at full speed but they went away and we saw no more of them<br/>Been working with a shovel making a dug-out to get in out of the rain and cold wind and it will come in handy if Fritz drops any bombs too close here that is if the horses are out to water although he generally pays us a visit when the horses are on the line &ndash; feeding and the men at meals. There is a terrific wind blowing and great difficulty is</p>
