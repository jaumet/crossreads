<p>advance has been made here. In the 4th edition you will notice an R.A.P. mentioned where we were working on the 28th October last. Well about 4 p.m. today we passed it &amp; I noticed that what was our front line then, last October, was only about a mile &amp; a half further on. I believe that we have about 6 miles to go, fortunately the ground was hard, if the weather had been wet it would have been a terrible walk. In the distance a mass of smoke could be seen, looks to be a village or two burning. At about 5.30 o'clock we had tea at a Relay post &amp; were told here that we only had another mile to go, which was good new for us all, as we were a trifle tired. It seemed quite strange the place was so quiet, no one German shell came over our way. The enemy must be a long way off. About 6 p.m. we (three squads) arrived at the R.A.P. which was on the outskirts of a village, which the Germans occupied scarcely two days ago. The dug-out we stopped the night in was very comfortable, it contained straw bunks.  It is very kind of Fritz to build these for us. All round here, an enormous amount of war material</p>
