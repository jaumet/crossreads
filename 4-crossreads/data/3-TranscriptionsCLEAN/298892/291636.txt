  
 find wherever we stopped the night our old friends the Y.M.C.A. so that we could buy food with our own money without fear of being defrauded. On the wharf where we landed from the transport there was a small refreshment booth run by these ladies. I induced my friend to ask for his tea in french by telling him that they did not understand english. I told him a cup of tea was "un tasse du the". He went boldly up and said "Give me two  "un tasse du the, please"
