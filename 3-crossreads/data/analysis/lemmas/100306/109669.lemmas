 Ribemont 21/1/17 Church parad 10.30 on ground near Sucreri . Men fair smart in greatcoat and drill order . Afterward march past Gener Smyth V.C. who took the salut . Ground still frozen quit hard and deep in hard snow . Had a haircut and a hot bath dure the afternoon . Vey cold and a great scarciti of coal so bed is the warmest place for one . Asked Madam if she had been to mass and she said no becaus her son was dead and she did not intend to enter Church again . Kill in action . The light has gone out of the live of the two poor old folk . In the even went to Bde HQ and had a talk with Plant on various topic . Dark street with group of soldier talk and here and there a busi illumin estaminet crowd to the door . Tree bare of leaf and sombr in colour show up black against the snow and make a dreari scene . No wonder that Spring and it advent are so much welcom by these old world peopl and their writer .
