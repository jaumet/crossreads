Extract from letter from The Rev Edward JulienChaplain First Batt.nAIF8/3/17.
"A few days ago I buried, according to the Sacred Rites of the Church of England Lieutenant F.S. Phillips, who was lying out for some time; being in no-man's land nothing could be done until the Hun's retreated.
Amid the shrieking of shells he has at last been laid to rest in the Bull's Rd Cemetery to the right of the town of Flers"
