 14th A fairly quiet day although there was a fair amount of Artillery fire from both sides. 
 15th Rather heavy Artillery duel between our guns &amp; Turks at "Cape Helles" a tremendous bombardment by our boats is going on.  From 8 p.m. to midnight could be heard a continuous rattle of rifle &amp; machine gun fire.  Rumoured that our Forces down south making good progress.

 17.6.15 Nothing fresh to write.  Battle still progressing as usual. 
 18th Light Artillery &amp; rifle fire on both sides nothing fresh. 
 19th Same as yesterday. 
 20th Nothing fresh.  Same energetic work going on, sapping &amp; driving toward Enemies lines. 
 21st Little artillery &amp; rifle fire during day.  About 10.30 p.m. we opened with heavy rifle fire &amp; bombs all along the line to which the Turks vigorously replied.  Our fire had been to find out their relative strength at different points along the firing line and it worked well. 
 22nd Principle work being done driving tunnels in front firing line to form new fire trench.  When this is complete we should have a very strong position, much stronger than we have at present. Other things as usual.
