26/8/16Edinburgh  Caught the Scotch express at 10 am and had a good run through lovely country similar to that between Bailleul - St. Omer - Steenwerck only England has more hedges and is much more trim. York & Durham are old fashioned old towns and Chester-le-Street is a quaint Dutch looking town. We ran into rain about Lincilnshire and the country took on a rougher aspect from there on. What lovely greens they get there in their woods and how smooth the trim meadows look. Newcastle is a big smoky place with plenty of coal about Berwick is an old place on a peninsula - naturally well fortified and easily able to take its place as a scene of many bloody border wars. We now ran along the sea for the rest of our journey passing Prstonpans and other familiarly named towns. The rain was now coming down properly and in a little sylvan valley I saw a "Scotch mist" at home. Reaching Edinburgh put up at the North Britain and took a walk up Princes St above which towers a height with an old collection of buildings on top of it. Very Pretty. Noticed the Scott memorial. Very wet.
