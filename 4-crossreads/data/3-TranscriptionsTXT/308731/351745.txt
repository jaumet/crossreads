Dear old Mr Bill Burrowes
Mum was schasked last night because she was in the middle of us in the big bed and Ruth was one side of mum and I was the othe side of mum. and Ruth is writing a nother letter to you. and to day is Sunday so I hope I can write more. and the little goats are real funny and we call the little blackgoat golly wog and he is real heffery and when I try to caught him he dogers me round the trees.  this morning I brought mum a cup of tea because she was schasked in the night and she could not breath.  Mum is going to school church and we are not going to church.
much love from Frankxxx etc.ooo etc.
