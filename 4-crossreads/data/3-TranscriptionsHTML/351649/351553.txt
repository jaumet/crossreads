<p>at the office very morning.</p>
<p>How is old John?  And also little John, give them both my very best love tonight, and tell little John to put in a good word for me occassionally in his prayers.</p>
<p>I believe Lloyd has gone off to the war, you remember, I <strike>wrote him some</strike> cabled him some time back saying he should go if he wished to.</p>
<p>Well goodbye &amp; good luck to you all.</p>
<p>And please excuse this short &amp; scrappy letter, but the letters are just to remind you that I often think of you all &amp; the good old days &ndash; please Heaven they come again.</p>
