a draw, after a good fight. I hear tonight that the "Karoola" has been sunk & a lot of our mail has gone down with her, enough to make a Saint swear after taking the trouble to write letters & then have them sunk on you25th. Had an early breakfast & then a good long route march it was a nice march for we went through several old villages & crossed & recrossed the river several times, & the scenery was very fine, though the morning was very hot & close the 2nd T.B. were also with us & we had both bands so we were well supplied with music, we marched practically all the way at the "trail" light infantry
