Marcinelle
people are about their houses. They scrub the outside front walls and lintels daily with soap and water and the scrubbing of the flags is an event of two or three times a day. Their care in this respect is a marked contrast to their filthy lack of sanitation and their dislike to washing their bodies. On the canal this warm pleasant evening are many barges and the watermen and their wives sit yarning. Got away from Charleroi station at about 9 pm on a packed train. The journey all night was one of the most wretched I ever remember. Had to sit on my suitcase crouched up against the heater of a wagon lit. All night had no sleep ? there were women (some elderly) crouched in the corridors.
