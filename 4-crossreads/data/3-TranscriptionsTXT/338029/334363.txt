Sun. 17th Sept.Dr. & Col. went down to the lakes to the fishing party, did not return, very short handed in regt.  My two A.M.C. men go down to stables and exercise, they are learning to ride.  Our mess is now in a flourishing condition, as good as any hotel.  Wrote a poem today at expense of Gerardy, sent it to Bulletin.
Monday 18thWe hear we are to move off at end of week so I put a pass in to go to Cairo on duty.  I will go up on Wed.
TeusdayParty back from Alex. had a good time, definite orders now in about us moving, obtained my pass will go to Cairo first thing in a.m.
WednesdaySaddled up before Reveille, borrowed spurs did not notice sharp rowells, my own are dummies, conseq. when arrived at Railhead I saw that I had drawn blood on my gallant little mare, I could have kicked myself.  After many changes finally arrived at Ishmaillia where I caught train for Cairo, and once more arrived at the old city, after clean up at Anzac Hostel, commenced work, visited various places, and at p.m. called to their great surprise on O'R.'s, spent very pleasant evening before returning.  Have about twenty orders for diff. chaps and have got them horribly mixed up.
