<p>Fatigue work getting wood.</p>
<p>Had a real good wash in fresh water, first decent one I have had since goodness knows when.</p>
<p>The Turks have rigged up some new guns &amp; gave one of the guns of our mountain battery hell, about one hundred shells in all. Their shooting was excellent. They have also raked up a heavy gun from somewhere. It sent shrapnel down Monash Gully &amp; got a couple of our chaps.</p>
<p>There is a constant growling from the guns of the fleet on the right &amp; we are expecting big things to happen there shortly.</p>
<p>Went &amp; had a yarn with Capt Fitzgerald. He is well. Found out that Harrison &amp; Maxwell are both wounded. Also that Capt Fitzpatrick made a very poor showing.</p>
<p>Had bacon &amp; two eggs for tea. It was First Class.</p>
