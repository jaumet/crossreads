named Erk on the Turkish left flank. The whole of the mounted troops & artillery shortly after daybreak attacked the Turkish flank, the engagement lasted all day & at times was pretty severe. The Third Brigade had a fairly large number of casualties & a two companies of the Camel Corps were badly cut up. our casualties however on the whole were light.  We captured a number of Turkish positions & our artillery must have inflicted severe losses on the enemy, it completely outclassing the enemy batteries.
