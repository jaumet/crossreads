<p>Eventually we arrived at Folkestone Boarding trains here we came across George Leary who was on what I would call picket duty. He was only a very young soldier when he first enlisted and even then had served 3 years or thereabouts so it was up to the authorities to allow him some relaxed duty.</p>
<p>Upon first arriving we had to report to Horseferry Road Offices Here we drew our leave money and here we left our "gear" in a room provided for the purpose. A soldier on leave takes all his belongings away from the Battalion with him</p>
