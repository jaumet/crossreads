<p>only fault with this camp. Kept busy taking shells up. One of my horses has gone lame so I am taking him &amp; other sick horses back to Albert for treatment. Arrived Albert, two or three of the spare hands gone up to relieve Higgins &amp; Pascoe. Fell in lucky for a trip to Abeyville for remounts. Left by motor cars for Asheaux Le grand then got a train, camped the night got horses next morning &amp; left for Albert, sorry we could not see the town which looked tres bon from the distance.</p>
