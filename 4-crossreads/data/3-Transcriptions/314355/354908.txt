<p>July 26, 27<br/>my coat on, when lo and behold &ndash; three staunch Australians stood before me &ndash; and they brought me safely to your lines".</p>

<p>July 27<br/>284.<br/>Coffee in the farmhouse five minutes ago compensated for a horrible day.</p>
<p>In the kitchen no lighting but the stove, and the blue light of the night through the tiny-paned window:  two old men, madame, and her mother, each in their corner, all silent.  Madame poured coffe out, and sank back in the chair:  still silence, and I forgot the day's disappointments and became one with the quiet.  Then a blundering voice outside, and a demand for "Coffee Madame?"  The usual flat platitudes, then he left and quietness came again.</p>
<p>Leaving Madame gave me the "good oil" &ndash; the French are coming here, we are shortly leaving.</p>
<p>July 28, 29<br/>285.<br/>From Davis &amp; Oriole, Masefield's "Gallipoli" and Houseman's "Green Arras":  also a bill.  In the evening to the Billet by Hondeg.:  then back and a listening to two thickset lads of Wales arguing and "Tearing" one another over the cleaning of their harness, when they last came out of the line:  the bout started on one of them telling me of their ins and outs of the lines.  So to the farmhouse:  Coffee and quiet.  Then I am in my own dream room:  ivory, yellowed walls, and cobalt-black curtains, and books, books, and books.</p>
<p>Bobby sent up from the Amb. a copy of Conrad's "Typhoon" and Lethaby's "Architecture".</p>
<p>Tonight a small notebook of Construction notes commenced.</p>
<p>In the Aisne Marne war, the French cavalry are in, and ground is still being won.</p>
<p>July 29<br/>286.<br/>Midday.  A pale sun without rays and a leaden haze of pale light.  The pool:  the pool.</p>
<p>287.<br/>Andy C. reading a new Bulletin.  I asked what was in the "Red Page":<br/>"A book of Hardy's".<br/>"What do they say about it ?"<br/>"Oh, considering his age, they say its pretty good!"</p>
