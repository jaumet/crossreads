<p>"The time has now arrived when the necessity<br/>"for action has arisen. The War Office has<br/>"pressed for an immediate carrying out of<br/>"the same reorganization in the remaining<br/>"Brigades."*<br/>I am of the opinion that there is a vast amount of bluff, and down right lying in this announcement. My experience in the military has taught me to distrust <strike>everything</strike> their statements.

This move was made to accommodate a draft of men from the 19th who were to be put into the 20th Battalion as "D "Company. When the 19th Battalion was paraded to be informed that it no longer existed, the men at once manifested their disapproval.

The 17th, 18th, and 20th Battalions each agreed to support the 19th Battalion in whatever action it might take. Tonight it was stated officially that the order breaking up the 19th Battalion had been cancelled. But the <strike>reassignment</strike> rearrangement</p>
