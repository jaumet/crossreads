<p>was done to the waterworks at Rodh Salem, and to buildings at El Hamma and Bir Mazar.  On the 23rd May, the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade reconnoitred Hod el Gaedaidia, 15 miles east of Qatia, where shots were exchanged with a patrol of forty men on camels, who retired.  Finally, on 31st May the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, one regiment of Australian Light Horse, and a sub-section of the Ayrshire Battery R.H.A., attacked the enemy's post at Bir Salmana, 20 miles E.N.E. of Qatia.  The post was surrounded before dawn, and an enemy post on the Ganadil road was rushed, while a camel detachment was seen making off to the south-east.  The enemy lost fifteen men killed and two men captured.  Our cavalry pursued till 8 a.m., when the pursuit was taken up by aeroplanes, which bombed scattered parties with effect, killing twenty camels and eight more men.  The force returned, having covered 60 miles in thirty-six hours, besides fighting an engagement.  The only casualties were two men slightly wounded.</p>
<p>On the western front, during May, preliminary measures for the occupation of the Baharia Oasis have been in progress.  A line of block houses has been established along the Darb el Rubi, which runs due west from Samalut, on the Nile.  Four block houses were completed and occupied by 23rd May.  Work on the two remaining block houses has been postponed till the railway has reached a point where it can materially assist in the supply of stores; this should be about the end of June.  From the most advanced block house it is now possible to reconnoitre as far as the Mohariq sand dunes, some 80 miles west of Samalut.  The difficulty of maintaining such a line in a waterless desert, subject to frequent and severe sand storms, has not been small, but all ranks have worked well, and with great keenness.</p>
<p>The enemy has a small body of troops, under the command of Nuri, collected on the Libyan side of the frontier, west of Sollum, but as yet he has not openly displayed his intentions.  Two battalions of Italian troops landed at Moraisa during the month, and have occupied Bardia.  The relations between the Italian and British commanders of the frontier are excellent.  The area between Sollum and Barrani has been cleared of the Bedouin population, and, though it has been impossible entirely to prevent communication between the Bedouins and Siwa, the energy of our patrols, according to numerous reports, is successfully restricting the entry of food supplies into Siwa.</p>
<p>By means of patrols of Imperial Camel Corps and motor cars, communication between the oases occupied by the enemy and the Nile Valley and Delta has been rendered almost impossible.  In particular, the camel patrolling from Kharga towards Dakhla and Beris has been carried out most efficiently by No. 1 Imperial Camel Company under especially trying conditions.  The Farafra, Baharia, Moghara, and Wadi Natrun fronts have also been controlled with great vigilance.</p>
<p>The Aulad Ali tribes in Egyptian territory are now all west of Barrani, except for a receiving camp at Sollum.  Markets have been established for the sale of food at Sollum, Mersa Matruh, Dabaa, El Hamman, and Wadi Natrun, where they are allowed to purchase what is necessary for their daily needs.  This restricts indiscriminate movement to the west or to the Delta.</p>
<p>In spite of the occupation, during very hot weather, of so many advanced posts in the desert or on its edge, I am glad to report that the health of the troops has been remarkably good.  I much regret, however, that General Sir Bryan Mahon, shortly after his arrival in this country to take up the command of the Western Frontier Force, had to be invalided home, owing to severe sunstroke.  In the meantime, Major-General A. G. Dallas, C.B., has continued, with great ability, in temporary command of that force.</p>
<p>11. I beg to acknowledge with great respect the valuable assistance I have received from His Highness the Sultan of Egypt.  He has, with great kindness, placed at my disposal his unrivalled knowledge of affairs affecting his country.</p>
<p>To His Excellency the High Commissioner, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A. H. McMahon,</p>
