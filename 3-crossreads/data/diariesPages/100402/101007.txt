Tuesday 8 January
On guard for 24 hours. A very heavy snow storm again last night but it is freezing again.
Wednesday 9 January
Snowing very heavily again. Attend lecture by Sir Richard Lodge, Professor History at Edinburgh University on the "Unity of Italy" the "Unity of Germany", a contrast. The lecture was lucid and I think it is a great thing for the troops I only hope it is a forerunner of more.
