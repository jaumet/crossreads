<p>the shells are landing it must be somewhat of an inferno. Through the glasses a little more is discernable and I saw one shell burst on the top of a ridge, lifting as it seemed to me the whole top off. Some 30 troopships along the shore are no doubt landing troops but we are too far off to discern details.</p>
<p>6 pm. Steaming up the coast some 9 miles to the North of the above, we have come on our own objective, &amp; can now watch two bombardments at once. At about a place called Fisherman's Hut, all our own transports have gathered, &amp; some are already landing troops. Nearer to the shore &amp; all along the coast belching out shells, and after the flashes which we can see quite plainly follow many seconds later the reports, and away up on the hills the explosions. The coast here is rather steep, in fact the hills tower above the beach, and a number of Torpedo boats are firing shrapnel. We can see it burst, but of course are too far away to judge results.</p>
