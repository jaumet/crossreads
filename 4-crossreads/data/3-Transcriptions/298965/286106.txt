When we landed we went for a route march &amp; passed through Atherton &amp; some very fine scenery <strike>roundabout</strike> We were very lucky to get ashore at all as none of the other troops were allowed to land &amp; we were only there one day as the next we went out into the bay there to anchor to be surrounded by all the other troops [indecipherable] <strike>We are still here with about 20 odd more others</strike>. Albany is a nice place also very clean &amp; the hills etc roundabout make it a place to be remembered</p>
