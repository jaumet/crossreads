Needle Tr (Firing Line)
27/12/16 shell holes. They arrived at all hours filthy and weary with skin clothes one mass of mud but report everyone quite cheery but longing for their relief. All agog these fellows at the idea of going over to London. The seat of the lats. here is certainly the most curious I have ever seen used for a similar purpose. It is a grave cross of some size in memory of a Pte. Of the R.E.s and resting on its sandbags its base makes quite a good seat. Our M.O. Sanbrook evacuated today and Fraser came in his place. A quiet evening with any amount of clerical work and tremendous lot of telephoning. Next time come in our carrying system must be altered. At present it means tired men from firing line carrying their own stuff and the result is that it simply does not reach there. Propose another relay further up who will carry the stuff right on. Everyone is suffering with a sore throat that makes one want to retch at every cough. The South of France seems a recuperating ground for this and for bronchitis. Returned officers notice the mens bad language very much for the first few days
