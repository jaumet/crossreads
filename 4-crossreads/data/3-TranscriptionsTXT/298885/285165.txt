 heart on 31 July.-17 
 The batteries here are having their worst time up to date 
 Aug 26th &ndash; 17 Last night we had more than our share of bombs. About midnight a plane was overhead and we all thought it was some accident when we heard about 12 bombs at the same time right along side of us. These are times when you will find out how many a dugout WILL hold. 
 Sept 2nd &ndash; 17 Spent my birthday all day on duty from 8AM to 12 midnight.
