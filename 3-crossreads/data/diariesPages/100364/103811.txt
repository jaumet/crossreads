lie. I have contended that all photographs by whomsoever they are taken, should bear the name in the corner of the taker, and he should be mentioned in conjunction with them wherever possible. I also had in the color pictures a slide of a pile of shells. It appeared in this picture and it was removed from the collection! The treatment has been so mean unnecessary, and unjustifiable, that I have washed my hands absolutely with the A.I.F. and will not be identified with, nor give any further efforts on their behalf. 
Here is 12 months of my life thrown away. All my experience, enthusiasm, (for the work was my hobby) my color slides, films, and results, I consider fruitless.
