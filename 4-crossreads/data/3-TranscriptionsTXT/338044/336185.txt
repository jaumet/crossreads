sea - moonlight; in the Mediterranean & the cruiser cutting across our bows continually, assuring us of some safety from submarines. Great is the Navy. At 10.30 pm turn in, tired out. Our lights have been out since dark    & we cannot even smoke on deck after 8 pm
11th July:- TuesdayNo  reveille this morning so did not turn out until 7.30 am. Parading all day long until 6.30 pm. Life boat drill & instructions & everywhere we go must carry our lifebelts with us like pets. The food is awful,just merely that slop called tea & a dough called bread, also margarine, called butter. There is one consolation, this trip is short  The food supplied by Allan line "Patriots" is the worst I've ever had & one feels absolutely week from lack of food. Still very hot. Anyway we're on our way to France, Marseilles,
