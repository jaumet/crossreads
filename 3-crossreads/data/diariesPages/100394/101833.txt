We are having a fairly busy time with our horses just now. A good many are on the sick list including mine with ringworms. Had a stray letter today from Ada Jones and wrote P.Cs. home and to Ada and Moll. Went down into Blesingham Village tonight and bought some pork chops and had them fried with eggs by the woman in our billet and had it with champagne.

Champagne is sold here at about 4/6 per large bottle. We were issued with gas helmets this morning and some of the Battery were gased to see how they worked. They also used some tear bombs. The mail closes at 9 a.m. tomorrow so I must try and drop a line or two home. Our boys are behaving wonderfully well over here. One French woman informed me that we are too quiet, much quieter than the French and English whom they don’t seem to like much, the latter I mean

July 7
Nothing much doing today. We are not allowed outside our billeting areas, so can’t see much of the country. Colonel Caddy addressed us today in regard to going into action. We are taking over from the 5th Brigade and so long as our position is not located by the enemy we will have a picnic. All work will be done at night and sleep in day time.

Had tea tonight with Corporal Bosall, Bill Hilder and Jack Burk at a farmhouse. Beautiful omelette containing 16 eggs. Went into Blaringhem after tea with Bill Hilder for tobacco but could only get cigars at Peach but very good.
