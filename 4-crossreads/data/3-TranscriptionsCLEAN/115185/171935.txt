9 - He has a bad eye at present. I have been to see him twice. He liked hearing all the Lemnos news.I got two nice letters from Co Jamieson. I think he will soon be back with us.I have not seen any of the "sights" yet - but have bought a Cairo guide book and two small books of Egypt in the Peeps & Many lands series & a guidebook to the pyramids "written for the Australian exp Force in camp beneath them" - which I've read & will post out to you. It's very good. There was a slight riot in Cairo today - but the light horse were called in and nothing happened.I will stop writing not. This is not a very interesting letter. I will have more to tell in the next.Devoted love to you allI hear there are heaps of parcels awaiting me at our new home where I go tomorrow.Your loving daughter & sisterBetha McMillan
