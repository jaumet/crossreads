her I'm in England. Have not looked up any of Mr Copp's relations yet but shall do so if remaining many more days here.Well, we've had a busy week. Getting our clothes fixed up - everywhere we go seem to have some alteration in our cape, cloaks etc. or hats - Now we have to wear shoulder straps with our stars - so we are some swank. I have bought a bonzer "Soth Wester" coat    & hat for the rain. We are allowed to wear them, also strong boots &  goloshoes .. fortunately my warm singlets are in good order & stockings, which I could not wear in Egypt, also warm nighties.I can see my money going fast, need umbrellas & all sorts of different  clothing so don't be surprised if I have to cable for money. Am alright so far. Travelling about is rather expensive    &  we are about indecipherable 1 hr 30 mins. out of London, so often have to take our meals out because trains & tubes do not fit in.
