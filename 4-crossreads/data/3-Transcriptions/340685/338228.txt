<p>22.8.18 McNamara came in about &frac12; an hour afterwards as he was detained to carry a stretcher case. Woke about 9 in the morning when Kenny the cook came round to tell us that breakfast had been brought over to the other side of the road. Mac got it and after some fruit we has a cigarette and went straight to sleep again until dinner at about 2.30 and after I had got it I went to sleep again but was awakened by Ferguson to tell us to get everything packed ready to move back. This happened about 3.45 and <strike>breakfast</strike> was at 4 and putting all our gear on the wagons we moved off at 5. Several German planes had manoeuvred over the firing line but didn't come further and were fired at by our archies. Got a parcel from Auntie Sarah containing books, an underpants and lollies. We marched up through Albert to our old camping ground after getting some firewood for the cooks we went to bed very tired.<br/>23.8.16 Rumours has again been active and now we are going to entrain direct to Armentiers. We got up at 6 and after breakfast <strike>mar</strike> got ready for marching and set out at 9 not carrying our packs. We travelled through Vadencourt and Contay where we were previously billeted on a hill and thence on to Warloy where we camped in a very dirty open paddock fairly close to the church arriving about 12.30. Mac and I proceeded up the town and bought a bottle of champagne to celebrate our escapes for 5 francs and on returning dinner was ready. We were told we would be staying the night as we had two days in which to reach Doullens. Soon after all the cyclists me included were marshalled to go to Contay to load our pontoons which had been dumped at R.E. yard previously. We set out (about 32 of us) in great style me with a fear of a blowout with two big holes in my tyre. However, all went well an I had a great spin and came in a good second. We got our wagons loaded and after a wash in a fine stream very like the one in Canaples we went up the town and purchased some fruit and chocolates and then returned home about 5.30. After tea as it was threatening rain looked round for a more suitable place to bunk in and at last got a suitable under the verandah of a house where ploughs etc were stored. It did rain a bit but we didn't get wet although we didn't sleep too well. Woke early but feet too tired to rise and waited until we heard someone say we were to leave at 8.10 when after a hurried dressing we got breakfast and got under way carrying our packs at 8.30. Felt wretchedly dirty and couldn't get a wash at all. Blood all over my clothes and mud and dust permeating everything.<br/>24.8.16 passed through Contay, Herissart, and on to Val De Maison where at 12 o'clock we stopped for 1 &frac12; hours to get dinner and here we put our packs on the wagons and all the men who had sore feet or were at all tired rode the transport horses while the drivers had a spell at walking. It was only 5 miles to Beauval and we arrived at our billet about 4 P.M. right in the centre of town and near the church. We had previously done a route march just to the outskirts to the canteen and had no idea how large and fine the town was.</p>
