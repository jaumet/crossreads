<p>like blazes &amp; they have hit a few I know.<br/>1st November.  Wet again today Im hanged if we can get 2 fine days in succession. Had a big party out last night in "Nomans Land" digging trenches out towards the Germans, my wasn't it cold just freezing we had no casualties but a lot of narrow escapes from the German shell fire.<br/>I brought the party in at 5 &amp; went down &amp; drew our rations which now includes daily a fair tot of rum per man, the men seem to think they are better for it but I don't think they are any warmer than I am &amp; I never touch the stuff.<br/>Had an unexpected visit from G. Vaughan this morning he has got a commission &amp; has had it nearly 3 months, I'm glad to see him with a star" for he is quite a good sort is George.<br/>A German plane brought one of ours down</p>
