 2/6/19 Edinburgh &ndash; London Made Adieux and left Waverly Station at 10. Amusing to see the Station Master wearing a top hat. The run to London uneventful and pleasant. A good view of York Minster and the Peterborough Cathedral on the train. It is the ordered regularity of the fields etc here that constitutes the difference between our country &amp; this. In their paddocks there is no &quot;picking up&quot; to be done. In Paddington at 7.25 after a tube run from Kings Cross. Got my hotel room and dashed off to catch a train for Hammersmith. Went to the Kings Theatre got a ticket dashed up the stairs and took my place just at the exact moment the curtain went up on a good rendering of &quot;Mignon&quot;. Bed midnight.
