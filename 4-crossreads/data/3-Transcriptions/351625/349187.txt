<p>old horse ship &amp; there was such a crowd on her that we couldn't find room to lay down.  Of course we came over during the night.  I had to sleep on a form about 8 inches wide.  We were on her about 20 hours altogether.  One funny thing about the new country is the new sort of money we have to deal in, Francs, Centimes, etc. but one soon gets used to them.  Today we have spent going through several gas chambers &amp; testing our P.H. helmets &amp; Box resperators.  We also got issued with our rifle, tin hat &amp; waterproof which is a sheet &amp; cape combined.  My word when we march away</p>
