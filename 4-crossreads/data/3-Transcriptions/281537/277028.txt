<p>15/9/15  Johnstons Jolly<br/>Taube aeroplane came over this afternoon and dropped a lovely bomb on Walkers Ridge.  Artillery firing at it failed to score a hit.  A mail arrived this evening.  In Lone Pine the 23rd have had a daring bomber who has been doing good work but rather venturesome raising head &amp; shoulders right over parapet while throwing.  Abdul waited for him today with machine gun and sliced the top of his head off like an egg shell.  Beachy Bill and Rickety Kate busy today.  Use at night a slush lamp made of fat and rag.</p>
<p>16/9/15<br/>Another quiet day.  All batmen stand to arms headed by the cook Jerry Bernau whose countenance hard &amp; warstoushed is warranted to terrify any enemy.  Noticed today that in one spot Abdul seems to have drawn his firing line back about 50 yards and lower down</p>
