AD SUMMUM.
The orbit ends &hellip;. A perfect sphere, to lovingearth divinely giv'n
Until its miracle was wrought, one raindropmore returns to heav'n,
It seeks its immemorial source beyond thebourne of mortal years,
Untinged of blood, nor dim with dust, norsalt with tears.
The spot it blessed, the watered seed, theliving branch, their witness bear;
The blossom by the orchard-side, the ripenedfruit, give promise fair;
And we who breathe that fragrance dearrecall our Edens of the prime
Ere yet we saw the teardrops on the cheeksof Time.
The raindrop in the wave was merged &ndash;a wave majestic, tempest-hurled,
High-towering o'er a sea that swept insurge on surge to cleanse  the world &hellip;
A wave of waves was all but spent &ndash; throughbloody surf it heaved the rest &hellip;A drop was lost; a bubble broke &ndash;but - on the crest!
