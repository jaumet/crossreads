DARDANELLES,5th October 1915.
My dear Mother,
Your letter of the 21st August to hand to-day and was of course very pleased to hear from you.
Think to-day must have been my birthday as I have received no less than twelve letters, which is not too bad.  We also got issued to-day with fresh meat and bread and have just finished a feed of steak and onions and there is joy in the dugout in consequence.  To-day we got a small issue of Comforts about 1 stick of chocolate per man, either a shirt or a pair of socks and about half dozen biscuits, not much but a welcome change.
It was a very good idea of yours to enclose an envelope and paper.  If you do this you May be sure of always getting a reply and there is an absolute dearth of paper etc here.
Things here are just the same old excitements and escapes.  Just as I write there is a heavy artillery dual going on two Aeroplanes are hovering about dodging shrapnel, and altogether it is rather difficult to write.
I would like to know Bernard Rose's Regimental No etc., so I could look him up.  Did not strike too many I knew in Egypt but of course I had the disadvantage of not knowing their Regimental Nos Brigades etc.  Have not seen Frank Eather yet.  Waiting for his No. etc.
Parcel has not come to hand yet, but have not given up hope yet.  Harry Smith has received a parcel from Home, so mine should not be far off.  Articles most needed are:-  Chocolate, Tobacco and Cigarettes, Socks and light flannel shorts, also a few boxes of matches.  There May be a few little things you could think of which May have slipped my memory.  Of course I don't want to break you, but if you have any money left over after Australia Day etc., I could do with another wristlet watch and case (preferably luminous).  There are only a couple left in the whole Section and it is pretty off when watching at night time not to know the time.
Well I'm pleased to say that I am still very much O.K. and getting fat.  Hope to hear from Os by next mail.  I hope Bill decides to come.  You know they are all wanted here.  Have not heard from Charlie yet.  Think you had better shake him up for me.  Surprised Colin did not get through and also that Alan did.  Will be very pleased to see them over here.  Hope Dad enjoyed his trip.
Will write again next mail.
Your loving Son,Pte 1280 Roy Richards.
