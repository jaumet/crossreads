 May 1917 24th   We had a route march through Bapaume this morning &amp; were free in the afternoon.   We played the tommies football &amp; cricket again this afternoon, as we have been doing for the last three days, otherwise there has been nothing else doing.   We have heard nothing further yet about moving off &amp; so far No 3 section has not returned from the supports.   The Tommies have been moving up in small parties nearly all day, &amp; a lot have come out.   The 60 Btn. is still in the line not having yet been relieved.   By yesterday's paper the news is confirmed that the whole of the Hindenburg line has been captured between Arras &amp; Bullecoart with the exception of about a mile &amp; a quarter.
