something...The chief topic of interest in camp now seems to be when our worthy S.M. is going to put on a new shirt. Controversy waxes strong on the subject and, I believe bets have been laid. He is reported to have worn the same shirt continuously during our stay at Sohag, but at Kantarah, amidst public rejoicing, he blossomed forth into a white singlet. It was and indiscreet step for white shows up the dirt rather markedly and now - after a month - it had distinctly lost its white  &  shining lustre.
