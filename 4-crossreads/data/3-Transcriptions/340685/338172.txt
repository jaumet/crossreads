<p>This morning the boat was pitching badly with a strong head wind and heavy sea and was quite as rough as in the Bight. Seasickness revived and I didn't feel sure of myself as I wasn't feeling too well. Too much supper the previous night I think. No land sighted all day but saw several boats only one of which was near enough to see at all. This was the Donalla. [Indecipherable] a hospital ship going home and she looked pretty. She is a converted P &amp; O boat. In the evening we were playing bridge down below when somebody came down and told us a ship was passing and sending morse signals. I went up and although I read the message quite easily it was coded and couldn't be understood. However, I saw our ship sending "good-night" and her code numbers. Before going to bed to-night Ludlow <strike>who had</strike> and I had a meal of onions and cheese which he had got from the cooks. I enjoyed it very much but have a nasty taste in my mouth next morning.<br/>21.4.16 Still just as rough but I feel quite happy again now although many look the very reverse of it. Easter Friday. &ndash; I am off to-day for feeding the horses and hope this after noon to get off exercising them. it is deserved I think. Feeling unaccountably the rightful to-day and think I'll peruse some French New Testament after breakfast. Rest of day uneventful. Wind lowering and the boat is almost steady now although the wind is still strong. Except to land about 5 on Sunday morning.<br/>22.4.16 After dinner to-day we saw land on both sides. On the right the Sinai Peninsula &amp; Palestine and hostile country &amp; on the left Egypt. There was a large island to start with &ndash; very high &ndash; and crumbly although rugged and with a light house on each end plainly visible.</p>
