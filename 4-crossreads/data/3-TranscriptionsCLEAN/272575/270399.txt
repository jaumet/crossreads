My Dear Bett.I am here at last, as you will see, I nearly missed my chance thanks to our muddling leaders.   I was to have gone on leave from Bovington, but as a draft of men were leaving for France all leave was cancelled, so I waited saw one of our Officers and he told me to apply in the following week, and I would get it, but my luck was out.  we got orders to move to Wareham, and the Officer who was backing me up went away to Salisbury.   I was amongst strangers, however I asked for leave at Xmas and for awhile was let think that it was quite all right and would be granted, however, a few days ago I was placed on a list with a lot more men who were to be transferred into the A. class group.   "No leave is granted to the men in that lot I believe, so, I had to get busy    I guessed that asking would be no good, so decided to use the General Australian method I did not intend leaving here before Xmas, as I had spent the last aboard ship so I handed my belongings over to one of my mates, and just dissappeared.   Getting away was a bit awkward, as I had no Pass and there are Plenty of Police on
