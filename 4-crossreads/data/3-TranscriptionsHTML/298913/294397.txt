<p>Port Said is a small place considering the amount of traffic by sea &amp; the position &amp; as is usual, is a native town. It has a very pretty beach which however is dirty &amp; is dotted with a number of dirty bathing houses. The streets are good in parts, whilst others resemble Cairo. The harbour is not very big, but is very thick with traffic &amp; the shipping here is enormous. French warships guard the entrance to the canal whilst a few British warships, monitors &amp; others are permanently stationed.</p>
<p>There is an aerodrome on the far side of the harbour &amp; in this place are some big seaplanes. One flew out whilst there &amp; made a great noise, &amp; was well worth seeing. The accommodation of the hotels is good but expensive in the better places. The Casino on the beach is only open to officers &amp; of course is very elaborate. A typical sight in this town is the money changer who sits on the corner &amp; changed ones money.</p>
<p>As in Cairo one can obtain light refreshments  at reasonably cost which are served on tables on the footpath. The heat here however is intense &amp; is that moist heat. The canal buildings are on the harbour &amp; are beautiful. Native police patrol the streets &amp; keep the niggers quiet. Native town is out of bounds &amp; is apart from the main town. The town is  not very busy &amp; the main streets are planted with trees on either side that give some shade. An old donkey train is the only means of conveyance beyond the familiar garries.</p>
