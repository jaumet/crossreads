31st.3.19Fair weather prevailed in which everybody turned up for meals.  The 1st & 2nd sittings well patronised.  A concert was held at night & everyone enjoyed themselves immensely.  At 11 a.m. this morning we sighted a large floating cylinder about 12 ft. by 4.  It passed within a hundred yards.  We had a few shots at it so as to sink it, it being a harmless buoy.  We did not stop but reported same to Malta by wireless as the Admiralty have patrol ships out for that purpose.
1.4.19At 8 a.m. we entered the Straits of Messina between Sicily Island & the Mainland of Italy.  We noticed Mount Etna volcano smoking also the Volcano on Strounbuli burning & smoking, smoke projecting fully 100 feet high.  It is a lovely sight steaming through these straits.  The Troops & passengers enjoying the views & taking snaps of the picturesque parts.
2.4.19At 9 a.m. we entered the straits of Bonifaco between the Islands of Corsica (where Nepoleon Bonoparte was born) & Sardina.  It was also a picturesque spot & very interesting the straits being only 3 miles wide in some parts.  The Ancient buildings, Cathedrals etc. built high up on the cliffs.  Fine weather prevailed throughout.  A concert was held amongst the troops & passengers in which everyone enjoyed themselves.  We eased down to slow during the night so as to be off Marseilles at Daylight.
