<p>8-1-17<br/>I am not in love with this place but am told it is the best Hotel in town not out of bounds to soldiers so will have to be satisfied, one cannot even get a hot bath here &amp; the tariff is 12 [?]  per day. My pass is made out for Port Said &amp; not Suez &amp; everyone who is staying at Hotels have to sign their names &amp; where they come from also their Regt. for the information of Military Police so I may get into trouble here before I return especially as I shall probably have to overstay my leave. Sent a cable home this morning; A Russian cruiser passed through the canal on the 5th &amp; either hit a floating mine, torpeoded, or internal explosion, anyhow she went</p>
