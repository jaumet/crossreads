<p><u>Written after leaving Anzac</u></p>
<p>After a beautiful sleep in our blankets I have a busy time issuing rations   &amp;  attending to a whole lot of little details<br/>At 2 pm  <strike>me</strike> we move up into the firing line  &amp;  see the bombardment which tears the Turk trenches about a lot<br/>At 3 pm we start to get out of the trench into a bit of a valley out of sight of the Turks but some of us were not lucky enough to get down quick enough I got my first hit in the left foot about 1 minute after getting out of our trench</p>

<p><u>Saturday Contd</u></p>
<p>My experience for the next few seconds trying to regain our trench w/- rifles   &amp;  M G's playing all around was a thing not to be forgotten in a day.<br/>From the dressing station I was carried to the beach  &amp;  onto the Hosp Ship.<br/> <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </u><br/> <u>Sunday</u><br/>Taken to Imbros Is. on a trawler   &amp;  installed in Marquee Hosp. Tent<br/>Luckily I can hobble about w/- a little difficulty   &amp;  pain.</p>
