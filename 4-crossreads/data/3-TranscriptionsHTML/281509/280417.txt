<p>13 July 1916<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>"Weighed anchor" at 3.30 p.m. after having a good rest. Incident of the throttled hen &amp; old French woman's anger. Passed through Flessnes. Crossed railway line on road to Amiens. Aerodrome. Plodded on with full pack up thro' one village after another, all filled with soldiers.- finally pulling up at Allaville where we are quartered for night in hay loft. Very comfortable till old French woman comes in &amp; kicks up row for tramping over her threshed wheat. Village sold out of eatables. That lovely avenue of trees.</p>
