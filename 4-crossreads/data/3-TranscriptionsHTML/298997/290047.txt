<p>our own, which may surprise Brother Fritz.  There is another of the iron observation trees of the Germans near Voormezeele.  It is even a better specimen than the one at Rose Wood. Round the trunk, near the broken "branches" is very fine wire netting supporting ivy leaves like the millinery in a lady's hat, which look very real.  The base is reached by a sap from what used to be a German trench.  Three bombs were dropped near the camp tonight.</p>
<p>March 22<br/>Worked towards St Eloi.  Fritz shelled heavily but we could see he was trying to get some ammunition trucks standing near a 9.2 battery, by Lake Zillibeke.  We were working when the explosion occurred.  A shell must have landed right in one of the  trucks, for it blew up bodily, the noise being most terrific &amp; terrifying.  It was magnificent to see way the men from the 9.2's butted in to save the other two trucks from the fire caused by the one in the centre which had blown up.</p>
<p>More gas last night; and the Germans big shelling keeps up.  Our own guns seem rather more quiet than usual.  We think they are building up for a big stunt.</p>
<p>March 23<br/>Fritz had the audacity to land a shell alongside the canteen <strike>when</strike> (Tommy Artillery) where we get our beer when we have the money &ndash; it is the best</p>
