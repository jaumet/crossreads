 Fri. 31st May A dire calamity occurred today.   We are each cook and scullion of the mess in turn for a whole day each;  we are at liberty to engage our own orderly to wash dishes etc from among the Italian or Russians. 
 George today after dinner handed our Family Plate (3 chipped enamel basins &amp; 3 tin spoons) to an Italian to wash and prompty forgot them. 
 The Plate, alas!, returned no more and we are reduced to using saucepan lids. as eating utensils. 
 Captain Mowatt and his wireless operator (McGrath) of the C.P.R. liner "Medora" arrived today after 24 days in a sub.   I earned the benedictions of the Captain (a pious but very decent chap) by doing the "ministering-angel" act with a tin of cocoa. 
 We take Mac into our Mess. 
 Sun. 2nd June. In our once-more brushed and garnished uniforms with borrowed accessories Mc &amp; I go to Mass;   the little Italian priest officiating.
