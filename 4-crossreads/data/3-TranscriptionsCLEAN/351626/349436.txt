3in Malta.  Hardly any of the boys get their parcels which are sent from Australia although we do not mind if we knew the boys at the front would get them more there.  I like England very much   & the people could not be nicer - they are very good to Australians.  Hoping to hear you are all well when I do get a letter.  I am your affectionate SonCharlie
