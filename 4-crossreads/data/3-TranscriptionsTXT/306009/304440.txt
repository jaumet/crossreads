 1915 Sep. 15 Wed. Left Gezira 11.30 am &ndash; Cairo 12 noon arrived Sidi Gaba 3.10 (just outside Alex). Changed there for Montazeh where arrived at 4 p.m.  Journey from Cairo to Sidi Gaba uneventful &ndash; line passing between well irrigated fields of waving corn , &amp; cotton bushes.  Between Sidi Gaba &amp; Montazeh passed numerous fruit laden date palms &amp; fig trees, Australian camp with horse lines, &amp; a camp of French Troops. I hope to have a good time at the Conval. Depot. It is a big building right on the ocean, on the coast west of Alexandria.
