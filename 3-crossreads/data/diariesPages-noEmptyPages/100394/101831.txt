Very good war news this morning victories on all fronts. We are leaving for the front in a few days. This is called Sandwick Camp and is supposed to be a rest Camp It is rotten being stuck here without money I could have had leave into Havre tonight but hadn’t a penny. We have very good Y.M.C.A. and Canteens here. It is a jolly shame to think we have been a fortnight without a change of clothing of any sort.

Nothing much happened today Had some tea and cake &c at Y.M.C.A. and we were all very surprised to get paid tonight 65 francs each at 28 fr to 1£. I was put on guard on Brigade stores tonight.

I had leave into Havre this morning and had a very pleasant time. It is a fine old city. Bought one or two souvenirs. At night I was put on town picquet in Saint Addresse a suburb, but our beat only consisted of one street near what they call the German Castle Some kind French lady presented us with cigars and cigarettes and beer. We were issued with another set of underclothing today.
