<p>1917<br/>Wed. 5th Sept.<br/>Yesterday I left the hospital and came aft again.</p>
<p>She reached the entrance to the Straits safely and all night was busy mine-laying.   "Wolf" laid the most complicated fields &ndash; she would run for 15 minutes and drop a couple of mines &ndash; would then go on again and drop a few more, etc.</p>
<p>She laid 110 mines, and it is a field which will not easily be swept up &ndash; last night's work is going to cost many lives.</p>
<p>As daylight came on the work was completed and the Germans cheered loudly on deck.</p>
<p>The mine-laying did not prevent me from sleeping well &ndash; even the cheers did not wake me.</p>
<p>This morning we saw a welcome sight through the holes in the bulkhead, - the mine-chamber was absolutely empty and our chances of being blown kite-high by a single lucky shot from a patrol-boat are much reduced.</p>
