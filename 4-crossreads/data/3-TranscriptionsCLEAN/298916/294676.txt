Every morning the flagship of the NZ convoy would call all his convoy up & after wishing them "Good morning" (by radio) he would give the warnews & any other messages & replies that may be of interest. The Australian method ---------Cq (all stations) Orders for the day (given) War news will be sent during the afternoon. (too tired now?) The war news I would often get at 3am from a warship perhaps up at Bombay in India or else from Aden. An hour later another message would be sent cancelling the previous one & issuing another which often had to be altered again. I am not prejudiced against the flagship nor anyone in particular, but never-the-less the way orders were issued, was disgusting, also, on the flagship the "heads" (wooden I think) had a special room for this & another for that, & a special stall for so & so's horse & something else for so & so. To cut a long story short there were enormous sums of money wasted in carrying out each officer's particular desire, instead of giving them a good serviceable room
