<p>C/o. D. M. S.<br/>Cairo<br/>Egypt<br/>1st. Septbr. 1915</p>
<p>My dear Girls:</p>
<p>You will notice that a new month has come upon us, the ninth of the present year. How the time is flying past? The end of the annual round will soon be upon us. In a news paper I have seen notice referring to the Christmas trade. Is it likely that we shall be home for the new year of 1916? No possibility is in view of such happy event, rather does each day promise prolongation of our stay in this northern hemisphere.<br/>11.30 p. m., another hospital train, with wounded from the Dardanelles, has just rolled into Heliopolis, two motors are coming to me with patients. When will they come?</p>
<p>Joseph dear: A letter written by you arrived to day. It bears date 2.6.15. Some silly ass placed upon the envelope in blue pencil, "C/o. High Commissioner, London", following this direction it has been to England and back. What should be done to the silly ass? Why cannot he mind his own business and allow the director of the address to be responsible for his actions. Yes he may have had good intent, therefore let us forgive him, but swear words can hardly be kept from interfering with charitable thoughts.<br/>I have not had word from Harris for a long time, he is bound to be pursuing the even tenor of his way in the fertile land of France, the world's best garden. My regards to him when you write.<br/>Ian Hamilton, if he is to succeed this year at Galipoli, must do so within the next four weeks, because it is said that unless he does so the severity of the weather after the equinox will render the supplying of his troops impossible, he must needs therefore hurry up. Is he doing so? The progress if any is slow, and no great success beyond the landing has been achieved. Let us pray that something better may soon be, with truth, reported. It is little satisfactory to be day after day pounding away at an enemy if, the end of each twenty four hours sees nothing accomplished.<br/>It is far otherwise with the position in Poland, where city after city falls into the hands of the German. Achieving much are the armies of Hindenburg and his fellows. How inspiriting to the whole German people must be the news of the capturing of great fortresses, such as those which surround Warsa[w], and are stretched from Riga to Galicia along the important rivers which run<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Paul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beckendorff und von Hindenburg, known as Paul von Hindenburg, (1847-1934), Prussian-German field marshal, statesman and politician, was chief of staff of the German Army from 1916-1919 and served as second president of Germany from 1925-1934.]</p>
