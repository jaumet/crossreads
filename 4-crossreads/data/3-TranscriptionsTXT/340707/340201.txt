At 7 pm there is a choir of 10,000 which perform in Hyde Park
I dine tonight at Pinveli & lucky to get in as special dinners are being given in every cafes called Victory dinners & every table has been booked for weeks ahead.
I meet an Englishman & his wife John O. Mayes of Constantia, Cienfuegos Cuba & now of Overseas Club, Aldwych London) & we join up in order to get in as there is a table for 3 available.
Inside all is a wild scene of revelry. A party of RAF & WRAF in one corner 2 opera or theatrical singers near by a Belgian woman & her husband a spanish lady all more or less half seas over & all making the greatest possible amount of noise.
We order a boule of Chianti not knowing what a bottle is & behold a bottle which takes both hands to hold & about 18 in high arrives. Much excitement is caused by its arrival & many participate in its contents. One Aussie from Egypt a law student from Adelaide nips me for 10/-.
Fun runs high & I did all sorts of things like the rest. Autographs are frequently collected & 2 chaps collect me & we do a forward rush down room clearing all before us including tables
