 onli have seen the push fall over one anoth the NCO 's myself get box up , but we got the grip of it at the finish Len promot was read out today also Sid Harri McKeown . This afternoon I reckon our offic done the most unsportsmanlik thing as ever I have seen , there are 2 footbal ground here , 1 of them was allot for a game of Soccer the other for Rugbi , the offic were play Rugbi but when they got down to their ground they thought it was too wet so they decid to come up to the other ground where the Soccer match was in progress , so up they come after a terrif argument they hunt the player off , the chap call them for everyth I believ , then left the ground in a bodi . This I reckon was a dirti rotten piec of work instead of encourag sport they are go the right way about thing to kill it proper
