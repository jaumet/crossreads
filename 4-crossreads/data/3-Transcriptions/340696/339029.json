<p>127<br/>Blue Carter &amp; I went for a stroll down to the Somme River the other night it was great.</p>
<p>10-5-18 Went punting on the River Somme it was glorious. Blue Carter Bill Newton &amp; a lad named Middleton were with me. The picturesque scenery is indescribable &amp; we saw it at it's best. It was a glorious afternoon just like our weather at home.</p>
<p>16-5-18 Train sports were held to-day- a brilliant success- plenty of fancy dress the clothes were obtained from the empty houses in the village. It was an excellent turn out.</p>
