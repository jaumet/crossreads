<p>40<br/>finding no officers in the mess I return to B Coy have supper &amp; then take Beatons billet again.</p>
<p>14-1-1919<br/>This morning I breakfast with A Coy &amp; then visit billets at 9 am am allotted to No 2 platoon. Routine here consists of breakfast 8.15 am. visit billets 9 to 9.30 then loiter around football field till10.45. fall in &amp; route march or battalion parade.</p>
<p>The whole of the afternoon is free to do as we like. Lunch is 12.30 &amp; dinner 6.0 pm. The night is free The one mania in this battalion is football &amp; it is pitiable to see grown men, pretending to be children &amp; with minds incapable of grasping the larger ideals &amp; so degenerate in a eager childish way to amuse themselves with something that cannot interest them.</p>
<p>The billets are arranged as artistically as possible as marks are awarded to each company &amp; everyone save the diggers simulate keenness Owing to intervention of my company commander Major Carr I manage to get two suits underwear &amp; towel from Baths. After dinner</p>
