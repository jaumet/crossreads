<p>bleak morning I got between the blankets again as soon as we crossed the Seine.<br/>At Epluches 29 kilom&egrave;tres on this side of Paris a two hours halt was made  and here we had a good clean up, breakfast and a stroll round the surrounding village.<br/>The train left punctually at 9.30 a.m., too punctually in fact for two of our Sergts who "missed the bus" and came on a few hours later. At Epluches we over took a trainload of Australian infantry also making for the north, but they continued their journey soon after our arrival.<br/>We ran through St. Just at noon, Amiens at 1.30 and arrived at Abbeville where there is a big British base depot. No one would think now that the Germans had possession of Amiens (taken on 2.9.15) and lost it again to the French. We were due to stay at Abbeville about an hour</p>
