steamed about 6 knots per hour - West - we are now doing 11 - We had some Bridge in Fitz's room last eveg but it was far too hot & we soon washed it out & went to bed on the poop only to be washed out by the rain at 3 am -
Saty Jan 2nd 1915 - Convoy is the order of the day - we lead & the Eastern follows so that this stunt has turned out all right -No prayers Saty morning - Holy stone instead - We all have our feet bare - pants turned up & wade about while the men scrub down & clean up for Sunday -Sick parade 8.30 - no one save a lad of 17 who has been seasick off & on since we left Sydney - I've given him very light work - none at all if necessary - No one else sick - It's hot & sticky & I think of the clean heat of Glen Innes & its lovely nights & I reread my journal of 1914 telling what happened - Any races at Deepwater this year?
