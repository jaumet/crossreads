17.6.15Thurs. 17th.  Penny, Smithers & I were on a sapping party from 8 till 12 this morning at Popes Post.  We had a very easy time of it & as I was in charge I had nothing to do at all.  Last night it came out in orders that volunteers were called for, for men to go as officers for Kitcheners army, anyone picked to go would have to sign on for 5 years.  I have been thinking of putting in for it, but came to the conclusion not too, as they only get 7/6 or 10/6 per day & 5 years is too long at this game.  I will be satisfied to turn the game in as soon as this war finishes.  After dinner to-day we went to the beach & enjoyed a lovely swim & gave our flannels & socks a rough wash in the sea.  This afternoon "Sandy" Cameron was cross-questioned by an officer on Quinns Post who thought he may have been a German spy.  The best joke we have had up to date.
