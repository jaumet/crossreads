<p>arrived at 3 a.m. with breakfast, after which we went to sleep in our dugouts, &amp; slept &amp; read the papers all day as usual. I saw an Inverell Argus a chap gave me, haven't seen one for years, since I was a kid in Warialda. The weather is still bright &amp; fine, the nights are pretty cool though. Went out digging as usual at 10.30 p.m., just as we started the brute sent over shells too close to be pleasant, but they weren't straight enough. It's a coot digging, with no dugout to get in, &amp; hear them whistling towards you. Saty. 8 June<br/>Came back at 2 a.m., breakfast came up at 3, then we lay down in our dugouts &amp; slept till noon, isn't it a rotten existence, as the Froggies say, "la guerre no bon." I got a parcel today from Elsie, a cake. Went across to see Boo this afternoon, he's O.K. I was having a read in my dugout before we went out digging, &amp; heard a big shell roaring in the distance. It then sounded as if it was going to fall horribly close, &amp; it shook the ground as it burst near a dugout on the slope. It blew the candle out there, &amp; made some chaps scatter, who were playing cards. Went out</p>
