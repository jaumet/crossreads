<p>On the way back I had a look at the damage done by big German shells last night, and found they had blown up the 5th Field Ambulance, and broken a few panes of glass round about, This mind you is situated in the main street of the town. It is Just up the street from our billet. So far we have been almost immune, there have been narrow escapes certainly, but still they are escapes, and that is the main thing.<br/>Presently,I may only be able to send field postcards.<br/>Things are getting hotter and letters becoming more and more difficult to write, and get censored, and sent away.<br/>I will hang on to the last of course, but we have received a number of polite hints lately, which augur a stricter handling of mail.<br/>SOMEWHERE IN BELGIUM,<br/>8/7/16.<br/>Our dug-out we have just made very comfortable; we are new tenants and we found it in a most disgusting condition.<br/>We managed to get through most of the hamper and then orders came to quit&#151;half an hour's notice.<br/>We do not get up (at the pits) until about 9 or 10 in the morning&#151;and in fact lie in bed all day if there has been a h eavy strafe the previous night, or early hours of the morning. I am scribbling this at the wagon line.<br/>9/7/16:<br/>An all night trip last night. Reveille 8 a.m.<br/>Nearly 5 hours sleep&#151;but that is not bad.<br/>10/7/16:<br/>Plenty of work yesterday, so no time to write. All</p>
