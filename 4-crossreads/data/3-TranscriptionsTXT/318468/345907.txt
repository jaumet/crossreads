today we could do little but sit in the tent & wait for the weather to take up.
6-4-15.   All last night the wind blew with terrific force & drove the rain through every chink in the tent.   Today there has not been much rain although the wind has been blowing heavily most of the day.   We have been packing up some of our things preparatory to going away.   We are to be on board by Friday 9th.   A good many horses were taken on board to-day also some of the Infantry embarked, the rest to go tomorrow.   Cannot say where going but think going Dardanelles.   Nothing else of importance.
