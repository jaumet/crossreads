<p>25, Half Moon Street,<br/>Mayfair, W.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. John</p>
<p>I've had two splendid letters from you and was glad to get all the news going:  the second letter was written from Ocean Beach &ndash; some place called Collervey, on January 26th.</p>
<p>You know you were not in a very excellent mood at time of writing but it is so long ago that I won't try and recall it all to you:  probably you had a fit of blues at the time:  never mind, old lady, we all have them if we are only honest enough to own up to it.</p>
<p>Why, I've never been homesick &amp; sentimental to the extent I am now previously:  as one grows older, undoubtedly one grows more and more soppy (do you like my word).</p>
