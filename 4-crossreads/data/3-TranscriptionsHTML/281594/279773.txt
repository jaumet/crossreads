<p>In factory towns one finds the very opposite. The factory workers find a pleasure in making their house beautiful, and cultivating their garden, growing flowers, and vegetables. This afternoon L.H. D.I. and myself  took a walk up the lovely drive to the chataeu, on the hill, called the Chateau L'Hermitage. Every variety of tree seems to be growing here, from the dark olive of the Pine to the bright green of the  <strike>Larch</strike> Birch, these trees were arrayed in their Spring grandeur. We each had a book from the Padre's Library and seated there we enjoyed a rest and a read in the sun. Looking down on to the plain beneath we could see the white roads winding their way over green fields. Clouds of dust were rising from these road caused by motor traffic of all descriptions going backwards and forwards carrying stores, munitions, etc to the "Line"</p>
<p>Down at the foot of the hill away to the left can be seen little cottages with their nice little garden. These  are occupied by the workers of the paper mills and quarries which are the staple industries of the village. Water power seems to be the motive power of these factories.</p>
<p>Looking up into the sky on hearing the sound of buzzing, one could see numerous aeroplanes sailing from the "Line" and to the "Line".</p>
<p>May 15th.<br/>D.I.  &amp; myself went to Bas. S. We found that the grandmother had died. The family were busily</p>
