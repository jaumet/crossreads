 Dear Mr. Layton - Mrs. Davies & 2 children want to get back to her husband who has been returned wounded to Brisbane & has not the means to pay her fare to Brisbane. Can you assist her with her fares for self & 2 children, her pay is only half this time & leaves her without any money when expenses paid that are owing - 
 Yours truly E. H. Bennie.
