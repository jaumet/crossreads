I was the only one on at the time, it being winter-time & no visitors. The break in the wall on the left is the way down to a Two-storyed Bathing House. I don't  know how people can swim in such cold water. It is only warm enough for about 2 months & yet these people swim all the year round. It is a lovely day to day. It has been a marvellous winter. just think we have only had 20 nasty days during the whole time. Last year we had ice & snow all the time. We have only has snow on about 6 days. I've written to Mum George, so I'll just say that we are both well & having as good a time as we can. Regards to the Mills family & Lily & Ken Norton. Your Loving Brother  Harry
