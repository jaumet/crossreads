 Bulford 10.3.18 Dear George, This are three of the Barrows as they are called that are to be seen by the dozens round these Plains. They are the burial grounds of the ancients. These three are situated about &frac12; mile from this office right alongside the Footy Ground. This was taken on X'mas Day when E.Sgt Toppia &amp; I were out for a walk. It has been glorious the last few days. It was a lot different when this Photo was taken. We had 3 wintry weeks about X'mas time but ever since it has been OK. I wrote to Mum &amp; Dad all about my leave to Grimsby. I had a day at Brighton. It is a lovely place. I shall go to see Auntie Anne next time. Ellis is not working with me now. He is Ward Master of A Division. I am Wardmaster of B. Div.. No promotion only it is better because we'll be able to go on leave together. Well George I am going for Tea, I know what it is on 1.1.18 &amp; on 31.12.18. Bread, margarine, Jam (made from Vegetables &amp; called plum) &amp; Tea. It is nice to always have the same. No Stomach Troubles arise out of it any way. Best Wishes to all at Brookvale &amp; to the Club Boys. Os. Merrett &amp; Mr Love.  Love Harry
