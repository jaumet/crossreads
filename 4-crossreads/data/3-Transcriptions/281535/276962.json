<p>17/5/19<br/>Salisbury &ndash; Sutton Veny<br/>countryside is and notices the oaks as especially beautiful. I have not remarked these trees on the Continent to the same extent. A march of 2 &frac12; miles from <strike>Sutton</strike> Warminster brought us to Sutton Veny Camp where all we soon installed. Met General Robertson after lunch and again at 3 p.m. when he arrived with General Rosenthal who gave an address to the quota. Spent the remainder of the afternoon in the Camp. Dined. Early to bed.</p>
<p>18/5/19<br/>Batman Scotty Watson is not satisfactory and was late this morning. Afternoon went up to No. 1 A.G.H and passed the afternoon with the sisters finishing with a stroll in the woods of the Marquis of Bath. Very lovely shades of green as usual. Being Sunday the camp was more quiet than ever.</p>
