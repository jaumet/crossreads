 Sunday 25 November 
 Today St. Catherine's Day is a great carnival day in Paris, but the excitement took place yesterday in the streets and we of course joined in the fun.  Fine weather prevails.  Visited the big wheel &ndash; Blighty Corner &ndash; Pathe Freres Gramaphone Rooms.  Politeness of the French People is very marked. Sunday night here is very lively   It seems to be a great amusement night and the city is crowded.  Quite a merry time at the Alhambra Called on Paul de Longchamps, 14 Rue de Washington off B'de Haussmann. Australians are well liked in Paris and eyes are upon us everywhere we go
