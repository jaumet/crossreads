Green is everywhere, and the scenery is pleasant, but further up towards the line, there is ruin all round.  Farms &amp; Houses smashed to pieces.  I wrote to you from England.  I hope that you receive the letters.  Write when you can and I will do my best to answer your letters.  They are things we look forward to very much.
