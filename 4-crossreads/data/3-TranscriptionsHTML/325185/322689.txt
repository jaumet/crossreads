<p>N.B.<br/>I received Miss Brown's parcel the other day.  Have written &amp; thanked her.  The cake was as fresh as when cooked even if it has been three months coming across.  Don't worry we shall bag the Kaiser this year &amp; what a time all shall have then.  Clyde.</p>
<p>Dear Father</p>
<p>Havent had any letters from you lately.  I dare say I shall get a bundle one of these days.  Well I am going into the machine gun section.  They call it the suicide Club here.  <strike>The</strike> Say the life of a machine gunner's <strike>life</strike> is only six minutes after they locate the gun the enemy.  That may be but one will account for a fair number in that time considering they fire about a thousand rounds a minute.  I have had three <strike>times</strike> tries to get into the section so am satisfied now.  We are to go to Yeritoun for three week's instruction then join the Battalion again.  I don't know where we are going to but it is rumered that we are going across to France in the spring.  I hope it is true.  We shall have a chance to show the square heads what we can do then.  I had a letter from Miss Smithers today.  She and her brother had sailed for Egypt.  I have just been making enquiries about the Reins he is in.  I am told they are at Heliopolis so I shall see them if we go to Yeritoun.  I wish I knew what Bert was in I dare say he is across here now</p>
