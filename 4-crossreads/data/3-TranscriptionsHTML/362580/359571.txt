<p>So pleased that poor old Annie was able to have a few days in Melb. with you, dear old Belle would be very delighted.  I must finish my p. cards now so must stop.  The mail we believe leaves to-morrow.</p>
<p>Darling Eddy is getting quite clever with his drawing &amp; writing.</p>
<p>Hope you are all well.  Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all.  Hope Belle have A Happy Birthday.</p>
<p>Tell dear old Mother I'm still looking for her letter.</p>
<p>From,<br/>Your loving sister,<br/>Edith.</p>
