 March Sunday 4 1917 Another Sunday in the line . One cannot discern ani differ from other day . There is none here . Turn cold again . Veri slack , few wound through . Thank good that the kill has slacken off even for a littl while . Poor old McDonald who was hit yesterday die . This war is a holacost , one after the other pass out , friend amp ; foe , comrad combat . We are weari of the aw wast .
