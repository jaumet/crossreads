 30th . It has been a love glorious day noth but sunshin from morn till night , just the opposit to yesterday . Heard tonight that the 1st , 5th 9th Battn 's had been broken up to reinforc the remaind of the Div. what a shame if it is true for those Battalion have a record that all are proud of whi it seem as if one is part with someth that is part of his life , I can hard realiz it true myself they must be want men veri bad to take such a drastic step as this with the old 1st Div. I for one will not like the idea of go back to a strang unit after be so long with the good old black green .
