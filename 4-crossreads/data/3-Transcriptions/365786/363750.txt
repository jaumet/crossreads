<p>Only till the enemy, heavily reinforced, counter-attacked. <strike>again</strike> Then either our men have been killed to a man, or have had to fall back - &amp; that little bit of the ground will have to be fought for again.  Not because our men didn't win thro' in the first case, but because, having won the line with great losses their decimated ranks could not hold the trench &amp; there being no more men to support, the ground won had to be abandoned.  Wouldn't it have cost much less, had we been able to hold that hard earned ground?  Then another way reinforcements help &ndash; if the men in the trenches can be relieved at regular intervals their health keeps good.  Just think what it must mean to the men when they are regularly given time off.  They do not take it easy altogether behind the lines but they get away from the eternally being on the alert &ndash; for even during a lull the front line is on the qui vive.  There are always odd bombing attacks, excursions into no man's land,</p>
