<p>10/1/18 Oxford<br/>towers but I did not go inside. Walked down to the Magdalen Bridge which gives pleasant views of the tree lined Cherwell and a big expanse of open grass land &amp; meadows on either side. Entered Magdalen College and had a good look round the beautiful cloisters of its secluded interior. Being winter time the creepers have no leaves &ndash; when all is green these walls and towers must present a lovely sight. The Chapel dates from 1480 and is very lovely with a stone reredos. Some cadets were drilling in the garden &amp; the paths to river side and the walks were not open. Passed University College &amp; All Souls College without entering and next pulled up at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin. All turrets &amp; pinnacles and a high tower. The door has twisting stone supports surmounted by a statue</p>
