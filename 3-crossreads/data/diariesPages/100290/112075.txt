No carry last night one early this morning. Broken leg. At this moment of writing one of our airmen brought down a Fritz aeroplane not far away. A thrilling sight. Met Bert Francis on the 3"green" across from Flers. First meeting since leaving Aus. Hardly recognised him for his unshaven face. We are all dirty unkempt. Weather is fine for a wonder.
