<p>There is a fairly heavy bombardment raging on our left this morning &amp; our aeroplanes are directing the batteries</p>
<p>This morning Capt. McKenzie called me down to his dugout as he wanted to see me, so down I went, he asked me about my commission, I told him what happened, he said it would be alright, it would come later on he would see to that, &amp; he also said he would do his best for Len what do you think of that he's some Capt. isn't he;</p>
<p>Just at present Len &amp; I are in the boom I am in charge of N.C.O.s &amp; men in the front line 37 altogether &amp; Len has the 3rd line</p>
