Spt 17 fact 2 lighters are now busy coaling us & we expect to leave this afternoon. Another transport (A 46) enroute to England arrived this morning, & the Euripides is expected some time today. Gee! Its great to feel that at last we are really "home" in Australia - despite the fact that 'Sy' is still many miles away.The sun is beautifully warm & not a cloud is visible. Believe we were expected at 6 yesterday mn'g & many friends & relatives had been waiting since that time.
