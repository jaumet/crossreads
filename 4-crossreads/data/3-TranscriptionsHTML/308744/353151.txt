<p>SEPTEMBER:  This was a month of records. During the two final weeks of September the work of the squadron was particularly strenuous. It was the first stage of our great advance, and all machines were pressed into service. The flying hours reached the substantial total of 866 &ndash; the highest figure registered in the history of the unit. The activity that prevailed after operations were entered upon is evident from the fact that for the first 8 days after the battle started the flying time was 409 hours, while 106,000 rounds were fired and 3,700-lbs. of bombs dropped by the machines of this Squadron. 159 attacks were made upon retreating troops and transport and other ground targets. The country both East and West of the JORDAN was closely reconnoitred early in the month, and during the advance of our troops our machines covered a very considerable area of new territory, over which no British machine had been previously. This extended from our old line up to Beirut on the Coast, thence across to DAMASCUS, and East of the JORDAN to SHEIKH SAAD, DERAA and BOSRA ESKI SHAM. Altogether 53 reconnaissances were carried out during the four weeks, many of which involved flights over distances up to nearly 300 miles, and the consequent use of advanced landing grounds. Two special reconnaissances were made to locate missing machines from other Squadrons, and in each case the search was successful. Eight photographic reconnaissances were carried out, during which 64 square miles of country were covered. Free use was made of the aspect camera also, photographs being taken of suitable bombing targets behind the enemy's lines, some while bombing was actually in progress; also of important roads, railways, stations, dumps, camps and other points of military significance in the new country penetrated during the advance. Many of these photographs furnished especially valuable records. Our line was patrolled from dawn till dusk with the object of concealing our concentration from the gaze of enemy aircraft. By this stage, however, the enemy machines had ceased to be very inquisitive, and were only seen on rare occasions. These patrols were carried out conjointly by this Unit and No. 111 Squadron, R.A.F.</p>

<p>When returning from a reconnaissance on the 2nd Lieut. C.S. Paul, D.F.C. (pilot) and Lieut. W.J.A. Weir, D.F.C. (observer) paid a further visit to MUKHALID and attacked the cavalry camp there. They flew low over the horse lines, firing 750 rounds into them and causing a stampede.</p>
<p>A special trip to AZRAK was made on the 11th by Lieuts. G.C. Peters, D.F.C. (pilot) and Lieut, J.H. Traill, D.F.C. (observer). This was the Headquarters of Col. Lawrence's force at this stage, and the object of this mission was to equip him with a supply of carrier pigeons which had been already trained from our machines. This constituted Col. Lawrence's only form of communication with the rest of the Army.</p>
<p>Throughout the early part of the month the whole of the enemy strategical area was regularly reconnoitred, sometimes twice daily.</p>
