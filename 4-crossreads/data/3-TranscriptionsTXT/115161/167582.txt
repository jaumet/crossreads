 fellows who were remaining to look after the things left behind, until we should return and collect them on our having completed our &quot;engagements&quot; at the front. (Only some came back for their belongings, many weeks later.) We are handed another rug each, so that the saving of weight was really infinitesmal. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; On the 6th January &#39;17 we leave Buire and continue to go forward for a further eight miles to a proper military camp. The roar of the big guns is now quite distinct, and the&nbsp;sound of the smaller &quot;pieces&quot; can be plainly heard. I wonder if this noise continues all day and night. However I very soon cease to wonder.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; I watched the other fellows for a time and then &quot;followed suit&quot;. What was my disgust to find hundreds of vermin in my clothing, my skin was &quot;raw&quot; in places where I had scratched. These vermin were &quot;chats&quot; (a&nbsp;kind of lice), from which we suffered during the whole time we were in France and Belgium. They made our life a misery. No matter how often we &quot;chatted&quot;, some eggs or juvenile &quot;chats&quot; remained.
