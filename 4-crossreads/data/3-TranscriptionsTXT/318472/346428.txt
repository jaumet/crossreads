22 July 1918MondayLeft Avonmouth about early in the afternoon & ran to Barrydock where we waited for a few hours picked up two Q boats & the Marmora as Escort & left about 6.30 The weather is not at all pleasant & the sea fairly rough. The Marmora is an Orient Boat fitted as an auxillary Cruiser & appears to carry about 8 guns. Barrydock is a very important coaling station on the Welsh side of Bristol Channel & appears to be very busy just at present.
1918 July 23TuesdayWeather rather wet with heavy rain squals. Am under Captains orders on Bridge keeping look-out for Submarines. About 2.45 P.M. Marmora which was lying close in on our Port Bows - was torpedoed & sank in 65 min: Two Q boats that were escorting gave chase to the Submarine & dropped a lot of Depth charges but I think with one effect except to frighten Fritz away from us. Reported all hands saved but some must have killed by the explosion as it was very heavy. I was on watch at the time & saw it happen one of our Escort have left us with the crew & of the Marmora & one is still with us.
