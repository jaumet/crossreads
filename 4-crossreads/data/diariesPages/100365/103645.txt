There seems to be heavy firing over the Belgian Border, which is not far distant from us.Received a few more letters but am expecting more as I know they are tied up somewhere.Have just heard that the Allemandes have taken another fort near Verdun so expect they will finally get Verdun itself, but they have had to pay a terrible price for it.We all expect Verdun to fall in the course of a few days. I believe we move to either Arrass or Armentieres next week but nothing definite is known at present.Very heavy fighting is expected on our immediate front in the course of a few days. Cavalry Mounted Troops of every description are being brought up billetted in rear of the trenches, so they evidently expect a move of some kind.

Weather is very trying the condition of camp awful. It has not ceased raining for the last 12 hours it is not too pleasant to get wet have to stay in clothes, but this is one of the many hardships to be had.I have just heard from some French people that all French Schools Churches have been ordered to get ready for receiving wounded men
