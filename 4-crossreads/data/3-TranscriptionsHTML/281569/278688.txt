<p>17 June, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Up at same time as usual.</p>
<p>Nothing much to do today, in the morning only did a little wheatstone in the afternoon, a large sports meeting was held at the Canal Company's grounds &amp; was an entire success although a member of the British W Indies Regt got nearly all the races he was a real beaut &amp; had lovely action although none pushed him, in the evening a concert under the patronage of about 6 generals also took place, this also was fine especially the music, supplied by one of the Infantry bands, the Mysore lancers gave a couple of turns which were very well received considering.</p>
<p>Bed at midnight.</p>
<p>18 June, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Spent the day at Achis place &amp; had quite an enjoyable time, only got home rather late.</p>
<p>Russians are still doing exceptionally well &amp; are still advancing &amp; capturing a huge amount of booty.  Eleven of our planes went over to El Aish today &amp; bombed the camp when they arrived there one of their planes was just rising &amp; one of ours nose dived to about 200 ft above him, he then let two bombs go &amp; one blew the machine to atoms, he thereupon sailed round the camp at a height of 200 ft bombing the inmates, the while, the other machines had also been giving likewise attention &amp; soon the camp was afire in many places. Bed at 11.30</p>
