<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>I am far too upset and sick at heart to say much Mother dear, for I have just had a telegram from Tommy which tells me Alan died of wounds in France on August fourteenth. I can find no one who knew him intimately round about and so I have to just think of him and turn my sad thoughts over and over in my own mind. Everyone is very sympathetic and some of the returned boys have said some fine things which only those who have been through this hell can say. But we are far from anywhere here and the very locality and weather are cold and cheerless, and I admit I'm down.</p>
<p>Well Mother, as you know your son was not only my brother but my very best friend. I don't know of anyone who could ever say one word against him</p>
