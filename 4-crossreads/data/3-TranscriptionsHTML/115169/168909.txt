<p>July 24th Squadron exercises during forenoon, such as taking ship in tow etc etc, -night firing again after dark. During the day we had another fright for it was rumoured that H.M.S. Conqueror had blown up whilst at anchor at "Rosyth" by internal explosion, - happily this proved to be false, but it was a common occurrence for a rumour to gain currency of some awful calamity, especially of internal explosions.</p>
