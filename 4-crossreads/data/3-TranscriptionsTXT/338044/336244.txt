Lieut-Col McGlynn can accept me which I consider probable. Raining hard, in showers, all day. At last we find a nice little place for our midday meal (2 francs per day) in a small back in "Stewart's Choice" & pay for a week in advance. But in English fashion by an English lady, not too well off, but clean    & I enjoyed it. A walk round the town at 6 pm, Rue de la Republique etc    & return. Am beginning to know Rouen well. The Cathedral is a beautiful structure, ancient as the kings & my visit inside is not to be the last. This is a city of beautiful churches. Several others are just as big & beautiful as the Cathedral itself. The Jardin des Plantes, near our billet is a pretty garden & my favourite resort. Some fellows in the camp here say the guns at the front can be heard at night from the hill
