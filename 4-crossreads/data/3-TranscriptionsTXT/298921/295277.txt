 November, 1915  3 Nov.15  From my Dugout I can see the War ships manoeuvreing &amp; firing &ndash; aeroplanes both friendly &amp; German in the air with little puffs of smoke shewing the shrapnel bursting around &amp; the men below, digging or cooking taking everything as a matter of course &amp; quite happy &ndash; We wish you all a Merry Christmas &amp; hope to be with you all again ere another comes round. Cup day &ndash; We have a sweep by Nos not knowing the names of the horses.
