<p>Sent cable home &amp; rode on a donkey from Shepheards Hotel to the station in time to catch the 7.15 train for Ismailia. From Ismailia to Ferry Post about 100 of us were crammed into a big motor lorry &ndash; Some were up on top and many a time we thought there would be an accident with such a load on board. Slept in a Hospital tent at 15th Field Ambulance quarters.</p>
<p>12th May (Friday)<br/>Warm day. Waited till mid-day for Anzac Desert train. On arriving back in camp we learnt that the unit had received orders to move for Ferry Post tomorrow.</p>
