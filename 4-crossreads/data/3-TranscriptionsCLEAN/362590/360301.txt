2.Those instructions have not come yet but I am expecting them this week. The course here ends on the 5th Feb & if I do not hear by about the end of the month I shall write. If it is necessary I shall not mind going to my battalion (which is at Cleethorpes on the East Coast just S. of Grimsby) for a while, but I do not think I would be capable or desirous of continuing with the infantry work. I am however hopeful of being given a chance in the Flying Corps when I want it. In my next letter I should have some real flying news.
I am glad to hear that you have again got into touch with Arthur. The postal system between England & the A.I.F. is very unsatisfactory. I have written to Arthur & Caesar & several others but have heard nothing yet from them even after an interval of a couple of months. I cannot tell whether they have received my letters yet.
The weather lately has improved very much & the days are quite appreciably longer. We have been spending practically every day out in the field reconnoitring & carrying out schemes of attach, defence, trench fighting etc. it is certainly a very healthy life & I am feeling generally better for it. Tomorrow night we go out on a night march by compass: it should be interesting.
Tonight, as usual, we have a lecture at 8.30 & I am taking advantage of the interval between 6.30 dinner & that to get some writing done for the mail on Friday.
Will stop now & hope to have more interesting material for the next letter.
With kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy & yourself
Yours very sincerely
L. Whitfeld
