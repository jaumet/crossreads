Men who bear and endure and hope, not through days only or months or years, but through a whole life.</p>
<p>Men who are greater than all men because they are poets.  Whether they have sung or whether they have written or not, counts not a little.</p>
<p>Such men are poets, and youth remains with them, for they are linked with a God.  Not the God of a custom or age, Not your God. But their God whom you can never know, whom your words could not define the knowing of whom your faith would crumble at, your heart pale of blood, and your mind strain aghast.</p>
<p>Men of strange lasting reason which cannot be assailed by the worm of doubt.</p>
