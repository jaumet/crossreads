<p>Ward. Ward crowded. A very good show. The officers of the unit came in for the skits.</p>

<p>It breaks one up very much to realize after all the care and endeavor to save the wounded man, he dies. However as the French people say "C'est la guerre".</p>
<p>Rumour very persistent that we are going to leave here.</p>
<p>March 8th. Thurs.<br/>Attempted transfusion of blood.</p>
<p>Told to keep two operating theatres in readiness.</p>
<p>Col Shaw is using a paste called B.I.P. This to my mind is causing more injury that anything else.</p>

<p>The R.C. padre whom we have with us at the present time is said to have been mentioned in dispatches.
