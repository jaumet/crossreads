<p>To father and mother, without whose love and care my life would be a fading dream &amp; not a casket of rich, inspiring experiences, I send these outlines of my work beyond the seas, hoping that they will help to keep us closer together in spirit, if not in the flesh. From your loving Son John.</p>
