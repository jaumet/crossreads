<p>1916</p>
<p>January</p>
<p>1:  Busy day, preparing to move to-morrow for Egypt.  Glad to get away.</p>
<p>2:  Left Lemnos at 10 a.m., boarding "The Empress of Britain" &ndash; 4000 on board. Good quarters &amp; food for all. Stayed in harbour all night.</p>
<p>3:  Steamed out at 9 a.m.  Word that Persic had been sunk that day.</p>
<p>6:  Reached Alexandria 4 p.m. after a good trip.  Baggage guard on wharf.</p>
<p>7:  Left at 3 a.m. in cattle trucks with baggage; officers in first class cars &amp; a dining car.  Reached Tel el Kebir at noon.  100,000 under canvas here. This is where the battle between the British &amp; Dervishes took place on Sept. 13; 1882.  Many British men &amp; officers are buried here in the cemetery specially erected by the British.</p>
<p>9:  Rations very poor, dry bread, date &amp; tea which get monotonous.  Went to the old trenches used in the action of 1882 &amp; the boys unearthed a few ancient coins &amp; other interesting souvenirs.</p>
