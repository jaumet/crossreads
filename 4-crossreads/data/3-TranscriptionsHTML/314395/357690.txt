<p>My first visit was to the "Arc de Triomphe" where at the conclusion of the 1870 war, the Huns marched through with fixed bayonets, while the French soldiers formed a guard of honour disarmed.  French soldiers also were compelled to make hay by the roadside as the victorious beasts marched through the arch.  We will wipe out that humiliation before we are finished, Please God.</p>
<p>The "Champs-Elysees: is also nearby and a really beautiful place.  Fine long wide avenues lined with statues.  The trees were all covered with snow when I was there and looked very picturesque.</p>
<p>Eiffel Tower was very interesting, but unfortunately, one could only view it from the ground, as it is now used as a military wireless station.  It is guarded by many sentries, and I believe that there are also anti-aircraft guns on the top.  The structure is a marvellous feat of engineering, and is I believe the highest tower in the world.</p>
<p>The "Hotel des Invalides" was well worth a visit.  Many war trophies were on view including guns of all calibres, captured</p>
