Saturday 31st 1918
We ceased to be the M.D.S. at 10 A.M. the 8th having moved forward & opened up near Cappy, the A.D.S. has also moved to the left, our division taking over from the 2nd Division thus bringing us to the Somme again. During the day I forwarded by motor lorry all my drugs & dressings to the new M.D.S. it was a full load. Loaded our waggons during the day ready to move off again. Matters still going well with the advance & a party of over 700 prisoners passed about 5.30. Latest reports are 120,000 prisoners & 2000 guns. Towards dusk, hundreds of our aeroplanes going home fly low over our heads & many do hair raising feats such as looping & flying corkscrew fashion, diving etc. Hun bombing planes over last night but no bombs close.
Sunday 1st September
Had a day of rest awaiting orders which I filled by writing, doing up a parcel for home & going for a stroll after tea. Also had an interesting time watching planes which were using the field
