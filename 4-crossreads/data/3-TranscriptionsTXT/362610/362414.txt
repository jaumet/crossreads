 Monday 17 July 1916 A grey morning giving place to a showery afternoon. Running round in the morning looking after bombers, &amp; trying to see about gas work, &amp; then started out on a route march over very slushy roads for a short distance, having to turn back &amp; form up on a battalion parade at which court-martial verdicts were announced. Had a hurried lunch &amp; then had to take a party to divisional baths some distance away where the men were able to have a cold bath : unfortunately they were not able to get a change of clothing. A shower as we marched home wet a men a bit. After tea attended a lecture at Bn. H.Q. Awakened abt. midnight by messenger with word to have things packed up &amp; ready to move at 6 a.m.
