 Tuesday 15 August 1916 Showery throughout the day. After breakfast we moved off to Albert, following a somewhat different route to that taken the first time. Roads wet &amp; slippery &amp; going heavy. Billetted in a deserted place in a fairly bad state of repair, but managed all right to be comfortable. Late lunch &amp; then spent the afternoon trotting round.
