<p>No charger prances or [indecipherable] glances<br/>Or Pennants wave before them<br/>They creep and crawl with slow advance<br/>With ooze and sluice all o'er them<br/>The days are done of battles won<br/>By cavaliers bold riding<br/>Today we aim to beat the hun<br/>By artfulness in hiding</p>
<p>But deeds as bold as e'er of old<br/>Are done on fields more bloody<br/>And times recording page may hold<br/>This knights all stained and Muddy<br/>Who Volunteer and Valiant stand</p>
