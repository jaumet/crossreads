<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Met Lambert McKenzie in a shop there.&nbsp; Glad to see him. He explained that, on account of red tape, or a disinclination so to do, he was unable to dine with me.&nbsp; I took it as an affront on his part and had no desire to eat with him at all.&nbsp; Felt rather disgusted at his behavior.&nbsp; Had tea in a swell cafe and caught train back to Corbie, arriving there 9.30.&nbsp; Herb was not too well after the bad headache attack that came on him while in Amiens.</td>
