<p>to load up waggons with stores.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the evening we finished the loading up of the remaining trucks.</p>
<p>We were then divided up into numbers of fifteen to a truck. In these trucks we were to travel all night to reach Alexandria.</p>
<p>The night was bitterly cold inspite of the fact that daytime had been extremely hot. The trucks were open and between the cold air, the jerking of the waggon and the clink, clank, of the chains these were not conducive "to much" sleep.</p>
<p>At various stops we <strike>make</strike> heard the cry of natives, shouting "Oranges", "Eggs are Cooked" "Chocolate" aroused the appetite of some of the troops and there was a good deal of hurtling to get their purchase before the train moved off again.</p>
<p>This being in the middle of the night one began to wonder if the natives ever sleep.</p>
<p>March 29th. Wed.<br/>Our train steamed right on to the Wharf at Alexandria.</p>
<p>Money changers were busy exchanging the troops money into English money. These money changers must have made a good thing out of it, as they got two and a half piastres on every &pound; exchanged.</p>
<p>We disentrained and embarked on to the Corsican.</p>
<p>Lying by the side of the "Corsican" was the larger ship "Transylvania" which was also being loaded up with troops. We were fortunate in getting cabins to sleep in. One advantage of being in the A.M.C. this time.</p>
<p>Each man is issued with a Life Belt. This he must wear continually.</p>
