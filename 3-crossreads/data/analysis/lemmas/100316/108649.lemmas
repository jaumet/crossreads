 9/5/18 Querrieu A love sunni day . No work do as all prepar had to be made for go up the line . Pack and blanket had to be dump and soon everi hat had been exchang for the steel helmet . The place is full of chang troop ? a mixtur of unit of all kind . Motor transport ? tractor , lorri , gun pass and re-pass along the road . I went down to the Chateau and saw the Gener . They had arrang for an aeroplan to come over and pick up their ground signal done with a signal sheet . After lunch had a confer of a few offic on the write of Operat Order . Went round the billet and inspect them . It was a hot afternoon and the men felt the heat as they move off laden with 220 round SAA 2 bomb in addit the to their other gear . The platoon were at 100 yard interv and Matthew took charg at the head of the column . I pass up the column after we pass through Pont Noyell and did a canter across countri . Just as the column was about to enter La Houssoy the enemi put over about 10 shell and kill and wound a few peopl there . Our column made a detour struck off overland toward Heilli . The black burst of crump of shrapnel was plain to be seen from there . Rode up to Franvil and had a look round our billet . Some American here
