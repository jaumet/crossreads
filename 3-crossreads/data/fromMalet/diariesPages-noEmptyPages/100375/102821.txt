getting a very rough time when he does come over. Our search lights, of which there are fourteen, search the starry heavens from all angles with there rays when Fritz's planes come over. When they manage to pick him up then there is a terrific noise of A. A. Craft Guns sending shells after shells into his direction until things become too hot, or he drops his bombs, then goes for his life back to his lines again.
We had half a dozen Germen prisoners brought in and all of them necessitated limbs to be taken off. We are often told that the Germens are hard up for food but if the prisoners which we see are supposed to be specimens of the starving Germens there is not much starvation about them. They are big, healthy, powerful looking men.
Went to St Omer with F.B. C.H. Mac, W.I. and got our photos taken
We have at present three teams with us. One of the teams which has newly arrived is a travelling O.T. on its own. Lt. Col Fiaschi is the Surgeon. He has a team of four L.Cpl and an Anesthitist. They all work well to-gether and Fiaschi is a good surgeon and turns out some splendid work.
