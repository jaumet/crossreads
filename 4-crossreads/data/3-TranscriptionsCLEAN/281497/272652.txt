The boys are all wondering what is the matter for I have been sent for 2 or 3 times to Hqrs to day, & several signallers have been round to me with message's I do hope it gets through This morning we had physical exercise & a short parade after it, & then finish for the day. It is very hot this afternoon & there is not a breeze blowing a leaf about
This afternoon I had charge of a fatigue party down at Headquarters I had to check all the wounded packs & see that they were correct a pretty tiresome job to have anything to do with at all, for you have to be so careful about them & see that no mistakes creep in.
