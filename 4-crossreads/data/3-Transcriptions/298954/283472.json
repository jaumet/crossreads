<p>1917<br/>3rd June.<br/>Yesterday's events seemed unreal &ndash; dreams &ndash; on awakening this morning.  But the brown hammocks swinging in rows quite brought back the reality of things.</p>
<p>"Breakfast" was at 8.</p>
<p>On the tables (bare, of course) were a couple of dishes of bread &ndash; vile-smelling blackish dough which resembled nothing so much as well-chewed "Spearmint."   Black, sugarless coffee came along also &ndash; was very good.</p>
<p>We mess in the partitioned off "Officers Quarters".  Dinner (at 11.30 am) was considered "special", being Sunday.  Consisted of soup, a small piece of Hamburger steak &amp; large quantities of dried potatoes.</p>
<p>The method of serving is rather funny.  A steward carries along a couple of tins to the galley for each table; he returns the tins to the head of each table and serves out the contents to the expectant "diners".</p>
