<p>Monday June 12. 1916.<br/>A nice morning, in fact it is the finest day since we have been afloat, but it became cloudy in the evening. The wind has changed to E.S.E. and the ship does not roll so much. This morning the Pioneers started to learn Semaphore signalling, and had some physical drill. In the evening we were practising for the Sports which are to come off next Wednesday.</p>
