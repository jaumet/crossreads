[indecipherable] today Letter from Laura & Charlie all seemed well-Posted you some verses written by a Bushie now in the Pay office, being wounded too badly for further Trench work- It is the high qualities of the Rank & file which keep our Regiments going & I always feel how extra good the officers should be to lead such men-Anticipated being away ere this but here we are still as no water available at our outpost at present.Climate is lovely here, now warm days & cold nights.
