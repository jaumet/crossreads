Tuesday April 10tharrived at Camp 3pm after tiring journey. Most of us I think has a touch of the BluesWednesday April 11thS major had a brain wave [indecipherable] while we were away. New orders all tents to be down before first parade. What a scramble to get on parade ground in time. Sgt B. (the lusty youth) entertained us this morning. He closed his eyes, yelled shun and fell over a wire. He rose asking us sarcastically was there anything funny, some wag said you and we thought he would go mad. Half an hour extra [indecipherable] physical jerks. Sgt not a bad old sort troubled with bad temper.
