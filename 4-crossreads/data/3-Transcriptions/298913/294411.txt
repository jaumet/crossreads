<p>Detailed account of the <u>Battle of Romani</u></p>
<p>The aeroplane reconnaisaisance (Turkish) had reported that Romani was only occupied by a few troops and that the hundreds of tents were only dummies. This appeared so to the Aeroplane observers because all troops were ordered into tents as soon as a hostile plane appeared. Thus the Turks set out to take Romani, and which they stated in orders captured by us would fall in four hours. It was a disastrous mistake on their part.</p>
<p>The main railway to Romani took out troops and our planes kept a good watch on the Turkish movements. They (Turks) then set out from El Arish</p>
