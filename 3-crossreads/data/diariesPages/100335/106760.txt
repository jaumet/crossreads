Tuesday Aug 12th 1919.
On handing in the Paper, I then was given an order for my Railway Holiday Pay, one day for each Month I was on Active Service which amounted to 32 day's, also my Railway Watch which I handed in when I enlisted, then I proceeded to Perth and received my cheque also a Free Pass for myself, Wife and Family from Aug 12th to September 17th 1919, And made arrangements to resume Duty make on Sept 1st instead of Sept 18th 1919.
On Sept 10th 1919, I cease to be a Soldier of the Australian Imperial Force's after serving for 2 Year's and 345 day's. And I honestly confess it has been the best 2 year's and 345 days of my Life and I have no regret's over inlisting, and putting the Bad times against the Good Times, the latter by a long way outweigh's the former, I honestly Thank God for giving me strength to be in carrying out my Duties and sparing me to return to my Dear One's once again, also I have enjoyed the best of health and had a splendid Education and a Grand Trip and a very pleasant one whilst I was a Soldier in the Australian Imperial Force's
Working on the Railway's of France and Belgium as a Locomotive Engine Driver
Doing my Bit for the Cause of Civilisation Freedom.
So at last I have finished my Diary of my Life as a Soldier and I trust it will be as great a pleasure to whoever Reads it in the day's to come, as it has been to me to write it.
