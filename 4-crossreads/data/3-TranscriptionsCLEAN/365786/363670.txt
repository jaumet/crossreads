I arrived at Pt. Said in Egypt on May 10th this year 1915 - as we drew near to the African coast the blue waters of the Mediterranean changed first to a greeny colour & then to a muddy yellow - the influence of the deposits brought down by the Nile being visible for many several miles out at the sea & soon we saw the huge light house, 174 feet high, & the big breakwaters with the statue of De Lesseps on the western one.  It seems fitting that the statue of the man to whose energy & skill we owe the Suez Canal should thus watch over the northern entrance to this valuable waterway.  At Pt. Said In a fine hotel facing the sea we stayed the night in a fine hotel facing the sea, leaving by train for Cairo the following day.  It was a most interesting run.  The line runs parallel to the Canal as far
