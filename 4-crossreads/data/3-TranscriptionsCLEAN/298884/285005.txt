  
 The "Nurse" who is on our Coy. for once did not expect trouble,  but  & before  we  he knew where he was, he was seized by five pairs of powerful hands and held whilst a couple of others dressed him up in a nurse's costume & blackened his face. A notice "Native Ayah" was then pinned to his blouse & he was carried around the boat deck to the delight of hosts of diggers & the remainder of the officers. 
 It was a most humiliating affair but it was well merited.
