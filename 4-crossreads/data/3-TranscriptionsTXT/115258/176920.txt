My dear Mother
i wrote to you yesterday and the day before, but as I start for the Regt again tomorrow I am goiing to write again today. When i went to the dentist yesterday afternoon he found that the root of the pivot tooth, which I thought was sound, had split in half - so he had to pull it out and He has plastered up the other pivot tooth which had the ivory broken off it and when my gum heals he is going to put a bridge across the front of my mouth; so now I'm off back to the regt and will have to come down again in about two months time. The work will take about 10 days to do, and will be charged to my pay book (they only charge for actual gold supplied)
