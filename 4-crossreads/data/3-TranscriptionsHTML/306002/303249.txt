<p>16.8.15<br/>Mon. 16th.  Very heavy bombardment took place at Achi-Baba from 3 oclock to 3.30 this morning.  A fair amount of artillery work on both sides, a number of Lenster [Leinster?] Fusiliers were brought from the left flank &amp; are to be put in the trenches here.  It is said they failed to hold some springs the Aus. &amp; New Zealand troops took, they turned when they saw the Turks counter-attacking in large numbers, the Aus. &amp; New Zealands had to retake the springs later in the day.</p>
<p>17.8.15<br/>Tue. 17th.  Mills has got a job interpreting with the Indians as he understands their lingo, the 1st Light Horse appears to be practically a thing of the past;  30 men were told off &amp; sent around to the left flank as snipers yesterday &amp; to-day, 15 more was sent off to various positions for the same purpose, the remainder of the Regt. go to Popes Hill every night as support, half the Regt. one night &amp; the other half the next.</p>
