<p>29.9.15<br/>Wed 29th<br/>Yesterday afternoon one of the war-boats gave the ground between Popes Hill &amp; the Turks trenches particular fits, apparently blowing up 3 lines of barbed wire entanglements that the 17th Btn was too slow to stop the Turks from pulling out; It is reported that the heavy bombardment on the left last Monday night was followed by an attack by Gurkhas who took quite a number of prisoners (300) &amp;&amp; took the position with very little resistence. Last night an attack was made on Courtenays in which bombs played a prominent part, the fight lasted for 15 or 20 minutes; The Turks got more than the bargained for &amp; had to retire, I have not heard casualties; Sometime last night 60 reinforcements arrived for this Regt. several lads previously wounded being among them, the returned wounded says Egypt is much worse than here to live in, was inoculated today for Cholera.</p>
