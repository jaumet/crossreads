<p>Train into the yard at Lillers to allow two important Troop Trains to pass.   After I had another Hot Dinner I went into the Sergeants Mess at 6.30 where the Depot Concert Party gave us a treat.   The place was full of N.C.O.'s &amp; the individual members of the Party gave us several good turns all of which were well appreciated.   There were several Professional Artist amongst them, the Concert terminated at 9.30 with 3 cheers for the Party &amp; all hands retired for the night.</p>
<p>Sunday 10th.   I had another enjoyable ride on the Eng in lovely weather to Bethune arriving there on time, where I left my chums, as they wished to have a look at the Locomotive sheds &amp; I intended to have a look at the Cemetery past the Canal I made my way up into the Square &amp; inquired the way &amp; soon arrived at the Canal, where several Steam Tugs were lying alongside the Wharf.  It is very pretty along this Canal the grass being nice &amp; green on the sloping back in between the Wharfs.  Having crossed the Canal, I came to the entrance to the Cemetery which is surrounded by a high brick wall &amp; there are two large Iron Gates which were opened &amp; in I walked along the road.   There are Pine Trees on each side growing which add to the beauty &amp; the Marble Tombs, &amp; Head Stones &amp; Glass Houses glittered in the Sun</p>
