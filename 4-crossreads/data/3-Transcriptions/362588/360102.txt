<p>We have all been working very hard here indeed, and the Troops are exceeding all anticipations.  You can imagine how upset everyone is by the extraordinary stories that are circulating throughout Australia about the conduct of the Division.  The <u>real</u> facts are as follows.  For a short time after we landed, the men were naturally attracted by the novelties of Cairo.  With 20,000 men it can be easily seen that some would play up for a bit while their money lasted.  Think of a Country where there is no control of liquor traffic &amp; where in the native Quarter brothels are as numerous or more so than public Houses in certain Country Towns, &amp; you get the explanation at once.  Seriously, I wonder that there was not more looseness than actually existed.  Bean wrote his letter to the Australian papers with the very best of intentions &ndash; to prevent the people from being deceived by the like of those returned as unfit to serve.  Unfortunately, some persons have tried to read between the lines of his letter &ndash; always a dangerous thing to do - &amp; have cruelly imagined that</p>
