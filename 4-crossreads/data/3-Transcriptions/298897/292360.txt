<p>a private I was often imposed upon.  I made a resolve then that if I ever had the chance, I would come down on such blighters.</p>
<p>Sunday 3rd Sept<br/>Church parade and distribution of ribbons won in the last stunt.  It was carried out at the bomb school and all units of the division were represented.  General Plumer was the head serang and we also had General McKay &amp; Godley besides innumerable lesser lights.  After the service the names were called out &amp; each one marched in front of the General saluted &amp; stood while General McKay read out the account of his action.  Then the General pinned the ribbon on, &amp; shook hands, the next advancing &amp; taking his pace.  Some of the deeds done were wonderful &amp; almost unbelieveable whilst others were quite simple a D.C.M. being given to one chap for simply working well at a Dressing station.  Still on the whole they were all well earned.  It was an impressive ceremony, carried out with heavy shells screaming by &amp; to the noise of a heavy bombardment &amp; aeroplanes passing overhead a raiding party of about 30 passing at the time all a proper setting for the event.  In the afternoon two of us rode to "Armentieres" &amp; were well repayed for it.  The place had been bombarded</p>
