<p>was marched to the Railway Station at Rouen with a batch of other fit men, for the purpose of travelling back to the base camp, which was at Etaples. After waiting at the Railway Station for nearly four hours, we were entrained in iron covered trucks which would have been very cold had we not had coal fires upon the centres of the floors. With the coal fires burning and the doors kept closed as much as possible to keep the cold out, we arrived at Etaples with our clothes and faces black with coal dust.</p>

The products were mainly vegetables and flowers.</p>
<p>We arrived in Albert and spent a very cold night in the camp there, as there were icicles hanging in the inside of the tents next morning. From Albert we marched to Ribemont, where we received a mail from our respective quartermasters of our own different companies. I had two mates who were        in my company ("D" Coy) with me, when we were detailed to go on a fatigue party to a village maned Contay. This village was about 12 miles from Ribemont, the village we were in, and we had to march the distance on foot. We had no idea of the nature of the work we were going to, or how long</p>
