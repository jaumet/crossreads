<p>Friday 1st <strike>Aug</strike> Sept 1916<br/>Dad arrived on Friday last to my great pleasure, &amp; after we had had a good yarn, &amp; he had made himself friendly with the W.O. Maxwell (temp while Pollard was away) he managed to get me leave till the Monday night<br/>All my hopes since enlisting were thus satisfied, &amp; in just the way I had hoped.<br/>Lily has grown a nice young lady now, &amp; it was a delight to see her again after my long absence.  She was tremendously excited but not more than I.</p>
