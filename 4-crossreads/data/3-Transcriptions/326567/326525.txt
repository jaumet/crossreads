<p>in this district, every day more are coming up from other Parts. <strike>Last</strike> <br/>Sunday 29th<br/>Last night we had our usual visit from Fritz also heard several Bombs dropped, I did not hear of any casualties. he only came over once &amp; with the exception of the Guns booming things generally were quiet all night. Several Amunition Teams came into our Camp this morning &amp; took up some vacant ground near by, they are from Bullecourt in France. One Lad told me this morning at 3 am  they had to gallop through Fritz's Fire &amp; a shell caught one team &amp; killed the Horses &amp; Drivers &amp; exploded the Amunition which blew up the Wagon. I admire these Men they have a perilious job to perform, they have to go every evening up to their Batteries with Amunition &amp; stores under continual shell Fire. Sometimes the Road is blown up &amp; they have to go around the holes &amp; through the Bush, they have to get there hook or by crook, &amp; continually</p>
