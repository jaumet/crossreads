  
 22 February, 1916 Maadi The squadron of the 12th Reg left here this morning  The regiment which was Split up into reinforcements when it went to Gallipoli is now going to reform  Their officers looked very swanky this morning clobbered up & with the black plumes in their hats   It looks right for us to leave on Thursday we are all getting fixed up for departure  They paid this afternoon so a number of the boys went into Cairo to have Their last fling before going away.  I took the precaution of making up my bed outside as some of them are sure to come back well tanked up.  Two up, Cards, & Crown & Anchor are being well patronised on every hand, It is marvellous the difference in the Mess room for a while after pay day.  This last week it has been so crowded that one could hardly ever get a seat nor always get quite enough to eat, but to night the mess room was not half full & there was scram to burn
