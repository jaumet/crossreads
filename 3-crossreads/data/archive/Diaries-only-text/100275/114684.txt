quite black with the grit etc. We went for a stroll round the beach this morning picked up a couple of dogs we then struck out across the heath went hunting for rabbits the dogs put a few up we had a bit of fun, we then went down to the beach the tide was just coming in, it travels across the open sand very fast, we watched it come in breaker after breaker, we then stripped off had a fine bit of fun in the surf with a big piece of pine that we found lying on the beach we used it to shoot the breakers
