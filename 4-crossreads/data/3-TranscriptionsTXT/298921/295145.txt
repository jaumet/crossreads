 June, 1915 Wednesday 23 Note from Laura letter that Dr Gault said Joe has a Cataract in his eye, he did not tell me that &amp; I hope he is not hiding anything &ndash; as he is the mainstay &amp; is of far greater consequence then if anything does happen to me. I hope W &amp; A have paid their interest regularly &ndash; by the way I  never  got any wash basin from Sydney people only an Air cushion which is most useful. Love to you all Mother dear &amp; don't worry.
