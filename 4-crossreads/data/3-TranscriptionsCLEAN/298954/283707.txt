A string of mixed Army Transport wagons, Red Cross ditto and 5-seaters were waiting to take the crowd to the camp.
The Boy and I got one of the latter ([indecipherable]) after a struggle and pulled up in about 15 minutes outside a wooden hut and on overworked army captain.   The Capt. took one look at the Boys gleaming resplendency and ordered us to the Officer's quarters.
A uniform does carry weight in England;  even the once despised Merchant Service now draws nearly as much water as the "Naivy".   We were quartered by ourselves in the usual barrack and waddled out to dinner at 7.30 pm at the officer's mess-room, which was gaily decorated with palms, bunting, and well-chosen, ornamental, W.A.A.C. waitresses.   The tables were brilliant with silver, palms and glass.   The entire room was prepared for diners, but the only ones there were Ted, a medical Major, a Secret Service lieut. who arrived with us, and Jackson - our lieut. host.
