 Thursday 16 November 1916 Col. Fuller left at 11 a.m. for Duedar where a football match was played between the 6th &amp; 5th. I left for Pt. Said by 11-30 a.m. Train buying Canteen Goods etc. returning to Hill 70 at 9 p.m. The 6th Reg. again beat the 5th after an exiting game.

 Friday 17 November 1916 I left at 6-30 a.m. for Kantara meeting Waggons at Station.  Conveyed Canteen Good out to Hill 70. Col. Fuller in Camp all day. Major Cross returned to-night from Pt. Said &amp; Cairo. 
 Saturday 18 November 1916 Col. Fuller at Brigade. Tents struck &amp; lines cleaned as usual. Match between Battle Squadron &amp; 6th this afternoon.  A drawn game. Word through that N.Z. are in touch with Enemy outside of Mazzaar.  We are on the verge of another scrap with the Enemy.  Something will soon have to be done as the line is getting too near Al Arish to be safe.  We will in all probability have to do the attacking &amp; clear the Turks further back.  The Military are determined to push the Railway through, &amp; to that end, are drawing up large supplies &amp; building Resoivours holding many thousands of Gallons of surplus water for the Troops.  We don't expect much until Chavel returns from England.  There is to be a Higher command shortly, &amp; an officer directing from France is appointed to take charge.  It will be known as the desert column.
