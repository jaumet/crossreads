 [Letter written on paper with Church of England Soldiers' Institute  letterhead] 27 August 1916 
 My Dear Mother 
 Am seizing a fleeting opportunity of writing &ndash; for cash!!!  Could not go to Melbourne as am on the beastly guard, but expect to get next week end. Things are "crook" here in dead earnest &ndash; raining in oceans &amp; every  corner is flooded to the point of drowning. All of our crowd are stony &amp; destitute  with  through buying tucker at  1/6 per meal &amp; it seems impossible to save a penny as things are. Please send &pound;1 by wire. It will only cost about 1/6. Wire it to Seymour Camp Depot Post Office Victoria. 
 I have your last letter &amp; am not surprised to hear about Chas. Poor old chap, I hope he's not having a rough time of it. Will write, when I come off this job, a less hurried letter, but must catch this mail if I want to see Melbourne. 
 Much love to all Harry
