19/1/18 York EdinburghAfter breakfast to the Minster but could not look round owing to a service being in progress. A crowd of surpliced people &ndash; clerics and choir but no congregation. Down to quaint old streets for a look round, noticing several queues of poor people. Today was evidently market day, booths being down the centre of the streets with wares for sale. Noticed a youth with an epileptic attack &ndash; nearly run over. A dull chilly wet day large blocks of ice coming down the Ouse. Had lunch at the hotel and then caught the Scotch express for Edinburgh having a quick journey. Arrived at Edinburgh at 7.30 pm and was met by Colonel Craig. We dined at the Station Hotel and then walked through icy streets to Abercromby place where we drank whisky and yarned till all hours.
