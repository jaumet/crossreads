<p>just pulled three teams up &amp; was coming back for our own gun (you see we used to help one another up, in any very bad places) when one of the ammunition waggons in front of our gun was stuck, could not get a move out of the team, the leaders would not try, so of course none of the others would, so our O.C. says, it is no use Giffin, you will have to hook your two leaders on. after about two pulls away we went as easy as you like, you see my two would pull all day. I have never had them refuse yet especially old Dick the one I ride,</p>
