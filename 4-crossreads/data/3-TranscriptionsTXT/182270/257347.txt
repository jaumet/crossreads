 TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1919. 
 Fine, &amp; foggy. Went up to the Bank 
 in the morning and to a 
 matinee of The Maid of the Mountains 
 in the afternoon. Went to bed 
 early. Alan came down &amp; 
 is staying with me. He has 
 got his gdischarge all right. I 
 gave him my two tickets 
 for &quot;Oh Joy&quot; &amp; he took Marj. 
 Lang &amp; enjoyed it very 
 much.
