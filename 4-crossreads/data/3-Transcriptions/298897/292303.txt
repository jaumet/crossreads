An appearance of lifelessness was to be seen everywhere just sufficient being done to keep things going.  Women were employed on the wharves with the men doing most of the light work.  My first impression of Marseilles is that tis' not so large a place or important as I imagined it was the harbour being especially disappointing.</p>
