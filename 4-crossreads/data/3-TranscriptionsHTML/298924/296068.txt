<p>Thursday 27 March 1919<br/>At sea<br/>Got a rotten cold &amp; still very hot &ndash; most of the men behaved themselves, tonight someone threw an onion at some Senior Officers playing cards &amp; one generally gets bombarded on the troop deck.  Anzac heroes!!!  When the National Anthem is played only a very few take any notice of it.</p>
