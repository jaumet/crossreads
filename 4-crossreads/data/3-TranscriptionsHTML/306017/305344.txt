Tea was ready for us, but I was sick again.  However I persevered &amp; forced myself to eat &amp; felt much better  At 4 am next morning was up again feeling fairly fit.  We sent 28 men back to hospital &amp; there many more sick in camp.  The NZealanders had many more cases than we had.</p>
<p>I don't think anybody even from the hottest parts of Australia had ever gone through such a rough spin  Had we followed the Turks for another hour we would have been done &amp; it would have proved a calamity.

<p>18th [May]<br/>Today was much cooler.  We takes the horses into the shade of the palms, each man taking a feed for himself &amp; horse</p>
