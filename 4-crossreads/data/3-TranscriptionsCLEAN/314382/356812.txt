  
 old batch of poor sailors aboard, sick again. 
 A Concert was held on the main deck at 7 pm which passed off splendidly.

 November 25th: - Boat covered 340 miles to-day which is a fine run for her. Slept on deck after an uneventful day. 
 November 26th: - An absolutely perfect day. Sighted Rottnest Island at 4 pm and at 7 pm anchored in Fremantle Harbour, the evening being truly glorious. 
 At 9 pm a steamer conveying a party of representative Fremantle citizens came aboard & entertained us with a concert & refreshments. 
 We were all highly delighted to be back in dear old Australia & our boys had high jinks at bedtime, retiring at midnight & not before. 
 November 27th: - Another glorious day. 
 At 10 am the Western Australian lads numbering about 30 were taken off and were cheered vociferously upon leaving. 
 At 10-30 am a party of W.A. ladies came aboard and again entertained the patients to a concert & refreshments and a first rate spread was given them. 
 Left at 4 pm & on steaming out passed the "Ourah" with whose passengers we exchanged greetings. 
 Slept on deck, night cool & windy.
