No food served in this detestable hole for weeks.

Tuesday 11th Jan. 1916

In Cairo again, with usual result.

Wednesday 12th Jan 1916

Volunteers called for Special Guard & decided to go.

Arrived at Fraz (15 of us in all Sgt & 2 Cpls) about three miles out of Cairo at about 2 pm Huge railway siding containing immense coal stacks & oil stores.

Am not feeling too well, but appreciate the chance of getting away from Gizeh. Difficulties with rations owing to their not having been forwarded. Men hungry & cold. Also blankets have failed to turn up. Corporal of night picket on oil shed. Very cold, but Soudanese watchmen, quaint fellows, help us with a big coal fire which we sit round
