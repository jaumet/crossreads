Monday 11 Sept. 1916Up early to attend a Gas Conference. A horse was sent in to Ypres whence I rode out to the Div. Gas School. After the conference borrowed a bike & rode along to see Leo for a few minutes. He was busy fiddling with a primus stove, - well & happy. He made me a lovely cup of tea. Rode back to Ypres in the early afternoon, not bothering about lunch. A light shower of rain in the afternoon, otherwise a dull day.
