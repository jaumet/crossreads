  
 I wrote very few letters for Xmas, my friends in Vic. will think I've forgotten them but I really am not in the humor. Perhaps the spirit will move me soon. Hope to be able to keep fit & stick-it. Know perfectly well I should hate not to be here, yet at times I'm very, very homesick. Hope to write more cheerful letter next time.  I did not get up for Holy Com. this morning, and was too busy to go to Church Parade. Did I tell you in my last letter that J - has been transfered into another Batt. Have not had any more news since. Hope he is safe & well.
