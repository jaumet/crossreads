<p>There are one or two things I wish to tell mother which escaped my memory yesterday, so you will not mind me adding them here. I sent &pound;2 home by Alan. One is a return to her for &pound;1 borrowed the day before I left, and the other I wish her to keep till the allotment arrives when she is to take the first 22/- and together with the &pound;1 send it (2 guineas) to the following gentleman.</p>
<p>A.B. Walkom B Sc.<br/>Hon Sec.<br/>Royal Soc. Queensland<br/>Brisbane.</p>
<p>Send a short note which you or Alan should write saying it is D.B. Fry's Entrance fee &amp; one year's subscription to the society. Also, the money left in the allotment should go to Hazel &amp; some to Dorothy when she is stiff, but of course as Hazel does not earn money outside I would like her to say how it is to be portioned out. Mother will best decide</p>
