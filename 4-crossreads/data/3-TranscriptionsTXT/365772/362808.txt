 What Price Conscription Hospital 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nov 16 My dearest Sister, Just a note to wish you Ralph &amp; Beres a Merry Xmas &amp; a Happy New Year. I hope we are all together for the next one - did I thank you &amp; the Mater for cabling on my birthday. I am getting a board tomorrow so will start on my furlough next week - so by the time you get this I will be back with the Bn. &amp; hope my past good luck continues &amp; I pull through. Owen called here to see me, he looks very fit &amp; gave me all the Sydney news. Well my dear Sister wishing you the best of health etc. for the coming year, your loving frere Ken
