&spend the day walking round & talking. One learns to appreciate beautiful English country on days like these. Grand concert in theatre until 9 pm.
Nov 10th - Friday
Feeling very tired & not fit for much exertion. Very monotonous & I am already sick & tired of hospital. No treatment here & very little notice taken of any of our movements. What is ultimately our fate is hard to say. Probably back to France.
Nov 11th - Saturday
Beautiful day, for a change. Very little to do. Write some letters, walk round the grounds. Bed early.
