<p>R.M.S. "Osterley".<br/>Monday</p>
<p>My Dear Judge</p>
<p>Please accept my sincere thanks for "The Dawn of History" which is interesting me very much indeed. It was good indeed of you to trouble to get it.</p>
<p>We again have splendid services yesterday, but I have unfortunately lost my sea legs &amp; am very unhappy today.</p>
<p>Please convey my regards to Mrs Ferguson, &amp; be sure that if I come within reach of your son you will hear from me.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely</p>
<p>W. Meredith Holliday.</p>
