<p>You can bet your life we always turn up smiling.<br/>They can sing their hymn of hate<br/>Till their vocal organs grate,<br/>An' extend their bloomin' frightfulness in strafing.<br/>But we listens good an' tight,<br/>With a smile of pure delight,<br/>And its 'Eaven 'elp the blighters when we're laughing.</p>
