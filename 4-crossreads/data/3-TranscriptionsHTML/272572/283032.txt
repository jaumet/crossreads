<p>&amp; arrived at St Riquier about 4.30AM on Wednesday we had breakfast &amp; marched 8 miles to a village called Ergnies arriving there at 11.30AM. St Omer is a large town with about 3 big churches, a nice railway station, which stands out prominently facing the bridge over the river. The country round about is very low lying on 3 sides of the town, it being under cultivation, it is very rich soil, growing onions, cabbage to perfection. A canal runs right up to the small river in the town, in the main Street every householder appearing to own a boat. Small canals run alround the gardens, the ground being that low lying, it must all be under water in the winter. There are a lot of apple orchards here so we had some good feeds. Thursday Raining. We had plenty of apples, there being a lot of apple orchards here.</p>
