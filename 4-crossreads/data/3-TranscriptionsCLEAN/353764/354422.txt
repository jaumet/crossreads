  
 though & I am hopeful of turning it out a first class charger I am very tired after my long ride & also feeling very dirty, but I do not get time to have a bath.  The boys are not having so good a time now, as they are all up at all times of the night. The Strange Crowd we took in are proving themselves to be very troublesome & I intend to start on them properly in the morning.  I have not heard from Jack for a long while, so I presume he is now down at Tel-el-Kebir. 
 13.3.16 Monday Another day passed with a good deal of Convoy work over. I got the surprise of my life to-day caused by a Cable sent by Nina.  It was keenly appreciated & I don't think I ever thought as much of anything as I did of that Scrap of paper with a few words on it. Expecting another batch of horses from Maadi to-day 90 all told.
