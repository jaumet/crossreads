am glad to say we start for Kilid Bahr the fort on the Peninsular side today & go into camp on the ground.  The long & difficult travelling from London has rather upset my programme and it is a question whether I can get through my Palestine work & get back here before May or June - but the future is on the knees of the Gods & the weather is taking up.
A I very nice man called Vollingony or some name of that kind introduced himself to me here.  He is O.C. education & he was at one time dilettante artist & knew the Canish Crew.  Also was a great friend & admirer of little Savage.  *  His pencil drawings are quite good & artistic.  (Miss Valentine Savage, his model for "The Actress".)
I hope you & Maurice are managing alright & that there will be no difficulty about the separation allowance.
As usual the voyaging has cost me dear & I am looking forward to a while in camp to reimbourse me for Cairo & further expense.  I'll write from Anzac.
Yours EverG.W. LambertCapt. A.I.F.War Records Section
