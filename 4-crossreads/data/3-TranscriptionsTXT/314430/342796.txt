Before the train started we were pestered by withered old mesdames to buy oranges, cigarettes, and matches at ruinous prices. Some of the boys in the draft who had been here before, and who, therefore, were awake to the tactics of these female robbers roared:- "Boukoo!"* and "Alley toot sweet!"+ About ten O'clock the train crawled out of Boulogne. Half an hour later, I could just discern through the gathering gloom, that we were steaming along the a low-lying sandy coast.
May 7th:- At 1 A.M. the train pulled up. Troops ordered out. Men wander about a maize of railway lines, some looking for their gear, others struggling to get it on, and many whistling or shouting in order to locate their mates. Eventually, all are ready. "Quick March!" is the order, and away we move in the darkness, through acres of huts and tents. Then comes the word "halt", and we learn we are in the New Zealand Base at Etaples. It is said the reason why we are going through the NZ Base, is because the Australian Base at Le Havre, is quarantined. Blankets are issued. Next we are allotted to bell tents in groups of ten. We try to sleep; but excitement, and over exertion, prevent some of us, and, as the Camp is now hushed, I hear for the first time, but very faintly, the ominous sounds of active artillery.
