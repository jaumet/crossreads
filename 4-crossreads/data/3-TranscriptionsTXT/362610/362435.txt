 Monday 7 August 1916 Summer again, but much cooler at night. Lecture by Div. Gas Officer to reinforcements in the morning, &amp; during the day I visited our Engineers &amp; other units to see about helmets &amp;c. In the afternoon rode out on bike to Fresselles to try &amp; get a refill for my electric torch from the canteen there. A hot &amp; dusty ride over a pretty bad road. Demonstration in use of SOS rockets at night.
