I'll get a chance to post this  -All has gone very well so far  -  No hitch  -  Our boat is very slow & that's a draw back  -Keep this epistle of mine & number it for I may want to refer to it  -  I want to get a knowledge of & be able to express that knowledge about the finest navy amp; the biggest navy of all time. We are a humble unit but our chaps of course know the ropes & I'm here to learn all I can of men & ships & war  -  They say our two submarines are the finest in the navy  -  & that the Commanders Besant & Stoker are two very fine sailors & fighters  -I think of you all & what's going on at my little home  -  Kiss the children & tell Rawdon I'm always thinking of him & trust he's a fine boy& learning to be punctual & generous & to help you & Maidie - don't forget a quiet pony - Maidie is a fine girl & will come on all right  -  We are all cheerful optimists on the Upolu & the world goes all the better with us because of the cheeriness of everyone  -  Goodbye  -  Don't talk about our equipment & be vy  -  careful not to tell the press anything  -No leave allowed  -  (2 pm)  -Your lvg husbandFred
