  
 [Wednesday 8 November 1917] 
 Still blowing a gale but things in general are better.  We get wireless news of how the war is going but nothing else, writing is difficult, the sea is so rough- We are now off  Cape Finistiere  & the Spanish Coast- You will notice I am using the end of 1917 Diary anticipating I shall not be soldiering when 1917 November comes round!!!  Dear little Mother I dreamt about you last night & could see you all so plainly at Bronte.  It is a great comfort to feel Joe is keeping every thing going & you are well.  I hope it was not selfish [indecipherable] to many.
