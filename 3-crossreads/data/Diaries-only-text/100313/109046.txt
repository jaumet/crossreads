10/1/18 Oxford
Balliol College are both close to this hotel. Returned to the hotel tired out and rather "engorged" with colleges, towers, chapels c. To see them properly would take months as the whole city is full of them. The number of pretty girls here is remarkable but they can't dress as well of M?dlle. There is missing just that little touch of chicness that makes the Parisienne so tempting. But they are better looking than the French by long odds. After dinner walked down the street past Carfax and back. There were very few people about and the town was dark as pitch. On returning to the Hotel went to bed early. The number of flunkeys and servants here is large. I can notice no lack of food, comfort or of fuel among the upper class.
