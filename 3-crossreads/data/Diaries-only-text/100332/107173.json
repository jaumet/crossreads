enclosed in frames representing the life of Christ from Cradle to the Crucifixion, these are all done splendid. The 10 am service was enjoyable but at 4 Pm when the Organ played the Choir sang it was a real treat to listen to. After coming out of the Cathedral after an enjoyable time I went along at 5 Pm to see the French Picture Show. As all the back gallery seats were reserved I had to content myself with a very front seat for 3d, this Cinema is a small place very stuffy the Picture screan is to high up to be appreciated. These seats were full of French boys girls what a chatter which of course I could not understand. The Pictures up to half time were very good written in French which I could not understand read but followed the plots fairly well. I came out at half time as I was very tired I started off to find my Caf where I had some Bread Butter Coffee at 9 Pm I went upstairs 3 storey's high to my room, I turned into a beautiful soft bed soon was fast a sleep. I awoke at 9 am.
