France 20/7/18.
Dear Bett.
I have yet to thank you for your last letters. So forthwith .. receive my thanks for same at once, of news, that is new, or interesting I have but little, still what I can find I will send. I left my little dug-out in the trench three days ago, and after sundry delays, arrived at this place .. "It's a quiet little place, hidden away in a hollow, tween the hills, and allmost hidden by trees .. You dont see it untill allmost in the centre so you can guess, the population does not exceed 1,000,000 in fact it's a little less. "I've seen several french men since arriving here .. but thats not what I was going to write about. The first part of the journey was accomplished per "boot, the second stage per motor lorry, and the third by Rail, and the fourth by boot so you see we had quite a high old time, for lately, we have done all our travelling in the manner last mentioned..
The country here is rather pretty, and after the flat country its rather nice to get into a part where they can boast of a few hills, even if they are not so good for farming purposes. the crops here do not compare, with those I have been amongst for the last few weeks. Yet these are worth more, for they will be harvested and the others will not, that is the difference.
