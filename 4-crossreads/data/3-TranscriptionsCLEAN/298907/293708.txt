  
 after all this was over Snow & I had a stroll round the grounds we were looking for 2 pretty girls we were not going to take on anything, so after about an hour or so I spots 2 who I thought would do, so I engaged them in conversation & after a little persuading Snow & I walked off with our beauties I took their photos (they were sisters) later on, sitting on a seat hope they come out alright, but I have my doubts for it was very dull however we spent a very pleasant afternoon with them & then took them to their home for tea, they were two nice sensible girls, after this Snow & I caught a tram & beat it for the hospital 
 27th.  Have had 2 signal honors of a mild sort conferred on me this morning nothing more than being asked to put an autograph in
