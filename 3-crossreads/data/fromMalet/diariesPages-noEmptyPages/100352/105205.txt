The "Matanga" sailed at three oclock. Shot another pig. This was a fine bit of excitement We wandered along a narrow pig track into a scrub such as we had never seen before It was impossible to see a foot off the track. The luxuriance of the vegetation , its rare beauty could be equalled in no other part of the world with the African Amazonian jungles taken into account. Although the place fairly stank of pig we could not see any coming out into the clearing. we ran into a number, however which took to their heels on out appearance. Hynes
