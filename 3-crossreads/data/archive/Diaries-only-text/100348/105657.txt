of other Christmas dinners I had eaten; was my Christmas dinner this year. I am in a large German dugout where we sleep during the day time. No movement is allowed during the day for the position is much exposed
26/12/16.
Received a small piece of Christmas pudding last night before midnight so yesterday was Christmas Day. The weather broke and it was fine and clear today. Was on "day post" and witnessed a fight between aeroplanes. One, burst into flames while flying at a great height and was destroyed. The town of Bapaume is plainly visible; behind the German line, the Hun defences before it seem very strong. This position is called "Fritz's Folly"; why, I cannot imagine. The hun is shelling Geudecourt other wise the front is quiet.
