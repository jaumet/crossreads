  
 get decent smoking tobacco. 
 Thanks so much for the snaps, the sweet peas  were  are really marvellous & the garden generally looks beautiful.  And how Graham is growing, it brings it home to me that I've been away for nearly 18 months. 
 I was glad to hear you were home & loving it, the season must be weird.  Your letters do hearten me up & I giggle no end. 
 I really don't know how to thank you because it is so decent of you especially when you have 24 to write to. 
 Only please don't get too pippy with me when I don't write every week.  I can't always you know. 
 And really there's very little to write about.  I must clear now.  Its no use talking about the war, the next two months will see lots of changes. 
 Give my love to Mac & Graham & the Boss & very much to yourself. 
 Yours as ever, Jim
