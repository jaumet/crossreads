<p>August 24th  March from Warloy to Beauval, a couple of miles from Doulens.  I don't think that these divisions will return to the Somme front &amp; I know that we have been detached from the 4th Army to which we were temporarily.  I think that the Australians have fully justified their being transferred but the price has been heavy.  I think we will return to the Armentieres dist.</p>
<p>Aug 25th  Spend day at Beauval &amp; I notice that Col Lawson has been killed in action.</p>
<p>Aug 26th  At 1 pm we left Beauval &amp; entrained at Doulens.  The country down here has completely altered in as much as the crops have been cut &amp; are stooked in long rows.  For miles you can see long rows of these stooks.</p>
<p>Aug 27th  At 3 am. we left the train at Hopoutre siding a couple of kilos from Poperinghe (Belgium) &amp; went to billets in huts a couple of miles from the town.  This afternoon we went into the town which is typically Belgique &amp; very old &amp; is of some size.  It is often shelled from Ypres direction.  We are about 12 kilos from Ypres.<br/>This part of the country is fine now the hops have matured &amp; there are many fields in this district which is famous for them.  In the town real Brussels lace can be obtained at high prices 200 fr. for a handkerchief.</p>
<p>Sept 1st  Move to take over D.R.S at Remi Siding about a mile the other side of Poperinghe.</p>
<p>Septr 16th  We have been doing very little here but indulge in sports of all kinds &amp;  walks.  To-day we held a Grand Sports Meeting &amp; the events were great, mounted &amp; on foot. A few days ago I visited the Mont des Cats from the top of which a great panorama can be obtained.  Armentieres, Ballieul, Ypres (cloth hall) Poperinghe, &amp; some say even Dunkirk can be seen.</p>
<p>Septr 27th  Still at the D.R.S. &amp; having a good time.  This evening we are having a dinner &amp; a distribution of the prizes won at the sports.  Also lately the Military Medals</p>
