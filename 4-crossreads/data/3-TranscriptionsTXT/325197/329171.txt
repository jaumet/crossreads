 Thurs 26th September Reported again to Horseferry Rd, and received another days leave. Spent the day seeing some of the sights, and having a good time 
 Fri 27th September Railway strike still going strong, so had another days extension While walking along the Strand the street started to jump up &amp; down, so I thought the best thing was to see the Doctor at Head Quarters, so got on to a bus top Horseferry Rd. After medical inspection I was sent out to Southall hospital 2nd A.A.H. and put straight into bed. (in G. Ward) The old French fever again A few days later I got Bronchitis so that will be a few more days in bed. 
 Wed 4th October Was getting on nicely, and like a big fool; I had to get up, and catch another chill, so that will mean more bed.
