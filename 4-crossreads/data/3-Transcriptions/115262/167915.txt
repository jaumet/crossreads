<p>Monday 28 May 1917.</p>
<p>The hottest day so far.</p>
<p>Physical jerks in morning.</p>
<p>Saw hundreds of flying fish this morning. 9 to 15 ins. long &amp; wings varying according to size of fish. Wings are really large fins &amp; are transparent. Frightened by boat they&nbsp;(fish)&nbsp;rise 3 or 4 feet above water and fly away from boat for a distance of from 20 to&nbsp;75 or&nbsp;100 yds. when they are no sooner in one wave &amp; out into the crest of the next.</p>
<p>&quot;Mock trial&quot; (for bigamy) on the upper deck from 3 pm to 5 pm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wrote letter this afternoon &amp; missed&nbsp;the&nbsp;trial.</p>
<p>Sleeping on deck tonight in deck space allotted to A.C.<s>B</s>.F.A.</p>
