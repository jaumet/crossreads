 1916   MONDAY 10   JULY 
 Fine & showery by turns. We were taken off the "Argyllshire" at 9.15 AM by the tug "Sir Walter Raleigh" & landed at the London & South Western Railway Company's station where we were put straight into a train & taken to camp at Amesbury, a part of Salisbury Plains. We got out of train at 4.15 pm and marched about 4 miles to camp. We were all glad to get off the old A8 although she had been a good home to us for 60 days. Capt Chicken shook hands with everybody as they left the ship. The journey up was very interesting to all, the prettiest journey I have ever had All the country looked beautiful. We did not enjoy the march out so much as we were very tired  The camp is a model though. Huts about 60 ft by 20 & beautifully built and only thirty men in each  Picture shows, hot & cold shows post office ect
