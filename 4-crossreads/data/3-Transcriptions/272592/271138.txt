<p>23rd.   A Taube was up bright &amp; early this morning &amp; our gunners were getting good practice at her they are such rarities nowadays that when one is spotted they are an object of interest, I don't know what became of her.</p>
<p>Capt. McKenzie came back last night &amp; is going to take over C. Coy in the morning I think the boys will be rather pleased at this for Mac. is a sport.</p>
<p>After parade this morning they had a couple of ties "pulled" in the tug of war C. Coy defeated D. &amp; the Transport &amp; now have to pull A. to win.</p>
