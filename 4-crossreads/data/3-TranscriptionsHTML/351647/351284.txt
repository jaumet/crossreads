<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Of course I have been a pig &amp; haven't written for two or three weeks but I do hope you'll be gracious &amp; merciful &amp; forgive me.  I have been so jolly busy, my old assistant left me &amp; the new one came &amp; I didn't think I'd keep him &amp; so didn't bother to break him in for a few days, so its been a long process.  Also it has been so wretchedly cold &amp; its hard enough to get through my work.</p>
<p>I can keep warm in bed or if I walk a lot or cycle but sitting &amp; writing I simply freeze &amp; am helpless.</p>
<p>I have not much news at all, no letters from you or anyone since I wrote last, there has been no Australian mail.  It seems so long between mails these days.  I get a few Blighty letters but it's the home ones I hanker for.</p>
<p>First of all, thanks so much for having the parcel sent from London for me.  It had very nice things in &amp; we all enjoyed them so much.  It was a very happy thought of yours.  I did appreciate it.</p>
<p>Miss Arn sent me a bonzer parcel too so I have been very lucky.</p>
<p>We had a decent spell out, of course it wasn't a rest.  I had to work hard but still it was a rest from worrying over ones immediate pals.  I told you about being domiciled in a farm quite a nice one &amp; nice people.  The old father &amp; four daughters, real jolly girls &amp; I had a nice</p>
