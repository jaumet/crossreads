 My Darling Eddy, The picture is the back view of the hospital where I'm nursing, the poor wounded soldiers. Charlie is here   &amp;  has been wounded but is very much better. I saw Keith Saturday night for a short time   &amp;  Sunday I had tea with him in Cairo. He is looking very well. It is fearfully hot. Heaps of love   &amp;  kisses from Auntie Ede.
