one wrong in the mind. To lie under the shade of a tree or wall is much cooler than to lie in closeness of a tent. The flowing robes and the loosely fitting, light coloured clothes of the natives gives a good illustration of how the people of a country cloth themselves to suit their climate conditions.

During the hotter part of the day from 12 midday to 3 or 4 o’clock in the afternoon one comes across natives lying in the shade of a tree or a wall even on the pavement of the streets in the city. Lying on the ground they throw their cloak over their heads to save them from the fly nuisance. I can’t help thinking that the manner in which the native women carry their water jugs and their baskets on their heads is meant for the same purpose, namely to ward off the flies. By carrying thse things on their heads, their hands are free. It is very interesting to see these women balancing their water jugs and baskets on their heads and waving the hands and arms in a peculiar fashion as if to whisk away the flies. Necessity is the mother of invention and this method saves the use of the fly whisks that the people of this nation use at this time of the year in Egypt.
