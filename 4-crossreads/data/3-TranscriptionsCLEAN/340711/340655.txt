Friday, 15.Mrs Cuckney came in and brought me books cigarettes, fruit etc. She is the wife of the Borough (Chatham) Treasurer. She is one of the finest women I have met. She not only does things for us fellows but she has the knack of personalizing them. She transmits the virtues of the motive that prompt the deeds to the very deeds themselves. Her gifts "resentissent" of the kindness and sympathy that inspire them.
Monday, 18.Transferred to Preston Hall, Aylesford, Kent. Left Chatham as a "stretcher case" at 7.pm. Preston Hall about 6 miles from Chatham. Motored.
