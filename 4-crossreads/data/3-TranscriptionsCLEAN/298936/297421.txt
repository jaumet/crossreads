 Wednesday 22 
 Supposed to land at 11 a.m. [indecipherable] Mudros which is on the eastern side of the island but got under way at about 4 oclock. 
 Had to search out the Aust. A.M.C. headquarters & then reported the arrival of 16 men to the [indecipherable]. 
 Temporarily attached the 1st Austral. [indecipherable] Hosp. for duty. 
 Miller Robson & Morris got about 50 letters each which made me jealous. 
 Had a walk through the village (a few rough huts) in the evening.
