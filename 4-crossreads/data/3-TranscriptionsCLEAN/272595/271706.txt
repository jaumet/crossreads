  
 for a wonder we did not have to change for we struck a through train which took us right to Warminster. 21st.  Back again in Camp & am doing a loaf this morning, while I was away old Billy Hughes paid the Camp a visit I should have liked to have been here with my Kodak & got a snap or two. There was a bit of fun here this afternoon a lot of the "diggers" were playing "two up" when a fight started over a bet, & they got to one another like mad, I grabbed my camera & rushed out in time to get a snap at the contestants. Have been writing practically all the day have penned 9 letters some of them fairly long ones at that. 22nd.  Took over the Dental work again this morning so I will be kept busy once more, I am feeling absolutely grand now & fit for anything
