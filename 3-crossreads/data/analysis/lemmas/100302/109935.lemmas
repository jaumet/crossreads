 At Sea 23/3/16 At breakfast we were about 40 mile South of Malta , a fine sunni morn with a calm blue sea and a cold wind . Parad on the after well deck and took it easi in the sun after a strenuous half hour of physic exercis . Chang our cours on come in sight of Malta at 1045 . A fair size island termin on the Western end in a high bluff . Apparent pretti clear of tree can see a fair size town inland a littl from the coast . On come closer one see the countrysid is terrac and subdivid by small stone wall which in the distanc seem like hedg . It is said that the island is almost solid rock and earth was ship from other place deposit in these enclosur . The differ in height of adjoin block is sometim much as 10 feet . We pass sever fort and lighthous and a tugboat met us off Valetta where we lay to for about an hour . Valetta appear to be a fair-siz town behind the breakwat could see some meno ?war fli French colour and some other ship . There is a gradual rise from the sea and the general run of hous seem like Egyptian . A church tower overtop other build . An aqueduct was visibl on the skylin and a ruin castl perhap that of the Knight of Malta . The coast appear to be an easi one and some small yacht look well with their white sail . The western extrem of the island termin in a steep bluff which drop sheer into the sea . I should say the highest point on the island would not be more than 400 feet . The most singular thing without doubt is the terrac hillsid with it hedg like wall . Receiv a wireless that Gener Ivanoff had deliv a crush blow to the German . Pass a torpedo destroy go into Valetta . Left the island behind and are now steer toward Marseill but zigzag a lot . Dure the night we pass some island and CAPE BON on the north coast of TUNIS.
