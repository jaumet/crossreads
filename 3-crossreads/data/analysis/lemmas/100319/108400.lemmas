We got to work with plenti of effort and they took over alright but after a tremend amount of troubl . Left 1 N.C. O per Coy , 3 signal , 16 Lewi gun , 3 ?phone Major Matthew to tide them over their troubl . Their coy . were 225 strong and the whole area was crowd with men . At 6pm under a heavi barrag the Tommi attack Montbrehain and their assault wave look veri well as they cross the open . Relief was not complet until 3.30 a.m. As we came through Estree on our return journey we were shell . Ended up befor dawn in cold dugout near Billiard Wood .
