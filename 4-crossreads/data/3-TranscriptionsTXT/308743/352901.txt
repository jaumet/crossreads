5 January 1915Tuesday
Stables as usualThis morning I thought that I would pull down my [indecipherable] so with Toby I proceeded to do so then after getting the engine out of [indecipherable] we were thunderstruck to find that the timing pinions on both wheels were gone.  They had evidently been badly forged or the steel hardening was too thick we then thought that it would be well to take down the others & made a start to [indecipherable] the same thing had happened there & also in Cairo the whole six were settled so now our bikes are properly settled it turns out to be exactly as Toby said.  The breakages were taken over to HQ for inspection & Major [indecipherable] is now concerned that we are right. The Boss ordered us to put machines together and ride them with the words that they will run a far greater risk when they get to the front. Toby has another late run to [indecipherable]. Bed at 9.30.
6 January 1915Wednesday 20 weeks of soldiering
Stables at 6.00At first parade the [indecipherable] were ordered to put packs on with loads and the horses went real well but the horses with the poles are a little fidgety when unloading.  Toby and I made a trough for [indecipherable] feed in but as usual the Boss wants it the opposite way.  In the afternoon Toby pulls his machine down and we alter the timing timing so that it has put on 5 miles per hour.  Now nothing of much importance happened but Corp Larkin and Bobby with myself were promoted to the Reg Signallers we are to start in the morning so now am glad that there is a definite job in front of me at least.  No mail has arrived yet but a stray or two arrives every day.  All leave is stopped from tonight on account of men from all camps taking French leave.  Bed at 9.00
