<p>Sunday 11th June 1916</p>
<p>Yesterday we were told to prepare to march off at 11.<br/>We marched off &ndash; 100 yds or so to the 2nd Stationary Hosp. to which we are attached for rations now.<br/>How we are going to fare now I can't imagine.<br/>There is no sign of going away.<br/>Schoeheuner [?] Highton, Marr &amp; numerous other tent mates of mine in old [indecipherable] are here &amp; yesterday I gave them a little music in return for a good dinner.<br/>We are in tents &ndash; about 60 of us &ndash; isolated, &amp; doing nothing.</p>
