 Sunday 28th October 1917 
 Aldy 12.30 to 1 p.m. 5 St. Faith. I am to ring up. 
 Today raining again, going Church if possible (nobody does go apparently these days) in evening have seats to hear HORATIO BOTTOMLEY lecture on "What I saw in France". This Hotel is right on the sea &amp; always blowing &amp; squally. Later. Lecture not much good but JOHN BULL as Bottomley is known as says the War will be over by XMAS, I thinks  not . 
 Letters from Australia, Mother JOE Daisy July 15th. Note all your news also a long letter from Mr. ROCHEFORT, please thank him.
