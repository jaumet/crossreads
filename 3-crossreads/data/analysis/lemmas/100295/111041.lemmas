 of the new day , with the torn tree ruin reflect in the placid mirror like moat . Of cours everyth is so blast shell , that had one not known that befor him lay Ypres , it would have been mistaken for a great brick dump . We took the car via the Menin Gate , left it a littl out of Ypres , as the road was be shell unsaf for transport . The way had been shell the previous night was litter with broken limber hors . In the centr lay a motor lorri almost cut in halv burnt by a shell hit . The Menin Rd is one of the , if not the , most ghast approach on the whole front . Accretion of broken limber , materi munit lay in pile on either side , give the road the appear of run through a cut . Ani time of the day it may be shell it is absolut imposs owe to the congest traffic
