<p>explosion and shrieks from men.&nbsp; This awakened the neighbourhood, everyone rushed from their billets, to the place from whence came the unmistakable sounds of suffering humanity.&nbsp; We had not far to seek.&nbsp; One of the big sheds had been hit by a shell, there were dead, dying, and wounded and pandemonium reigned.&nbsp; I think there were over one hundred and sixty casualties resulting from two shells, nearly all being members of our 14th Battalion.</p>
<p>The shells that night had me running all over the place, taking cover behind the most absurd and senseless places.&nbsp; Ditches, ruts in the fields or roads, or blades of grass, then when I was quite fagged out I went back to the house and joined others in the cellar, which was after all the safest place of all.&nbsp; Why I had not gone there first is more than I can tell.&nbsp; Just a new phase of my idiocy, I suppose.&nbsp; I shall never forget that night as long as I live.&nbsp; The other chap just stayed where he was all the time and no doubt laughed at me running all over the place.&nbsp; His calmness and coolness irritated me almost beyond endurance.&nbsp; Worry, not he.&nbsp; Fear, he didn&#39;t know the meaning of.&nbsp; He annoyed me beyond measure.&nbsp; I&#39;d say sometimes &quot;By jove! he&#39;s getting a bit close, I&#39;m going down the cellar&quot;.&nbsp; He would simply ask me why?&nbsp; He never heard the jolly things falling, or if he did it didn&#39;t worry him, and he would still carry on his work as if he were in his own office at Kalgoorlie.</p>

<p>While here I obtain a few days leave and visit Paris.&nbsp; Well! everyone knows this city, and it would be impossible to exaggerate Paris.&nbsp; They say there is only one Paris in the world, and my impressions were quite in accord with that verdict.&nbsp; Paris stands alone in my opinion as a most beautiful city, and as a place where the maximum amount of varied amusements abound.&nbsp; The customs of the French are different from the English.&nbsp; I spent a most enjoyable time and all my cash in Paris, and then went back to the village</p>
