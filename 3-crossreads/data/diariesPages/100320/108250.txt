23/11/18 Bohain
About 250,000 civilians are now being fed from this place. Great talk of the deplorable conditions of prisoners daily returning into our lines. Met a woman and her daughter at a house where we had coffee while waiting for our horses. They were full of enmity against the Huns and all the metalwork in the house had been requisitioned also their woolen & cotton garments. Paper garments replaced the latter. Had a long ride to Bohain & no one there could give us any news of where our billets were. Found DHQ collared the General's lamp. Woke the waiters and had a fine dinner of beef ofvegetables and sweets served in a fine oak panelled room with blazing fire. Plenty of whisky. Found orders for the Bde on the mantelpiece. We stay here a couple of days. My billet was occupied by a doctor. After searching round secured a bed.
