Afternoon tea 3 pm, tea 5 pm & a cup of cocoa at 8 pm. I am on light diet owing to my throat being sore. wrote four letters, we have to pay the penny postage here, just as well they will take French money, it is all I have. There is a Belgian civillian Dr in attendance here, he recorded me tonsalitis & shell shock, according to the symptions given him. He seems a very nice chap. A very fine afternoon. Had a bad time tonight.
Saturday April 7thI have a throat gargle & medicine to make me sleep of a night time. We have a decent meal served out at dinner time, otherwise we only have bread & butter, & an egg or bacon for breakfast. Feeling much better today. The days seem awful long lying in bed. All clocks etc were put on an hour at midnight, daylight saving system.
Sunday April 8thThe weather is getting grand now, every day is getting warmer. Everything is very quiet. A Major examined me today & marked me to a special hospital, I don't know what it means though. No feeling too good today.
Monday April 9thThe weather changes very quick here, it was snowing this morning, at dinner time the sun was shining, & now it is again cloudy. Feeling pretty crook in the region of the abdomons. There seems to be a good lot of chaps in here, most of them are Tommies & are marked up for convalescent camp.
