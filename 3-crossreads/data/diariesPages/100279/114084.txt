When we came out of the line we thought we were going North to Armientieres or Belgium, but it appears that the Australians kicked up a row refused to go for they reckon that now they have stuck the Somme all through winter done a lot of fighting they reckon now they have started the Germans going they will stop here take the good with the bad, for it can't be very much long before Baupaume falls we want to be in it, quite right whats the good of going now
