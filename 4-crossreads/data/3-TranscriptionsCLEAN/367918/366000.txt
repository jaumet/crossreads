Dear Mother & FatherHave reached another stage. We are now at Haure. Have got absolutely nothing to do here and time hangs very heavily. The weather is oppressively hot and I feel inclined to do nothing but sleep all day long.
We leave here for England on Tuesday 13th but am afraid that from all accounts we shall be hung up for a good while in England. I shall let you know when I am likely to embark.
Best LoveYour aftt SonC.R. Lucas
