Thur. Dec. 21.  O Lord wet again & they call this "Sunny France".  Jolly good news in the Paper about the French giving Fritz a hiding at Verdun.  Got an Anzac today & a pair of Leggings so I'm getting equipped gradually.  The fellows who have had leave to Blighty all seem to have had a jolly good time.  Shall be glad when my turn comes.
Fri. 22.  The 8th got the worst knock they've ever had this morning.  Poor old Alec & Nugget Bennet got killed in their dug out.  It gave us all a most painful shock.  Hughie Taylor of C sec got baldy wounded too.
Sat. 23.  The Bearers returned today & what a sight they looked.  Unshaved, unwashed, lowsy, clothes in rags & Poor beggars I felt sorry for 'em.  It was good to se 'em again & they were mighty pleased to be back.  Stan Wright brought back my mail 2 Letters from France & Xmas Cards I from Cis, one each from Kath, Arthur & David. 1 from Nell, Ruth B, Aunt Nell, & 2 glorious long Letters from M.S. & 2 [tricky?] Post Cards.  How the deuce I'm going to answer 'em I don't know.
Sun. 24.  After Dinner went into Vignacourt with Stan Wright.  Went into a cottage & had a good feed of Eggs, Bread & Butter & Coffee.  Made few purchases, Post cards etc.  After Tea we strolled through the streets.  Met Bricky Howard.  Adjourned to an Estaminet & drank each others Health in good English Beer.  Later on we met David, Russ & the crowd & had a sing song.  Returned about 9 p.m.
Mon. 25. XMAS DAY.  Porridge & milk for Break.  For Dinner we had Soup, Rissoles, Plum Pudding, Fruit & actually  Beer.  I ate until I was  ready to burst.  The patients had first sitting, then they waited on us.  After Dinner they gave out Parcels & what a time we did have.  For Tea we had Salmon, Tinned, Fruit, Custard & Jelly.  After Tea we had a jolly good Concert.  Blanton & party played a little sketch entitled "Ours or theirs", which was a huge success.
