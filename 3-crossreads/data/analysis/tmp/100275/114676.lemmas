 would care much about it for it must be dead quiet slow we walk home along the railway line 2 more mile . This even I saw a small French airship . She look veri nice grace as she flew slowli along the sea , they patrol the Channel Sea on the look out for submarin Zeppelin . Saw Brummi Hall Dick McKenzi tonight , they are here in the Convalesc Camp . 24th . To day is the anniversari of my second year in the Armi . I never thought it would last this long when I enlist , but you can never tell how long
