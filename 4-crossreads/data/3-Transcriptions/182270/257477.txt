<p>SATURDAY, JUNE 14, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Had another go at the</p>
<p>Middle paddock bore but it</p>
<p>beat us again so I just</p>
<p>shifted the horses to Seven Star</p>
<p>&amp; let it stop for a bit. Round</p>
<p>Mountain &amp; Wheelers after.</p>
<p>Put an old fellow on poisoning</p>
<p>but he is not much good</p>
