such places in the end, his artillery puts up a good fight but still without staunch infantry support it wont hold us, from what I can see they just about have him on the run here.  At present we are in possies a few miles behind the lines just far enough back to be out of danger of the zonks!  How long we will stay here I cant say or where we go next, its just about time all the Australians in France had a good spell as they have been on the go since before Christmas wherever the fighting has been most critical.
