<p>been up under Fritz's very nose, this sort of work has rather a fascinating sort of excitement &amp; is not so risky as one might suppose or as it is often made out to be.  You have doubtless been reading of the great work of the Australians on the Somme in which our lot have taken no part, but still they have been doing just as good &amp; successful work on a smaller scale up in this part of the front.  Oh well I have just about run myself dry so will say Au revoir with love &amp; kisses to all &amp; whips to yourself.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Douglas</p>
