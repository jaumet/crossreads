<p>I think it was about the [indecipherable] of the Ypes stunts of Sept, Oct, &amp; Nov, wasn't it? Well anyhow I will start from there. We were relieved on Nov 7th &amp; came back to "Half-way-House", a kind of rear reserve, and on the following day we came back to billets near Steenvoorde. <br/>On the 11th we shifted to Staples. We stayed there a week &amp; then moved to Meterin (now right up against the line). The following day we shifted to a camp just outside of Steenwerke (now occupied by Fritz). From there I was sent on the 25th, to a bombing school at Neuve Eglise. I was there a fortnight, rejoining the Coy on 8th Dec.<br/>Dec 15th we moved up to Pont-de-Nieppe. Support battalion. Some place, believe me. The French had evacuated it leaving every thing behind. Pictures on the wall tables &amp;</p>
