<p>to "Gamaches", 6 Kilos with Roy who returned to the Ambulance again two days ago after an absence of 12 months in England. Had tea there, steak &amp; chips, the steak I bought myself &amp; the woman of the house cooked it splendidily. Enjoyed the outing.<br/>Friday 18th Oct.<br/> Ordinary duties in the Store also returned some surplus equipment to D.a.d.o.s. Made a Kit inspection of the Unit in order to find out what was wanted &amp; issued some things out. After tea one of our new Sgts was evacuated to Hospital at Abbeville so two of us went in with him, afterwards calling on the Sgts mess to see some old friends. It was a perfect home of a place but full preparations had been made for raids, the tents being revetted &amp; trenches dug for shelter. Saw several of the houses which had been bombed. The trip in was delightful, the moon being full &amp; the air keen. Just as we reached town the steering gear gave way, a fortunate time, as previously we had been travelling easily 30 miles per hour along the main road. Arrived back feeling fresh at about 10.30 P.M.</p>
