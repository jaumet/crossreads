I hear you calling me
1. I hear you calling meYou called me when the moon had veiled her lightBefore I went from you into the nightI came do you remember back to youFor one last kiss beneath the kind star's light
2.  I hear you calling meAnd Oh the ringing gladness of your voiceThe words that made my longing heart rejoiceYou spoke O you remember and my heartStill hears the distant music of your voice.
3.  I hear you calling meThough years have stretched their weary length betweenAnd on your grave the mossy grass is greenI stand, do you behold me, listening hereHearing your voice through all the years between
