<p>Oct. 30th &ndash; Monday<br/>Blowing like seven furies.  Cold &amp; rain.  Great weather.  Seen by the doctor this morning &amp; after a short examination marked for England with heart trouble &amp; debility.  Probably a weak heart for all I know;  a nice ending to my trying to hang on whilst feeling knocked up for so long in anticipation of getting to the front.

<p>Oct. 31st &ndash; Tuesday<br/>Blowing a gale all night &amp; our tent almost over.  Raining</p>
