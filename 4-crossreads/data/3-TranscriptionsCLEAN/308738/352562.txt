  
 Dec. 4 Saturday 1915 In bed all day General Maxwell came & looked through the Hospital. I hear that Lieu Hordern is in this Hospital sick Got letters from Home what a joy it is to read them. I look & long for the day to come when I shall see those Dear Faces again. Poor Girl she has the hard time. We men do not know what anxiety is. I reckon our Women are the Heroes. God Bless them. 
 Dec. 5 Sunday 1915 In bed all day Feeling a bit better though my food does me little good. Service held down stairs can hear them sing, but cannot attend 
 Dec. 6 Monday 1915 In bed all day The days are long lying in bed. I often wish they would send me Home, but I fear that my turn is a long way off yet. There are so many much worse that I have only a small chance
