 Lord Roberts, as our leave expired at 9 P.M. we had to catch a train at 6 P.M. it was with great reluctance that we did so. 
 Thursday was spent working at the Docks loading our equipment into Railway trucks. in the evening a party of us visited a Lodge meeting there we met with a reception fit for Royalty. 
 Friday was also spent at the Dock, we were entertained at tea by the Y.M.C.A. after tea we had some music &amp; all had a most enjoyable time.
