  
 I had a jolly swim this morning in quite cool, even cold, water with Herbert - He is 26 & cant dive as well as Rawdon who has been ever in my mind as I jump into the briny  -  It's a great misfortune for any young chap in the Navy  -  not to be good at games - sport - bridge & the ordinary things that add to life's enjoyment & bring men together   -  get hold of every parlor trick, especially athletics that you can  -  Skipping is a fine thing for exercise & all the gymnasium drill & it does help chaps on  -  Keeness, energy & good temper are absolutely necessary in the Navy  -  The officers here tell me  not  to let a boy inclined to lazy habits play golf too young  -  The boy should play football, hockey, cricket - tennis  -  If they get fond of golf - they loaf horribly round the limbers & smoke cigarettes & yarn & this is bad for young chaps  -  It sounds comon sense  - We are charging the Batteries on AE2 & that means a tremendous uproar from engines &  the  stench from oil fuel - like to the smell of a smoking wick due to unconsumed carbon - a very unpleasant irritating smell  -  Oil fuel & electricity are among the submarine's  complements  necessities  -  They cook by electricity  -  Haggard is to show me over AE2 - a marvellous contraption of the most up to date machinery & electric gear  -
