<p>on the transport.</p>
<p>On the west was nothing but undulating, arid desert.</p>
<p>Passed Tel-el-Kebir during the night. Arrived at Zeitoun at midnight. Thence we marched through silent streets, where our footsteps echoed dismally, to Zeitoun Camp. We had to carry our Kit, and it seemed an intolerable burden. We were very tired---then we left the metalled road and ploughed through heavy sand for nearly a mile. It was hell. Then we had a cup of tea, then blanket issue, then at 2 a.m. sleep.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 29.<br/>Up at reveill&eacute; 6 a.m. Parade at 9.30. Tent erection etc. all morning. Leave for afternoon. Six of us went to Cairo. Met Light Horse sergeant who offered to show us round. Saw Wuzza, so called Kam-Kam dance, zig-a-zig of Egyptian harlot by a man called in, French, Italian, Greek, and Egyptian prostitutes. Thence to see Music and Drinking Hall, where one may choose a lady---very tawdry affair. Stayed there ten minutes, thence to a French and Italian Brothel. Ceaseless stream of soldiers going in. There they are carefully examined, however, and are afterwards given a Condy's Fluid wash. The sights of the day were brutal and sickening. A man would have to be hopelessly drunk to fall into such temptations.</p>
