  
 Sunday 25th The Baloon moved on this morning.  D Co had another rough night. A prisoner was given to us to look after yesterday. It is a funnie old turn out. Of course there is no where to keep prisoners. And the only Sentry posted by day is up the hill at Headquarters & the prisoner pokes about down here. He is a quiet little chap & I think would be hard to chase away. He had to sleep in our Dugout & it was rather overfilled but not uncumfortable I don't mean a Hun Prisoner  Returned in evening & went back to Co 
 Monday 26th There were no empty dugouts so scratched a hole for my self in the Hill.
