returning from a raid on the enemies lines.

As they were crossing from the enemy country the sky was simply peppered with puffs of smoke where the anti aircraft shells had burst.

A big number of cases brought in this afternoon. D.R. very busy.

June 23rd. Fri.
Taking conversation lesson in French, with what success I do not know.

D.W. got 21 days detention for being absent without leave. He had gone out for a ride with one of the Motor Amb. The Amb. had broke down with the result that he could not get home that night.

B. got 28 days detention being out of the C.C.S. grounds after nine o’clock at night. Col N. is rather a strict disciplinarian judging by his sentences against offenders.

June 26th. Mon.
A large number of wounded came in to-day. Mostly Anesthetic Cases.

A rather amusing thing happened to-day. A couple of chaps were lying on stretchers in the D.R. waiting to be attended to. At first they lay there quite quietly, but on looking round about them they suddenly recognised one another. They apparently had been mates and unbeknowing to one another they had been wounded at different times. Their conversation was of rather a humorous nature
