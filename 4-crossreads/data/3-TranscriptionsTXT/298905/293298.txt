remarking on it, especially anyone like me, whose sole thought is for the land, & all it grows, you can look for miles & miles over lovely crops of wheat & oats up to your head & over & as level as a table how I would like to have a binder working in them, what work one could make, it would be a pleasure to be slashing it down, the beans & peas here are a wonderful height on account of the great fertility of the soil, which is a splendid sort of dark brown clay, as strong as you likeJust compare France to Gallopoli & the difference you can't explain they are so far apart, just imagine us here bogging into the cherries & plenty of them everywhere, I have had some splendid feeds of them
