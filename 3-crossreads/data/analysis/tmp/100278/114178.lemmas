 1st of Decemb Today we enter upon the last month of the year and still the war seem no nearer finish , sure by the time next Decemb come round it will all be over and we will be back in sunni Australia . I had a rag-tim guard on last night they were mount from 10 o'clock that night till 4 in the morn just as well there was no "visit round " or there would have been troubl We had breakfast about 8 o'clock and move off at 9 and pass through Heilli a fair size littl town with our Brigad Hqr 's in it , just befor reach this villag we all had to pull our pack off the "limber " and march through the town full "march order " , after we had clear Heilli we threw them on the "limber " again . It was a veri short march and we soon reach our destin ( Ribemout ) .
