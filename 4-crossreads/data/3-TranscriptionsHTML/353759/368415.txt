<p>13<br/>Notice the entry &ndash; well 13 is my lucky number.</p>
<p>14<br/>Lately seem to have gone all my desires for an exhaustive and compleat collection of war cartoons.  Now instead of a collection of quantity, it shall be a collection of quality.  Raemaeker, Dyson, Lindsay, Lewis [?], Sullivan and a few others of exceptional beauty of design or originality.</p>
<p>15  Jan. 18<br/>The Blue Mosque &ndash; below the citadel, the Sphinx and the Pyramids, midnight and a sky of slow embroidered densely deep blue, the Cathedral of Aix in Provence, and now three days ago, on Sunday the Cathedral of Amiens.</p>
<p>All the Gods ever with us and we heard high mass celebrated before a wondrous altar by marvellously robed Priests:  a choir of white robed red cap"d boys and censor swingers in delicate laces:  and the service between two high long walls of deep sandbags.</p>
<p>All the richer and more exquisite carvings and shrines, the choir stalls were hidden beneath flat walls of sandbags:  but the brilliant stained windows, of the lustered apses were clear and unprotected.</p>
<p>The building is the realised conception of a madman.  It is a creation ranking with all the best and greatest of the world"s Art.  In a way it somehow recalled Rodin"s "The Thinker" and Michael Angelo"s "David" and Phidias" "Three Faces of the Parthenon".</p>
<p>16<br/>In Amiens a bookshop &ndash; Vachell"s latest, "The Achievement of Time", 5th serve of de Maupassant and Balzac"s "The Wild Ass"s Skin".</p>
<p>At a photograph shop spent 40 francs on pictures of the Cathedral.</p>
<p>17<br/>Last night a heavy fall of snow &ndash; today snow &ndash; balling &ndash; and no respect of red cross.  Had Hunt alongside resulted in two &ndash; jolly fine big bricks.  Good sport in the snow, but hares badly outnumbered by about 200:  still they put up long and good fights, but &hellip;.</p>
<p>18<br/>There are two Jews amongst the new reinducements says Bib &ndash; "A Serj. &ndash; that"s crook &ndash; we"ve got the mob that killed Christ with us &ndash; what will we do."</p>
<p>B"s in the cookhouse now.</p>
<p>One day in the incinerator comes up the W.O. to him and says &ndash;</p>
<p>"Where"ve you been Bib?"<br/>"Ere all the morning!  I"ve &hellip;"<br/>"I didn"t mean that, what have you been doing, I haven"t seen you about for months."<br/>"Oh, up the line and &hellip;"<br/>"Then do you like the job."<br/>"It"s a '&hellip;" of a job."<br/>And so Bib"s on a nice one &ndash; the cookhouse.</p>
<p>Once before B. came into the tent disconsolate and fed up.  "When"s sick parade, I"m goin" sick."<br/>"What"s up Bib?"<br/>"Nothin" that &hellip; of an incinerator won"t burn, that"s all."</p>
<p>19<br/>After Jake, it"s a penance to see these native beggars under the showers:  half of them have the lesses of ugly women:  no muscle lines or symmetry.  Of the whole twenty there"s not one worth a second study.</p>
<p>20<br/>Letters from home.  Geoff wrote for particulars of the tank:  Billy"s writing a novel, otherwise the family are well.  Other letters from [indecipherable] Sharpe, the Whittels and Joyce.</p>
<p>21  Jan. 20<br/>Sun worshippers &ndash; in a land where the sun is a God that is dead.  Where nature has been shrouded and laid in a hideous grave by the spirit of Desolation, a land where once most lovely woods are ripped jagged, trunks and dead branches, gaping holes of sinister water and mud, where tall trees grew from deep grassed soil.</p>
<p>Only the skys are lovely, still blue and swirling clouds, white with rifts of pale gold</p>
