<p>Personally I am feeling very fit and getting accustomed to the new conditions of life. Hobart looks dried up. I'm afraid you're having a bad time too. From the little news we get the Germans seem to have taken the whole of Belgium. They'll take a bit of putting out. The slaughter seems to be awful. I wonder how many of our 10,000 will get back. They seem to finish that number off in a day. I expect after this we will only be allowed to send post cards; I'll send them as many and as often as I can.</p>
<p>I hope you are well and as cheerful as possible under the circumstances. I wish I could have seen you, if only for a few minutes before going away, but the fates were against it. If we had kept going the first time we started we would have gone by Sydney, but by all accounts it was just as well we turned back.</p>
<p>Please give my love to all the family. I think of you and them all when lying in my bunk, and many memories of happy times come back to me. I can hardly credit I'm off to this jolly war.</p>
<p>My fondest love to you &ndash;<br/>Your very affectionate son<br/>Gibson</p>
