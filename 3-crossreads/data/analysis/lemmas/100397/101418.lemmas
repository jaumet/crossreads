 Somewher In Franc 27th 5 1916 Dear J. Your letter date 13.3.16 arriv yesterday also one from Mother Bett . my letter are just begin to arriv , here , a few day ago I receiv 7 and yesterday 5 . I think all Mother letter have arriv now . I mean those that were post address to Egypt . Thank much for the present . I will be abl to chang the note here , and I fanci they are worth a littl more than Aus . paper would be over here . But just where to spend them , and what to buy is anoth matter if we were near one of the larger town , way back from the fire line it would be easi enough but here the onli articl worth purchas are Luxuri that our Comisariat Dep. doe not suppli . Such as Eggs , they are onli 2 d each . Preserv fruit 2/ - per tin , in Aus . about 1/1 other articl are much the same . Bar , Wine Beer . " So far as the brand of Wine stock here in these Esta are concern I dont like them they dont come near the Australian articl Champagn , at 5 Franc , per Bottl is not too bad But the 15 franc articl is better . But I can assur you that I dont go in for ani . " A Frenchi told me that it was no Bon for Privat , onli for Officer mean that a privat pay would not stand the strain , I quit believ him . The French Beer you can purchas for 1d per glass , if you are veri thirsti and there is no water about the stuff is just drinkabl or some of it is . I have seen a good solid beer drinker turn round after take one mouth and leav his Beer on the Tabl . at one place they stock an articl which they claim is English beer . it is certain a better articl than the other , but I fanci onli English in name , but it is 3d per glass , onli small glass at that , so what is a man to do when I want a drink ? go for the 3d articl .
