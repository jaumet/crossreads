20 August 1918 Tuesday   Talaat-el-Dumm  (X to X crossed out)Spent the night here & marched again at 0400 which is 4 AM for the Valley-   Still very hot & dustier than ever but fewer shells about.The Culverts & Bridges are nearly all repaired again that Johnny Turk blew up-  What destruction is going on all over the world.   How long??X I suppose Joe is in England now?  Alls well with Dolly & the Bairn.  I get letters about twice a week. X
