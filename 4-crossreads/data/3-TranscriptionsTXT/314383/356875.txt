 May 20 Old Scotty &amp; I had a look thro the bazaar with Zillaman as a sort of guide.  The place is much the same as Kermanshah, tho here there is a Jewish quarter, with better shops &amp; more up to date goods, which come via the Caspian.  Poverty and  starvation is just as rampant &amp; Stalky has people on the job of famine relief. One meal a day is given to the people on road work &amp; the surplus distributed to the people.
