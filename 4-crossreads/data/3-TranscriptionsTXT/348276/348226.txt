War DiaryTo the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and to those who were associated with that famous Corps in the Battle of Sari Bair - The Maoris, Sikhs, Gurkhas, and the new troops of the 10th and 13th Divisions from the Old Country - Sir Ian Hamilton tenders his appreciation of their efforts his admiration of their gallantry, and his thanks for their achievements.  It is an honour to command a force which numbers such men as these in its ranks, and it is the Commander-in-Chief's high privilege to acknowledge that honour.
Signed W.P. Braithwaite, (Major General.)Chief of General Staff, M.E.F."
1915  1st Oct.Four men to H1. and 2 back to duty.  Generals Birdwood and Godley inspected trenches and expressed pleasure and surprise at the amount of work done and the excellent condition of the lines and trenches - Enemy is now very consistent daily in shelling, in retaliation of our persistent worrying of his positions by day and night with M. Guns and R. fire - also E [enemy] is putting in a prodigious amount of work opposite on Battleship evidently in response to our efforts here.  Fishers and Kidd's Saps are being pushed on and are now out each 100 ft. and tunnels 37' and 24' respectively with branch T heads halfway along length on either side - another week will break through at end of bluffs which will then afford a splendid observation from both No. 1 and 2 Posts into Donga below.  Antill's Lookout also on West Pt. had been made into a fine position and we are now breaking through there and joining up with main comn. Sap on Sugarloaf, thus linking up the whole position - On Table Top a new comn. trench has been finished - Reserve Ammunition, Magazine has been completed and filled - and 10 days Reserve
