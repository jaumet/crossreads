<p>Thursday 27th July</p>
<p>The news still holds good.  1st Div. have orders to pack up but we have none yet.  The general opinion seems to be that we will go on Saturday.<br/>The heat is very trying still, &amp; any hopes of getting away from here at all, are sufficient to cheer a man up.<br/>The nights are getting cool but treachourously moist just now, &amp; one has to guard against getting a chill &amp; one has to keep clothes over one at night even if it is close.</p>
