 My dear Judge, I was cleaning out my desk today and found enclosed spare copies of minutes on Heat &amp; dust over here which I scribbled out once as introductions to some material I had collected on the subjects. 
 They may be of some slight interest as indicating the climatic discomforts that caused the sick rate here to keep fairly high. Compared with malaria neither is of any importance in the health consideration but they were contributing factors in that they caused a lowering of general resistance. 
 I was told today that I can get away as soon as some one comes down to relive me. So hope to get off about the first week in July. 
 I had a letter from Dorothy today dated 18/4/ and hope for some more mail tomorrow. &ndash; it has not all been sorted yet. 
 Yours very sincerely R.J. Hunter
