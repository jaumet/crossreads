<p>28-2-16<br/>Mon 28th<br/>The Cpls still have to fall in daily for lectures but I am exempt from them &amp; they are only a farce at any rate; they do nothing but tell yarns Scotty Hamilton was on patrol yesterday  &amp; shot a gazelle; Foxes are very plentiful about here &amp; see several every day from camp.</p>
<p>29-2-16<br/>Tue 29st<br/>L le Measurer commited sucide by shooting himself at Heliopolis a couple of day ago as he was not allowed to rejoin the Regt. It is reported that the Senussis have retired from here &amp; are making their way back across the desert, they could not have stayed long as their food &amp; water would have run out &amp; apparently they decided not to fight. I am on mounted patrol again tonight.</p>
