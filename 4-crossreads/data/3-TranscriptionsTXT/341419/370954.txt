 S.S. Port Darwin Melbourne heads, 22nd Dec. We arrived here yesterday &amp; went to the quarantine station here.  The quarantine Authorities came aboard with pads over their mouths &amp; noses whereat there was much merriment &amp; jocose remarks at their expense. 
 They have put us in quarantine for 3 days, so that all going well we shall leave on Tuesday morning &amp; with luck should reach Sydney on Xmas day, where I at any rate shall call a halt for several days. 
 Meanwhile we have our Temps. taken &amp; are shut into an overpoweringly hot whaling room.  It is an anxious time too for but Hush.
