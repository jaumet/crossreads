 Dear Major Greenwood 
 I do not know if my letter of the 14th of this month reached you but my proposed visit to Amman and its British representative is off for the present.  Colonel Bruxner of Anzac Mtd. Div. has collected me & he tells me it is better to approach Amman from the Jerusalem end and as he is my superior officer & also a knowledgable man I give in and look forward to meeting you in the near future. 
 Still hoping I remain 
 Yours truly & Ever G.W. Lambert (Capt. Official Artist C/o A.I.F. E.E.F. A.I.F. H.Q., Cairo)
