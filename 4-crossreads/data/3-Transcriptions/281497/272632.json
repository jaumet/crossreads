<p>this charge made the 5th one that I have been in thats a pretty good record &amp; not many can beat it I surely can't go any further without getting a smack of some sort or other, it seems impossible I saw Harry Kelly here, he is the Battalion bombers of the 26th Batt. had a good long yarn with him he looks alright, they were on their way up to Pozieres" to have a smack at our friends, one German when he came in wanted to know who we were for he said he knew we were not English, for he said English bombard, &amp; then charge but we bombard &amp; charge at the same time, &amp; so we did;</p>
