 arriv from Australia and were camp at Tel-El-Kebir . I ask British A.D.S. to send them up to our Bakeri and I would work two shift . This was done short after and we were then abl to suppli all Australian Unit in Camp . The Flour suppli was all from hard wheat ? most Canadian and with 25 year experi previous I never saw a more even or better qualiti of Bread . I often wonder if I was fortun , consid reflect I have heard ofcast on British Officer . ( The suppli depot at Tel-El-Kebir dure my time there chang O/Cs three time , and each of them knew his job from A to Z. ) My recollect of them will alway be of the happiest . Two of them have "gone west " . Five I have alway kept in touch with . At Tel-El-Kebir I again came in touch with that "imposs " who had previous been at Abbassia and Zietoun . He was the most incompet muddler possibl to find . My opinion was support by everi offic who I spoke to on the subject . When Col . A took over command of the Camp all friction was wipe out . Stiff in disciplin but a splendid administr . On the 5th of March the O/C return to his Unit after be away five month and I was veri pleas to be abl to hand over the Unit to him with such a clean and meritori name .
