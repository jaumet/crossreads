<p>Saturday 23rd March<br/>    A very strenuous day.   Some 90 odd patients were evacuated last night by means of lorrys &amp; fortunately without casualties.   This left about 40 who had cleared off in all directions to take cover from the shellings &amp; they turned up this morning.   Then we had about 30 cases (various, gas etc) to be evacuated also &amp; what with fixing up their particulars &amp; those of the men who were sent off last night we were going hard all day.   I was looking after the evacuating.  The enemy sent very few more shells over but we cleared up the old camp, our quarters now being in the School in the Village itself.   Civilians are moving back &amp; we are under orders to supply cars to evacuate aged civilians from Bailleul which is being heavily shelled.   Most of the C.C.S.'s are full today so the shelling must be very general &amp; we have reports of places being shelled 20 odd miles back.   Tonight</p>
