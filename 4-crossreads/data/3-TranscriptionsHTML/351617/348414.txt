<p>Westhocke that I witnessed one of the finest Aeroplane scraps I ever saw. It was about 4 pm when one of our Aeroplanes tackled 2 Fritzies about 2500 ft up, according to some of the crowd who saw it, &amp; for fully a quarter of an hour they dived and ducked like flies away up in the blue sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the Fritzies was seen to be on fire and down he came the airman jumping out about half way and racing his engine to the ground. The other two seemed to take no notice, but kept going until Fritz got on our fellows tail and drove him down to the ground. He landed in the shell torn ground a total wreck but got out in a seriously injured condition, with both legs broken and shot through the abdomen.</p>
<p>The last we saw of him was on a stretcher passing brigade, and although he looked pretty near dead then</p>
