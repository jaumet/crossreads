 shells dropped close we ducked for a Tunnel near by. Started again &amp; once more he put his shells in us for the Tunnel again. Got to work again &amp; finished off quick &amp; lively Another chap &amp; I were the last to leave as we were fixing the camoflage. Were covering a truck on the Tram line when "plunk" a gass shell dropped only a few yds away. We ran for it &amp; the next one dropped just behind my mate it keeps us  movaling  moveing. Just then the shells started falling fairly thick right on the track in front of us so we stopped untill they steadyed down Then we put on our Gassmasks as there seemed to be quite a cloud of gass in one place &amp; got through without any trouble. In fact it does not seem very dangerous stuff if one puts his mask on in time Not as bad as the High Explosive shells. Even with them  there  it is largely a matter of luck as they can burst very close &amp; do no harm on the other hand you may get hit quite a distance away
