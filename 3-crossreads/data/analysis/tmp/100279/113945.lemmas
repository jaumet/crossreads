 good to us I thought , so I said to the chap we will have to sneak back one at a time I will start out first , so off I went just befor I reach our trench I watch for the other to come up , just as each man drop into the trench a sniper had a shot at each of us , you would have laugh if you could have seen the dive that the last man made he fair flew into the ditch . " No man land " is cover with German dead they are lay all over the place I cut a fine pair of wire cutter off one chap also brought a rifl , bomb and gas helmet for curio . The next thing I had to do was to report to Mr Edgeley , then I had to write a "report " out on my night 's work and it was sent down to Hqrs at onc , the Capt reckon I had done
