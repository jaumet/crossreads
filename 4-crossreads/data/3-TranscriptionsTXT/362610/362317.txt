Tuesday 11 April 1916Up at 6 & at once got the men at work clearing the furze & scrub on the ground for the tents. They did splendid work with their short bill-hooks & spades. By breakfast  time the rain had started & with short breaks it continued during the day, accompanied by strong cold winds. About 9 a message came to march the men back to camp, & in reply to a progress report & query that we returned, further word came telling us to stay.In consequence I went back to H.Q. to find out what they really wanted. Got orders to proceed with the work & after considerable trouble was able to get further rations for the party. Meantime they & the 4 transport waggons that had arrived were standing by, but after some lunch we pushed on with the aligning & pitching in the rain, & were amazed abt. 4.30 pm to see our (1st Bde) battn. march in. Extra fatigues were at once got going & the tents pushed up so that by dark all hands were under shelter, most of them with floors to their tents. Had it not been for the twilight allowing us to work until 7 o'clock we should never have managed it.
