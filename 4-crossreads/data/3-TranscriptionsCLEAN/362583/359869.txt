but am quite happy except of course that I am yearning to get home again. However there is no use yearning it must end some time & then I shall just blow in to tea some Sunday night & tell you all about it. I am afraid we shall all be most frightfully boring when we get back and become reminiscent.
Best love to Dorothy & everybody else.
Best luck to Keith
Yours affectionately
CR Lucas
