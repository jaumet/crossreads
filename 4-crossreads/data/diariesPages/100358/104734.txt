French Arabic English. We are always greeted with "Sieda Australia, mafish faloose? (Good day Australia, money finished?) They understand exactly what we mean by imshee! and the like. There's no doubt that everywhere the Anzacs have been they will be remembered. London is just the same. This wretched Arabic + French + dinkum Australian, was the lingo there.
Its funny to see the Peasant women going out after pine needles and fire wood every day, with great mats like carpenters bags, over their shoulders. All the kiddies go to work at a very young age here, and they are all hard seeds too. Man seems to take a very back seat in this town. From what I can see he is the second boss of the house, and is told when where he can have his beer, and cant imitate a machine gun when he's talking nearly so well as his wife. Of course it isn't fair to compare these places from impressions gathered at wartime. Being a sea side town, the streets are in total darkness at night, and, as we only get out at dusk, we cant claim to see anything but the inside life of the place. But they could do with a shaking up.
Paris-plage is about four miles down the coast from Etaples-s-mer. It is one of the watering places of France, and is a noted gay spot. Just at present it is as dead as the Marmelukes tombs of Cairo. But, here too, it is due to the war. There are no lights in the streets at all, just what may escape from a few shop windows. The beach is rather good, and no doubt in the summer time, its some spot. There are some splendid eating houses here, and altogether it looks a bit more like modern civilisation than does the other town.
Well, its 3 pm, and the Scotties are gathering for a game of soccer, so, as I'm dead cold, I think I'll just wander down watch. I like these Scots. Theres some go in Jock.
