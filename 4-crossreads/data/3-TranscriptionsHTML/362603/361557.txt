<p>Bulford<br/>5/12/17<br/>Dear Mum,<br/>It is now Wednesday &amp; I am only answering Your letters now.  Ellis has gone to Salisbury &amp; I am on Duty.  But My fatigue Party are cutting up the Suet for X'mas pudding &amp; I have not to stand over them.  I'll go &amp; see whether it is finished &amp; that's all I have to do.  I've pulled the Big arm chair up to the Fire &amp; now I'll try &amp; answer a lot of My letters.  I received 20 odd last week.  I am so glad that Cyril has been out to see You.  We had a bonny day in London to-gether.  I have written a couple of letters lately to Mrs Stephen.  I reckon Her as one of my Best of Friends.  I received Your X'mas parcel O.K. to-day.  Everything is choice &amp; good.  The parcel was a bit battered &amp; the nuts &amp; the sugar were a bit mixed but I soon sorted that out.  I am sorry to hear about poor old Mrs Bowden.  I did not know anything about it.  I am not playing Lacrosse or Football over here.  I am taking on Hockey this year.  It is a nice gentle game &amp; we have a lovely ground right alongside the Hospital.  Ellis may play too.<br/>We don't worry if the mail is late.  We are lucky to get any letters the way things are going.<br/>I've been called away on another Job since I wrote the above.  I have had a shave &amp; cleaned my Boots in the meantime as well.  It is a bit too cold to shave in the morning.  One can do it alright but "it is nice to get up in the mornin', but it's nicer to stay in bed"   I can have one extra &frac14; of an Hour</p>
