<p>No more "dinkum <strike>oh</strike> oil" yet.  It is absolutely ridiculous, the way we are being fooled about here.<br/>Even now all the men have not got their equipment yet, &amp; they are supposed to have that before embarking.<br/>Inoculated 100 against <strike>Cl</strike> Cholera this afternoon.<br/>Since coming here there have been about 800 inoculations.  I had a second dose of Paratyphoid myself &amp; <strike>Chlor</strike> &amp; Cholera.</p>
