 I then went around for drugs and got them, that finished I started to enjoy my short holiday in this pretty town, but such was not to be, as I became ill and at three I had such a raging fever I had to go to bed at an hotel, I shivered so much that I got up and went down to the lake and got into the water still shivering. This did me good, then a good dose of Quinine pulled me to-gether, it spoiled my holiday for after a sleepless night I caught the next train in the morning to Serapeum. 
 Monday 30th 
 Arrived Serapeum about mid-day in awful heat, got right as far as rail head where had to wait until five for ration waggons, arrived back at camp. Dr awfully pleased with my success. 
 Found 12 letters awaiting me, went to bed tired but happy. 
 Tuesday 1st Aug Saddled the mare before breaky and rode to rail head then train to the Canal where I had an enjoyable swim. Then met the hospital boat and took off my goods, I had to leave them and arrange for transport to the light railway, it was Hell, trying to make these thick headed English Yokels understand. I eventually persuaded a band of niggers to do the work, the Arabic is a blessing, after much cursing and swearing I arrived home after over 20 loads and unloads. The mare is in splendid condition. 
 Wednesday 2nd 
 Opened up all my stuff, Dr delighted. I furnished my hosp complete, it looms lovely, everything from toothbrushes to books, I am proud of it, then I put the day in dispensary, dispensed 30lbs prescripts.
