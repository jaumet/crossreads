<p>25.7.15<br/>Sunday 25th.  Nothing during the night &amp; did not have to stand to arms till 3 o'clock this morning, today has been a good deal hotter than usual, a good many splinters of our own shells fly back into this gully from own shells, no-one has been hit but they drop mighty close after every shell is fired.  I do not think there is enough force in them to put a man out of action for long.  The Turks appear to be using a new powerful mortar for throwing bombs &amp; it seems to be a success.</p>
<p>26.7.15<br/>Mon. 26th.  As soon as we were dismissed from standing to arms this morning Charlie Burke &amp; I went to the beach to see if we could buy any groceries from the sailors, all we could get was milk &#64; 1/6 per tin, we sig's now have 10 tins on hand;  we had a swim before returning &amp; relieved the Sigs on N.T. Phone at the outpost at 12 oclock.  The 2nd L.H. who were brought up as reserves have been taking a turn on the 'phone so we only strike a shift every 6 days.</p>
