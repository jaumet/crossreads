Mon. Aug. 13. M.O. marked me for Base. Spent afternoon in Y.M. Played few games Ping-Pong. Raining again. Fell in at 5 & marched over to Collecting Camp. 16 of us in a Bell Tent. Only one blanket – no boards on ground. Had very little sleep.

Tues. Aug. 14. Reveille at 6. Woke up feeling pretty rotten. Discovered had a lovely cold, owing to sleeping on damp ground. Breakfast 6.30 Small piece cold Bacon & 1 slice Bread per man. This is the Life. Went over to Con. Camp. Spent day there & had dinner & tea there also. Once went over to Base Camp. Attended Concert in Y.M. Hut. Pretty good. Pouring rain again good thing for cold, sleeping on wet ground.
