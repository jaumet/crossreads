<p>"We need examples of people who, leaving Heaven to decide, whether they are to rise in the world, decide for themselves that they well be <u>happy</u> in it, &amp; have resolved to seek &ndash; not greater wealth, but simpler pleasure;  not higher fortune, but deeper felicity;  making the first of possessions, self-possession;  &amp; honouring themselves in the harmless pride &amp; calm pursuits of peace."   "Unto this Last."  p 191</p>
