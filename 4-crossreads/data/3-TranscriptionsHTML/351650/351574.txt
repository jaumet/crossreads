<p>and push one expects from the British Empire.</p>
<p>However, enough of soliloquy for today or my head will bust.</p>
<p>We are still sitting in the mud to the everlasting rotten sound of firing, but its not too bad &ndash; and I've just had a few days off and lived in Amiens town, and there is every chance of us getting relieved shortly, say in a fortnight.</p>
<p>I think I told you in a previous letter we had had the luck to be detailed as training battery to an Army School.</p>
<p>Well that fell through, &amp; we were immediately pushed back into the big battle, now dying down but still rather uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Personally I'm fit &amp; well, except one's feet get bad so easily.</p>
<p>After those cheery letters you wrote me about your voyage, I feel heaps better, &amp; could write you all sorts of nice things.  So just please think of all the nice things I could have written, and imagine that's what I'm thinking about you now.</p>
<p>But out of pure cussedness, I won't put them down in writing &ndash; you always said my cussedness was a sign of a weak nature;  and I'm quite sure you hit the nail on the head, for my ideals about myself have been sorely busted during the last 15 months.</p>
<p>My hats now are far too big.</p>
<p>Well goodbye Mrs. John, &amp; best of wishes to you all.  Tell John, to give my love to old Frank if he sees him.  I've got an Australasian picture of the Carrathool sheep sale last October, and saw a quartette including Neilson, John, my brother Tom and Ralph Falkiner:  and of old Frank selling &ndash; how I should have liked to have been there, and in your last letter you mention giving a dinner feast of turkey etc., etc., for me at Toganmain when I return without having a lot of women there.  Now that's being an angel, &amp; I shall not forget to make you keep the promise.  Best luck,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>John Chute Ellis</p>
