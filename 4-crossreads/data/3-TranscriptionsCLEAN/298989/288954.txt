  
 15/1/16 whittling down wood. Another turner working alongside. A sawing machine tracing out intricate designs and a man engaged in inlay work fitting each tiny bit into its place after much filing and scraping. Others lacquering and polishing and an artist drawing designs. 
 Then along the street to the brass bazaar passing the tailors with their eyes glued to their task. How dreadfully prevalent eye trouble is nearly every second one is affected. One military tailor busy with gold braid and with a stock of court swords. In the brass shop bought an incense burner and there watched the brass workers. Whole families engaged in the work their hammers tap tapping on the little chisels quite automatically the children working over the designs already traced out by the craftsmen the articles set in cobblers wax to prevent their bending. 
 Returned along the same street gay with signs & traders plenty of notices of sage femme & medecins treaters of skin diseases. Came back past the lawyers booths and past Steins stores said to be run by a German firm. Through the Ezbekieh gardens looking delightful to the street again. In front of the Shepheards shops met Tulloch Forman & Hennessey. In Mousky trader wanted to sell me erotic cigarettes for marriage use.
