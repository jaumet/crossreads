<p>[Card]<br/>From Lance Corporal T. Taylor<br/>Australian Expeditionary Forces,<br/>On Active Service Abroad,<br/>To<br/>My Dear Mother<br/>With Best Love</p>
<p>For the sake of those I dearly love,<br/>And in the cause of Liberty,<br/>I've left my southern sunny home,<br/>And crossed the wide and trackless sea.</p>
<p>Heaven guard and bless you, dearest one,<br/>Whilst I in foreign hands may roam;<br/>Though I am absent in the flesh,<br/>My tenderest thoughts are of my home.</p>
<p>Good luck to you whilst I'm away;<br/>I know the parting cost you pain;<br/>My earnest prayer from day to day is<br/>God be with you till we meet again.</p>
