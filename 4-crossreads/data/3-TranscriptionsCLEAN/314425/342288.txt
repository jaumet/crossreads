We left the hospital in motor cars driven by W.A.C. girls. All sent as stretcher cases. It was 2 p.m. when we left the hospital for the train but it was 4 when the train started. We travelled all night and had tea supper and breakfast in the train. We were in bed all the time and had a fairly comfortable trip. There are 4 patients in each compartment one on each seat and a stretcher above.We are to go to Le Havre. We had a good many stoppages on the way but it did not seem long for I went to sleep.
Before we got to our destination the train stopped on the line for several hours.
Friday Nov 8 1918. 1557.A fine morning. It is 9 a.m. now and we are still in the train waiting on the line.We spent most of the day waiting in the train. It was after 4 o'clock before we got on board the Red Cross boat. We had nice soft beds to go to. The beds consisted of mattresses spread close together between decks and we were packed together like sardines with one white blanket each.
