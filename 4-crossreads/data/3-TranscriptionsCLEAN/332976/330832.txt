  
 April 1917 2nd continued   The weather has been bitterly cold all day & at about 4 P.M. we had a very heavy fall of snow which lasted about an hour & a half, & with a strong wind, almost a gale, blowing all day, things have been rather miserable. At about 3 AM this morning the anti-aircraft guns near here were firing at some of Fritz's planes & again at about 8 a.m. when seven of them came over.   No damage was done & they were driven off. I received orders to-night to return to the company with the party to-morrow morning.
