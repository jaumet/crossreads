<p>Last Friday I motored to France to shop.  The country looked beautiful all the crops are green.   And the trees and flowers were lovely.   We drove for about twenty miles along the banks of a canal.    I did enjoy it, Great beds of poppies and buttercups, all nodding their pretty heads to us.   I insisted on the driver pulling up and picking some on the way home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are billeted in beautiful German Villas here</p>
