3 4 5th Dec  We are in the trenches.  The march down we passed rows of houses with the contents turned upside down evidently the work of Germans, who according to all accounts did a lot of pillaging.Some of the houses look as if the rats had been at them.                     We are supplied with Gumboots and whale oil to rub our feet with to prevent trench feet.    We, the stretcher bearers are told off 4 to each company and are allotted 2 dugouts in which we can stay until the call for SB's comes.  We are right up in the front line immediately
