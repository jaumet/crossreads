<p>The Zeps have been very busy around here lately. I suppose you have read all about the two being brought down last Sunday morning. Some of our battalion who were on leave brought home fragments of shrapnel which they dug out of the pavements, and one of the Head Qtrs staff Pte. Smith, the Opossum King, returned with a bullet wound through the hand. The shrapnel must have come from our own anti-aircraft guns. I am forwarding the "Sketch" giving some pictures of the fallen monsters. On looking for this paper I find it has been used to wrap up lunch. Anyhow I suppose you have the same pictures appearing in the Sydney papers. I don't think any of the papers here come up to the Australian Papers, even the "Times" is behind our "Sydney M. Herald" or "Telegraph" and "Punch" can't compare with the Bulletin.<br/>I must close now as we have just received word to move to another camp to leave room for some fresh troops.<br/>With best love to all at home &amp; next door<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene</p>
<p>No. 1515 Pte. Eugene Sullivan,<br/>A.M.C. Detail<br/>33 Btn. 9th. Brigade,<br/>A.I.F. On Active Service<br/>Abroad.</p>
