<p>uninteresting afternoon. At Church Parade this morning. Our Pierrot Concert on Friday night was a great success. The Concert last night by a Salisbury party was very poor.</p>
<p>I obtained Leave to visit Birmingham on Monday to see Reg &amp; London on Tuesday to see Lex; but the C.O. this afternoon asked me to conduct Leave Draft to London tomorrow instead. Gladly accepted as I get 4 days instead of two.</p>
<p>We leave camp tomorrow at 6.30am - Major Harris &amp; myself with about 200 new reinforcements on their 4 days&#39; leave. I shall visit Reg in Birmingham on Tuesday. I must travel &amp; have 4 days&#39; leave on &pound;6. Cheerio!</p>
