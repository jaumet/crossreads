<p>The ward 2nd next door to us is occupied by a military lieutenant (Hun, of course.)</p>
<p>He gives us fags etc. &amp; we give him tea in exchange.</p>
<p>A decent sort, he sent home for all his old school-books on English which he gave me in order to practice up my German.</p>
<p>But he is addicted to Uniform.   Dinkum; I met him down near the Verbandzimmer the other morning wrapped in a gorgeous flame-coloured dressing-gown, and under The Garment he had on his uniform!</p>
<p>23rd Mch.<br/>Der Leutnant tells us amazing tales of a huge German offensive which began yesterday.</p>
<p>The Allies, so he says, are running like sheep and the war will be over in 3 months.   Of course we laughed at the news while Der Leut. was in the room, but things <u>do</u> look glum!</p>
