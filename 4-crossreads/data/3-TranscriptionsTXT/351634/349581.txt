 February 1915 (Thursday 11th) Left Liverpool camp at 9.30 AM and entrained for Sydney arriving at Central station at 10.30. Marched down Elizabeth St to Liverpool St thence to Wooloomooloo and embarked on board of Troopship Seang Bee (A48) at 11.30 AM. Met and said good bye to Kathy and Mum.

Not many down to their meals sea astern but still rough. Am going to turn in good night. Course north get to Brisbane tomorrow.

There is not much to see from here as we are a few miles from Brisbane. 10 AM One trainload of Troops arrived and came on board. They were the 2nd reinforcements for 9th and 15th Battalions. Shortly after another lot came and went aboard the Choon Sha arrived about two hours later than we did. A lot of the boys got drunk and the pickets went to fetch them. I think we would have got a night there only for them drinking. Anyway we left there at 6 pm amid cheering and whistles blowing.
