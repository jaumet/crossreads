  
 February, 1917. 1st in Lent. Quadragesima. Sunday 25 Foggy in morning sunny late afternoon. Usual routine till 11. when Brigadier of 3rd Bde told us to go home as Fritz had retreated 2000 yds & probably 18 miles eventually. Brigade moved up closer during day. One man of 9th told us patrols were over 4 lines of trenches towards Bapaume. He shelled obviously from that way at long range. Home at 12 and had a good bath. Altercation with Dave in morning and S.M. told me to go pipe pushing to-morrow at 9.30 for 3 days school. Welcome change. Feeling rather unwell with diarrhoea. Infantry moving up closer.
