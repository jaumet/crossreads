The idea is that, having the Transport experience by me, I can learn the supply part &amp; thus have both at my finger tips, He stated that he knew I had been overworked lately &amp; this would be a good chance of a little rest as there is not as much worry &amp; work in the last mentioned duty. He further stated that he could promise me, that it would not be long before I got my Star &amp; that I had the CO Trans influence behind me. All these facts together with the certain knowledge that I need rest has decided the course of action which I intend to take &amp; hope for the results to mature at an early date.</p>
