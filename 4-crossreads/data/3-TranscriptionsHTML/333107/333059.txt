<p>Wed July 11<br/>The Lecture on "The Magneto" was continued this morning.</p>
<p>Went into Town after Tea with "Perce". It came on to rain, so we took shelter in a Bathing Tent. About 10 we looked into "Arcadia" where the usual Wed. night dance was on and I had the last waltz before going back to Camp.</p>
<p>Thur July 11th<br/><u>Many happy returns B.E.</u> Hope to the Lord I'm Home before her next.</p>
<p>The School Lecture was on Electricity Accumulators, etc. Dave and I and a couple of others are putting an engine together. It's very interesting but we waste a lot of time looking for the different parts. We fixed an oil engine to our car, so as to see the working of the Gears.</p>
<p><u>Wrote Letter No 30 to B.E.</u></p>
<p>Fri July 12<br/>Lecture on Clutch and Gear Box. I take down copious notes on the Lectures, but I'm hanged if I can understand what I've written at times.</p>
<p>It is raining beautifully, and the Farmers are smiling once more. I did not go into Town after Tea, but stayed in Camp and looked over my gear. It's a week today since I had that yarn with O.P. and I'm beginning to wonder if anything will come of it.</p>
<p>Sat July 13<br/>Lecture on Springs, Tyres, etc.</p>
<p>After Tea I went into Town but things were rather quiet. I've seen scores of chaps here that I know.</p>
