<p>When we come in we see a list up of all our names &amp; of how we are to appear in England.  Matron adds that if anyone can't appear in proper uniform that they'll be put in a party of their own.</p>
<p>Yes, our stay in Egypt is drawing to a close.  The date for leaving fixed for the 22nd &amp; we go by the "Karoola".  No 14th A.G.H. are taking our place here.  We have got it all so nice for them to step in to.</p>
<p>A party of 10 of us rose at 4.30 this a.m. &amp; went on donks to the Mokattam hills to watch the sunrise.  It was beautiful.</p>
<p>Matron wanted us all to be photographed this afternoon &amp; I have just come in from that trying ordeal.  A few weeks back I was keen on having a proper photo taken of myself in the uniform.  Thought of sending some of you one for Xmas.  I got as far as making an appointment paying a deposit &amp; putting my cap on.  I gave a final look in the mirror &amp; the photographer was all ready &amp; came away.  Twas an <u>off</u> day I looked what I felt &ndash; old &ndash; and have never had the courage to go again.  Ma [indecipherable] photo.</p>
<p>Now I want to introduce Miss McConachy to you and a few of many that words could never tell what they have done for the Australian Mothers &amp; their Soldier Sons.  Some day I may be able to tell of some of their goodness &ndash; these are their names, Rev &amp; Mrs Gillan, Lady Rogers &amp; Chetham &ndash; Mr &amp; Mrs &amp; Miss Gentles, Miss Ghryoeb &amp; Miss McConachy &ndash;</p>
