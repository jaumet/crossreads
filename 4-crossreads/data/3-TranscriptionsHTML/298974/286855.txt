<p>3<br/>One of the chaps near me, but he was absolutely done, and, altho' I banged him with a shovel, he only grunted. So when the officer came up he saw that we were at the end of our tether, &amp; ordered us back to the post. Here, taking our turn at observation still, we sat on the floor of the trench amid the snow, &amp; awaited dawn. It was just about as much as we could stand, &amp; my word we were lucky that the hun didn't come over that night. But now this trench is miles behind our front line! Well, I'm feeling more fit to go "in" this time than ever before, &amp; you bet I'll be alright &amp; look after myself. I have been in the middle of quite a number of Fitz's heaviest barrages, &amp; have been amongst the lucky, so I suppose I'll do it again. Of course narrow squeaks put the wind up a bit, but one gets horribly used to the ping of lead on the helmet or showers of mud &amp; dirt coming down.</p>
