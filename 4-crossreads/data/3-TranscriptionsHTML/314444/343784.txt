<p>a howitzer shell coughed its way overhead and a battle-plane circled slowly in the clouds, like a huge bird of prey &ndash; watching and waiting!</p>
<p>We will go back again now to the train and to the Rhone Valley. Two very interested men gazed out on emerald green fields, vinyards gardens and orchards &ndash; on old grey castles and towns reposing peacefully on the banks of the river &ndash; on a mountain capped with snow which stood majestically over all, and this thought went through the minds of both &ndash; "France is indeed a country a man would gladly die to save" &ndash; and I am sure that every Australian soldier now in France is fighting with even greater bravery and vigour than he did at Anzac, which made him world famous.</p>
<p>Yours Very Sincerely &ndash; Warren.</p>
