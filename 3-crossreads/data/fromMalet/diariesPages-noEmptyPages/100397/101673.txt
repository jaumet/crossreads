When the parcel comes along I will send on the packet to Elsie, I had a Card from her today She has been staying with one of her Aunts for a holiday, and says She had a ripping time, Harold has been home on leave and Mrs H. Says the war has not altered him a bit yet. They were dissappointed because my leave was so far off but it cant be helped, it will come round someday but I would have liked to visit Blighty while the weather was good, I had quite enough of it during the dull days in 16 and dont want to go on leave in that sort of weather, Had a letter from Tom Kennett a couple of days ago. he left "Blue Nobbys" sometime ago and has not been on the Station for a good while so could not tell me how Bonny was. he mentioned some of the boys from that way. Three of them had returned from this side all wounded, and two or three others have been killed in action, I have met very few fellows from the North N. West over here, I fancy most of them are in another Div ?
