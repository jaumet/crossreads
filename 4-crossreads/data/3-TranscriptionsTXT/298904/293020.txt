thousands of brave men were killed & where good colonial blood was simply poured out " all for nothing" except a name which should make every Australian feel proud of his country, & a name which will never die, for never I should think did men fight more bravely, stubbornly, amp; in such a self-sacrificing spirit as out boys did there, & against a stubborn enemy who fought well & fairly, & we also had to fight against natural difficulties which were far worse than the Turks themselves. We felt like cowards sneaking away at dead of night with bags round our feet
