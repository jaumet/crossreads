<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>I knew when I was sending off last week&#39;s letter to Lockhart that I would not have much to add to it for you, and much less time to do&nbsp;it on the Sunday. &nbsp;And so it turned out for we were away at Railhead by 8 am for the busiest morning we&#39;ve had on the job. &nbsp;But we got through it quite well, notwithstanding that our boss left that morning for his leave in Italy. &nbsp;We were already packed up, and after dinner set out on a long journey away back. &nbsp;It was 9 o&#39;clock when we got to our destination, and we had to hang around to get a place to pitch a camp. &nbsp;It was well after 1 o&#39;clock before we were fixed up for the night. &nbsp;Well, isn&#39;t the news good. &nbsp;It looks as if the war is pretty nearly on its last legs and we should be able to have our own way.</p>
<p>I have just received Lock&#39;s latest&nbsp;</p>
