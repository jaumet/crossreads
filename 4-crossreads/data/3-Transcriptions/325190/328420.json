<p>this morning &amp; there is a distinct chance of my getting on it.  Otherwise it will mean the board &amp; C class.</p>
<p>Did a turn as mess orderly this morning, &amp; yesterday was on Y.M.C.A. fatigue.  Both afternoons read &amp; slept with a liverish result.  Had very little exercise lately.  Don't care a brass fender.<br/>Wrote Rita a doubting letter a week ago, which may have the effect of causing unhappiness &amp; even a rupture.  I suppose it is poor justification to plead that the thoughts expressed were such as have been worrying me for some considerable time.<br/>Curiously enough, despite the fact that I fear incompatibility</p>
