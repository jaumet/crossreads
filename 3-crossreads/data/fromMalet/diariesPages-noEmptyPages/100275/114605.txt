Tonight I am Corporal of the picquet, we have to patrol the streets with a body of men, see that order is kept.
The Australians have adopted a movement of their own in the new bayonet fighting, it has been so successful, that it is being taught by all the Instructors in France be they British or Canadian it is called the "Australian Punch" is the finishing movement after you have engaged missed your man in the thrust, it is done with the butt is very effective the boys are fine with the bayonet I reckon we do that part of our drill best of all
