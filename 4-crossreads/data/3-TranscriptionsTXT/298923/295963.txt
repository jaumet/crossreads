 24 October 1918 Thursday Cairo Not much to write you now as I sent you a long letter re Dolly going Home &amp; my arrival I hope early in the New Year but one can never be sure in the Army what is going to happen. Had afternoon tea with Stewart Brown who was at Mrs Batemans with me in Warrnambool how many years ago.
