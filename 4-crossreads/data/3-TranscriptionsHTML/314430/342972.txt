<p>October 8th :- In bed at the Devonport Military Hospital. Am in "D Upper" ward, which is in charge of Sister G.M. Wylie. This being one of the old established military Hospitals, everything is carried out in regimental style, even to the making of our beds.</p>
<p>October 11th :- A lady representing the Red Cross Society (Australian Section,) came to my bedside today, and gave me a hair brush, a comb, soap, toothbrush, shaving brush <strike>and</strike> Australian newspapers, and cigarettes. She told me the principle of the Australian Red Cross Society was "wherever there is <strike>an</strike> a wounded or sick Australian soldier we must find him, and give him something". As far as my experience goes, that principle, I can say, was always enforced to its practical limit.</p>
<p>October 21st  :- Still in bed. Near to mine is that of Sergeant H.C. Hull of the 107th American Infantry. He is a decidedly interesting chap, and has seen active service in Mexico. In civil life he is a cartoonist, and a contributor to the American "Life". We had many <strike>intere</strike> long yarns about the Press, literary and pictorial. Between us, we had designed a series of articles* entitled "Should we show the Huns Mercy?" Subjects, such as German Machine Gunners (as we knew the facts) camouflaging themselves with Red Cross Brassards, were to be treated; I was to write; he was to illustrate. The joint production was to be sent to New York</p>
<p>* Changes in the hospital, and other inconveniences, prevented the execution of our <strike>intentions</strike> designs.</p>
