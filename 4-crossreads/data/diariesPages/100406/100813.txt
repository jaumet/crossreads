19-4, Saturday (Primrose Day)
Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament Commons and Lords. The Roof of the Abbey, especially Edward VII Chapel, is very lovely better than that of the Chapel at Windsor Castle. We passed the Statue of Lord Robert Disraeli which was decorated with primroses by the Primrose League. I was introduced to John Burns the one time Radical. He lectured to us in the Chapter of the Abbey. After he had warmed up to his subject he spoke like a cockney misplacing his H's and speaking through his nose. He is very severe on anyone who does not pay attention to what he is saying. By the way, the outstanding feature of the Abbey design is variety. In the afternoon I was watching the people in the back streets dancing to the mechanical Organs, they were mostly full or should I say intoxicated. I put in the rest of the afternoon at Hampstead Heath and after tea took on a Picture Show.
20-4, Easter Sunday
Concert at Royal Albert Hall in the afternoon, Albert Victoria Memorial walk through Regents Park. Met Jack McMahon, he is on 27 Quota, looks well. Concert at War Chest in Evening. (Not much good.)
Easter Monday, 21-4
Visited St. Pauls Cathedral in the afternoon taking in the Crypt, Whispering Gallery, and Stone
