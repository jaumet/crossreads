<p>It is grand the way people write to me and I get more letters than anybody else in the troop and they ought to come more regularly now that I have got to the regt. What a splendid winter you seem to be having; hope you get more rain as the weather gets warmer to keep the wheat growing &ndash; wish I could be home to harvest it still we all hope to be back to sow it again next year.<br/>Was the Ford much trouble to start in the winter? I have heard that Fords take a bit of winding in frosty weather but it ought to be warm again by now. It would be a nice change to see some rain again the last time I saw it was some where in the Indian Ocean I think.<br/>How are the rabbits in the Lease; I suppose they have come on a bit with the green feed; we will have to fix them up for good and all when the war is finished. There is a tremendous dew here at night now; however we all sleep out side and it does not hurt us as we are allowed to spread our blankets out to dry; there is none of that foolry here they had at Liverpool. Here pretty well all you have got to do is to look after yourself &amp; your horse to  <strike>their</strike> the best extent.

Love to Mother; will write to her in a couple of days. Don't work too hard Father but spend your time rolling about in your carriage now you have got one. Have you built a garrage yet?<br/>I am<br/>Your loving son<br/>Robert C Wilson</p>
