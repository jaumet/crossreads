April 1915Saturday 10Weather still dullLots of chaps have been ashore. They say that the Hospital tents are very full. Nearly all the patients have pneumonia they say. The town or village has a few shops but looks like a "has-been". The women all wear shawls. The price of all things being judged by the price of beer, they say that beer is 3 piastres per bottle. Many French soldiers are here. They have a long thin, three cornered bayonet & a long rifle.

Cold Southerly blowing. Had a church parade forrard. The Dean of Sydney (Dean Talbot) preached at the C. of E parade ground. Rained heavily last night. Some of our chaps went for a row round the various troopships. Weather fine.
