<p>in a few cooees to make weight. The Australian transports "Port Sydney" and "Marathon" and the N.Z.T. "Turakina" then passed in. They looked very fine as they steamed slowly by us, with the troops all over them. We sighted a Japanese Cruiser at anchor when we arrived, also the Australian Transport "Suffolk" awaiting our arrival. And so the February and March Reinforcements from Australia and N. Zealand came to anchor at the end of the first lap of their fifteen thousand miles voyage, to right a wrong and chastise a bully. The "Shropshire " is now anchored about three miles from the Port of Freemantle. The weather is quite warm, and the Indian Ocean as calm as a mill pond. Today we saw the first sunset since leaving Melbourne. The sun sets in the ocean here, and it was beautiful sight as we stood at the rails and watched "The sunset turn the ocean's blue to gold". As the sun dipped below the horizon the trumpeters sounded the "Retreat". All hands faced aft and remained at "attention" until the last note rang out. A silent tribute to the men of Australia who have paid the full price in upholding their country's honour. The boys are quite happy now, and are singing songs as "Monterey"  "I Never Knew" "Coming Home" "The roses that made me remember", etc. They have a piano out on deck, and are all in high spirits. Seasickness and other unpleasant things are all forgotten. We may enter the harbour tomorrow, and if so, I will post this ashore in the Post Office. If we are not granted leave, I will keep it until</p>
