<p>23.12.15<br/>Thurs 23rd<br/>Put in a very quiet time today on board had rifle examination this morning; We have only eleven men to each table &amp; the food gives no cause for complaints, I am in charge of this mess table also of B troop on parades  but have very little to do &amp; are having a little holiday; The Colonel told us at dinner time to-day that we would soon be fighting again &amp; the sooner we are at it the better as I would much sooner be at the front than being messed about 'falling in' every few minutes for some parade or other; I commenced to write home to-day but gave it up as a bad job as we were told that no letters are allowed out of Egypt for 6 weeks;  It is a grand sight here the harbor is filled with boats of every description from motor launches to Dreadnoughts, we passed close by one of our submarines when coming in from Gallipoli</p>
