<p><u>Feby 8th to 27th.</u> Quiet period. Company working some distance from Camp building pill box. Still unable to walk to work so am kept on light duties indefinitely. Its no use parading sick. As likely as not would be marked duty<br/>This would not worry me in the least, and as sergeant and corporals are expected to see every man home from toil its not likely they are going to be pested with me. Prefer field work every time, but as I am unable to get backward and forwards will content myself with whatever is offering in the shape of light duties. The total absence of bombing raids and no shelling make our habitation safe. Though we are in close proximity to line near an important road-way, close to light railway junctions and adjacent to large motor lorry parks yet we are left alone. The name of the camp is Lindenhock.<br/>A road running from our side, through no man's lands and into country held by Fritz is seldom shelled. Compare this quietude to a few months ago What does it all mean. When will these peaceful valleys and shell shattered ridges become vetiol.</p>
