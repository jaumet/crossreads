<p>June 14th. Thurs.<br/>Very busy day in the O.T.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit crook with Diarrhoea &amp; 'Flue.</p>
<p>June 15th. Fri 17th. Sun.<br/>Been very quite lately</p>
<p>June 18th. Mon.<br/>Very busy to-day.</p>
<p>June 19th. Tues.<br/>Awoke early this morning. Five Taubes came over at five o'clock. Our Anti Air craft guns got on to them and sent them flying in all directions. Our triplanes went up after them and soon they were all lost to sight.</p>
<p>Chick, W, and myself went for a walk round some of the outlying village</p>
<p>June 22nd Fri.<br/>Pretty busy, a number of very bad cases brought in to-day.</p>
<p>June 23rd. Sat.<br/>Three of our Observation balloons were brought down by a German Aviator with his machine gun. A lucky bag for him.</p>
<p>June 24 Sun.<br/>Two Taubes were brought down by our planes one at 4.45a.m and one at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>The latter looked a mere speck in the sky, and was flying rapidly away from our Anti Air craft shells. Suddenly it seemed to stop and fell just like a feather falling from the sky till it reached a few hundred feet from the ground. One expected every minute to hear the machine crash to the ground but it suddenly righted itself again and fell</p>
