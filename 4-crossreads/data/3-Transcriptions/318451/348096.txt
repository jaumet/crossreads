<p>Thursday Mch. 22<br/>Today is the anniversary of my wedding day, six years married.  4 months today since we arrived in France.<br/>It was snowing heavily today but when it cleared the snow melted quickly.  The German retreat still continues though a little more slowly on the British front, but rapidly on the French.  Had lunch with A Coys officers.  Crackenthorp, the great Chess player who is with the 36, came in this evening &amp; we had a few games.  Of course he won but I was not altogether discredited.</p>
<p>Friday 23<br/>Weather fine but cold.  Have not been far today.  Made arrangements for Church Parade for Tomorrow.</p>
