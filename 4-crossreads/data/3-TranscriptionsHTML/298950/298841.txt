<p>Mail dated February 9th 1916.<br/>Statements made by Camp Comandant of the German Consentration Camp Colonel R.S. Sands during a enquiry made some months ago, before Mr. Justice Rich, into complaints made about the Camp in general :  My duties since have gained addet importance, for I hawe been given charge of the whole of the Pris. of War in Australia.  The ages of the Germanes in Camp rang from 17 years up to 83 yeahrs.  The underground drainage in operation in Camp was payd for out of Canteen proffits.  The drainage is carried away 250 yards underground to a Creek.  There are 20 showers &amp; a hot water shower, wich the Germans hawe errected themselves &amp; for the use of wich they charge 1 penny.  <u>Now comes a deliberate falsehood</u>.  (Some of the Germans hawe to be forced to washe.  I hawe had a staff sergeant Major, holding a certain German, who is in a very high standing in Australia under the shower by the neck, while he washed.  Ther are 45 shelters in Camp, each 115 feet by 9 feet wich occupy 55 Men each.  They are all open on the north east side &amp; get all the sunshine.  The shelters are of my own design, there is no draught &amp; they are warm in Winter &amp; cool in Sumer.)  On Sundays all the bedding &amp; Bunks are taken out &amp; the whole of the shelter scrubbed down like a ships deck.  Each shelter gets thouroughly disinfected every 40 days.  One gets done each day.  The proffits of the Canteen amounting to &pound;2500 a yeahr is applied to securing recreation &amp; comfort for the Pris. &amp; the healt generaly.  When the Germans behawe themselves they get everything possible to make them comfortable.</p>
