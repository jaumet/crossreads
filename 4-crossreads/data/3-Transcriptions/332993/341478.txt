<p>anti air craft artillery took [indecipherable] their billets.<br/>Later in the evening he put over 6 more, the last two falling where we were lined up at the cook house for tea.<br/>The last shell fell within 60 yards of us. There was a scatter and a shower of earth fell over us. Orders were given to remove all horses out of the stables which we did in quick time &amp;amp took them half a mile up the road to another stable.<br/>As we were going up shells were bursting around many of them being shrapnell shells &amp;amp bursting high in the air, one very close to the baloon.  A stream of women &amp;amp children followed us up. We came back for tea leaving a picket with the horses. By this time the schrapnell were bursting short of us falling about Erquingham. He had a balloon up observing his shots. Our big guns are now busy replying and I hear no more of the enemies shells from that direction S. of Armentieres.</p>
<p>Tursday June 12. 1917<br/>(1044) Fine &amp;amp warm to day. There was another terrific bombardment of the enemy by our artillery last night which continued with varying intensity throughout the night. From a point  South of Armentieres Fritz this morning shelled Bailleul with a long range gun; the shells passing right over our stables &amp;amp billets. He is evidently in search of our aerodrome</p>
