<p>of our soldiers graves, at the foot of the small wooden cross that mark them, I&nbsp;have <s>saw</s>&nbsp;seen babes from the neighbouring hamlet depositing wreaths of brilliant flowers o&#39;er the&nbsp;<s>grave</s>&nbsp;mounds of our mighty dead.</p>
<p>&quot;And some these be, which have no memorial;</p>
<p>Who are perished, as though they had never been;</p>
<p>But their righteousness has not been forgotten;</p>
<p>And the glory of their work cannot be blotted out.</p>
<p>Their bodies are buried in peace;</p>
<p>But their name liveth for evermore.&quot;</p>
<p>At fitful intervals the<s>se</s>&nbsp;valiant dead use with their arms &amp; flit through the mists of 1 night, &amp; their voices appeal to their living comrades to press forward to victory. May their voices travel across the distant seas and stir the latest patriotism of their compatriots in Australia, so that they too may be with us to share the glory of 1 final achievement.</p>
