<p>"I saw an Aust Soldier cut a finger off a German airman before the poor fellow was dead. He was really dying at the time.<br/>The digger did this to get a diamond ring<br/>Told me by Roy who is reliable [indecipherable] May 19</p>
<p>Australians burying the dead came across a dead German and a dead Australian. The heads had been blown off each body and there was only one head to be found. They buried the bodies in separate graves and they tossed a coin to settle the question as to which grave should have the head.<br/>The Australians [indecipherable] body won the toss</p>
