Sunday. 6.F.C. left me about 1.am, waking me to tell me so. German shell falling at 5 second to 10 second intervals on every side. C. left blankets and everything and went below to the dug-out. Shortly after I heard order shouted in lines, "Stand to your horses!" No one woke us---we were left to chance. Got dressed and found W.O. and Bdr. McBean letting horses loose. No men about anywhere. Collared three horses and took them towards Aveling Avelny.
German fire over head and to my right. Soon I had to shift---the shells on the right were getting too close. One piece fell within a couple of yards. I moved on a hundred yards and so-for a mile Fritz kept me on the move. Presently beneath a tree I found Jock Cameron; things were quiet there for a while. Presently Fritz opened up with another battery and that shifted us.
At 5.30 am we got back to the lines. Some lazy beggars stayed in a Tommy dug-out all night---never did a hand's turn. The O.C. Wagon Line decided to shift at 8.am. All ready. Then ammunition arrived. I went with it to Pits. Things smashed about a bit, but nothing serious.
Moved to other side of river at 5.pm. Orderly sergeant. Tea? 9.15pm.
Monday, 7.This morning Fritz sent three shells over, one in horse lines, and the other two about five yards from where I was standing. Not much of a burst. (Aeroplanes have been up and they are the cause of our being so constantly hunted out.)
Last night 18th Battery and B.H.Q., who stayed in old quarters, lost 11 horses through shells which Fritz sent over last night. Learnt also today that 106th lost six men at Pits, and 16th and 18th Batteries several, the former's one gun buried. Our own lost nothing, though Fritz's shells close.
We moved still further over today, among old British trenches. Jelling the O.C. Wagon Line, is a fool and the W.O. is likewise. No newspaper for several days.
