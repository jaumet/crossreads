 Lark Hill Camp Salisbury Plains England 
 Sunday 23-7-16 
 Dear Mother, Father &amp; all, We have at last reached England and are once more in camp. 
 We arrived in Devonport on the 18th. and this camp on the 19th. Amesbury is our Rly station &amp; is about 12 miles north of Salisbury. This is a fine place here and the weather excellent. All the fields are covered with wild flowers some of which I am enclosing. The larger ones are observed casually but the smaller ones require a little looking for. 
 This camp is one of many camps scattered all over the plain and I understand there  are  is accommodation for 30,000 troops easily here. All here are Australians and also at 4 or 5 adjacent camps. Conditions here are great, fairly large huts taking 30 men. The food is good. The Govt. supply bacon meat bread tea etc &amp;  each  an allowance is paid into the company
