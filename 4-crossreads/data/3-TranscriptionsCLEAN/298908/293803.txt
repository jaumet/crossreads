16th.  Went down round the town last night for a few hours but getting fed up I soon made tracks for home.The sun has been shining nicely all day but if you are not moving it is very cold & nippy.  After dinner today I went for a stroll out into the country part of here the old fashioned lanes are very beautiful just now with their masses of foliage of all colors.  I took my camera with me but got pulled up just as I was going into the town & advised to keep it out of sight so I decided to take no unecessary risks & struck off into the country.  While wandering down one of the steep little lanes I came across a big party of orphan girls out for a ramble with their mistress.  They looked very pretty in their blue dresses with red edged collars blue hats & hair tied with a red band of ribbon.  I took one little partys photos but I think it was too dull to be a success.
