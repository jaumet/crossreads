6/10/17 Ypres De Kneot Fme
Stood to arms at dawn and awaited counter attack which did not arrive. The morning turned out bright and sunny and extraordinarily quiet not a shot or shell being fired. It was the same on our side. More ammunition coming up I suppose. Went round the camp found them all well but very dirty tired out. Crowds of parties moving round and a few scattered prisoners coming back. This quietness continued all day. Colonels Murphy Ralph of 18 20th respectively came round and arranged relief for tonight. Duggan reported his patrols well forward and no opposition but later events did not confirm any ideas of evacuation. About 7 S.O.S signals went up and terrific barrages of m.g. fire artillery were put down without anything happening. We moved back to Hannebeke Wood. Bogged several times heavy rain conditions miserable especially for the poor men. A couple killed one's head and shoulders blown off cannot identify. Orders now for another attack. I have 200 boys dog tired and miserable. Rest of the day quiet.
