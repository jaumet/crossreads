Sometimes, when times are slack, they cant make enough to pay for the ricksha for days at a stretch. This puts them in debt and close to the Old Wolf. Then even the best of them only last about three years. How they keep up the murderous work that long is a marvel. Fine thing to be white &ndash; eh?<br/>Architecturally  D. is a picture city. No tall buildings. No ugly tenements, even in the native quarter. No plaster statuary or stagnant 'fountains'. All the prominent buildings are designed and grouped with an eye to artistic effect. Also they suit the climate &ndash; wide squares, trees, palms, gardens all about them, wide collonades &amp; balconies: airy, picturesque, useful. The General Post Office, in all but size, beats ours to the wide wide. The Museum Building wins in all but its contents.The Town Hall runs level.But the Palm Court Hotel leaves both Sydney &amp; Melbourne clean out of sight. It's a long, pillared building  three storey , built of white stone and having a wide pillared balconey  round each story on all sides. Each of its three balconies is a garden. The roof is another. About the finest building I have ever seen.</p>
