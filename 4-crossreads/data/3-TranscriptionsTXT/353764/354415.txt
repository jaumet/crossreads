again as I explained before, the various Divisions will probably be sent to different places.There is something very big on as troops have been coming in & going out all day & night.  I think that this year will, in all probability see the end of the war, as the Germans & Austrians are now becoming desperate & the Turks are literally speaking on their last legs, & don't forget, england still has about 1,000,000 fresh troops still concentrated here in Egypt, ready to be sent to any front.It is fairly cold here to-day with a bleak wind blowing
1.3.16 WednesdayTo-day brought news that we have to shift Camp to a place called Luna Park.  But I do not think we go until Friday.Jack called & said he thought they were to go to Tel-el-Kebir to-day, but I am awaiting further news from him.I & a party of 5 Sergeants went into Cairo last night & had a gay time. I was perched up on the Gahree [Gharrie] driving through Cairo, & yelling out Ora-a-laigaley - Sha-me-nack - An-me-nack  etc, & ran right into the Majors car, so I suppose I will hear something about it.  I drove them into every smelly & dark looking spot
