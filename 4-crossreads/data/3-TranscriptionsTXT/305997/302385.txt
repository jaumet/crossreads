 attenuated Divisional Staff, such as ours is, to run a major operation with three Divisions attached to it and no extra help in the way of Staff. 
 The attack was a marvellous performance on the part of raw men, a great number of whom had not been under fire before.  When we were compelled to withdraw from the position we, of course, had to take up a more contracted front which we now hold.  It is, however, a great improvement on the former one, but nothing to what it might have been.  The Turks now look down upon us.  They are heavily entrenched &ndash; they are on the "forehead", so to speak, and we are on the "eyebrows".  If the position could only be reversed things would look considerably brighter. 
 As an instance of what progress was made on the 7th, the Ghurkas actually saw the Dardanelles from the top of the hill and Turks riding in motor cars on the Gallipoli-Mudros road. 
 As a result of these operations the New Zealand Infantry Brigade including the Maoris, is only 1150 strong and the 4th Australian Infantry Brigade 850 strong. 
 By the way, water was our great difficulty here when we first started on this new venture and at one period it threatened to be quite critical, but thanks to a wonderful Australian water diviner, Sapper Kelly of the Australian Engineers, who found us 200,000 gallons a day, we were saved. 
 Our men are wonderful at trench warfare now and their trenches are a lesson to all incoming troops.  Reinforcements should be trained in the use of periscopes, periscopic rifles, the throwing of bombs, trench digging, trench discipline, and trench interior economy.  I should like to see two or three thousand more Maoris here.  They are most excellent workers and the best material we have for working in the trenches and they fight like tigers.  We could do with heaps of them and I should not let their height or size interfere with their qualifications &ndash; concluded the Colonel.
