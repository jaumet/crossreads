<p>10 Sunday<br/>Grey, cold day. Feeling tired, ill &ndash; nourished &amp; miserable because I wanted to work &amp; no warm spot to be had alone. Miss Smith had family party lasting from 3.30 till 9.30. uncomfortable &amp; disgruntled. Oh for a little means to procure peace comfort.</p>
<p>11. Monday<br/>Maroon went at 11. Then people began to celebrate. Came on to rain &amp; people slopped around all wet &amp; draggled. F. Post  rang up &amp; asked me round to celebrate with him but couldn't go as Mr A was muddling off to a conference.</p>
<p>12.Tuesday<br/>Cold grey day. People still celebrating in pubs. Had painful sore throat &amp; weak heart. Went to bed at 3.00 o'clock &amp; slept till 5. Got up &amp; rested &amp; typed a little of "Down Under". Nelson Smith came at 7 also with a cold.</p>
<p>13. Wednesday<br/>Twilight all day. Fog.  Felt myself getting worse. Crawled home typed a little &amp; went to bed. Oh the cruel lack of comfort if one is ill. Cold salad not right sort of food.</p>
