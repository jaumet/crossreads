<p>Duke of Argle, but she did not sail until about 9.45, I obtained a good collection of Belfast Post Cards. It was a fine night and I had a good passage over to Fleetwood, We were held up outside the harbour for 2&frac12; hours waiting for the tide to rise then a long wait in the train on the pier for the mails to be loaded during which time I had some breakfast 3d for a cup of tea, &amp; 4d each for sandwiches. The same extortionate prices were charged on board the steamer.  &ndash; 1/- for a small  bottle of stout &amp; 1/6 for a large glass of whiskey.</p>
<p>The steamer was again crowded, in fact there was not sufficient room for all down below and many stayed upon deck all night including women and civilians. Eventually the train started, but it was near 10 am and we passed through Preston, Wigan a coal mining town, Warenham ? and Crewe we the train stopped for dinner. Then through Rugby &amp; many other town until we came to the terminus at Euston soon after 4.p.m.</p>
