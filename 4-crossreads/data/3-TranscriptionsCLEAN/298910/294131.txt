 Boisterous - Rain & Snowstorms night & day. Squaring up the Camp - The order still to be in readiness. 4th Div - we heard took several Villages. But were repulsed with losses. Had a bit of a sing song at night - one of the Boys found a Mandolin in one of the Villages and as there are many players we have some fairly good music.
