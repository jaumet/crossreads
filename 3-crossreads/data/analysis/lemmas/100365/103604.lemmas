I found them after 4 hour ride quarter on an out of the way farm was allot a barn to sleep in . We are here to rest for 4 day after that I do not know . We have receiv order to shine up all our steel part which in my mind is absolut ridicul . It seem to me that this is all the Tommi are do , while they sleep in villag clean up we have to work clean also . We are situat from 6 to 9 mile from the fire line on the Armentier Lill front , at time the nois of the bombard is terrif . Even now one can hear the dull boom reverber of the big gun . At night time the whole sky is lit up with Star Shell , while one can smell the Gunpowd for mile . Where we are quarter the Uhlan were billet in 1914 , along the main Road where I had to proceed one can see sign of battl all along .

You even have to go to bed with everyth cover with mud . A number of our waggon went into Belgium today on a job in the direct of Ypres . I went over the boundari line but came back again . Everywher in this vicin one can see trace of the furious fight that took place earlier in the year the inhabit of the villag all have their own special tale of woe .

We are now camp about 2 mile in rear of the trench at time our posit is under shell fire . Just in front of us is a big gun batteri I am wonder how it is possibl to get to sleep with the nois it creat . The whole ground seem to vibrat .

It has been rumour that we are go North again , but I do not think so as they seem to have plenti of Troop down there .

There was an intermitt bombard last night but general everyth was quiet on our Sector .

The night was cold there was a veri heavi dew , consequ we all have the symptom of a sever cold . Further news of advanc have come to hand the Russian seem to be again on the War Path . We have lost all our Green Bivouac so have to sleep in the cold . We laid our bunk in the roadway had to get up pretti well everi hour to allow vehicl to pass . Still in Canapl await order . Most of our Compani has now move to Sen Rubempr , Septenvill - 1.8.16 Monday - Most of our waggon move out late last night we are expect to follow up today . Fight of a terrif natur still continu the Aust 2nd Divis are go tooth nail . The 4th is prepar to reliev them now . yesterday there was anoth advanc of a mile on a 6 mile front poor Fritz is now begin to wonder what is up . To show some of the difficulti encount in an advanc . I will quot the descript of 1 captur trench I suppos there are hundr of the same build in this vicin . The Trench was on the outskirt of the villag of Poizeir , ran direct to Ovillier Cootalmaison . It was found to be 90 feet deep and was approach by long zig zag slope . On reach the bottom , there was a big excav a complet Cinematograph show Hospit was built therein . It was approach by massiv iron door which had to be blast in a decent haul of prison were taken . The floor were carpet good furnitur instal . There were unmistak sign of femal have been there as garment recent worn were found on the floor although no femal were taken prison , but undoubt it would be some poor wretch who were forc into their den . The German spent 20 month in perfect this labyrinth of defenc deem it impregn . Howev after be subject to a violent artilleri fire the top was burst into a shambl , but noth below 10 feet was touch . A great idea of the prelud to an Infantri attack is a rather novel idea . To cope with the Barb wire entangl small section of pipe full of cordit is push along the ground under the wire from our trench . When all these are in place the inhabit of our trench lie flat our own Artilleri fire at these pipe . As soon as a shell hit a pipe there is an enorm explos the entangl are blown to piec , as soon as this happen the Artilleri lengthen their fire place what is call a Barrag of Fire on the rear of the German Trench to prevent them bring up arm , ammunit reinforc . As soon as this is done the Infantri advanc take the first trench . This is repeat in each line taken , so you can guess what a slow affair it is , all the same we have the men gun the German , besid be forc out of defenc system that took 20 month to build , are lose veri heavili suffer in their moral . later We receiv order to move up to the front at 3 pm had a lot of work to do to get thing readi . I left the column at Haverna took the Valley path in compani with O.C. it was a veri pretti ride , the track be in place veri steep wind in out of the dens schrub valley mountain . We pass through Naour in which were a lot of The Highland Regiment just in from the advanc posit for a rest . We next came through Talma then on to Septenvill where we are now rest for a while . I am billet in a French Chateau it is a most beauti place , mani acr of nice woodland grass to roam about in . I am a littl puzzl over a letter I receiv today from Mum about sever visitor call say they knew me well . - 2.8.16 Tuesday / Wednesday We are still at Septenvill await fresh order . The Troop are pour through here from rumour it is evid that there is again go to be a heavi bombard which it is hope will smash up the 3rd system of defenc . The weather still hold good thing are work smooth . I hope they have us here for a few day , as not onli are we comfort quarter , but everyon need a rest after the strenuous time we have had recent . Aeroplan veri activ numer have not sight one singl Taub or Fokker of late , which speak for the way the Alli have in down them . The German are again use a vast number of Tearshel , which emit poison fume , but the helmet combat the Gas if prompt fit on when the fume first aris . They will get gas this month I can assur you . 3.8.16 I am now billet in a wealthi Parisian Countri Shoot Lodg which he has thrown open for use I can tell you it is some class . Beauti massiv furnitur bed to say noth of wonder exquisit clock ornament in card room . I am now busi take in Imperial ASC men who were in the retreat from Mon . They are come through from Havr and Ruen . I fanci we are go to evacu the Canadian . Rumour has it that the biggest Bombard of the war is about to open this week judg by last night preliminari one , I am wonder if the world is strong enough to withstand it . The concuss in the air can be felt for mile . Last night the shell were so thick that they were meet one anoth in the air explod . I am expect anoth move from here short what with move look after 360 men I can assur you my time is fulli occupi . The Town of Albert is wonder to look at . There is scarc a brick stand , where onc a big beauti citi was situat . So much for big Gun destruct enemi . 4.8.16 Friday I was awaken this morn by the skirl of Bagpip dress quick I hurri downstair watch the 15th Divis Scottish march into Battl . It was a wondrous sight they were a fine bodi of men all laugh talk as if they did not have a care or troubl . They imped our movement somewhat as all the road were close consequ we could not carri on with our earli morn prepar for work . 5.8.16 Saturday Our Divis of Artilleri take up it posit in the Fire Line tonight consequ we have to move on . I think we are go to Albert are await order now to move . I receiv sever letter today . The news is veri cheeri from the front I believ our chap have again done well , have taken a veri strong ridg outsid Poizeir . The weather still fine inclin to be warm in the middl of the day . The Bombard still continu without respit this morn be particular heavi . A glimps at the maze of gun now in use on the Somm front would astound one , it is a sight that will live in everyon memori as long as life last . The air of a night is just one scream of burst shell all lit up as if by a gigant fire . It is like watch fork lightn in a black cloud onli on a much bigger scale . later I have had a veri excit even have to gallop through Rubempr Talma the surround countri in search of some Canadian who were attach to us for whom a special order came tell us to despatch them to Aucheus Station thenc to Ypres Poperingh in Belgium . One of them be a French Canadian necessit a hous to hous search . I eventu found them all got them off . When leav they held a brief for a Lieut myself total ignor someon who came out special for an ovat . I tell you it hurt him some . - 6.8.16 Sunday - March order came today I am now at the Front , our Divis have replac the 2nd , who have done well . We were circularis by G.O.C. who state that he was sure we would keep our end up as well as the previous Divis . At 2pm we pull out treke through Rubempr , Talma Walloy Sen are now camp between Sen Albert . On the way through Walloy we saw them buri the men who had die in Hospit we felt veri sad . Hundr of rude littl cross mark their last rest place . The road were veri dusti on account of the great amount of traffic over them , necessari to the movement of an Armi . The German gave us a pretti live welcom in the natur of big shell it last all night . We were stand on a high ridg of land watch them burst . They were aim at Albert , part of which they have alreadi destroy it was awe inspir to see a big shell hit a build see it go up in a cloud of dust . We are have a strenuous time veri littl sleep while we are on the front line duti as the other Divis onli did 6 fight day night , I presum we will do likewis move back again , be reliev by the 4th DIV. It is terribl to see the horror ofwhich War has wrought here . All the peopl live in cave , built for them underground when the shell start they all run in off the street . We are work the Tramway in Albert they tri hard to smash it up . We had 2 hors blown to piec last night , but fortun the driver escap . I was up all night receiv despatch transport had suffici light most of the time from star shell burst shrapnel , high explos etc to see what I was do . One could no hear anoth speak at all . Sever of us had a narrow squeak through a shell explod in a fire close by . A bullet go so close as to sting my ear . Close to us the Observat Balloon go up I fanci we are catch a lot of shell meant for them . They are huge thing shape like sausag with a basket hang from them for the observ . As soon as an enemi aeroplan appear he is set on to by British French chase machin if they do not succeed in drive him away the Balloon is haul down - 7.8.16 Monday - A veri fierc fight is in progress the shell is sever . We are work day night right up to the Gun pit without intermiss . The Lahor Art Div are catch it pretti strong . They are plunk shell after shell into Albert . Last night I went with a few more up into a redoubt just on the outskirt of Albert had a fine view of the Battl . All along the line the big gun were vomit shell fire whilst the Rifl Machin Gun fire was terribl to look at . The German counter attack our posit on The Ridg , but were beaten off after a furious struggl with heavi loss . A Detach of their attack Forc number 49 men ran toward our men say Merci Kamerad Souvenir Kamerad at the same time throw their arm away tender their Helmet to our men . They were sent to the rear of cours . Whilst observ the Gun Fire a veri curious shell near got me . It seem to burst high up then fall in flame , but it look veri pretti . The Cathedr still stand in Albert ( That is the Image ) but the next good shell will finish it . We were kept awak all last night by the furious fight they got veri close to our Hors Line camp with shrapnel , it burst on a Ridg close by . They score one god hit with a Jack Johnson by hit an ammunit stack explod it . You never saw the like in your life it went up with a roar a vast sheet of flame rain bullet for half an hour after . Our Sleep Lizzi howev , got onto the culprit with a few well place shell entir silenc it . The abov Gun is a gigant 16 inch on a Railway run up to it posit after fire a few shot goe back again , but the report from the beggar make one sick . The 9 ? 2" Howitz kick up a deuc of a row there is a Batteri of them right close to us , so imagin the Headach . - 8.8.16 Tuesday - The Battl is still proceed with undiminish furi the concentr of our artilleri fire on their line is terribl to see . It look to me as though they are alter the shape of the land . I had a bitter tast in my mouth this morn . ? We all heard this confound gun bark which is worri us short after heard the approach of the shell , gee it was a bonser , br-r-r-r bang . It seem to pass over our head land in Sen just in front of us . Blew up 2 hous did anytheveryth but do ani militari damag . They fire 2 more of these , one of which did not burst , but they are some lot I tell you . Artilleri Batteri are gallop by go into action . They are practic jam wheel on wheel so imagin the racket they creat . I had a letter from Clabbi who is in England with the 3rd Divis we will all be pleas when they arriv here , as it will no doubt mean a longer spell for us out of the Front Line . I think someth is in the wind here , as Cavalri to the number of 45 000 is concentr in rear of the Australian readi for a quick dash through . Old perman Imperial Artillerymen who have fought at Mon , Ypres Arras , say they never heard anyth in their life like this continu bombard . Men are come out of the pit utter insan white after 48 hour of it , so imagin what it is like . - 9.8.16 Wednesday - The bombard was still veri intens this morn they again shell Sen , this time manag to land one in a French Cavalri Regiment encamp about of a mile from us . The shell kill 6 men 10 hors . We had one man wound 3 hors kill today , also 2 waggon blown up . The fight eas off in the afternoon and at the present time it is veri quiet in fact after the turmoil of the past few day , it seem to have a depress effect on us all , becaus it is natur onli the calm befor the storm . Everi gun on the line has 5000 round a special word letter from Gener Haig , speak for volum . He state that we are no longer fight for time " , but for victori " . I receiv a letter from Owen Dows who is with Clabbi in England he expect to be over short . I hope they come to this front but I do not think they will . Today or the next is go to start the most furious long drawn battl of the war , it seem by the compar still that both side are busi prepar for it . The aeroplan are veri activ mani duel have been fought . Our Sleep Lizzi " is prepar to have her share of the forth come fight her weight of metal will be felt . We have had a rough day of it in prepar Waggon trench unload Rail head materi , the latter be done under their big shell fire . I have heard that the 5th DIV suffer fair heavili at Armentier where we came from , but do not know ani fact as yet . Our .O. are all fair off their knut are frantic endeavour to obtain imposs work result , AS USUAL" , but we all condol ourselv with the sooth effect of what the day of peac will bring with them . Chief grievanc of today ? Dig waggon rut unload coal , on an empti stomach , when it could have been easili done at a more conveni time . The Imperial Driver with us are dog - 10.8.16 Thursday - Last night 's bombard was again sever , but eas off in the morn . They again land sever larg shell in our vicin too close to be pleasant . This afternoon we were all warn that H.M. The King was to pass through our vicin it seem as if his visit was known as a half an hour after he pass through Bosancourt about of a mile from us they fire 6 shell in quick success right onto the Main Road . It fort . The shell fail in it primari object , but unfortun got onto a crowd of soldier maul them . Sever of our Driver had veri lucki escap , one waggon be jolt with concuss . The crater in the road was sever yard in extent . At the time of write they are again heavili shell us as sever of our waggon are still on the other side of the shell area they are caus some anxieti . So far our gun are unaccount silent , but all hand are expect them to open up direct . I fanci The King visit is the prelud to the Great attack " which is short go to astonish the whole world . Sever batch of prison were march in today the guard had great troubl in keep the French Kiddi off them . They stood off pelt them with stone mud . - 11.8.16 Friday - Heaven ? what a night it has been . No one who may read this could possibl imagin what it was like , I have no doubt that it will live in the memori of all who were present forev . Even the French populac , harden as they are to warfar had to take refug in underground cave , as for us , - well we were in the open . It open at about 8pm by the German who shell our Sector with 8 to 12 inch Krupp Gun . It was a veri anxious time , the long drawn sigh of the shell , as they travel through the air was veri nerv tri , I fanci has ad a few more grey hair to my head . At about 8.30 a Batteri of 9.5 Howitz took up the challeng start to shell rapid , a quarter of an hour later . The big Naval 12 " Gun rush up on Railway line after about 10 minut furious fire , entir silenc the German . This was the signal for a general Bombard the thousand of gun of all calibr , hitherto silent , belch forth their shell the air was a perfect inferno of shriek shell , sick fume of Gunpowd . Imagin a 30 mile front with canon park wheel on wheel 3 tier deep ( Accord to their size , larg piec be in rear ) all fire as rapid as they could load . There was no particularis between individu Shot , nor Batteri , but whole Brigad were fire simultan the concuss of the air was terribl . None of us could be down for long , as the vibrat of the ground made one feel sick . So we all gather togeth in group spent the night watch as we joke term The Firework " but there was not one man who was not decid subdu . The whole sky was split continu by jag spurt of fire , I think the worst feel of all was the displac of the air , which affect one with an unaccount feel of deep depress . The shell have a sinist sound as they hurtl through the air , each one produc a long drawn sigh all tone differ . It is this sound which play up most of all with one nerv , as you hear the Gun fire , then hear the shell come whistl through the air , each one seem as though it is come straight for you , then hear the crash as it explod . The final sound is alway one of relief as you natur know that it has miss you . What the German suffer last night must have been fright , as some prison who came in this morn are stark mad their casualti were veri high . Cheeri news come from the Italian Front this morn at last they have captur Gorizia , which must be a relief to them . Our Forc in Egypt have again been busi the Turk have again been beaten on the Canal , with heavi loss of men gun . later We have all been told of the Australian Light Hors great charg at the Turk which utter rout them glori in their deed , as it is the first chanc they have had for a long time of so distinguish themselv . It must have been a sight to see a line of horsemen gallop forward with a front of 3 mile . - 12.8.16 Saturday - I have had further duti place on my head from what I can see of it will have to go day night whilst on the first Line sector . The Bombard open up again last night but not near so furious . Last night 's Battl was a desper counter attack by the German but after our Artilleri had finish with them there was not much left for the infantri to do . Howev the now famous ( 13th Brigad 4th DIV ) call the fight 13th met them with a cool that astound mani Imperial Gener after cut them to piec with machin gun rifl fire , leap over the parapet use the cold steel . They took 300 yard of Trench on a 600 yard front there were onli 2 unwound German in the whole trench . This speak volum for the intens dead accuraci of the Artilleri Fire show how the German must ultim be thorough extermin if they keep on fight . We have been advis that an Armi of 100000 Portuges will short arriv here , the way men are come in speak veri bad for the German ever have anoth moment spell . The Aeroplan are unusu activ as a consequ anti-aircraft gun are throw shell all over the place one run a nasti risk of be hit with their own shell . A veri distress incid occur in our villag last night , which the German were shell . Two fair age peopl were walk across the street with a child between them when a shell explod right where they were , believ me , you could not find a singl trace of ani of them after . The enemi are persist shell our Convoy road in the hope of both catch a convoy destroy the road . To this end the Author gave us a differ rout an hour after we had commenc use the new road they start to pour them in on us again . This led to a search , as a result 6 spi were march off this morn . They had been hide in cellar in Bosancourt . They gave us a liber dose of smoke Bomb last night but beyond make our eye smart they did no militari damag . We have had 6 more waggon smash 3 hors kill as a result of further shell , so I am go out to Acheus direct to draw more Hors . So far my littl poni has not been touch , although when a shell explod near him or a big gun fire he give me some troubl . - 13.8.16 Sunday - The night pass veri quiet as far as our immedi front is concern , but the French on our right , got well into it pour shell in all night . The 75s were particular activ . The 1st Divis are move in again after their spell , their Artilleri move into a cover posit of our 4th Div. Art . The infantri have reach Warloy , 6 mile behind us . This Morn one of our aeroplan was hit by the enemi manag to fli as far as our line where he volplan down , both he his machin were save . Late yesterday even one of our stationari observ Balloon broke away drift toward the German Line , it was great to see theour aeroplan tri to catch it . The pilot descend in his parachut our machin final explod it with bomb . The 15th of this month is call Asumption Day here is commemor by big feast , a religi rite , have some connect with the Virgin Mari . It is general thought by all hand that a terrif offens will start on that day , especi as our Engineer have made fast the suspend Image of the Virgin Mari , in the Cathedr Tower in Albert . If this fall the French peasantri are bound to regard it as an ill-omen , unless the Bosch score a direct hit , it will not come down . Our convoy has just left Sen for a place beyond Albert , the German are at the present time busi in shell the Road , whether they succeed in get ani I am at the present unabl to say but I do not like it . We are all look forward to a spell in a week time hope thatthey do not disappoint us . Receiv a batch of letter but am unabl to write at present . There was a bless Group of machin gun fire close to us last night machin gun fire close to us last night we all did not get much sleep over them . This is our 7th day here it is veri tire . They deliv a gas attack on the portion of our Compani who stay behind at Ypres , but fortun did not do them ani harm at all . Two Taub manag to break through our line at Sausag Gulli , but beyond observ certain posit , which were immedi chang , they did not get a chanc of do ani damag . Some of the fellow who riot in Sydney have tri the same thing here , but they have been round up are all handcuf in a circl round a tree . What will becom of them I do not know , or care , the Guard had a hard task to keep other Australian off them . - 14.8.16 Monday - Sever more case of direct case of injustic selfish has occur today from .O. such as hurri all hand off without dinner when it was not necessari . Shift Bivouac to better posit general dis-satisfact of everyth done on the line . Another score to be paid off . The fight is still intens , but netherless not near so sever as the earli part of last week . Reggi White came over to see me he is now in the 2nd Div. Train I receiv letter from all round yesterday was satisfi with my share of the mail . The weather has again chang for the last 2 night we have had to put up with wet blanket .
