Everything was lovely, Marie sees to that.  Auntie is cook   &   bottle washer & Gran. is Auntie's off-sider.  Marie looks to the rest.  They had a woman doing the work but She took ill   &   auntie was unable to get anyone else.  Anyway they are better pleased I think because with a stranger in the House a place is not Your own.  Their Yard Boy does all the messages   &   dirty work, so they are spared the outdoor work.  My word that Rose of Mrs Doyles is a beauty isn't it.  Fancy it flowering so soon. I suppose You went to Georgie's orchestra's Concert.  It must have been some Show.  Do you go to the Dandies   &   the Pictures now the Summer is on?  Aunty Fanny still living in the same House?  The Girl Percy married must be mad to take Him on.  I do not mean because of the Kiddies only, but He is more Brute than Man.  I could always picture that fellow as a wife beater,   &   such a child too, only 17. I do not think there are many fleas here.  I remember one being on me when I was at Aunties.  Marie said well You must have brought Him here, because we have none.  Well, Mum dear, I have to write to Dad
