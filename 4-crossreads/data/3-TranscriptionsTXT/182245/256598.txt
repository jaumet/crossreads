MARCH 1917
24 SATURDAY
Fine & Sunny but with a very
nippy wind. Rode down to
Steenwerck in morning with Rohu
for rations, from there on to
Erquingham & Armentieres
& had dinner there. Went on
to the battery position after. Old
Fritz lobbed a 5.9" shell about
15 yds off me as I was going past
"Le [?on]" dump. He shelled out a
battery of NZ guns about quarter
of a mile from our position today.
I went & had a look at their pits
& there's no doubt their shooting
is marvellous. Had tea
with Joe Clonan at his billet
& then came on home.
