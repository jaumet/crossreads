<p>Aug 26 Arrived Suva. Misty rainy weather. Miserable. "Sea lark" here. Lt. Cr. Jackson joined us.<br/>Aug 27 left for Samoa. Pretty rough all the way. S.E. trade winds. Guess the soldier- men are sorry for themselves just now.<br/>Aug 30 Arrived Samoa. Glorious view. Peaceful looking place   &amp; we feel rather formidable. Jackson &amp; Lewis sweep for mines. Capitulated without a shot. Frenchman sorry, wd. like to try their guns. French Ad. Landed &amp; read proclmtn of British possession. That's 'entente' for you. Left noon. W/T station first disabled by Germans.<br/>Sept 2. Bad cold, developed into pneumonia. Have to stay between blankets in this awful weather. Am not so bad really. Some officers go ashore for a walk. Brought with us as prisoners on parole Governor of Samoa &amp; several other officials. Accommodated at Grand Pacific Hotel. </p>
