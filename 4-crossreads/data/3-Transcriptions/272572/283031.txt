<p>It rained hard during the night. Steenvoorde is affair sized town, not quite as big as Poperinghe, but it is more select, better class shops, a lot of lace is made in both places. Poperinghe has 4 big churches, one has marks of German shells on the tower, a corner of the square being knocked off, it is not a spire, though the others are. The streets are cobbled &amp; are narrow &amp; winding, with a square in the centre of the town. The town is not ruined at all, though there are plenty of broken windows &amp; shrapnel marks on all the buildings. Steenvoorde is intact, it has one big spire church, in a recess of the outside of the wall, is built a crucifix it is very pretty, being colored, with a background to it. It looks like the stage at the theatre. Thursday 19th it is raining hard. We moved to another billet in the town after dinner. I went for a walk, after tea. Friday lovely day, frost this morning. We had a route march this morning.</p>
<p>Saturday 21st lovely day. Heavy frost this morning. We moved out of Steenvoorde at 10 AM We passed through Cassel a small village it is the prettiest &amp; most select, that I have seen in France, it &amp; the country surrounding is high &amp; commands a good view of the country for miles. In a garden there, there was a lovely bed of flowering begonias. We stayed the night a couple of Kilo's out of Noordpeene. Sunday 22nd we left our billet for St Omer arriving there (2 mile outside of the town about 2.15PM where we billeted in a farm. Monday fine, not as nice as yesterday. I went for a walk &amp; helped to dig up carrots in the farm. Tuesday 24 sprinkling with rain, it is very rainy looking. We leave camp at 1.30 for Arques, about 4 mile away from Tilques, where we were billeted outside St Omer. Arques is on the opposite side of St Omer, we having to go back on the St Omer Rd for about 1 mile before branching off. We entrained at about 5.15PM</p>
