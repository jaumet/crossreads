Sunday 25 November 1917.
Moved at dawn across Jaffa road 2 miles & bivouaced.
I.C.C. Bgde moved into front trenches. On watering 1/2 way to Jaffa.
Oranges picked off the trees are exceptionally "good". 40 for 3 P.T's I got at one grove which was about the best I have seen so far.
Jews return from Ramleh to Jaffa. From all accounts the Turks gave the Jews a rough time.
