Thursday 14 Sept. 1916A bright morning but afterwards very cold & changeable with several heavy showers. During the morning went to the Div. Gas School & in the afternoon was fixing up a number of necessary gas matters. Cuthbert left for England on leave in the morning. Nice to hear the bugle calls again, more especially some of the cavalry calls.
