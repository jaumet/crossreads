<p>They got in however no one being hit.  The Turks must have got a great surprise seeing 10 men charging them.  They fired like blazes for an hour later wasting a terrible lot of ammunition.  I went after bags in the afternoon &amp; had a swim.  There was very heavy firing again at night &amp; the cracking of rifles &amp; bullets nearly deafened us.  I saw a high explosive shell crash into the cook house of the 12th Battalion.  It was funny seeing the tins &amp; cans soar into the air.  No one was hurt.  There was a lot of artillery fire between 5 oclock &amp; dark.  At night the Turks tried to cut off the Queensland patrol, but did not succeed though young Reynolds was killed.</p>
