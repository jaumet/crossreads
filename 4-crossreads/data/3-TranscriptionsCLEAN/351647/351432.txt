I have been round the country which is gorgeous just now, the flowers are gorgeous.  The other morning I got up very early & had a cycle ride to a certain historical place & rode miles through a wood & stacks of honeysuckle bushes loaded with blossom fairly made the air like a scent factory.
I suppose you know Bert Macnamara has been wounded, he will lose one eye, a jolly pity.  Bill Barlow was killed.  I got a rotten shock & am very sorry indeed.
I wonder what you are doing & how you are getting on & whether it is cold, or wet at Tog this winter.  And how is Graham & the Boss & Mac & who are the Jackeroos & what are they like.
I wish I could get a letter, its so maddening as I know you write.  I'm full of the war & no error.  I'm wearing my glasses today, first time for years but my eyes & head have been bad lately.  Haven't heard from Mrs. Johnson or Miss Arn lately.
Blowing a gale today, I'm going to town tomorrow to hear the Garde Republicaire Band play & am gloating over the prospect.
