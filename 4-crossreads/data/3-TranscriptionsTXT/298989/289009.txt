 Moascar 11/3/16 No physical drill parade owing to all being hors de combat from inoculaton. Morning parade kit fitting and finding how to make the equipment comfortable. In the afternoon prosecuted in the case against Mouritsen charge of fraudulently altering his pay book. The Court Martial found him guilty! On the evidence I would have discharged him. Military justice is rough and ready. 
 12/3/16 Spendlove sober again. Up at 0700 and shaved the Company fell in at 0830 and marched to a siding at the Moascar station. All the men stripped naked there and got into their greatcoats. Their lousy clothes and blankets were all tied up into bundles and put into a closed truck attached to a locomotive from which steam was pumped into the truck. After boiling for 40 minutes the greatcoats were put in. The mens tones of commiseration for the lice were amusing. "Poor bastards" was the general expression. 
 The Egyptian State Railways is a splendid institution, admirably run. The whole service is marvellously up to date and efficient. The express trains are splendid, the clerks smart and the nigger engine drivers in their fezs as good as any. The railway yards are very big and big stacks of stuff about. The large camps look very neat &amp; comfortable pitched on the bare desert, the fringe of palm trees and other vegetation on the irrigation canal make a welcome relief to the eye. A great article of diet is Eggs. The natives call out "Eggsacook" &amp; "Eggsafresh", "Eggs laid tomorrow". The paper sellers call out "Egyptian Mail &ndash; a good news 500 Australians killed at Lone Pine!" 
 Skene Smith received word that big preparations are being made for our reception at Aldershot. Other furpheys state we are going to Bombay. Aeroplanes alighting just near the sterilizing plant &ndash; very pretty descents. The language of the men is filthy but they mean no harm. Sunday today.
