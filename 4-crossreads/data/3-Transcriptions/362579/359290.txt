<p>lovely here, so hope to stay for it. I am off-duty for a couple of house so shall try to write a few letters.</p>
<p>We have not had any visits from our   <u>friends</u>,   <u>The Huns</u>, for 24 hours, so think they have been driven further back. Yesterday a number of their aircraft about but they did no damage. Our own guns have been fearfully busy   &amp;  it was just awful last night, thought once our tent was coming down.</p>
<p>You would be amused if you could see us with   <u>Gas-Helmets</u>, have to carry them about with us, everywhere we go   &amp;  at night have it ready at the side of the bed. Each patient   &amp; all of the Staff is supplied with one.</p>
<p>We get warning in plenty of time. 2 hrs before word comes through to be prepared so heaps of time to fix everybody up properly. The wind has not been favourable for the   <u>Wretches</u>  to do any damage to us. Things seem to be looking much brighter   &amp;  it is rumoured that out boys are coming out for a spell. We will be glad for their sake but do not much like the idea of nursing Tommies again.</p>
