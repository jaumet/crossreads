 July 4th. Wed. A bomb was dropped by an enemy 'plane in amongst our tents at the back of the building. 
 We had heard the 'plane buzzing about all night. 
 One of the sisters who was on night duty was slightly wounded on the shoulder. She was operated on but the Surgeon was unsuccessful in getting the small piece of metal. The piece of metal had apparently penetrated the lung.

 July 6th. Fri. Rumour that in our next stunt there are to be nine Operating Teams.
