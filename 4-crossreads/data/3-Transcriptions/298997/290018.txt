<p>Jan 7<br/><strike>Dec 7</strike><br/>Have neglected this business and must pick it up someway as best I can.</p>
<p>This day our company moved back to Rose. Wood, which is adjacent to the Ravine and bivouaced in trenches which seem to have been badly knocked about.  C &amp; D Companies have gone in, &amp; taken possession of the Ravine &amp; front line.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact there is really a gap in the line in front of Rose Wood, but the ground is so low lying that it is practically impassable.  We get a very bad time here, as is already evident, from machine gun fire, &amp; shells, chiefly gas.  D Company had a number of casualties while in this position.</p>
<p>The doctor, who would not let me go back to the line, ordered me back here in advance of the Company, &amp; one of the men in the platoon who was out because he going back to a school humped my pack for me.  I got into a very nice dugout, but discovered during the day that a Fritz machine  played right across the entrance.  When the Company arrived at night there was a quarrel between the signallers &amp; some of the sergeants as to who were to have the place.  I was glad to leave it to them.</p>
<p>I am sharing a "possie" with Sgt Maginnis.  It is a section of trench that has been cut off by the demolition of some of the original trench by shells.  Originally it was part of a German system.  Hanging</p>
