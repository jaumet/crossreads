<p>Sunday 22 April 1917</p>
<p>ABUSSITTA</p>
<p>Marched again all night &amp; bombed again this morning. Approved to have 24 hours rest but being continually bombed gets on your nerves. Enemy shot down another of our planes last night, it burst into flames on reaching the ground.</p>
<p>Water is still the trouble but the country could easily be developed in this respect.</p>
<p>Suddenly we saddled up &amp; moved again at 3 p.m. &amp; camped at [indecipherable] again. This life is like chassing De Witt in Africa. <strike>MAIL from Dolly, Laura &amp; Paper from Ferrar.</strike>  The Field Post office follows us.</p>
