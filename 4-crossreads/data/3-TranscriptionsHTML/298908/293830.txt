<p>I have dropped in rather lucky here in one respect, for the girl whom I take out occasionally is a real good sort.  She speaks French fluently &amp; sings &amp; plays nicely &amp; is in all ways a real refined girl, but she has a rather sad thing in her life her fianc&eacute;e was killed over 2 years ago but she has never forgotten him, she told me all about it last night &amp; I felt real sorry for her.  Thank goodness there are still some girls left who are true to the ones they loved &amp; don't go gadding about all over the place as if nothing had ever happened, that's one of the worst parts of this war the thousand s of young people that have been parted for ever &amp; the homes that have been left so empty &amp; sad.  Its very bad over here for practically every one has lost some one near &amp; dear to them.  I have often thanked my lucky stars that if ever I happened to get knocked out for good no one would ever grieve over me with the exception of perhaps Mother.  Sometimes I have often wished that it were otherwise for a chap is very lonely at times &amp; craves for someone to confide in, but I suppose one of these days all will come right as I</p>
