  
 perhaps for my peace of mind that my leave is just finishing for I am certain the more I see of her the more I should like the girl having to work for her living has improved the girl if that could be possibly done. 20th.  Rose rather earlier than usual this morning 7.30 & slipped down to breakfast thinking to find the room empty but on the contrary it was full so I gained very little by it after dining my mate & I went down town for a stroll & slipped in to see the girls for a minute after this we went out to Roath Park & Lake they are both very pretty & the flowers are something lovely the finest dahlias I have ever seen are in these gardens, Anderson wanted to catch the 1 oclock train so we hurried back & had dinner at the Louis then round to our hotel & over to the station but arrived there just about 3 minutes too late.
