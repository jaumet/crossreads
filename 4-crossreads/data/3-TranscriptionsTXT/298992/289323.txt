 that we visited the Hospital at T.I., and were shown over by a very nice little nurse. Quite pretty &amp; about 24 years old. As you know I have a partiality for nurses, so we really enjoyed our little visit. Got some afternoon tea into the bargain. 
 We have been having fairly rough weather lately, but the little sea experience I have had has stood by me, &amp; I can always go below &amp; get a good dinner down &ndash; and keep it there. Tommy also is a good sailor &amp; has not been sick yet. I only wish we had Mills with us. He is a really decent fellow. I have told him to go up &amp; see you sometime. Have you seen him yet? 
 It's near "lights out" now Mother dear, so I will end this off, and hope you are all well, &amp; do not worry about me. I am coming through this little lot alright, you see. 
 Good bye, &amp; with lots of love to you &amp; the family &ndash; 
 Your son Alan.
