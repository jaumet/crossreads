<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>We received a mail from Australia today &amp; I got 4 letters &amp; a Christmas card out of it, one letter from you dated about 8th Oct., two from Mother, one dated about the same as yours &amp; one a week previous, the fourth was from Aunt Eva, the card from Auntie Bee.  I am still hoping to get some more out of it as Ken got 12 &amp; I generally beat him in mail.  I hear a lot of mail has gone down lately so I wouldent be a bit surprised if I do get a short mail as I well know the rest have met their fate.  We are still stuck here but are waiting anxiously for an answer to an application we put in for a transfer to the 17 Batt.,</p>
