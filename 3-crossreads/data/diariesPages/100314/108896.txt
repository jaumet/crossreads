3/3/18 Amiens
A cold and drizzly day. Rose about 9 and paid 6 francs for the room I slept in last night ? not a bad place at all ? in a private house. Walked round to the Officers Club and there had a good breakfast at 2.50. It is remarkable how they can do it at the price. Walked down to the Cathedral and viewed it first from the Place Notre Dame in front. The whole of the lower portion of the front is now all sandbagged up to a height of about 30 feet. There is something fascinating and irresistibly beautiful about the front of this place. A large row of statues representing ancient Kings of France runs right across the centre of the faade in niches. The flowers, fruits and minor decorations cover the whole nearly every stone being carved in some manner. Went
