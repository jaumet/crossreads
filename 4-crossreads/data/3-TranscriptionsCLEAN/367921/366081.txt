It mas in one of these Institutions that I found myself, there must have been very close on fifteen hundred patients being looked after by these monks with not a woman on the working staff of the establishment.        While going through the reception room of the hospital my pay book, which was taken from me, was the object of much interest to the German soldiers who comprised the clerical staff of the hospital, for our payments of twenty or forty francs in the field fortnightly was indeed something in comparison to german soldier's pay - which, inclusive of allotment, amounted to about fourpence per day.

Medical treatment by way of an operation was impossible in my particular case, although I was ex-rayed.
