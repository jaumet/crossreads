  
 [The beginning of this letter appears to be missing.] &lies. 
 I had a hunt for Joe Kirby but didn't get him.  Poor Joe, I can't help liking him, faults & all.  I suppose you are home at Tog  by  ages ago, hope you had a nice welcome & the weather decent & garden gorgeous.  I also trust you did  not  get Stella's cold. 
 I simply longed to be home too, just to get you & have a real long talk & cheer & brace you up, because I felt you weren't A1.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but you sounded bored & restless. 
 One of my pals went away sick yesterday much to my grief, results of gas.  Still he'll be out of things for a little while & may chance a trip to Blighty. 
 I had a very charming letter from Miss Arn today, they're all very excited as the Colonel is on his way home.  They are very charming & so jolly kind to me. 
 My brother is in Palestine.  I wonder if I have told you all this before. 
 How is your romance, you simply haven't mentioned it for ages.
