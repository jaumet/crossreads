<p>file, under the cover of darkness, into the Firth of Forth, &amp; under the great Forth Bridge to our respective anchorages.&nbsp; Leaving &amp; arriving at our base always took place during the dark hours, thus guarding against submarine attacks in the narrow channels.&nbsp; Submarines were reported by our destroyers from time to time, &amp; we knew that some of them were waiting to attack us near the Firth of Forth, whenever the opportunity occurred.&nbsp; it is comparitively easy for a large fast ship to avoid a submarine, when sighted by the former.&nbsp; Immediately the submarine is seen, full speed is put on &amp; a zig-zag couse steered, which outpaces the submarine &amp; gives her a varying target for her torpedo.&nbsp; In the case of a destroyer sighting a submarine, she at once attempts to ram it, being able to turn quickly, &amp; steam at very high speeds towards it.&nbsp; A destroyer draws too little water to be certainly hit by a torpedo, &amp;, therefore, has little to fear from a submarine.&nbsp; The great change in conditions of climate to which the crew had been subjected soon made itself apparent,&nbsp;&amp; nearly everybody on board suffered from severe coughs &amp; cold.</p>
