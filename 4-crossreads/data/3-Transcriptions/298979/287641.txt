<p>pulled up the sleeve of the right arm the contrast was so great that the Sister nearly fell down, with laughing. The wounded arm really looked no bigger than a childs. It was only skin &amp; bone.</p>
<p>Although after this the wound gave signs of healing, the use of the arm did not come back, it appeared to be partly paralized with the 3rd 4th &amp; 5th fingers so badly contracted &amp; clenched that it was impossible to open them, with the greatest power, even half an inch. However continual massaging mostly by the patient himself, gradually effected an improvement that enabled the fingers to become flexible showing that in time the fingers would become straight again, although probably the little finger would for all practical purposes be useless.</p>
<p>At this time the Sentry was able to leave the Hospital during the allotted hours &amp; enjoy rambles along the hedge protected lanes that seem customary over all parts of England.</p>
<p>Occasional half day trips were granted. A small number of men would be invited from each of the Hospitals near London to visit one of the Theatres. On arrival they would be taken in hand by a woman representative of either the War Chest or YMCA (or some other) Australian fund &amp; after the Theatre, would be given tea, returning to the Hospital about 8 pm.</p>
<p>After the first of these trips the Sentry having had his tea spent an hour interestedly watching the people passing in the street below, on foot &amp; in vehicles. It happened to be the "Strand" and the sight attracted him wonderfully &ndash; while watching, Queen Alexandria &amp; a friend were noticed passing slowly in a motor.</p>
<p>Although watching for an hour a very keen desire was created to come back &amp; see more of this great city. Landing in London by means of a "tube" railway at 'Charing Cross', the very first object that catches the eye</p>
