<p>21.6.15<br/>Mon. 21st.  Nearly 9 oclock this morning before we raised enough energy to get up &amp; get breakfast ready, soon after we rose the Turks artillery commenced to drop shells on the point of Popes Hill, they had the range to a nicety &amp; dropped the shells right on the trenches, they fired about 20 shots before our 6 inch Howitzer opened up &amp; silenced her after firing 5 or 6 shots.  Stan &amp; Smithers had to go on a sapping party at one o'clock, we received a large mail to-day from Aus. &amp; England.  I was agreeably surprised to get a letter from Lilian Tomlins.  The warboats have been firing continuously all the afternoon, about 3 o'clock several Turkish shells fell right amongst the 3rd L.H. dug-outs on the hill opposite us, none of the shells exploded before landing &amp; no one was hurt by them.</p>
