<p>194<br/>by us.</p>
<p>In the excitement of battle when men are apt to get a slightly distorted view of things, mistakes are apt to occur. In this instance our Machine Gunner turned his gun on to them without however causing much damage as far as I could see.</p>
<p>Another time, a little German, probably lost, wandered into our lines to give himself up. The same gun was again fired and a couple of bombs were also thrown, with the direct result that the little chap was so badly wounded he died soon after.</p>
<p>I took a risk that afternoon too. It came on to rain</p>
