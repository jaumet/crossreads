<p>1915<br/>May. 16 Sun.<br/>Left Mena House about 9.30 am. after being there for 16&frac12; weeks. Am now installed in the administration Office at Gezireh Palace which is on Gezireh Island beside the bank of the Nile &amp; about a mile from Cairo &ndash; the tram fare in being only 2 milliemes (&frac12;d).  Got to work straight away but could not find much to do &ndash; After tea went for a walk through the beautiful public gardens on the Island, splendid!<br/>The Palace is a splendid building amid fine surroundings &ndash; Much decenter than being out at Mena although not quite so comfortable &ndash; but much finer building.</p>
