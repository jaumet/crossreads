August 19171st   We are in the Morbecque district & are billeted in a large farm.   The other sections are billeted on farms around the district, about 3/4 Kms apart.A heavy bombardment has been going on all day to the north & North East but quietened down towards evening.2nd   Rain started to fall during the night & continued all day, & at times, very heavy.   There has been no parade yet & all we have been doing is to straighten up our billet.3rd   It is raining again to-day but not so hard.   We had our first parade this morning & Lt. Oliver is still acting O.C.   After a little squad drill we returned home & had the rest of the day off.
