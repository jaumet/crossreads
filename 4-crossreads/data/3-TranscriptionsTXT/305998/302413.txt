17th/Had orders to entrain at 1.30 pm. We got the horses aboard & had open trucks to ride back, we do not mind open trucks in fine weather, but this trip was the limit, it started to rain just before we left & continued through out the journey to Cairo. We soon got wet to the skin but then the water started to wash about the truck so the next thing was to make holes through the bottom of the truck with bayonets which was done after a doing great many attemps,
