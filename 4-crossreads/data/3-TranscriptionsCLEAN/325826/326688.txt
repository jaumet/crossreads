  
 2.  quite two days before he picked up.  Gwendoline Bateman is absolutely charming.  She is so bright & girlish & yet so clever & entertaining & has such a sweet face that it only took me about five minutes to completely fall in love with her and I am sure that before we leave the ship everyone else will have done so too.  John is very nice but he is miles eclipsed by this wife of his.  I wish I had half her gifts they would be so useful to Rid. I am hoping to send a telegram to Adelaide to you, Father, & long ere this gets to you you ought to have had it.  I couldn't remember the name of Mr Scott's house. I had such a lovely big budget of letters at Adelaide, they were waiting for me on the Malwa.  Among them was yours Mother dear, for which thank you so much, and those of Rid's that you kindly posted on: also the Xmas cards & several other odd letters.  I think already I have had to write about 18 or 19 on board, it seems endless, really. Am probably going to Perth with the Batemans
