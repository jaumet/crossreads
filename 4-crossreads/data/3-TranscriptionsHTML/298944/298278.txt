<p>Tuesday night</p>
<p>Since last writing my round has been simply work (military &amp; educational) &amp; sleep.</p>
<p>During the night I do preparation work or write parodies for the concert, or learn some shorthand when there is nothing to be done in the way of attending to patients. A few influenza cases may be relied upon every night, but beyond that there are not spent many cases &ndash; that is wounded.</p>
<p>Tonight there has been a raid in which our boys wore certain kinds of hats. The number of wounded was only about half a dozen, &amp; of those only one was serious. We seem to have dealt with 4 worrying machine guns.</p>
