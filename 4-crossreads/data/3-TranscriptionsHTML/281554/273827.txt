<p>26th<br/>Rather dull but not cold.  Church parade 11 a.m. opp. our own Lines.  Leave from midday, visited larger village West Mudros.  Busy but very dirty place, plenty eatables, fruit, sweets, etc. but prices very stiff, home to tea spent night in tent.</p>
<p>27th Monday<br/>Orderly Sgt. for day.  Woke early to hear rain but day turned out bright later on.  Haircut, reading &amp; card playing.</p>
<p>28th Tuesday<br/>Weather keen, but bright sunshine.  Mail fatigue,</p>
