<p>Articles contributed to augment those used &amp; supplied by the Govrmt.<br/>This section would include, sandbags, bandages &amp; dressings, first field dressings, socks, Balaclava caps, mittens etc. crutches, splints, Invalids clothing.</p>
<p>All these should be delivered to &amp; only handled by the Army Ordnance Dept.<br/>Even though sandbags can be made cheaply in India from jute on the spot I consider all used commercial sacks should be made up into sandbags. If new hessian is used I would think that after duty, freight etc. is paid on it, that the Goverment could manage better, by getting them made in India by machines, <strike>cheaper</strike>.  Labour is cheaper there too.</p>
<p>Now as regards knitted work.  Men are supplied with caps &amp; socks by the Ordnance Dept. on a regular scale. If they have just had socks from issue &amp; a comforts lot arrives   <strike>will</strike> men will waste them when they are plentiful as you know. The Dept. could use all knitted work by issuing it, where a check is kept on a man's kit.</p>
