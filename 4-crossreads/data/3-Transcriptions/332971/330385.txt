<p>feet are coming in by the hundred.  This weather is terribly severe, we were told by an Officer when in doing his outpost round he passed one man on duty, and in passing said "All right here", reply "All right sir", then he passed on to the next, but instinct told him to retrace his steps and have another look at the man.  By then the man was standing, silent and frozen &ndash; he had given his life.  We are told that the Germans have warned us to remove all these C.C.S. from the front by a certain date.</p>
<p>18th.  The inevitable, I must submit and give my place up for some stronger.  It's hard luck, but I am tired and Matron insists.  In a way I am glad.  Capt. C. says I need a thorough rest and recommends a warmer climate, and it's all I need &ndash; warmth and sunshine.  Matron fixes me up in an ambulance, hot water bags, rugs, and tucks a small bottle of whisky in when she says good-bye.  I might add that the driver will find that later.  And on my field card is marked "Debility" and I do dislike being labelled thus &ndash; a nice little Sister is sent with me.  Then from 21 a Sammy M>O. joins us and I keep him well employed with managing the slipping rugs.  I'll repeat again that there is something very attractive and lovable about the Americans.  I make for the Sick sisters at Abbeville via Peronne and Amiens.</p>
<p>Good-bye I did hope to mention Paris, tell a little more of Cannes and this present lovely place St Albans, but if you are not already tired of the scribble I will continue in my next.</p>
<p>Yours<br/>A Donnell.</p>
