 Dear Dad, Mum, George, Ellis. I crossed from the Island this morn. We had a nice crossing.  It is 2 pm & we are just off to Euston. We had a lovely Holiday of which is now over. We are quite anxious to get back now, but, oh so sad at Heart for Auntie Marie. Our lovely Uncle Tom is just O.K. also. Gran was Home so we had a real happy Time altogether. Must dry up now as the train is just about to go. Love Harry
