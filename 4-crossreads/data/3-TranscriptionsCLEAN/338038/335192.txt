 35 My Dear Father & Mother, 
 Some time has elapsed since I last sent a line home, but I must plead pressure of work as the excuse, as I have been going hammer & tongs up till a day or so ago. 
 Since writing I have had your letters in one lot dated from 9th to 28th November, as well as Cable 1 and parcels - The latter were none the less acceptable reaching me in Egypt instead of Gallipoli as we are quartered at present
