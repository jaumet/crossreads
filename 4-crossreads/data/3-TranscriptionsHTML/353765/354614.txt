<p>July 1916<br/>22nd &ndash; Only hope it turns out well. Another farce of exam in view. Nursing Sergt this time. Regts returned about 11 pm. About a dozen prisoners taken including a German Sergt or officer. Reported that two 2nd L.H. Sgts captured, horses done up. &amp; one of 1st L.H Regt killed. Taubes again.<br/>[Note in margin:] Tuesday<br/>23rd &ndash; Another air duel. This time above clouds but within hearing. Our plane hit engine stays, &amp; MG. &amp; pilot &amp; aviator slightly wounded in shoulder &amp; wrist. Chased German to Bir el Abd &amp; left him then returned at leisure when the German Aviators stole up on him. Various conflicting reports regarding duel. Their machines evidently superior. All hostile planes called Taubes by us. Good shooting by A-A gun at Taube splendid range &amp; elevation, bad line. Nothing fresh about Turks, evidently trying to draw us out. No hope in life. L.H. doing good work<br/>24th &ndash; Regts out again. Taking turns with 1st Bde left 1 am returned 11 pm. Our artillery fired 80 rounds into Oghratina, supposed to have been good shooting. Turks replied with a mountain gun or some such type. Wounded two &amp; killed a N.Z. by trapping them &amp; turning Mach Gun on them. Only one prisoner taken.<br/>25th &ndash; Taubes very active, 'Tween 7 &amp; 11 am passed over camp four times. A A gun doing good shooting. Two S.R. from Mohamadiya told us that a hostile 'plane was hit by a gun out there &amp; fell after one of our 'planes tackled it, crashed to the ground in front of their trenches. Taube dropped a message reported to be that she was going to drop bombs tomorrow &amp; to distinguish all red cross, ambulances etc for protection. At present too indistinct. Another report said Turks were going to attack &amp; shell the camp &amp; to distinguish red cross etc</p>
