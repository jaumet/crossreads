<p>January 1917<br/>Longueval, A.D.S.  1st</p>
<p>1<br/>Good old J.  The best I heard for many a day was what Barton had to say.  If you can get your transfer to here, we"ll be set.</p>
<p>2  4<br/>From the Bulli. of Oct. 26 &ndash; the results of a competition &ndash; a description of Billjim.  The best printed on line of the typical Billjim.</p>
<p>1  A Gay &ndash; Grey-eyed, graceful, generous gambler.<br/>2  An honest, humorous, honourable, handsome, happy of luck hard-won.<br/>3  A lion, lithe, lank, lazy, live, laughter, laring, large-eyed, long armed, larrikin, long necked, loose limbed, laconic, leg-pulling, lurid, lean.<br/>4  Nice, narrow hipped and nonchalant.<br/>5  A quick willed, red blooded resourceful rebel.<br/>6  A slim, sturdy, sinewy, slouching, sensitive, silent, self-reliant, soft hearted, sports loving, swash buckling, straight yarning, sturdy eyed, small chinned, sandy haired, super masculine, sentimental bloke.<br/>7  &hellip; only more so.</p>
<p>3<br/>A young Fritz we took down the other day after his first  bashfulness passed, anxiously asked confirmation of one of their "Dinkums".</p>
<p>"Do you send all the prisoners you capture to Australia?"</p>
<p>4<br/>Bill"s just come into the tent &ndash; and in still another rig:  Glengarry &ndash; cardigan, mauve underpants and knee gum boots.</p>
<p>Headgears<br/>Soft easy felts &ndash; well shaped and well dinted and otherwise, hardhatters, shams and caps &ndash; and the first day supplemented by enormous whites worn a hundred ways.  The brim ever wide and soft, and of a lovely surface for decorative indelible words, "Bill Smith &ndash; Enmore &ndash; Australia will be there" impressionistically stitched on the under side and the brim caught up by a rose or a cigarette card &ndash; a patriotic button or a glaring breach.  Then again the cap could be well worn and safely kept in position by simply turning under the sides, so leaving two chin jacks:  or by turning under the whole, and so constructing a neat toque.</p>
<p>Then comes the uniform issues and they gave us a cap and hat (Billjims already had both &ndash; from his cobber or he"d pinched 'em) and we wore our caps to a standstill.  On the transports we"d the wind and the sun.  Egypt it was hot but we still stuck to the caps &ndash; but gave the hats more than a fly.  Then the helmet.</p>
<p>By the time we"d reached France we"d not all of us both caps and hats, some had and for a while stuck to the cap.  For a while:  a day dammed the cap and the hat came into its forte and compleat glory.  Our uniform became changed by the fitch fastened to the Tommy tunics - but we stuck to the hat.  Tommy has adornable puttees, trousers and tunic but over our hat.  Then to the line, and they gave us steel helmets &ndash; heavy and uncomfortable, with wide straps and deep lining.  Uniforms can be easily summed up:  Top gum boots &ndash; sheepskin, leather side and mufflers, a balaclava and helmet &ndash; or hats.  Generally a waterproof sheet gracefully drooped from the shoulders &ndash; or with a hat in the centre is turned over the front and back, with a string tied round the waist.</p>
<p>In a late copy of the Bulli. in a paragraph on the use of a kerosene tin.  What about the virtues of a helmet.</p>
<p>A wash basin, and a seat, a pot and a candle holder &ndash; candles would be the tops and a diner and a tucker dump.  A jewel of Bibs, describing a New Year"s day episode &ndash; "I got 'im a tin 'at to spew in, but 'e wouldn"t, an" I put me finger in "is mouth, an" 'e bit it so I said - you: &hellip; an" &hellip; you too 'e sez.</p>
