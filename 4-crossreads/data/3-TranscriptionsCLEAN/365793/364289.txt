  
 July 6 going to ask about being boarded. -- Later, unable to get leave until my Board Papers arrive, & goodness knows when that will be. Looks as if I'll be left in England for duration 
 7  Thought it was too good to last. At first we only had to fall in at 6.30 & then finish, but now the damned Orderly Room & the Quack have put in extra parades, fatigues & put several of us on Pioneer fatigue - which is a job for a class men. Drew 1 quidlet & am going to the Jubilee if the rain hangs off (Later) [in margin] M, Mill, R.
