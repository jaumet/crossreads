These latter strew the floor in a deep pile of broken splinter remain . After complet my work at Albert , we ran down to Amien to view the Cathedr there . This superb edific is an odyssey in stone . Its pure gothic grace eleg surpass anyth I have yet seen in architectur . The interior , unlik most other similar edific , is exquisit light . The light filter through harmoni color window which at onc fill one with a pleasant sens of peac , rest quietud . It is glorious ,
