<p>this afternoon nearly every gun must have been in action &amp; the vibration was very pronounced, Fritz showed his good sense &amp; kept fairly quiet while it was on.<br/>9 Boches gave themselves up last night, as one of them was passing us he pointed to one of the patches on our backs &amp; said "No Bon," he knew what the patches were meant for.<br/>A little while ago I unearthed a good store of Fritz's iron rations, &amp; we had a good feed off them his tinned meat is something like brawn to taste, &amp; is very good.<br/>It is cruel to see the state some of the men are in, they have to wade through mud right up to their arm pits, &amp; in this awful state they have to stop for it will be several days yet before we are relieved its enough to kill any man, it would not be so bad if we had dry dugouts to go to or had a change of clothing, but no, neither of these are to be had.</p>
