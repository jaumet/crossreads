<p>Judge of the Supreme Court, an appointment which was made permanent in 1912. In 1931 I retired on reaching the statutory retiring age of 70.</p>
<p>Since then my leisure has been prevented from becoming burdensome by the opportunity that has been given me of doing public work as a Royal Commissioner. I hope it has not been without value to the State. Now, writing <strike>at the age of</strike> in my 77th <strike>year, I look forward to being allowed</strike> year, I am cheered by the knowledge that there is still work which those in authority think I may <strike>I hope to</strike> be allowed to do.</p>
<p>So much for the present on <strike>the</strike> purely personal <strike>side of my</strike> matters.</p>
