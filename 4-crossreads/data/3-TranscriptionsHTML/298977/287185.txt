<p>The vehicles are for the most part drawn by donkeys and it is funny to see one drawing a load about twenty times as big as himself.  Sometimes when carrying maize etc., you can only see their ears sticking out.  Horses are mostly used, but for the most part only for carriages.  There are also a few motors and have noticed some Ford's carving through sand.  Camels are also used a good deal.</p>
<p>Well I suppose I had better stop or else you might think I was going to write a book, but I thought you would like to hear something about where we are.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed your sea trip as well as I did and that every body is O.K. in the Office.  Kindly remember me to every body.</p>
<p>Met Roy Clune to-day.  He has been here for a week and is going to the Dardanelles to-morrow.  He is in the reinforcements.</p>
<p>Have not seen anything of Major Martin yet.  His Battalion is here.  Have met a lot of fellows I know.  I wish you would send me over the "Sun" or Times" every week as would like to see how things are in Australia.  Will send back some Photos when I get them done.  Can get them printed here.</p>
<p>Give my love to Mother and Ruby and remember me to all my friends round Homebush.</p>
<p>Your affectionate Son</p>
<p>Pte 1280 Roy Richards,<br/>M.G. SECTION,<br/>19th Batt, 5th Brig.</p>
<p>Harry wishes to be remembered to you all.</p>
<p>Have you heard anything from Roy Fleming, if you know his address send it over.</p>
<p>I might also mention that I weighed 11 stone 1 lb in Cairo Sunday , so you can see how I wasted on the trip.</p>
