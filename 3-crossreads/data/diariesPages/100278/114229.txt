Some of the boys were stiff today they had to go on fatigue, Len had a big party too won't be back till midnight.
When I woke up this morning I felt much better, but I had breakfast in bed, did not get up till nearly 10 O'clock, first thing I done was to go out have a wash in a shell hole. I then dressed myself lit a fire Jock, Bellchambers I cleaned our joint up I can tell you it was in a nice state after the night's carousing.
