<p>Oct. 2 Satuirday 1915<br/>Received letter from Maude dated 23rd May. In it reference was made to having received the different parcels &amp; P. cards.<br/>Not feeling too well today.<br/>Went with Dick Playdell to pictures tonight.</p>
<p>There is a pretty spot in one of the parks here, &amp; in the centre there is a long narrow strip of water which is full of lovely gold fish. It is a rare sight to watch the pretty creatures darting about after food. There are also a large number of ducks &amp; geese swimming about &amp; people fed them with all sort of dainties.</p>
<p>Just heard that Capt. Richardson of the 6th ALH has been killed at the Front. He was a quiet man very anxious to do his duty, &amp; was liked generally.</p>
<p>Oct. 3 Sunday 1915<br/>Worked from 6 AM to 8. 30 AM. Went to church both morning &amp; night.<br/>Sacrements at both services. A large number of soldiers stayed to the night's after meeting.<br/>In the afternoon I went for long walk through the different gardens &amp; a large cemetary. It appear to be the custom to place the shoes of the dead on top of the grave.</p>
<p>Oct. 4 Monday 19115<br/>The monuments are very beautiful &amp; in many cases the full sized portait of the deceased is enclosed in a glass house on top of vault.<br/>Monday  worked all day went to hear Dr. Jays lecture tonight on "Veneral diseases"It was hightly instructive &amp; the different points he drove home will stay with us all through our life.<br/>The Y. M. C. A. here is certainly doing much to help the young fellows to live right &amp;  the rooms are very comfortable &amp; clean.</p>
