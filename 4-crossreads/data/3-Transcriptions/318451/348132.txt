<p>return of the incidents of the great campaign.<br/>I have not many thrilling experiences above the normal trench life because for the six months of its history we have been in trench warfare &amp; only after I left did the Brigade go over the top in the present advance.  Had I remained with them, I should have had a great story to tell but one must try &amp; regard these changes as providential.  I return to France next Thursday to my new Batt. &amp; will commence a new diary of my doings &amp; experiences when I get back.</p>
