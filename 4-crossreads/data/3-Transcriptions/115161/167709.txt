<p>about it.&nbsp; I have to thank them for making my stay in their town so enjoyable.</p>
<p>The daughter had a very narrow escape.&nbsp; When the enemy first marched into the town, she was standing looking through the window,when an officer seeing her fixed his revolver at her, but luckily missed.&nbsp; The hole still remained in the glass.</p>
<p>My boss takes me for many motor trips through the country.&nbsp; The scenery along the valley of the Meuse, to Namur is absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>A rather peculiar incident took place one day.&nbsp; The boss and myself stopped at a little wayside caf&eacute;, and as the car approached, a couple of women and a girl about fifteen came to the door.&nbsp; On seeing my turned-up hat the girl screamed and ran inside, calling out &quot;Austrailien, Australien, pas bon&quot;.&nbsp; We stayed and had some coffee and I had the little girl on my knee laughing and quite friendly before we left.&nbsp; Perhaps the enemy had given us a bad name, and as we were the first Australians they had seen, made them a bit nervous.</p>
<p>The river here is very &quot;rapid&quot;, and the small boats by which you travel across are attached by a wire rope to another which is stretched right across the river at a height which will not interfere with the other water traffic.&nbsp; At times the rope breaks and the small boat goes careering down the river at a great pace, which has usually a very dampening effect on the passengers.</p>
<p>A very large railway station is here, trains running to a very good time-table.&nbsp; A visit to the different towns should not be missed.</p>
<p><u>CHARLEROI</u>.</p>
<p>is a fine town and is especially noted for the uncommon waxworks, showing things which in our countries would be only visible in the lecture rooms and laboratories, or of the medical enthusiast.&nbsp; One can imagine <s>almost</s> what an outcry there would be in England if anything of it&#39;s kind were attempted to be included in the wonderful and popular institution of Madame Tussaud.</p>
