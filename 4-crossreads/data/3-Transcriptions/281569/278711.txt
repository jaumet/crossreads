<p>Revielle at 1.15 &amp; off at 2.</p>
<p>Everything went OK right through the turnout &amp; we arrived at Katia at 0530 &amp; drove them out successfully on to the heights, our guns which had then come out bombarded his emplacements to some order, but their anti-aircraft guns are some class they shelled our planes all over the ship but never hit one although they must have gone pretty close later one of theirs came along &amp; met ors &amp; after a severe scrap ours downed him he fell behind their lines, they shot the pilot dead &amp; the machine turned turtle &amp; the observer was killed also.</p>
