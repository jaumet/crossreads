 Friday 13 September Last night the A.D.S. retired to Tincourt because of shelling. Fine day &amp; night &amp; the Boshe bomb-birds were very busy but not without opposition. It is great to see the plane caught in a dozen lights from all round, shining like a great moth with archies bursting all round &amp; tracer bullets going up from our M.G.s.  One brought down in flames &amp; another under apparent control both throwing out plenty of flares. Score 1 for archies!!
