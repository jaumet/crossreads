 Picture and a little destroyer which we christened Dirty Dick would come close in every evening at sunset and put from 17 to 20 shells into the Turks trenches before they would send one back at her. Having finished our work at the Canterbury slopes we joined the Battalion and relieved the 28 at the Apex a slope of Saria-Bair facing the famous hill 971 on which the Turks where strongly entrenched they also had a blockhouse  from which they sniped at us. We had a Howitzer which used to drop 6 inch shells in to the blockhouse and you could see pieces of it flying all over the place you could see the shell coming over and you would thing they where going to drop into our own trenches the block house was  only forty yards from our first fire trench and the noise of the explosion would nearly deafen you. The Apex was one of the worst posts on Gallipoli  you could look over the trench with a periscope and see the dead lying out in hundreds and the smell at times was unbearable. It was at this post we lost most of our men the bombs and shrapnel where very bad. I soon got used to seeing men killed and wounded and you did not know when your turn was coming.
