<p>Saturday, 24 April, 1915<br/>Awfully hot day one of the worst we have yet had, flies are awful far worse than in Australia.  I went to dance at Bulac at night only stayed few minutes then came home.  The Greeks of Cairo are making a terrible fuss of Mr Venizelos the late Greek Minister here he is estimated as the national hero.  The Grecian populace is going about crying Zeto Venizelos.  It is a pity that Greece did not step in with the Allies.</p>
<p>Rode into the hospital to get some instruments for canine operation express by Capt Fraser, Professor Watson &amp; Surgeon General Williams saw all my friends &amp; nurses.</p>
<p>Sunday, 25 April, 1915<br/>Australians made their historic landing at Gaba Tepe to-day.</p>
<p>Worst day I have ever experienced hot wind tearing over desert at terrific rate, the flying sand almost cuts the face tents blown in all directions every thing covered in dust if you get out of the wind flies will eat you this is typical of Egypt.</p>
<p>In the p.m. went to O'Rs to get out of the desert for a while, found Cairo &amp; Shoubra much cooler and hardly any wind although close the desert is about the worst place to be when the weather is hot &amp; windy.  The Veterinary Corp from Mena have come here now and are lying next to us they have done good work so far.</p>
