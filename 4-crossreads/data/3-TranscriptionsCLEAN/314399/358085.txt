Saturday 29 March 1919Very decent day. Went into town & had lunch with the boys from the Nirvana. Went back to camp for tea & then went in again & did train picquet for Hopkins cos I want tomorrow off.
Sunday 30 March 1919Had a look at a game of football & then went out to St Addresse  [Adresse]. Had a sing & a dance & then came home. After getting into bed who should turn up but Bill Cowper. He's back for good. Do me.
