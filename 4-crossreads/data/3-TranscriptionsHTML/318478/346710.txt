<p>Feb. 28th 1919</p>
<p>The twenty eigth (please note coincidence of number of this page) has been cold &amp; bleak with intermittent showers.  My forethought of yesterday in gathering flowers &amp; plants saved the situation and I have had a long day at still life.</p>
<p>The Turk Major left us to-day for Constantinople and before he left made a most elaborate &amp; flowery speech of appreciation of the Australian both as a scrapper and a host.</p>
<p>I managed a pencil portrait of him before he left us which will I suppose go into the archives.  Zeki Bey was his name and a more unassuming little chap one could not find, still a Turk is a Turk and a nation is not made up of exceptions.  Tomorrow's breakfast will be bacon, this staple breakfast food having been docked during Zeki's stay out of deference to his weird religion.</p>
<p>We are supposed to close up this outfit in another two weeks &amp; I am getting worried about the weather.  It may mean staying on and I feel Palestine is calling a bit.  There one does get sun.</p>
<p>Still the weather may tack oop tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W.L.</p>
