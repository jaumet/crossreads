 Big Mail today not yet sorted. Still marking time &amp; as usual did not get away as soon as expected.  Lectured tonight on  Cosack  Cossack posts &amp; Outposts as we have many Reinforcements (to  p  replace the old men) who have had little practical training but they are all triers  four letters 2/1/16- I did send letter with Paper but no Diary   Yes I got Sheepskin from Roger &amp; had him to dinner at Aerodrome.  Just got Australasian of November 20, you see how erratic mails are. Love to all -Frank
