<p>7th L.H. Regt.<br/>30/1/19.</p>
<p>Dear Colonel Arnott</p>
<p>We were not able actually to identify either Morris' or Colonel Harris' grave, as all the crosses and headstones had been removed in the Shell green cemetery except two &ndash; Trooper Ronald of 6th L.H. and Tpr D . . . ton 7th L.H.  The Graves Registration Unit should be able to identify these easily however, as they have all the graves plotted out onto a proper plan, and with a few cross bearings should be able to restore the crosses above every grave.</p>
<p>We are waiting up here at Rafa for our demobilisation, and hope that it may not be too long delayed.  I hope to get leave before long and will try and call in and see you,</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>J.D. Richardson</p>
<p>[Colonel John McLean Arnott CGM and Colonel Dalyell Richardson, both Commanding Officers of 7th Light Horse.]</p>
