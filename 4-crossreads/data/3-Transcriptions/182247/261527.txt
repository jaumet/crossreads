<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Parade 9.45.&nbsp; Caught motor lorry from Sercus to Ypres via Poperinge.&nbsp; Dusty run but much preferable to footing it.&nbsp; Familiar sound of gunfire etc. become new after a good spell away from them.&nbsp; Seems like a lively place.&nbsp; Passed through the dead city of Ypres.&nbsp; Only a shambles with its famous Cloth Hall barely recognisable.&nbsp; Bivouacked behind and to the left of Ypres.&nbsp; Plenty of hostile aircraft about on this sector.&nbsp; Think things portend to the lively side.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Parade 8.30.&nbsp; Spent day on dug-outs for our own comfort.&nbsp; Herb, Don Beaton&nbsp; Snowy and Alex and I spent all day building one to hold 5.&nbsp; It proved very satisfactory and cosy.&nbsp; Nice to be able to lie down on the soft earth again.&nbsp; Feel quite snug and at home in our own little &quot;&#39;ole&quot;.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Went dental.&nbsp; Spent morning messing around in quite true military fashion.&nbsp; 2 pm.&nbsp; Took motor and went to hospital over near Poperinge.&nbsp; After having tea at 4, caught another motor to Rest station.&nbsp; Slept there all night on a real bed with real blankets and covers.&nbsp; Hardly knew what to do with them.&nbsp; Had good night&#39;s rest.&nbsp; Day very dull and cold.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Went to C.G.S. and had tooth fixed up at last.&nbsp; At 1.15 set out, per boot, to return to camp, 10 miles away.&nbsp; Reached there tired and hungry and ready for a good bunch of parcels from home.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Parade 8.&nbsp; Spent day erecting huts for Divisional Headquarters.&nbsp; Turned in early.&nbsp; Had a visit from John who had just come on to the sector and had seen one of our company in the Y.M.C.A. and found out where I was.&nbsp; Handed him some of the good things from home.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Parade as usual.&nbsp; Spent day trimming steel hats with hessian.&nbsp; Not a bad job.&nbsp; Fritz fairly busy with shrapnel.&nbsp; John came over after tea and spent an hour or so with me in dugout.&nbsp; Glad to have him near me again.</td>
