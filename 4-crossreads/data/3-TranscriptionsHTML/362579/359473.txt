<p>Finished up by going out to Myra's   &amp;  had dinner. She also had another visitor a Flying Corp Officer. He is brother to a Mrs Edwards who is staying with her. An awfully nice fellow but very young.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon   &amp;  evening stayed in my room, had a nice fire, so had a busy afternoon mending   &amp;  writing &ndash; also washed my hair. A real cost afternoon, made tea   &amp;  toast. It was a very cold day, so thought best to rest a little.</p>
<p>To-day am on duty all day. We are not busy, so I'm in my office trying answer a few letters   &amp;  write my usual one home.</p>
<p>A number of new sisters have come lately waiting to take our places. Quite a crowd are like myself going on transport.</p>
