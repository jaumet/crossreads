1915June 22 Tue.Up at 5.30 a.m. - shower & 31/2 mile walk round the Island before breakfast. Best time of the day as it gets so hot later- the Nile is very pretty - Yeomanry look well exercising their horses.My correspondence has become somewhat extensive lately & as I acknowledge all letters received, have been rather busy getting off replies. We can now send letters & parcels to Australia free provided they are initialled by a responsible Officer. This will save me quite a small fortune - I guess.
