  
 our chaps got a splinter of a bomb in his leg, it was a lucky escape. 29th. Our bayonet drill was advanced another stage this morning. I had charge of one squad on this work, another shot was fired accidently this morning but luckily no-one was hit. We also had some drill in bombing squad's which is also very interesting. I believe there must have been a Zeppelin up last night, for the aircraft guns were going pretty heavy about 7 oclock or so. There is to be an inspection of helmets & iron rations this afternoon. Capt McVean came back from England this morning. 30th Those who were short of iron rations went up this morning, & got 7 days C.B. a bit hot I reckon.
