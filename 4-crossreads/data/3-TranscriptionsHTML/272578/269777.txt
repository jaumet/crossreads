<p>It was hell while it lasted but he did not succeed in doing much damage. It lasted for 4 hours. Managed to get a bit of tea. Got to bed at 11 oclock.</p>
<p>6th June 1917. Came on duty again at 6 oclock. Fritz shelled around here today. Killed a few of the boys of other batteries. Built a dugout near the telephone station. Fritz started shelling with gas tonight at 12 oclock. Bombardment started at 3.10 this morning while I was on duty. Lets hope the business will be a fine success and our boys can bring fresh fame to Australia. 5 of our staff are going over with the Infantry. Came off at 4 guns rowing like fury.</p>
<p>7th June 1917. Woke up at 9 oclock with the artillery still going strong  we eased up slightly afterwards. The advance at latest reports is going good, our boys have taken Messines &amp; ridge. Lets hope Fritz doesn't counter attack much. But I have confidence in our boys. We had a sad day as we had the first death today in this battery. A fine little fellow being caught in his dugout by a big shell. Went on duty at 12 &ndash; 4 &amp; 8 &ndash; 12.</p>
<p>8th June 1917. Went on at 8 till 12. Rather quiet as far as artillery goes this morning. Although Fritz shelled the position heavily. Fritz also has been attacking the new positions. At 9 oclock at night Fritz attacked new positions heavily which called the wrath of our artillery on his shoulders. Went to sleep at 10 oclock &amp; woke at 4 to go on duty. Parties of Fritz tried to get into new trenches at that time</p>
