<p>Took a long walk around the hill as usual at night commanding a beautiful view of the town in the valley. Had a long talk with a French soldier in the Officer's Training School who gives me all particulars of details of French army</p>
<p>13th August:- Sunday<br/>Duty as usual ([droll?] &amp; monotonous as ever) until 12.30 pm &amp;  afternoon off. A few showers of rain &amp; very fresh. Have lunch in a French Caf&eacute;. Very nice. A train ride to the high hill "Bon Secours"), view the pretty little church, the statue of Joan of Arc, the cemetery &amp; a nice view of the whole town, bridges &amp; river. A beautiful sight with the Cathedral greatly conspicuous. Rouen is certainly a pretty town situated in the valleys. We take a walk</p>
