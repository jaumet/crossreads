F. Lovely Day.
Everyone A.W.L. we carry on OK. C.O. arrives unexpectedly & there is a H--- of a scatter to find anyone. All on booze again. I set out for T'worth alone & buy Red Lamp. Home to read bath & to bed. I am thinking by day & dreaming by night. All the time. The boys get rabbits & the game keepers nearly get them.
