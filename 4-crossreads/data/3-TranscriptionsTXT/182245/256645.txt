Fine &amp; sunny. The horses all went
up to Steenweck to be dipped in
morning, but someone else took
mine up. I camped in my dug
out &amp; read. We had till 4 pm
off in afternoon &amp; I wrote letters.
General Grimwade inspected the
place in afternoon &amp; was very
satisfied with things I think.
Old Fritz was putting some more
over near the battery, but
no damage done. I got a few
papers &amp; some socks from
Linda.
