 27-6-16 Tue 27th Soon after breakfast this morning a Taube passed over us making towards Hill 70 &amp; Kantana.  light clouds were in the sky &amp; we only caught sight of her for a few seconds, but reported it through &amp; a few minutes later we could hear her coming back again, &amp; received orders to stand to our horses we got them off the lines pretty lively, &amp; could hear two planes but could see neither as they were high above the clouds  shortly after we caught sight of our large battle plane coming down in circles, apparently the Taube decided to retire when she caught sight of our plane &amp; did not wait to drop any eggs; 
 I took a walk over to the Field Ambulance soon after to have one of my teeth filled &amp; was given an appointment for next Monday arrived back in camp in time to start off to mend the telephone line to Bde, then it was time for stables;  Had nothing to do this afternoon
