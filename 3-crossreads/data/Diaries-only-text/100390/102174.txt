Night at Matrooh
The little mosque across the ink-blue bay
Gleams in the moon, an alabaster toy;
Like golden fireflies the morse lamps play
Where line on line the pallid tents deploy. 
The moonlight's fingers linger on the sheen
Of silent ?planes, like giant gnats asleep
A cross of blood above a bar of green
The "ship of pain" steals out across the deep.
