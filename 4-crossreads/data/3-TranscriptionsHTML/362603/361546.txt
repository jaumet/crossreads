<p>3.  We have not had any snow yet &amp; the weather is quite mild.  A fortnight   <strike>ago</strike>   early than this last year we had snow &amp; could not be without a fire 6 weeks earlier.  We have only had 2   <u>cool</u>   nights to-date.<br/>I met Wal. Patterson from Brookvale again to-night.  He was over from Park House on Duty.  I have dozens of letters to write &amp; I am trying to do a little reading also.  I had to darn 7 pairs of socks this afternoon, only tiny Holes, but they all take time.  I am going to get another &pound; 10 off the Firm so You can pay it over as soon as You like.  It costs about &pound; 3.10.0 for a weeks leave &amp; I have had about 21 days leave in 3 months (better keep it dark) &amp; it takes money.  I am sure to want some money for X'mas too.  Now, Dad, I told Mum all about My Manx Trip, so I'll not repeat it here.  Ellis &amp; Dave &amp; I are all Tip-top.  We are quite naturalised now as well as climatized so we "carry on."<br/>Remember me to Otto &amp; all the neighbours &amp; to Mr &amp; Mrs Ali &amp; Stephen.<br/>Best Love to You &amp; Kindest regards to all Sincere Friends,<br/>From Your own Son<br/>Harry</p>
