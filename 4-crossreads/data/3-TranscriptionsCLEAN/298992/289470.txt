better get a set printed from them, before they begin to go. The best way to deep the prints could be in a little album I think, as handling too much will very soon spoil them.
Well, Mother its not often I am stuck for news, but I really have nothing to tell you just now. Am quite well, and feeling ready for anything that happens along. Have written often to Joan & Dulcie & received a long letter from Aunt Soph, a few weeks ago. Coleridge dropped in to see me lately, he is in the 45th Battalion. Remember me to any enquirers & tell Bill I hope he is always a good boy & never gives you any trouble. Many Happy Returns of 17th June for Hazel, & you can get her something nice for me.
Heaps of Love to all the family,
Your loving son
Alan.
