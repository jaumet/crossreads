 Messines  Spent a very quiet day mostly on the phone. Fritz put a few cinq.neuf over. Weather very unsettled. Hear there is a raid coming off tonight. Our guns were cutting wire this afternoon.  Was on 4 to 6 this morning. Went down to canteen and heard the 15th were at Spy Farm, and the 8th were at Daylight Corner.
