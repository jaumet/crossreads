[Sunday 11 June 1916]  Bayudat 4 AM a fog came off the coast, & we had to halt, everything was quite wet & we sucked the dew drops to save our Water bottles-At 7.30 the sun came out & soon "hunted all the Pearls of dew away"   By then the enemy had been alarmed & we were fired on by about 80 men with Camels, 2 horses wounded. We destroyed the Wells burnt the Native Mia Mias & started off across the Desert home- via Og----a.  By then both Horses & men were shewing Signs of fatigue & want of Water- so we kept on, arriving in Camp at Midnight - 40 miles without unsaddling for 27 hours.
