<p>May 1915<br/>treated very well, getting 3-5 piastre tickets to get what we wanted with.  There were several wounded Australians back from the Dardanelles &amp; we had a long yarn with them.  Came off duty at 12 o'clock.  The 7th Lancaster Fusiliers all got their ammunition &amp; marched out from the Barracks at midnight.  .  The Herts Yeomanry are quartered here now.</p>
<p>Sunday May 2nd<br/>Fairly warm day.  Had no duty during the day &amp; went up town for tea.  There was a big crowd in the town.  At 10 oclock 3 of us were put on the Esbekieh Carocol  We had a couch each to sleep on &amp; were not called out once.</p>
<p>Monday 3rd<br/>Came off the Carocol at 7am.  The 1st L H Brigade relieved us at 2 oclock, so we packed up &amp; went back to Maadi.  It was hard to leave.</p>
