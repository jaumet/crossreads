  
 Tuesday 25 September 1917 Still a good gale blowing & as our boat had when leaving Sydney a fair list to starboard, we pitch & toss quietly all the time.  Still I cannot feel any effects now.  Brush & comb stolen during night - why oh why can people not keep the 8th commandment! The Southern Cross still shines bright in the sky & I say goodnight to it & to Australia leaning over the rail watching the waves chasing one another in endless procession.
