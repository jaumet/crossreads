<p>Sunday 11 June 1916<br/>Thundery with one or two sharp showers, but sunny for the rest of the time. Heavy rain during the night making the place very sticky &amp; muddy under-foot. The work of the school was continued, no difference being made for the Sabbath. Use of live bombs &amp; grenades the main work. Leo came over for a short time in the afternoon &amp; I was glad to have a yarn.  &pound;5 handed to him for safe keeping during my visit to the front line.</p>
