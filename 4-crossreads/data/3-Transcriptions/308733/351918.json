<p>could be over in London in a day.</p>
<p>We had to get rid of our cameras, they wont stand them over here, it gave me a sharp pang to part with mine, I had so looked forward to taking snaps over here. Today we all had a fine warm bath and clean clothes at a specially fitted place a little distance away, a great comfort. It seemed funny to be amongst whole houses again for <u>every</u> house in the Artillery zone has a hole of some sort in the roof or sides.</p>
<p>I know what April showers are now it has showered off and on, mostly on for a fortnight and is raining solidly now, it makes everything very much more unpleasant in this flat heavy land. It's a great country though and I hope you will see it some day, the fields, roads and planted trees are an education in themselves which ought to bear some fruit from the minds of those of us who live to get back. I hear things are much improved at Liverpool and the men more orderly, it was not a difficult thing to improve on.</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you shortly<br/>With best love to Annie and the Kiddies<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>Don</p>
