<p>December 15<br/>Tomorrow when we leave, men of the 3rd Division arrive here &ndash; their third resting in this area.  May those billeted here by [be] those who remember their nationality.</p>
<p>33.<br/>The march a wounderful success, a perfect day, and an enjoyed march.  Passing Samur by one mile, a lorry took our packs, a march of singing progression, loved melodies &amp; old songs, full choruses, and Gyppo band-singing.  Marching by Blue H., he the song leader:  his voice full and rich of harmony, and full of mood.  The masterpiece of the march,</p>
<p>I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel,<br/>I feel like the morning star,<br/>I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel<br/>I feel like the morning star"<br/>"<br/>"<br/>"<br/>"<br/>My Mother told me,<br/>That she would buy me,<br/>A rubber dollie,<br/>If I were good:<br/>But when I told her,<br/>I was a soldier,<br/>She wouldn't buy me<br/>A rubber doll.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the roads again.</p>
<p>Wavrans<br/>December 16<br/>34.<br/>After-entry, 32.<br/>And early this morning, waking us at 6.30 - because it was so greatly cold &ndash; she brought us caf&eacute;, in the candlelight her sweet face was smiling as she poured it to six little cups on a small tray, we sitting up fresh from sleep, even so early she was wearing her snowy cap, its white stiff bow compleating the framing of her face, saying good-bye she blessed us with her line, a blessing worth the full treasuring.</p>
<p>35.<br/>At Wavrans, after a full morning's marching, also here close about 1st, 3rd and 4th Battalions.  Saw for a while Alek Wilson and Malcolm Miller of 4th Details.  A lovely morning &ndash; the early afternoon cloudy skies, and faint falling of pellety snow, now the sun is out of the sky the night will see a heavy fall.  Again for Billets we're lucky &ndash; eight of us in a small luxuriously straw'd stable.  Madame has invited us to share the fire of her kitchen, so the whole eight of us are in possession.</p>
<p>The rumour has been all the afternoon of reveille at 2 a.m. for marching to entrain, now word of a 7 a.m. breakfast.</p>
