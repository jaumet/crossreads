  
 S.S. Finland. Off Holyhead March 6/16 
 My dear Ferguson 
 I can quite sympathise with the Children of Israel & understand why they did not please Jehovah.  Forty years in the wilderness  was  tough!  Of course our pilgrimage has not been so bad or so long:  but its been bad enough & long enough.  It  seems  ages since I left Sydney.  And it has been  over   6 weeks ! 
 Through Canada we travelled in state.  The Government cars - 2 - at our disposal & everything very well done.  From Vancouver to the Atlantic seaboard all the country is covered with snow.  The Rockies are a glorious sight - through a steam-heated window.  But when as was the case with some unfortunates whom we saw, you are snow bound for 23 days.  Well then they are  some  mountains.  You bet
