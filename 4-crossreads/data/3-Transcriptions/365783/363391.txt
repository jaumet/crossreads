<p>It has been very windy during the last few days &ndash; the dust gets into ones eyes &amp; makes them very sore &ndash; the annual rainfall in their part of the world amount to about 1 inch, we have had none since we have been here.  In spite of the small rainfall everything is beautifully green wherever there is irrigation &amp; it is wonderful how quickly the crops come on.   Some of the men have scattered some oats seed in a circle round their tents &amp; have now quite a decent little green patch in the midst of the sandy waste of the desert   Some of our convalescent patients have done the same round their wards; others have circled them with sones in some cases quite artistically   I am as a rule pretty tired each night &amp; generally turn in about 9.   It is a fairly long day from 6 in the morning &amp; buzzing about all the time.<br/>I must now end up with best love to all &amp; hoping you are all real well<br/>Yr. loving husband<br/>Will.</p>
