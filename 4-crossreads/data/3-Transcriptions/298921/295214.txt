<p>August, 1915<br/>Tuesday 31<br/>3 weeks today in bed, getting as far as a pig &ndash;<br/>Hear our Brigade is to come back to be reorganised &ndash; as so many casualties, this may mean I get my Captaincy &amp; will not go back to Gallipoli for some time &ndash; or 90 Spencer Browne. Warm countries agree with me &amp; Egyptian summers have no terrors like a Peninsular Winter.<br/>Tell Joe a Periscope would be a good thing for duck shooting our men use them to watch fights among themselves &ndash; I was amused at Anzac to see one chap on the outside of ring run away &amp; come back with a Periscope so he could see the fight better &ndash; I mean <u>fists</u></p>
