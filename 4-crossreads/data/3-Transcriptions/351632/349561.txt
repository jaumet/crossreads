In some cases, I believe the majority, they had been put on by the patients themselves.  One man told me he had put one on his arm himself.  They were all in severe pain from the constriction and in all cases where amputation was required, the presence of these tourniquets made it necessary to amputate much higher than one would otherwise have done.  But no doubt their lives had been saved by the tourniquets.  There was very little evidence of any skilled treatment before they arrived on board.  Naturally the German Surgeon had been very much shaken and handicapped.  His station in action was the stokehold, which was uninjured.

The steering party remained in the tiller flat &amp; were unhurt.
