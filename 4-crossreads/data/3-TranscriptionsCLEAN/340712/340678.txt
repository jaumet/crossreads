The Cigarettes were exquisite     I am not a Cigarette fiendbut I relished those. The Cigars, (you have a good memory) reminded me of old times.The bandage was well to time too, for I had a patient the very next day, with a ripped hand. Also, when I said to a fellow&#151;"Try a date" he said "Eh, what? a date". They are the first I think any of us had seen since leaving Australia.25th June:The cake was right-o, also the tinned chicken.By GeorgeI I wish you could have been here to see me opening up the parcels. One views all the things from home from a different standpoint that we have been wont. It is because news seems so slow and the things, once ordinary and within easy reach, are now far awar and hard to obtain.26th June:There seems always to be a call for one when one wants to write. I cannot remember the last letter that I was able to write straight off. Last night (about midnight or 1 o'clock) during a particularly hellish bombardment by our guns, one of the drivers,who had just returned from the pits whence he had been with ammunition, ripped his hand, or had it bitten by a horse, I forget which. Of course your medical outfit had to be requisitioned. They brought him to me and woke me up&#151;the bombardments don't, we are getting too used to them. I fixed him up alright&#151;-though ointment is running short. The "Vet" has promised me some,however, This morning, I had to accompany a prisoner (as evidence) to the Colonel. I had put him under open arrest because of a flagrant act of disobedience, the culmination of several weeks of "trying to see how far he could go".
