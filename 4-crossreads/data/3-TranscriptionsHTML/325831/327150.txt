<p>2.<br/>I had great hopes of seeing Tom at Ypres, but by the time I had rejoined the 1st Division had already moved towards The Somme, &amp; we were preparing to follow. We had to march for three or four days before we reached the selected entraining station. We crossed the frontier, &amp; following a roundabout course (to escape the traffic) passed close to the town of Bailleul. At one point we were only 15 miles from Calais, &amp; here we crossed the beautiful broad, tree-lined road, down which the Huns had at one time hoped to swarm to the coast. At one of our halting places we were billeted in a large barn, &amp; while resting for a day or so were given our votes on conscription. The polling booth was the front room of a comfortable brick farmhouse. The Nos were very noisy &amp; in a big majority&mdash;everywhere it seemed the same, at the Base, &amp; wherever the men gathered together. As in Australia, there were no sensible reasons for doing so. Hughes' appeal was received very coldly, &amp; even a statement from General Birdwood, which showed so plainly the wisdom &amp; necessity of it all, did not seem to influence many. Tom said it was the same thing among the Batteries, so you can guess what a surprise it was to us to hear "Yes" had won among the troops. We were of course pleased, though doubtful. But many noisy "Noes" must have registered a quiet Yes vote. Probably the Light Horses in Egypt were more sensible. Certainly the vote was not taken at an auspicious moment in France. The men expected a rest after their Pozieres battle, instead of which they were given two months at Ypres, &amp; their rest postponed until after their second appearance on the Somme was over. It is easier to blame our own authorities for</p>
