ABUSITTA
Had a shave & wash over in a quart of water hair cut close & a good flea hunt so am fresher. Very hot & crops ripening fast.
My Squadron doing pick & shovel work making road over WADI. Enemy plane over again but we have shot down 3. 3rd Brigade captured a Troop of Lancers yesterday, Horses & all. don't think Turkish Cavalry have much GUTS.
[The following sentence crossed through.]  They serve their GUNS well & are superior in the air coz of better machines (don't repeat this).
