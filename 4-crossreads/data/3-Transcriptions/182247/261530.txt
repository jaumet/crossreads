<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">up, with what strength I had left in my poor eyes, and there, bending over me, was Walter Willey.&nbsp; He told me he would get a stretcher party for me.&nbsp; I lay there suffering hell for what seemed an age, and then he came back with a party of Red Cross men.&nbsp; They stripped me and bandaged me as well as they could and, after putting me in the stretcher, set out with me, with Walter Willey as one of the bearers.&nbsp; I remember nothing more of this day until I awoke in a cot in Liverpool Merchants Hospital, Etaples, feeling very groggy and sorry.&nbsp; Admitted to Hospital with right eye completely destroyed, fractured rib and several body wounds.&nbsp; Condition serious.&nbsp; (This is the bulletin of my case at time of admission).</td>
