<p>Steenvoorde 21/10/16 In billets all day.  In the afternoon rode into the town and saw the General about more officers but there is a deadlock and though the establishment is 34, I have to run the battalion with a total of 14 deducting the 5 on H.Q this leaves 9 company officers for 800 men.  Steenvoorde is a little cobblestoned country village with some old twisting streets and a small market square.  Had a good ride along the road and back.  After ten all the ballot papers came in and had perforce to be sorted and bagged up.  The result will I am sure be a great and overwhelming majority of "noes". Held orderly room and sentenced one man to 21 days H.P. No.2 for being absent without leave from marching off and dismissed a charge against one of the old chaps who was suddenly taken ill and fell out without leave.  Fulton and Groves put up stars today.  In the evening the move order arrived and I issued the necessary orders in connection with the march.  We form part of the Brigade column of route and clear the starting point at 11am. Buysscheure is our destination where our billet is a good little place and the old people kind and considerate.  They speak Flemish and French and their rooms are most abundantly decorated with crucifixes and pictures of a religious nature.  The houses of the south are said to show quite as conspicuous an absence of these outward devotional aids.  All the Coy commanders came in at 9 pm for supper and we discussed tomorrow's plans and arrangements.  This pleasant country is a charming change to the uninteresting land around Ypres.  Cold chill night.</p>
