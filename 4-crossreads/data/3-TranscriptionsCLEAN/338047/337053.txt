On arrival at Hastings we caught the tram to Hollington, & was introduced to Nance's father & mother.  They had been looking after a lot of my things while I was in France.  I was surprised to find the number of socks that  they had been keeping for me. We went for a walk along the front esplanade - or whatever they call it, & saw a stranded German submarine which had broken loose when being towed to England & washed up there.  Nance bought me a photo of it. 
 May 31 We went to Hastings again for a walk.  We went along the "front", & I noticed that the trams are propelled by three different means.  In one part the electric wires are overhead.  For a little way the same trams run by petrol motor, while along the front, the power is obtained from plugs set in the ground
