He says they have been acting as stretcher bearers lately for his battalion.  A number of patients left the hospital to day including Smith the draughts player<br/>Black/Green Batt.<br/>The "Daily Express" of yesterday announce the capture of Bagdad by the Brittish.  It is a crushing blow to German aims and an irretrievable blow to Turkish Prestage.  It is a very old and important city and crowns with success the long British campaign in Mesopotamia.  The British have had another success at Bapaume capturing a fortress with prisoners and booty.  The French also have succeses on champagne, and the russians in Persia.</p>
