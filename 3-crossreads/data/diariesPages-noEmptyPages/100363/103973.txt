Even the small boys clothes are repaired with multicolored patches and the women, though appearing as if a good bath would do them a deal of good, are bedecked in a variety of colors, like a tea cosy. The green cactus hedged roads, along which a number of donkeys are now coming, heavily laden with golden oranges, wind across the fields now asprout with barley.
At every turn there is some new interest to absorb one; even to the primitive tilling. All sorts of beasts of burden are utilised and it is not infrequent to observe a camel yoked alongside a tiny donkey, drawing the primitive plough. I secured a very interesting series of pictures of the light Horse amidst these quaint surroundings and returned to Deiran 5 pm. 
I have made arrangements to visit the front line positions tomorrow and will leave by car at 7 am.
