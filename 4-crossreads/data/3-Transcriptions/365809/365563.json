<p>London<br/>30th Sept. 1917</p>
<p>My Dear Judge,<br/>A lucky run of mails recently brought me your two letter of July19 and 31 of which the latter apparently came via America as it did the journey in just under eight weeks: and that I fancy is shorter than the trip round the Cape.</p>
<p>My presence in London is explained by the fact that near the end of last month my Colonel thought it would be better for me to get well properly and faster than I was doing at the front. Consequently I went into hospital and was sent to England for massage and electrical treatment to revive the muscles of my thigh which had atrophied through disuse. The weakness of the muscles made the knee joint weak and that hindered me in my work. After the gales of August 27-30  had subsided we crossed over and I went to one of the R.F.C. hospitals in London &ndash; at Bryanston Sq. then on the 17th. Of this month a medical board gave me a month's convalescence  with treatment and that is how things stand at present. The treatment is having the desired effect &ndash; if rather more slowly than I would like.. But I have learnt the futility of trying to rush these things by now.</p>
<p>Soon after arriving in London I went to Horseferry Rd. and there learnt of Keith's departure for Sydney</p>
