<p>My squad was again fortunate during the night, having so many Bearers we were not required very many times, but the heat &amp; smell of the place was awful.</p>
<p>24th September 1917.<br/>A fairly quiet morning,  news to hand of 3 wounded &amp; one killed in C. section. Pte. McGoldrick, Mole &amp; Rayner &amp; the latter was Phil Murray. It is when our own men are killed that we feel it most. At night the rush was rather severe,  scores of wounded passed through our hands:  we had English Ambulance Bearers helping us also.    The following day, the 25th was one of the worst days that our Bearers have ever experienced. The shelling of our lines was hellish,  never will I forget it. It was so bad that 300 yds below our post we were obliged to place the wounded in a big crater for shelter. The dugouts were all full of men,  of course very little shelter. The road we usually carried down was in flames so we thought discretion was the better part of valour &amp; that's the reason why we kept the wounded back. Naturally the smoke etc. drew Fritz's fire &amp; it was hell. Only those who go in the line can realize what it is like. I saw quite a number of men killed, our 3 squads did what we could, bandaging some of the wounded chaps, horrible news to hand in regard to our bearers,  three killed in one squad,  Henry Mercer, Mat Doil &amp; Lue Ballard, but we must not worry, it is the work of war &amp; if we intend to carryon with our work, we must keep a stout heart. The fourth man, Bill Hippersley, had a miraculous escape,  he was knocked spinning yards &amp; received  a slight wound in the foot. Of course he was suffering from shock,  I saw him shortly afterwards &amp; he was deaf. From all appearances he will get along all right. (We have since heard that he is in Blighty).</p>
<p>Really I do not know how to write an account of today's doings,  it is too awful to think about. After a few hours the shelling quietened down slightly so of course the bearers got to work to get the wounded away. There was terrible congestion at first but gradually the conditions became better. On the way back to the crater our squad consisting of Fred Wiggins &ndash; Wally Miller &ndash; Hue Reid &amp; myself came across a chap suffering from shell shock,  it took 6 of us to hold him,  everytime he heard the sound of a gun he struggled &amp; kicked like mad.</p>
