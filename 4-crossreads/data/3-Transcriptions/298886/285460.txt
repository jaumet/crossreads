He asked 10 piastres and for once I had not the heart to beat him down I concluded that he had justly earned that amount.

<p>We left C Squadron behind at Asyut and travelled on south this morning We have the Brigadier and his Staff in front. Since we left Tukh-El-Kheil we have been going at a good pace along the roads but since the Brigadier came in front the pace has been chronic &ndash; too slow.
