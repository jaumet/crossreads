7 am. Find out now that not feeling too well. Very little to knock me up. Quiet morning & Lily Schwerer arrives at hospital at 3 pm. After looking around the wards & theatre, have tea & take a walk, still drizzling rain (miserable day & night) pulling up a Churchyard. Rather romantic, love on a tombstone. Anyway does me & a good time, after which set forth home. Having schemed to get out (No Pass) have trouble getting in. climb the fence about a mile up the road & after many falls in mud, over prickly bushes etc, eventually roam in, wet & muddy & get to bed.
