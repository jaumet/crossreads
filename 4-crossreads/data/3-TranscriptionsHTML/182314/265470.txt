<p>Dear Jack</p>
<p>Only this morning I saw &amp; heard the 2<sup>nd</sup> Bn. They were marching beautifully. My Adjutant was with me &amp; I at once gave him orders to get a list of all men able to play band instruments &amp; also any drummers. (The 2<sup>nd</sup> Bn also had a side drum band for marching). The idea of getting the names was to get going with a Band at once. I really think it necessary: I may not get a good band but it surely will help the marching.</p>
