<p>5/8/18<br/>Villers-Bretonneux<br/>The night was quiet except was a few salvoes of gas shells. Once again the roads were thronged &amp; busy in preparation for the attack. The noise of tanks, tractors, guns and transport getting into position could be plainly heard in our front line and must have been audible to the Boche. Thousands of shells are being dumped in little heaps and camouflaged. There were several little fires burning in Marcelcave. Corpl. Wigger of our Transport was up forward carting S.A.A. up for Bde and somehow got out into No Mans Land being lost. The 21st post put a bullet through him. Got up at about 8.30. We lit a fire to create a draught through the dugout as the air was so thick that you could cut</p>
