8 May 1918 WednesdayLeave.   Cairo.  Very busy getting Kit etc grand being with the wee wife again-   She has made many nice friends.  Took her to Doctor, arranged re a Flat & also for room at Anglo American Hospital.  Found as usual my Kit had been robbed that I left at Moorcar.  Brought some Jordan water to christen the Trumpeter with, Dolly shares the flat with Col Mc Laren's wife, ie Doctor & whose wife was a Sister (Nurse) so she will be in good company.
