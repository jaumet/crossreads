<p>raiders which later would hardly think the possible booty worth the risk</p>
<p>of having huge boulders rolled down onto them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practically no level land exists for agriculture and to over-</p>
<p>come this xx difficulty the hill and mountain sides have been carefully</p>
<p>terraced, stone walls being employed to hold up the soil and prevent it</p>
<p>being washed away.&nbsp; This gives the whole country side a corrugated</p>
<p>appearance.&nbsp; Apart from everyday necessities in the way of vegetables</p>
<p>and fruit, olives appear to be the only article grown to any extent.&nbsp; From</p>
<p>the appearance of these olives which are small and blackish I should</p>
<p>imagine that they would be used mainly for oil making and not for table</p>
<p>use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The roads throughout the Riviera are excellent and the grad-</p>
<p>ing is a master piece of engineering.&nbsp; La Corniche the famous scenic</p>
<p>road is all that it is depicted, whilst the numerous mountain roads are</p>
<p>also rich in rugged mountain scenery and panoramic views of villages in</p>
<p>the valleys and occasional glimpses of the towns on the coast line.&nbsp; For</p>
<p>nervous people these motor car trips over the mountain roads are not to</p>
<p>be recommended.&nbsp; The Italian and French (mainly the former) drivers are</p>
<p>marvels at handling their cars but they cannot be persuaded to go at a</p>
<p>moderate speed and are never satisfied unless their car is &quot;all out&quot;</p>
<p>which for these high powered cars means about 50 miles per hour on the</p>
<p>flat.&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind it on straight roads but when they take these hair-</p>
<p>pin bends on the mountain roads on two wheels I am not so keen about it.</p>
<p>One day we had xx a driver whose idea of taking a sharp turn in the road</p>
<p>was to rush at it, throw his wheel round, at the same time applying his</p>
<p>foot break so that instead of following the arc of the front wheels, the</p>
<p>rear wheels locked and skidded over sideways whereupon he loosed his</p>
<p>break and carried on.&nbsp; This may be alright at the Olympic Games but</p>
<p>when the road is hewn out of the side of a mountain which rises sheer</p>
<p>up on one side and leaves a drop of a couple of thousand feet on the other</p>
