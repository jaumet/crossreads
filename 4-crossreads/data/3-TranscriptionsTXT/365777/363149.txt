been a great success. the hun has been completely surprised & fleeing for their lives. Our boys are meeting with practically no opposition. We are now moving at the gallop along the main road running from Villers Brettoneux towards Saint Quinton. A strange sight that meets the eye as far as the eye can reach both ahead & to the rear, is one long line of wagons, guns ect.
