<p>the town.  The church proved to be a very fine building with a splendid tower.  Some of the windows were really beautiful quite as good as any I have seen in France so far.  We stayed awhile &amp; listened to the service the singing sounded beautiful.  Later we visited a few of the shops, bought some odds &amp; ends, sampled their beere &amp; met Parisian Bock which we had not seen since we left this area 12 months ago.  On our return to our billet which was once a pigstye divided by a partition we found the other Sgts in a joyful mood which developed into a series of raids until about 11.30 P.M.  The partition dividing us into two parties was the origin of the affair &amp; it took a long time next morning to sort out our different belongings, blankets puttees &amp; clothing being mixed up together, altogether a pleasant evening.  Hop picking is in full swing in the neighbourhood the first time I had actually witnessed it.</p>
