 Tuesday March 27.1917 The weather is very changeable.  Rain early last night, freezing late in the night and snowing late this morning. The papers came to hand this morning. The "Sunday Herald" says Fighting continues to be more stubborn along the Cambrai, St. Quentin and La Fere line, &amp; especially towards the South it is severe.  But for the inundations created by the enemy the French claim that La Fere would be in their hands by now.  The banks of the Oise has been reached N. of La Fere.  This shows that the famous Moy road between La Fere and St. Quentin has been cut.  There is yet however no definite indication that the "Hindenburg" line has now been reached, but it is probably. The Russians have inflicted another defeat on the Turks in Persia and have occupied Kerind which the turks set on fire.  Socialist members of the Reichstag paint vivid pictures of the misery of the peoples &amp; hold the Kaiser &amp; Chancellor guilty of the death &amp; misery of millions.
