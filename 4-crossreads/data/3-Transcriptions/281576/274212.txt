<p>Thur. May 10.  Last night was quite exciting.  We had quite settled down to sleep when bang! came about a dozen Fritz shells.  Just got settled down again when the Serg. rushed in &amp; told us to put on our Gas Helmets as the wind was favourable for Fritz.  I was sleeping between Bricky Howard &amp; Prescott.  Bricky slept peacefully through it all.  Prescott suffered from nightmare &amp; sung out in his sleep "Oh, this war, this awful war!"  Altogether it was a most eventful night. 18 of our chaps, Billy May, Snowy Atherton Towney, Ross, Stan Wright among them went out to the A.D.S. about 8 o'clock.  This morning we pitched Tents &amp; unloaded waggons.  It is quite hot &amp; the crowd are getting quite tanned.</p>
<p>Fritz had a Balloon up &amp; soon sent a number of shells around our Camp.  Several motor Lorries were coming along the road &amp; the way they broke the speed limit was real amusing.  About 20 men got knocked &amp; we had a busy time for a few hours.  A 2nd Division Transport sergeant was killed.  Hippersly was at work in the Cookhouse when a lump of shrapnel came through &amp; hit him on the Leg.  Three motor Amb. were smashed up &amp; had to be towed to the workshop.  We fell in at 5 o'clock for Gas Helmet inspection &amp; after fooling around  till nearly 8, we set off for the Line.  Stan Wright, Billgy May &amp; party at the A.D.S. made us some cocoa which we greatly appreciated.<br/> [Paper with the word Bullecourt obscuring part of page]</p>
