Tuesday 21st March
General G Djafer left for Sultan's palace to-day.He gave me his address & I gave him mine;  we are to correspond.  My last conversation when I took him in a sleeping draught the night before last was rather long.  He has great faith in Turkey's power to carry on, & in Bulgaria's.  The discipline of the Germans is, he says, immense.Men & officers are perpetually in the trenches for months at a time.
