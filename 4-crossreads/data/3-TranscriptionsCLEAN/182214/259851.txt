  
 We got leave to go to Ferry post once a week for a bathe but Scotty & I used to go in every sunday after dinner so we only go half a day & moreover we had to walk 12 miles back again as there were not anything running on the light railway  we enjoyed these trips & generally visited the A.I.F. canteen & have a feed of tin fruit & biscuits we also saw big Transports going through the canal full of English troops going to Mespotamia & other places abroad, they would cheer us & clap their hands the Australians would do the same. We had a quiet time till Anzac day when we had a glorious feed. I say this with full permission of the men who have always claimed it as the best feed.
