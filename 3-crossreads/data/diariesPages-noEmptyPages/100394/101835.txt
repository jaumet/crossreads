July 13I am now at O.P. on telephone duties permanently. There are only Bdr Hilder and Gunners Carr Wheeler, Burling and myself here. We have an OK position in a fine old house. Beds, tables chairs fireplaces &c and living in great style. It is a young fortress but we are likely to get shelled out any day with coal boxes and whiz bangs. It has been awfully quiet today Hardly a shot fired

July 14
We were up most of the night firing There was an awful din all night. This morning I walked about 3 ½ m. into Enquinghem to get ourselves some supplies as we cook our own food. No sleep again tonight as we have to stand to again Had letter from home. Sunday – This is a much hotter part of the front and we expect something big tonight so no more sleep.

July 15
We have to move out again tonight to a new position. We are very sorry to lose this Camp as it is so comfortable. Had letter from home today and also wrote home. A tremendous bombardment going on tonight on our right and that is where we are going. This is the third night I have had without sleep and poor food. I am beginning to feel the strain and my belt has shortened.

July 16
We got away about midnight and landed in our camp about 7 a.m. We have no cover whatever as it is only a temporary camp. We are shooting away barb wire entanglements for our boys to charge tonight. We have 77 guns on 1000 yds front They shelled us badly this afternoon very close to us but so far no damage. It is raining now and very uncomfortable. No sleep for days. We are near Fleurbaix. Had another letter from home. Our boys suffered a number of casualties last night.
