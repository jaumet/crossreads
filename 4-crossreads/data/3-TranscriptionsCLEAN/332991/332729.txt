  
 a parcel from Miss Irene Ping [?] of Merrigum, containing one large scarfe.  It will come in very handy this cold weather when travelling at night.  It is one of the misfortunes of the army that the soldier has to work 7 days a  week.  Yesterday (Sunday) I was working all day and part of the night.  In fact I did more work yesterday, than I had done in a month previously. To day I oil painted one limber wagon and two cookers. 
 Tuesday Feb. 30. 1917 Continuous light misty rain all day from breakfast time till dark.  As it was too dirty to do any painting to day I was put on nailing up new canvas on the side of the stable. This afternoon Mr Cox who is now O.C. of H.Q. Details came out here
