 20/9/15 Gallipoli Stand to arm 4.15 and as cold as can be . Pitch dark and star lit when I rose and as I put my head out of the blanket door a bullet went "phut " into the earth onli a few inch off . From where I do n't know but it was a narrow shave . A monitor put shell into some posit up Suvla way . The sound "bang , paus , plonk" . This morn wash shave and clean teeth in a cup or two of water . This is as per usual . A peculiar bomb affair in Lone Pine . A new man in the trench lit a bomb but seem to have no power to throw it gaze at it in a mesmeris sort of way . It burst and kill him and two other wound sever more . In the fire line this morn yarn to the "head " . All merri and profan bright
