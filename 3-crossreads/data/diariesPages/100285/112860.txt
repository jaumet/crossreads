20th. Rose rather earlier than usual this morning 7.30 slipped down to breakfast thinking to find the room empty but on the contrary it was full so I gained very little by it after dining my mate I went down town for a stroll slipped in to see the girls for a minute after this we went out to Roath Park Lake they are both very pretty the flowers are something lovely the finest dahlias I have ever seen are in these gardens, Anderson wanted to catch the 1 oclock train so we hurried back had dinner at the Louis then round to our hotel over to the station but arrived there just about 3 minutes too late.
