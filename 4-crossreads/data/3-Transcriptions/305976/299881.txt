<p>animals in the world the Mule wins. For a time after we were mounted there were Mules &amp; the boys everywhere. The remount boys rounded us up again. Fine horsemen these fellows. Saw Tom disappearing over horizon on the neck of a Mule. One of the Mules [indecipherable] caught in Red's belt &amp; he thought the Mule was trying to have a meal from him.<br/>Eventually we got into formation but all day these dam mules played up. They have a mouth like iron &amp; have formed opinion that only thing to do when they bolt is to <strike>sight</strike> sit tight &amp; ride them. Remount boys tell us they have just arrived &amp; need breaking in. I believe it.<br/>Barnsfather would have found some good material for his sketches could he have seen us today.</p>
