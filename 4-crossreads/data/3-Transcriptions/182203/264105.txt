I quite expected one from home but was disappointed &ndash; must wait a little longer.<br/>I'm most distressed at not hearing from or of J &ndash; yet. I have a great battle to keep myself from thinking the worse &ndash; suppose shall receive an explanation some day. Fortunately, we have plenty of work &amp; not much time to waste on thinking. Dont worry about me because I'm very well and quite understood when we parted that I should have to cultivate plenty of patients.<br/>The weather has been much brighter lately, so have managed to go out</p>
