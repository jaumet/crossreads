Pioneers who had an officer killed today. We then came out on the main Bailleul road where there was plenty of traffic and so home. In the evening one of our Lewis gunners from La Creche came back and I asked him how they got on for fuel. "Good!" he says, "it's a case of ?hold out your bag, Digger?, the Aussies fill it"!. Mr. Leon Barbier had afternoon tea with us. 
Am suffering from a cold due to getting suddenly away from the warmth of braziers. The stoves we have send out an acrid stifling smoke that well nigh blinds one and French coal burnt in open braziers emits carbonic acid gas dangerously. Awarded punishment to some drunk A.W.L's.. The word "set" is acquiring great popularity just lately. It is used to imply "alright" or "all correct". The whole camp after dark is carefully screened to keep any lights from showing. Our wet canteen seems to be doing brisk business.
