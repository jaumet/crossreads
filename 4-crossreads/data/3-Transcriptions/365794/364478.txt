<p>Sunday 17th March 1917 [1918]<br/>A day to be remembered long.  One of those pretty soft blue sunny days, large white clouds lying in big masses overhead &amp; the reflection of the palms in the water just perfect.<br/>Mr. Blundell &amp; I rode back - &amp; there too &ndash; together &amp; had long talk, he is nice I fancy but no opinion yet until I know him better.  A merry party we made with the familiar "coo-ee" waking the echoes of the ancient tombs of the dead bulls of 3,000 years ago.  Such gay laughter &amp; singing as we ride through the ruins of Memphis &amp; stand on the statue of Ramses II to be photographed.  Back to A.S.C. 6 p.m., dinner, church 7.30 p.m., room packed, sermon - "forgetfulness of God by us all".  Back to Cairo in car 9 p.m.</p>
