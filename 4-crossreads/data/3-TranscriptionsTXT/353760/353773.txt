V.Roses are beauty, but I never seeThose blood drops from the burning heart of JuneGlowing like thought upon the living treeWith a pity that they die so soon,Die into petals, like those roses old,Those women, who were summer in men's heartsBefore the smile upon the Sphinx was coldOr sand had hid the Syrian & his arts.Oh myriad dust of beauty that lies thickUnder our feet that not a single grainBut stirred and moved in beauty & was quickFor one brief moon and died nor lived again.But when the moon rose lay upon the grassPasture to living beauty, life that was.J. Masefield31.12.17

Opened December 2, 1917, in Billets, Quehen Isques, D.R.S., 8 kilos from Boulogne
1.A sunny windy day, to the high hill nearby, for a walk.  A clear blue sky, white clouds like great galleons sailing across, their shadows richly chequering the small hill, meadows and low valleys.
Evening:  the afternoon with Frank S. to Courcelette, then to the third estaminet for Cafe et Curacao, a continuing of the walk, then back to second estaminet and tea, savoury omelette, chips, Bread, Butter and Apple Jelly.  Met there Roy F., Arthur T. and Charlie.  A long yarning, with Arthur, of models generally, or Greek and Aegyptian legend, of the beauty of the Venus de Milo and de Medici - opposed to the David of Michael Angelo, the old argumenting of the two beauties, of the woman, of the man.  So to the third est. - all five of us with two men of the Transport, cafe et curacao, again to the second, Red wine and sugar.
Then in the clear cold night a quick steady walking to Billets, so to bed, reading "The Shadow Line".
Mail - T.L.S. - the first receiving of it on a Sunday.
