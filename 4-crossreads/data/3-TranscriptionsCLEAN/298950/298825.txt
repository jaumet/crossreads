  
 Camp Comandant & all the higher Military Officials of this Camp.  On account of the I Camp Exchibition had proved a great suxcess, a comittee had gathered wich held another, in a structure build by a Internee Syndicate called Skating Ring.  Charge of admittance wher 3d each person.  This also proved a great suxcess.  The Camp Comandant having gratiously given permission to the Soldier Guard to view same, about 50 soldiers a time.  Mostly all exhibits wher sold to Officers & Soldiers, as ready cashe wher much in need in Camp.  From Chrismas 1916 untill N.year 1917, we also wher permitted to burn our lamps in the barracks untill 11.30 p.m.  On New years night untill 12.30 a.m. New years Night their was a well patronised Masquerade Ball in Skating Rink.  New years day turned out a day as usual.  The same class of food.  In fact holidays are no exception to food ration with the exception of the Chrismas Bar instead of Tea.  The Cinematograph & Theater wher crowdet allmost nightly from Chrismas Eve untill January 1st.  The amount of Internees held in Australia amounted to just above 5000.  I forgot to mention that on ende November 24 Internee wher exchanged with Australians held captive in Germany.  The Camp Band give them a hearty send-off.  They left Liverpool for Germany via America.  Early in Decemb. 1916 A Internee got shot in the Arm by guard, for going near the Water tap, after first signal, to get redy for the night.  Their never has been any instructiones given to Internees, that it was forbidden to get Water after the first signal.  However this acted to us all better than any other urgent Notice.
