Aug 17 Albertarrived last night and are camped near a long 12" Naval Gun on a railway mounting which was firing as we passed & nearly sent the horses silly
Have been out this morning distributing rations to several working parties Guns of all sizes firing but saw very little reply from the Huns.
Passed through what was La Boiselle but should not have known it had been a village unless told - Not a wall
