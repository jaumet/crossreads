  
 My delight at seeing dozens of racing boats. I had not seen one for over two and a half years and should have given anything for a row. 
 The whole place is full of cadets and one is struck with the fact that the cadet nowadays is of a very fine type. This training lasts for 4 months and is of the best. He is turned out as a platoon commander and experience has shown that he is usually a very efficient one. 
 I am going back to London tomorrow to attend a dentist. Then to Sussex and afterwards to Brighton, which by the way is also in Sussex. I return to France on Saturday next 29th Sept.
