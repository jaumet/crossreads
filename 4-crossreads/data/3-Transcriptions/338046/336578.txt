<p>1917 Sept<br/>to follow, dropped us like an overripe egg and we went back to the Infantry.<br/>Mick Brackpool, Ron Mawson and I had arranged to meet in London on October 1st.<br/>I had no spondulicks [money] but expected to be able to borrow some from Mick so applied for leave. Unfortunately mid week leave was not being given at this time, only week end leave being granted, so I thudded. For some unknown reason, the major sent for me and asked me if the leave would do on the following week but I told him that it was not much good to me. Mick and Ron being gone and me without cash. On second thought I told him that I would take it, hoping to raise the wind somewhere.<br/>The first day that we returned to the infantry we had an all day stunt out Dinton way. We attacked an old Roman camp which was about 1500 years old. I wondered if any of the legionaries ghosts were watching us. We marched back through Dinton.</p>
