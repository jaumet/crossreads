<p>Christmas Day 1915</p>
<p>Malta</p>
<p>We arrived in Malta at 2pm today. Coming into this harbour you see lots of guns in the forts and I suppose there are hundreds You cant See. This place- looking from the harbour looks peculiar indeed&nbsp; it is Built right on top of the waters edge high up on the rocks. Coming round the Ship are a lot of maltese Kids and they want you to thow money into the water and they will Dive for it and very Sedom miss it. They like the Natives of Colombo are very good at this Sort of game&nbsp; When I get ashore I hope to get a good look at This place and See wich is Best, Malta or Egypt</p>
