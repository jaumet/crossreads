<p>as it is very much cooler in Egypt &amp; Jim for you, you will be dreading the winter coming on &amp; you will feeling it awful, never being used to the cold weather here I will knit you cuffs &amp; mits for your hands same as I did for John when he was in this country also a helmet for your head of course you wont need them till October but I will make a start now. Well Jim I will have to quit for this time hoping to hear from you soon again. &nbsp;How were your people when you heard from them, well I hope. &nbsp;Remember me to Bess when you write best wishes from all at 89 Campbell St.</p>
