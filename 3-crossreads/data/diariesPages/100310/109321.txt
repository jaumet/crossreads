17/9/17 Westhoeke Ridge Ypres
The boys were all in fairly good heart. While there Blanchard came in rather shaken up with the effects of one of his lads who had just had his head blown off. Pushed off towards "D"Coy crossing what had once been a road ? now a tattered battered place. Flares were going up close to us and we had to freeze into rigidity now and then. Entered another round concrete place after much adjectival advice to keep our heads down and there found Davis and his officers. I was not satisfied with the grip shown in handling the situation here and put the acid on. They could not find the company on their left so I arranged for two flares to be fired in quick succession at 11 p.m. from their left post to give the direction. Mc Intyre had 4 men killed in his post. Returned now to "C"Co. HQ with Sergt Cook (wounded later) and some shells skimmed close enough to part our hair, found Woolf and had a good talk smoothing out some difficulties for him. The enemy shelling consistently round about here. Called in at R.A.P.
