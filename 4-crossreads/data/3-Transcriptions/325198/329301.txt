<p>15 May, 1916<br/>We left Romanai at about 2.0 oclock one reg of New Zealanders &amp; the 6th &amp; proceeded to Katia; here we watered &amp; boiled our quarts &amp; had a good tea - Joe woods had boiled a piece of bacon &amp; it went well - a bit after six we saddled &amp; moved off again, it was quite pleasant riding along in the cool moon light night  After about 5 or 6 miles we halted again &amp; re filled our water bottles &amp; fed up  &amp; did not remove our saddles &ndash; later we took our horses around to a well &amp; gave them a drink, when we came back the section opened some bully &amp; we had a snack then lay down with the reins hooked over our arms &amp; tried to get some sleep &ndash; the horses were very quiet &amp; I was awakened only too or three times with the horses tramping up against my shin bones, then there would be a little language &amp; I would go off to sleep again</p>
