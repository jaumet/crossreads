Beautiful Day.  Sightseeing again - Impossible to name all we saw.  Visited the American Club and yarned with the Yanks.  Paid a very amusing visit to the Musee Grevin (wax works) - a very fine display.After tea we went to the Olympia - This, too, was very funny especially the bicycle turn.Paris is a gay city and in many respects more attractive than London, though the meals are not up to the English standard, the customs being different entirely.  Today I tasted a few snails as a souvenir dish.
