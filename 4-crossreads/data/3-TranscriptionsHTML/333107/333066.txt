<p>[Drawing of nurse holding thermometer. She is saying "Open your mouth and put this under your tongue, please".]<br/>Thurs Aug 8<br/>Went into Town for a walk. The weather is keeping splendid and so is the war news.</p>
<p>Fri Aug 9<br/>There's no news about the Postal Job, but I've got my things ready for a move. Commenced Letter 34 to B.E. I wonder what she will think of things. It's certainly a mess-up.</p>
<p>Sat 11<br/>Got word this morning to pack up and be ready to move off. Got my boots from the Bootmaker and drew rations for the Journey. Said "Goodbye" to the mob.</p>
<p>Left Weymouth about 11, changed at Westbury and reached Warminster about 3. 4 mile march to O.T.B. Had a jolly good tea, Bread and Butter and Jam and Lettuce. Best Feed I've had for months. Attended Concert in Y.M. Very Good.</p>
