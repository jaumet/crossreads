<p>My dear Mr Ferguson,</p>
<p>When I wrote my last two letters to you I little thought I'd be writing such an one as this within 3 days &ndash; You may understand how it comes about that I never knew of Arthurs death for so long after when I tell you that I have only once had a newspaper in England viz . [indecipherable] Despatches &ndash; I told my wife when I got your first letter to read carefully every Australian Casualty list &ndash; but It was by a mere chance that I heard &ndash; An Australian Colonel was talking to me and I said I had written to Arthur Ferguson hat v day &ndash; he looked grave &ndash; and told me the dreadful news of his death.  He then showed me his diary. It appears that shortly before Arthur was killed that our people had some bad luck, lost 2 guns and 60 men. Yr boy was in the scrap.</p>
