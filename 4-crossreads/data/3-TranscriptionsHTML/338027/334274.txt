<p>Saturday, 21st November, 1914<br/>About 3.30 a.m. shots were heard &amp; those that were awake thought there was a big engagement on.  When daybreak came we could plainly see the Jap cruiser Ibuki holding conversation with 3 of our transports &amp; with her searchlights on.  All sorts of fearful rumours were spread but this is the official news about 2.30 a.m. the blue funnel transport Arcanius rammed the leading boat the Shropshire.  She had a hole in her starboard stern 12 ft. long but above sea level so she will be able to reach Aden providing we get good weather.  Two men were reported overboard &amp; that was the reason the cruiser was looking for them with her searchlights.</p>
<p>Sunday, 22nd November, 1914<br/>Previous night had a concert most successful yet, had Violin &amp; good artists.  I recited my own compositions "The last of the Emden &amp; Thoughts of Home as an encore.  Nearly every man on the ship has a copy whilst the latter is the most popular.  Church parade to-day was note worthy as it was the initial attempt of the ship's choir.  They sang splendidly gave the lead to all the others and the hymn Nearer My God to Thee was splendid.  As every man joined in and the lead was given, it was impressive showing what a planted seed will do.</p>
