The decision of the Court was, as I have said, also that his Pay should be stopped untill the damage was paid for. I do not think any of the troops were sorry as "Sergeant Onions was one of the Anzac Police that the Papers are so fond of Praising up. There are some very decent fellows amongst them and also some of the Greatest Mongrels that ever wore out Good Boots."
It is nearly tea time and I will have to stop as there are about 30 hungry men in this hut and they will be wanting their tea. I dont know whether there is any more that I can tell you just yet so I will Ring off with heaps of Love to all at Home. from your Loving Son, Chas.
Love to all the Relatives when you see them especially Little Mollie
