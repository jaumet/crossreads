  
 I am the white headed boy with our new chief can't do wrong. Was very near promoted to 2nd steward before sailing Lloyd had to leave to go Chief of the Tahiti. We were without a 2nd.  The chief said if he dident  That was about a day before sailing. Heard after we sailed the chief had asked that I should go 2nd in the event of the other man not being in time. Now I have this bar the 2nd would like to strangle me. How are all at Marshall street well I hope. Havent time to write much as we are only calling at Hobart for a couple of hours. Will be abel to write again from Australia. Love to all Your Sincere Son Clyde.
