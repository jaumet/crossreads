 Bringing stampers down on early parade the sky presented a most extraordinary striped appearance with sweeps of ominous clouds right across. Did artillery formation and then an attack with the non.coms.  Pedler returned with LeCaire I go tomorrow morning taking Spendlove with me Mitchell being still in hospital. Unless my box arrives this morning I shall have to borrow decent clothes to wear up there. 
 Stayed in at office all day. During the morning a troop train passed through with much cheering probably new Australians arriving from Suez. More mail coming to hand gradually received a fair number today. Before dusk took a walk down to station passed all the different battalions in order and saw the 6th Field Artillery disentraining. Just past Brigade a cinema show is being erected by natives. The 8 1/2 is in the hands of a contractor allowing a rebate of 2/- a man per month in conson. of getting the business. Lappas allowed 4/- per man rebate - an instance of the business morality here. 
 In preparation for Cairo trip gathered up sufficient clothes to turn out smartly. Breeches & puttees from Bird also shirt & tunic from Sparrow. My own clothes are awful. Sgt De Boos in this afternoon. Turned in about 2200 & read till late.
