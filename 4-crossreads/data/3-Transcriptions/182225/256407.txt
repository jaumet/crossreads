<p>OCTOBER &nbsp; SUNDAY 15 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Saw a bit of sunshine today the first for some days, but it was counteracted by a bitterly cold wind. Poss &amp; I had leave for the day to go to Bournemouth, but Poss has been bad for a few days with influenza &amp; he did not feel like the trip so I stayed with him. I wrote a few letters during the &nbsp;day &amp; cleaned out my kit bags ect. Saw Joe Clonan in the morning, he was A1 &amp; had just come back from a week in the trenches, about 12 miles away.</p>
