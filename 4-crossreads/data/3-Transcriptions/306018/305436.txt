<p>June 1917<br/>Wednesday 6th<br/>Men who were away on leave came back &amp; a few more went, only 2 from B Sqdn.  We are moving from this camp in the morning.  Got more papers &amp; parcels.</p>
<p>Thursday 7th<br/>Reveille at 3.45 am.  Had an early breakfast &amp; were on the move about 7 oclock.  We only about 5 miles to travel.  The New Zealand Brgde passed us on their way to our old camp &amp; we occupied theirs.  We were all settled down in the new camp before noon.  We get a fair bit of dust here &amp; no swimming.  The days are warm still but in the afternoon there is always a cool breeze.<br/>Saw a few French Algerian troops, I believe there are a good few here now.  Enemy planes have been less active.  Ours have had a few successes lately, so they are not so keen on coming over.  Artillery on both sides are very active &amp; we heard the Turks had made a local attack without success.</p>
<p>Friday 8th<br/>Got more papers &amp; parcels.  Quite a good supply of stuff came from the Comforts fund  &amp; there was also a couple of bottles of beer per man.  Wasn't feeling so good at night.  Had a lot of stomach pains &amp; no sleep</p>
<p>Saturday 9th<br/>Had a bad day.  Bowels in</p>
