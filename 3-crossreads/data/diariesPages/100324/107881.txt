16/9/15 Gallipoli
there for 12 minutes until officer ordered removal. These same men last month would have fainted at the sight of blood or death! Still as we settle down we shall get s.b.s. picked who have the "nurse" instinct and a feeling of brave tender comradeship for all suffering. Abdul very quiet all evening but fairly late by concerted firing along all the front we drew hot fire from him. Went up into front line to view show. First up went some rockets beautifully lighting the show. Big things with sticks 6 or 7 feet long. Inferno of noise commenced from both sides bombs etc. The machine gun rifles pouring a hail over our heads and cracking into the sandbags. We had a few casualties but none serious. Bed 10.20.

Bitterly cold. The winter here will be dreadfully severe on us. From trenches this morning
