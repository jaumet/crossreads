<p>7 Sept. Taken over the line at Ypres. A pretty warm spot it's a big salient and Fritz gets a line on us from all directions. He put a couple of "Rum Jars" (Trench Mortars) over yesterday and got 17 (5 officers &amp;1:3 Sigs) all killed except one, he was buried for 8&frac12; hrs and when they got him out he'd one broken ankle. They could only find little pieces of the others. Was running wires from the front line all day yesterday wandering in liquid mud up to the knees, it's a rotten place and abounds with snipers, the enemy in places</p>
