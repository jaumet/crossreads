<p>some other crop, the weight being considerable, &nbsp;To get an easy</p>
<p>carriage for the basket the weight must be as nearly perpendicular</p>
<p>over the feet as possible, hence her back must be straight and her</p>
<p>head erect, and to prevent the basket falling, the walk must be</p>
<p>even and graceful. &nbsp;We passed hundreds of these women stepping it</p>
<p>out along the roads bound for the village markets. &nbsp;Occasionally</p>
<p>they are accompanied by t heir men folk in which case the man would</p>
<p>ride on a donkey whilst the woman would walk behind and carry the</p>
<p>load on her head. &nbsp;There is no doubt we spoil our women in Australia</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several of the Australian State Governments have irrigation</p>
<p>schemes before them, but for some reason or other they hesitate</p>
<p>about getting on with the work. &nbsp;If they could only see what has</p>
<p>been done in Egypt where there is absolutely no rainfall to help</p>
<p>the schemes, they would not hesitate one moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alexandria was reached at 1.30 p.m. after a most unpleasant</p>
<p>trip. &nbsp;The novelty of riding in a coal truck wears off in about</p>
<p>five minutes and to have to spend 6&frac12; hours in one is a severe pun-</p>
<p>ishment. &nbsp;Unfortunately our trucks were near the engine and this</p>
<p>obsolete vehicle sprayed us with live cinders up to the size of</p>
<p>peas. &nbsp;If they hit you on the face it hurt and if they landed on</p>
<p>your clothes unnoticed they burnt holes. &nbsp;I had a hole as big as a</p>
<p>shilling burnt out of the pocket of the best tunic I possess and</p>
<p>then when I put an overcoat on, I had this burnt in places, not to</p>
<p>mention &nbsp;a big bit burnt out of my hat which was blazing away freely</p>
<p>what time I was searching my clothes for the cause of the smell of</p>
<p>burning. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alexandria is not a very interesting place which is</p>
<p>generally the case with sea ports which live entirely on the ship-</p>
<p>ping of the Port. &nbsp;Our troop train ran right on to the wharf along-</p>
