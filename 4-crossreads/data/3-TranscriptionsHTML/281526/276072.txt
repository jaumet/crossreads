<p>17/1/18 York<br/>an hour or two and then caught another train this time for York to where we had a good quick run in the dark. Landed out of the dark station completely at sea &ndash; everywhere quite blacked out and in utter darkness. Dived into the first place, out of dark into a world of glare and glitter &ndash; the Royal Station Hotel. Put up here and had a good dinner. Feeling very tired tonight probably by reason of some late hours that one Julie could tell something about. This is a very large hotel and seems full. Noticed today in the Black Country, broad dialect, stunted growth, and the poorer fatigued looking women using the shawl for wrap and headcovering just like those of Glasgow and of Edinburgh. Met some English friends of Jake.</p>
