    All possible attention should be paid to this lecture, for patrolling is work which you are likely to be put on to at any time, and all that you are told today is practical and from experience.  These methods and hints may be of vital importance some day, perhaps very soon, and may make the difference between a good job and a bad one or even between safety and danger. 
   
    Information is secured by spies, aeroplane photographs, balloon observation, and all this may be supplemented by patrols. 
   
    Photographs will show lines of trenches, but patrols must find out how strongly they are held and whether listening saps and shell holes are occupied.  Photos show enemy wire, but only the patrol can definitely report on its condition or the gaps. 
   
    Patrols are sent out nightly along the whole British Front.  Each patrol reports what it has seen, and when many patrols along a front report the same thing and others elsewhere report differently, it frequently indicates to H.Q. the movement of the enemy. 
    
    Scouts must never exaggerate, anything but the absolute truth is criminal. 
   
    Courageous, steady, patient men are best.  Every man in patrol should know objective, also his place in the formation and his specia duties.  Carry only such equipment as is necessary, the box respirato at the alert, gloves, rough cap or balaclava not steel helmet, faces and hands to be blackened, identifications removed. 
   
     Choice of weapons :  Knife or bayonet in puttee and a knobkerry are best for they are quietest, best weapons to do "a dirty job in a quiet way."  Rifle and bayonet awkward when crawling, otherwise good.  Revolver only to those expert with it.  Bombs should only be in the hands of those expert in patrolling, for a bomb though useful in getting one out of a tight corner, is very dangerous when thrown in open to own patrol and also may draw the fire from the enemy.
