 Dear Mother &amp; Father, 
 I wrote to you by last Friday's mail. I hope you recieve it alright. I also posted a few post cards. I am sending twenty four post cards to you by this mail I am also sending you some presents. I hope you get them alright. I have sent three dresses a couple of scarfs a table centre and a spoon. I want you to tell me if I got them reasonable. They are all hand worked &amp; the silks are the best. I paid 30/- each for the cammel hair or tussore dresses &amp; 25/- for the silk evening a pound each for the scarfs 12/- for the centre &amp; 3/- for spoon. That was &pound;7 altogether. There is a dress for mother &amp; a scarf two dresses an evening &amp; a summer for Dorothy also a scarf &amp; the other two for the house. I have not seen anything suitable
