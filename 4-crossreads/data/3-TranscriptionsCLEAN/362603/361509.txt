  
 2.  Keep an appointment.  Next Time we are going to write and make arrangements. We are all well & when I come back from the Island Ellis & Dave are going on leave to Bonnie Scotland.  Will Alli is going down to Wales again next week.  Our Major Dunn is returning to Manly.  That is Will's Friend.  He has been away about 2 1/2 Years. Well Dad, Mum & George, it is "Ligh'ts Out" & as Ellis & I both over slept & missed parade this morning I must toddle off to bed.
