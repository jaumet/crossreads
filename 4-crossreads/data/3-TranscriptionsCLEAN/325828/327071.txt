My dearest Father,I am down at my London "home" on 6 days leave from Shawbury.  As before, both Mr. & Mrs Hammond have been exceedingly kind.  I was getting really fagged out & nervy, & was granted 6 days leave.  Almost at the same time I had a pressing invitation from the Hammonds to spend my time in London at their home if I cared to do so.  I accepted their kind invitation, & arrived down here late on Tuesday night (about 11 p.m.)  I found a huge supper waiting for me, after which Mr. H. & I had a cigar over in front of an asbestos gas fire, (for it is very cold over here now) & then oh! glory! a lovely soft feather bed, with sheets.  After camp life it was simply A1.  I slept without a break till 11.30 the following morning when Mrs. Hammond woke me with tea & toast, & after a bath & shave I shoved my feet into carpet slippers & strolled downstairs to breakfast.  Breakfast at 12 p.m. mind you.  Talk about luxury.
