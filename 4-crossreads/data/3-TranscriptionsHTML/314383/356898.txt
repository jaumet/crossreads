<p>July 2nd<br/>Dick Hooper busy with villagers in purchasing wheat &amp; barley.</p>
<p>My cook got to work &amp; turned out a fairly decent though weird meal in which he mixed green plums.</p>
<p>My little girl came along this evening the Commissioner has done nothing for her even tho he promised, so Scotty &amp; I gave her some washing to do for which we paid her 10 Krans.</p>
<p>July 3rd<br/>These damn Native cooks just about drive me mad.  The old boy &amp; his offsider commence by cooking first my dish &amp; when that is done start another. He never thinks of cooking all the food at once &amp; if left alone would boil the water for the tea after washing up.</p>
