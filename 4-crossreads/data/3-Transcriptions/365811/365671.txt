<p>3<br/>mistress of the car as I expected (Dorothy will smile at that I expect). I am glad it has been so successful</p>
<p>Here the Fords are <u>the</u> cars. The amount of work capable drivers can get out of them is extraordinary &amp; they'll go where another machine would never have a chance. I dont think anyone over here will have a bad word for them after this show. The Ambulances are no good &ndash; body is too heavy but the touring &amp; box fords are <u>it</u></p>
<p>I was very pleased to know that Keith is looking well &amp; improving. I should think time is the main factor &amp; I hope to hear of his good progress. It will be a long business I expect but he is alive &amp; he's home. My mother tells me she was going to Sydney about Christmas time &amp; I am hoping she went out to see you &ndash; I know she intended to if you were in Sydney.</p>
<p>I have not yet received any of the Current History's but will be really glad of them when they do come &ndash; good reading matter is scarce. I have not heard from Caesar or W.P.M. for ages but now &amp; again see their name in orders. I too hope both came through the last show alright &amp; that Caesar has got his Battn.</p>
<p>My very kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; yourself</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>R.J. Hunter</p>
