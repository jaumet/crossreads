 November 1918. Saturday 23 
 Southall. Hospital Spent a rather quiet morning. Did not go to the workshops as they were closed all day. Went across to O.s in the afternoon and stayed until I missed the last train from Wembley, thus missing the last from Paddington also. Had to walk to Ealing and a bus &ndash; militaire carried me almost the remaining portion of the journey. Felt pretty dicky too.
