<p>Fine &amp; cool. I was orderly</p>
<p>officer for the aft of the ship. Its</p>
<p>not a bad job though as the</p>
<p>duties are light. Had a</p>
<p>boxing tournament in the</p>
<p>afternoon &amp; it was very good.</p>
<p>Also had arough dance at</p>
<p>night, but as there were only</p>
<p>about nine ladies it was</p>
<p>not much of a success.</p>
