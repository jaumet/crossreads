<p>Sat. 5 JAN.  Got Mr Jacks to take a few copies of the enlargement, as it is too big to send Home to M.S.  I don't get up in the morning till about 11.  The weather is too jolly cold.  Ern &amp; I went to a Dance at St Michael's Institute but I got too giddy &amp; had to give up.</p>
<p>Sun. 6.  There was a procession to St Michael's.  All the soldiers &amp; Council attended the Intercession Service.  I intended going, but got up too late.  After Dinner Ern &amp; I paid a visit to Father's Grave.  It is well looked after.  There are quite a lot of new Graves near, that were not there when I was here last May.  All the Hotels were closed all day..</p>
<p>Mon. 9.  Went visiting.  Saw Mrs Hambleton at the Brewery Stable, who enquired after France, &amp; said that my wife must be a "lovely person".  Fancy calling B.E. a person</p>
