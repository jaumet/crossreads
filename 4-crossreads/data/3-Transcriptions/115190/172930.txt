<p>There is a cemetery in the making here fenced in with barbed wire.&nbsp; It is filling up far too fast.&nbsp; Every day I see fresh mounds.&nbsp; One of my mates lies here a wooden cross on his <s>head</s> grave.&nbsp; Poor Harry&nbsp; I saw him alive &amp; well just after we crossed the Jordan River.&nbsp; This place is called [Rornar ?] and is about a mile outside Damascus.&nbsp; 150 Turkish officers are billeted in a house here with a Tommy guard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; About 100 of us are taken to a small Rly Stn per motor ambulances.&nbsp; <s>Written</s> on a notice board on the platforms in chalk is the legend. &quot;Captured by the 4th Regt ALH&quot;&nbsp; We are stacked in covered trucks (similar to&nbsp; our C wagons) &amp; we steam out about 10.30 am.&nbsp; We are a mixed crowd.
