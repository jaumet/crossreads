When a halt was made in Cannon Street the Coldstreamers were bombarded by a shower of Cigars and cigarettes, which were lighted on the spot. Smoking very wisely, was not "verbotten," a privilege which was appreciated by no one more than the wounded and disabled men who filled the places of honour in the motor wagons.
By the time the return route was completed and we had reached Hyde Park Corner, many of us were as tired as in those weary days when we trudged up to the firing line from Bethune. With the order to dismiss a furore of hand-shaking broke out again. We wished each other the best of luck, and with that esprit-de-corps which has always characterised the Brigade we decided unanimously that, in the event of another war we would all join the Guards again.
After the march every man of the House Hold Cavalry and the Guards Division was handed a message from the King expressing his high appreciation of their war records.
