<p>exactly myself yet. If you ever have a snap of yourself, Ivy  &amp; Noni please send one over  &amp; I also wish Vol that your letters were not quite so long between each other. Why it is months now since I had a letter. But then I suppose you work  &amp; Ivy  &amp; baby well then neither of you have too many leisure moments.<br/>Don't you think we are winning? You saw we pushed Fritz so hard that we pushed him right through Russia &amp; now Russia has pushed back they're pushed him right into Italy. Still we're winning but then we are easily doped. Well Vol old boy I must really close now so give my best love to Sis, Noni  &amp; self  &amp; give my kindest regards to all your people. Must try  &amp; get another leave before I go to France. Am due for it on 9/11/17 but if I am shifted to draft camp before then I will do it in. Well ta ta Vol till next mail  &amp; I remain the same old stick Hal</p>
