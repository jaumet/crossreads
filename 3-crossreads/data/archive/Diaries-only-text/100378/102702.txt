5th December '16 (Con.)
all the communications for the whole Brigade. Our Battery shot first. Passed off very fair. I with 6 of our staff stayed behind to keep up the communications. Had a great shock in the early morning before firing started. Went out on the horse over the range to deliver tele. plugs. Somehow I was rather late in getting the plugs away and I had to Gallop madly back to the O.P. [Observation Post] for safety as firing was just about to start. I was 3 miles away from my goal. I think the old horse did it in Cup time, and dodging shell holes was very awkward. Anyhow they remembered I was out on the line of fire so shooting was delayed 5 minutes for me to get out of the way. I was greatly relieved when I got back to safety. Arrived back at camp at 2.30. Had dinner and afterwards did stables. Did not go out anywhere. Received letters from Charlie, Trev. Beattie.

Left camp at 7.30 after having breakfast harnessing up for the range. We were on observing work for the 8th Brigade. We were in the dugout up near the 4 gun battery from which I had the race for life yesterday. A rather good day, slightly warm in the sun. Some pretty good shooting by the 8th. Got back to camp at 3, had some dinner had afterwards
