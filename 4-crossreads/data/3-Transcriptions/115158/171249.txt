<p>fine old chap, dressed in a&nbsp;Donegal tweed jacket, white flannel trousers,&amp; a collar &amp; tie. He spoke English well, &amp; he was delighted to hear that Samoa&nbsp;was now British. His patriotism was intense, &amp; to each drink we had he never omitted to say &quot;Damn the Kaiser.&quot; He explained what preparations Suva had made to withstand any attack, &amp; he was most emphatic in telling us that they would make things pretty hot&nbsp;for any Germans who had designs on Fiji. When I parted&nbsp;from him he wished us &quot;good luck&quot;, and said he hoped&nbsp;that we should meet with the German cruisers &amp; &#39;blow them up&quot;. &nbsp;He also presented me with his walking stick. From what I could gather his position as King was more or less nominal, he being responsible to the Governor for practically nothing. He is a member of the Legislative Council &amp; receives&nbsp;&pound;200 a year, besides an annual stipend from the Government, with a house. His bearing was very dignified, &amp; one could well imagine him sitting surrounded with Fijians in &nbsp;solemn&nbsp;&nbsp;conclave. The Fijian women are not such fine types as the men, &amp; they age very early in life, &amp; incline to be very portly &amp; heavy. The Hindoo women were very picturesque with their bracelets on arms &amp; ankles, &amp; ornaments on their nostrils. The Fijian police are fine fellows, &amp; apparently keep splendid order. Everybody seems highly contented, &amp;&nbsp;it would be difficult to find a more patriotic race than the Fijians.</p>
