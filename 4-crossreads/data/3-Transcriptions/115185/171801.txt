I wish I had gone to her house but it was such a rush and so late. I could have saved myself considerable expense. I sent Aunt Maria one of Gibson's letters &amp; asked her to post it on to you.<br/>They will tell you all I know. He may be coming to N.Z. Convalescent depot today and in that case I may see him again as it is at Blackheath. This is Saturday and we have orders to leave for Southampton Monday &ndash; 12th July. I have been waiting in all today to get news of Gibson. Nurse Piggot came in this morning</p>
