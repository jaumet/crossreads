<p>heels of advancing troops in France. (I am enclosing a photo taken on the first day of that severe march in 1916). A wet miserable cold day, but luckily no casualties, had a good sleep &amp; felt O.K.   I met my old &amp; esteemed friend Captain Ward he is starting a soup kitchen in the village.  The different Battalions when coming away from the Front Line all patronize this kitchen, &amp; the soup is much enjoyed.  He is still the same old sport.    During the night Fritz put about 10 shells into the village, but no damage was the result.</p>
<p>March 29th 1917.<br/>At 2 p.m. our squad received orders to move again, to that village we stopped at on the 21st inst, which was about a mile &amp; a half further back. A good move for us, as we are getting further back &amp; away from Fritz. Raining in torrents all the afternoon &amp; following night. God help the lads who are fighting in such weather.</p>
<p>March 30th 1917.<br/>Our work at this village is to load the cars, but as very few cases came along</p>
