<p>there we seen reps of N.Z. Aus, Britain, Sikhs, British West Indies &amp; Gippoes, &amp; there wasn't more than a couple of hundred all told some of the British were naval men too.</p>
<p>9-5-16<br/>Small whirlwinds are quite common here one occurred today in front of the Q.M.S, Store with the result that several pairs of shorts, a blanket etc went sailing up in the air.  The birds (crows I believe) were much surprised one could see them circling around the shorts in mid air trying no doubt to find out what kind of birds they were.  Very hot today.<br/>8.0 PM about a 1000 of our Brigade have just marched out to the station it looked rather impressive to see the long column of heavily loaded men each man with at least 2 Kit Bags winding along the sandy camp road in the moonlight.</p>
<p>10-5-16<br/>This morning we could hear the sound of heavy Guns this the second time that this has occurred.</p>
