soldier & 4 French people at a corner table were very merry, as the dinner & wine progressed. One girl was stuffing a paper serviette down the neck of the men. We came out at 9, the trams had stopped running & all lights were out & the town in darkness, & we had a very long walk, could follow the tram line luckily as there was nobody about to ask the way, nor would they have understood us. Got "home" about 10.30 alright, Aubrey, Merrett & I slept together, I was in the middle & kept pretty warm, but the other two complained of being cold all night. During the night, we were awakened by the roar of the guns, an air raid was on by the Huns, & the guns were booming. Through the door of our tent I could see the flashes of the bursting shells from the French guns & search lights playing about the sky trying to locate the enemy aeroplanes. One loud explosion fairly shook our tent, & it evidently didn't drop too far away. After some time the roar of the guns ceased, but what happened I do not know.
