pudding and cakes etc. I am sending along some little presents with this mail so you should get them soon after this letter. Ida will think that they are never coming but they will turn up eventually. When you write again you can leave the reinforcements out of the address as I am now with the old Battalion and my Company is"C". I trust that Ted Carrigan is still OK.  I managed to keep my promise and send him along a letter from Tel el Kebir but since then it has taken me all my time to keep the home news going. I suppose I will soon be getting a letter or two from Clarry. I have only received one of his so far and would like to hear how he is getting on.
I will sign off now dad for this time; in case I don't happen to get another note along before Xmas. I wish you all a Bright, Merry and Happy Christmas, and only wish I could be with you but don't worry about me as you can bet I will be having a jolly good time once I get the old billy with a big plum duff.With Love to all of you at HomeI remainYour loving sonGordon
