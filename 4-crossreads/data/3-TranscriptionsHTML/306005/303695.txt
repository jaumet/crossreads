<p>11-1-17<br/>parcel &amp; left Ismailia at 2 oclock arriving at Kantara at 3 PM, crossed the Canal &amp; took my time walking to the station to catch the train to El Arish &amp; when I got there found I had to wait till 6 PM to catch a train; while waiting a Hospital train came in from El Arish loaded with wounded soldiers (mostly leg &amp; arm wounds) from one of the lads I heard Major Irwin &amp; Lieut Tony Hordern* were both wounded &amp; a good many other ranks also, but they managed to take Rafa &amp; captured all in it. The train to El Arish left at 6 oclock &amp; had to change trains at Romani &amp; again at Mazar &amp; riding all night on a load of sleepers.</p>
<p>*Tony Hordern is at present in the officers ward. Major Lewis was hit the same day, some are returning to Australia tomorrow. J.M.T.</p>
