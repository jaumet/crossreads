<p>[26th Aug. contd]<br/>Seeing a French officer on the platform with some stomach I enquired of the guard in my best French if he was a Flying Corps officer &amp; as the guard mentioned this to the officer he got a kick downstairs in reward.  They took it as a joke though &amp; laughed heartily.  It began to rain soon after and visions of a wet tramp back from Faughemberghes came up before us.<br/>We arrived at Thiembronne (stop before Faughemberghes) at 8.10 and it was nearly dark &amp; raining heavily.  There was no shelter &amp; we just had to push on.  We were soon drenched &amp; after an hours walk we got to Thiembronne &ndash; took the wrong road twice &amp; eventually arrived at our billets at 10.30 drenched &amp; cold &ndash; but soon into bed &amp; right O.</p>
<p>Monday 27<br/>Still raining windy &amp; miserable.  I was working outdoors all day on odd jobs &amp; it was not very comfortable.  I was rewarded however for I received 17 letters 1 parcel &amp;amp: papers from good old Aussy  (inc were 3 letters from M.B. 1 from home also the parcel which was good).  Slept well.</p>
