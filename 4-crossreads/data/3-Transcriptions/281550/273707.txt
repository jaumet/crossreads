<p><u>November 1918</u></p>
<p>November the 1st<br/>The events of the last two or three days are very satisfactory.</p>
<p>It is reported that Turkey has been granted an armistice.</p>
<p>The terms provide for the Allies to occupy her territory and her Army has to be demobilised immediately. It is further reported that Austria-Hungary is in a state of revolution and that her troops are not fighting. It is believed here that within the next week Austria-Hungary will be forced to surrender to the allies.</p>
<p>Here in Germany there is a lot of unrest, The people are beginning to see that they have been mislead and deceived by their Military rulers.</p>
<p>It is my belief that Kaiser Wilhelm will make himself scarce very soon, and by doing so give the signal for general upheaval and revolution.</p>
