<p>Steaming WNW at dusk. Sea like a mirror. Parade 6.30 &ndash; 7am. 9.30 -11 am (lecture Lt Bruce on field engineering, bombs &amp; grenades very interesting &ndash; wonder why we are not taught more about other arms &amp; explosive which we must use the little pea shooter?<br/>Afternoon parade 3 to 4p.m. a very imposing affair.-  All hands stripped &amp; standing round &ndash; fighting one another &ndash; under the salt water faucett. Our canteen can only sell lemonade' cigarettes &amp; tinned fish. Tobacco &amp; matches are 'non est.' Also, all fresh water being barred except a small quantity for drinking only, it has now become a crime  to shave. All from Commandant down go unshaven &amp; look pretty rough. This is the result of orders issued on day of departure.</p>
