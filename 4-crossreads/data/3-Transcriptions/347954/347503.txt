<p>the Turks at the other end of the Dardenelles.  I hope it is true because many weeks hanging on as we are compelled to do makes life rather drab &amp; uninteresting.  One thing I must comment on which rather astonishes me &amp; also everyone else who happens to be observant &ndash; The amount &amp; quality of the food supplies in comparion with the same supplied us, both at Sydney &amp; Cairo.  Here we get an allowance of bacon, onions, &amp; potatoes for brekker each morning, an unheard of proceeding at either of the camps mentioned.  Such things as rum, lime juice, &amp; PURE unadulterated tea are luxuries after the concoctions served out in peace camps.  If I was vindicative I should say that the Army quartermasters must do an amount of tampering, if not they, then it must occur down at the contracting stores.  I have just received word through of the death of Captain Bage [Edward Frederick Robert (Bob) Bage] of the Engrs.  He was with Doctor Mawson of Antartic fame, before coming away with us &amp; a favourite with most of his company.  With our officers we are a good deal unfortunate, most of the Head Quarter staff have met a soldier's grave &amp; it certainly looks black for the remaining numbers.</p>
