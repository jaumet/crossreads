Rumour that we move up to the line to-morrow which is now a great distance from here.
Friday 6 September
Move to-day from Morcourt to Halle on the Albert-Peronne road. We came by Bray, Suzette Maricourt we are now camped in a quarry, just north of the Somme on the old Somme battlefield of 1916. The country is desolate just as it was when we were at Flers in 1916. Rumour that Fritz was driven back yesterday the A.D.S. even is about 3 kilos East of Peronne. Just on our left is Mont St. Quentin, not much of an eminence but commanding all approaches to it.
