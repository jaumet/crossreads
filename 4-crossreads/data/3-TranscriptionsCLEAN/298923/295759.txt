Could hear big guns all night, the Infantry are at it again-   Send Reinforcements tomorrow, to our Brigade who are not yet returning & my leave to Port Said indefinitely postponed. X The Circassians turned dog on us, but we blew up the railway each side of Amman.  The N.Z lost a good many Officers & men also the 6th L.H. among them an old friend of mine Major Harold Ryan who was in Africa.X
