 July 28 On July 28 we had leave again from 11 am.  I bought a   photo   print of the Rhodes Memorial for 9d &amp; sent it home by post.  I did not like to take it back to the boat, for fear that it might be crushed or mislaid.  After dinner we went by tram to Clarence Road.  We walked up to the Round Church, a quaint old Dutch Church (I think) &amp; caught a tram to Camps Bay.  Had a look around there, &amp; walked back over Kloof Nek to the City.  We had tea at the Feather Markets (buckshee) &amp; went to the pictures at night to see Charlie Chaplin in the [Four photographs, Cape Town, Kloop Nek, Botanic Gardens]
