 My dearest Lady, I just loved your letter, though the abominable time I've taken to reply would almost seem as if it were not appreciated.  Not so dear, even though appearances are against me.  The truth is it came when I was very busy & very full of anxiety about my dear lad & by the time I had scribbled my home letters felt incapable of doing any more, also that letters when one is very depressed are certainly not acceptable to one's friends.  I know Mer. has written to your "Hubby" so if the letters have reached their destination you will know of his long illness, five weeks at Lemnos then a relapse at Malta & another five weeks in bed.  He has been back here nearly a fortnight and was dressed for a couple of days but back in bed again yesterday.  The trouble is his heart is very weak
