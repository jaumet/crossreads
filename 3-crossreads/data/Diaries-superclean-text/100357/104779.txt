The following message have been received by GOC NZ A Divs from "A NZ Arm Corp" it is with the deepest I have I have to announce the death on 19th of General Bridges who has proved himself the most gallant of soldiers best of commanders I am quite unable to express what his loss means to the Aus Div which can never repay the debt is owes to him for his untiring unselfish labours which are responsible for the high state of orgination to which the division had been brought in every detail. The high ideal he placed before the boys from at Duntroon which he succeeded in at home as far as my knowledge of those now serving with the A.F. in the field is concerned will I hope go down the honour of his name
