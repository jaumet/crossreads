<p>10th. This morning we left our billets in Lavigcona, it was just starting to drizzle, so the order was given for everyone to put their waterproofs on. I had none for I dumped it at our last billet on account of the weight, so I had to fall back on the old chaff bag, &amp; she kept me dry as a bone It was a very stiff march &amp; the roads were greasy &amp; slippery, which made the walking anything but easy, we passed on our way through Herrisart a fair sized village.</p>
<p>Reached our destination Loutencourt, &amp; everyone was about knocked out.</p>
