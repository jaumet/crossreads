 put in a good team against us but after a most exciting game we won by 2 goals. Colonel Moseley and others came round to afternoon tea at the mess. Great enthusiasm & celebration over our win & dinner was a noisy meal. Afterwards Matthews and myself dallied and yarned until everyone was out of the mess and so saved too much jollification. Some of our chaps have completely "blancoed" their equipment and the guard was a very smart sight Issued orders forbidding it in future. Walked down to BdeHqs and had a yarn to Brazenor. We move on 3rd Rumors of 4th & 5th Divs hopping over. M. le Cure was in before tea & we had a yarn and a glass of geneve gin. Yarned with family.
