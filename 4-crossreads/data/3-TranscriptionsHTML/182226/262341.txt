<p>Still in Valletta but running short of cash. Met Mac &amp; Norrie at 2.30 spent the afternoon with them.</p>
<p>Went &amp; had tea &amp; fooled round playing billiards etc. Took a run out to Mesieda [Msida] when we got to the ferry the last boat had gone so we went over in a gondola, we got back to camp at 1.30 a.m. We had only been in camp about 5 hours since Wednesday.</p>
