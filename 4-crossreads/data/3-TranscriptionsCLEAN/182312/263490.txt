 received such treatment as was dealt out to it on this occasion. 
 One is constantly reminded of the last Franco / German war for 
 each village found about has a memorial somewhere within its 
 boundaries erected to the memory of its contribution of soldiers 
 who fell about Bapaume mostly during the first week of January 1871 
      It is rather an important town, as roads and railways 
 radiate out in several directions forming a new connecting link 
 with out forces in the North and South.  The scene on the Main 
 Albert - Bapaume road immediately after the occupation of the last 
 named town was a remarkable one.  The traffic was immense.  Guns, 
 ammunition, transport of all descriptions, cavalry, foot troops, 
 Red Cross, vehicles, etc. flocked along in streams all day and 
 night.  Piccadilly never saw such traffic.  About every couple 
 of miles the Boche had blown a huge crater in the road measuring 
 about 50 feet in diameter and abour 30 / 40 feet deep.  To look 
 at one of these holes at first one would think that about 50 men 
 could fill it up in a day, but after a day's hard work the hole 
 appears as big as ever.  It was found to be much quicker to build 
 a road round each side of these craters (cutting down the banks 
 where necessary) than to block traffic whilst they were being 
 filled xxx in.  In one place a huge caterpillar dragging a 
 howitzer blocked the traffic badly by falling into a trap left by 
 Fritz.  Whilst the frost was on he had driven a tunnel under the 
 road about four feet below the surface knowing that when the thaw 
 set in, the first heavy vehicle passing over would dislodge the 
 earth and fall in.  The caterpillar fell in all right and in 
 doing so swung half way across the road.  The next heavy vehicle, 
 coming in the opposite direction in order to avoid the cater- 
 pillar edged well over to the side of the road and there fell
