<p>I have been feeling off color lately as a result of a night in the line without shelter during a blizzard. Doctor says its pleurisy and I must take things easy.<br/>Jan 2nd Left  Perrone for the north. It was freezing hard and if it wasn't for the rum that was issued we should have frozen. Still we stick it and about 6pm on the 3rd we reached Voistraate where we took up our quarters in the old camp.<br/>Jan 7th We are now fixing up the line wind banks and last night</p>
