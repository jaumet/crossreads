 Saturday. March 2. Since my last entry we have covered many hundreds of miles & are now in Capetown The trip was uneventful except that a severe epidimic of Gastric Influenza broke out & about 75% of the Officers were down with it. We had some trouble with the young lads who are being returned to Australia under age. They attempted to breach a hatch & even to attempt to take charge of things generally but they were dealt with very severely and the ringleaders punished & the rest soon
