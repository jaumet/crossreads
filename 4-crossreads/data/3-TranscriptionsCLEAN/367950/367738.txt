  
 General full particulars about the disposition of "Jacko" and his forces as near as he can he cannot of course go too low down to look for fear of being brought down. Although those airmen of ours are very daring and come down thousands of feet lower than a Taube ever does. Our Brigade the 1st consisting of the 1st 2nd and 3rd L H Regts and the machine Gun Squadron move forward and the various Brigades move off to their respective places and the fun commences. Our Aeroplanes up to about 9 a.m have dropped about 50 bombs and as they discharge their Cargo they come back with the latest report and load up with more high Explosive bombs and go aloft again. But "Jacko" is a wily rascal and when he sees our men come over he hops into deep narrow pits already dug for that purpose and gets out of harms way to a great extent. We start off at a walk first and make straight the Turkish position. Then we trot and open out and for miles we move like the eccentric rods of an engine moving to the left then the right then back then forward then half left half right and move forward the whole time presently Swish - Bang! comes a shell which explodes at short range  Siv   Boom goes the gun again
