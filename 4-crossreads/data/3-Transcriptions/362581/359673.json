<p>Your letters are beautiful  XOXOXOXOXOXOXOX</p>
<p>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>Suppose you will be commencing your Xmas holiday now. What are you doing? Grandma should take a small house near the sea, then you could have bathing, fishing   &amp;  build houses in the sand. All of you could have a holiday together.</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  kisses<br/>XX From Auntie Eadle X</p>
