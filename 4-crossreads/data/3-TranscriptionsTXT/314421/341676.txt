Sunday September 30. 1917 (1154.)
It was exceedingly cold & frosty last night.
There was a terrific artillery duel last night which continued with great intensity all night and far into the morning, ending about 8. a.m. There has been a series of rushes by our troops on this sector every night since the 20th and all our objectives have been gained and held. The Germans admit their losses, but try to minimise our gains to deceive their own people and Neutrals. There is great political strife in Germany and it is rumoured that a second and more concilatory peace reply will be sent to the Pope by Germany as a result of the great British gains on this front in Flanders. Haig is described by the "Express" as a great peace maker. If the weather only keeps fine for a few weeks longer, the enemy will be in a very serious plight indeed, and will be forced to evaculated Flanders, which means the loss of their U. boat bases and several aerodromes from which they make their attacks upon England.
War is a period of extreme activity followed by periods
