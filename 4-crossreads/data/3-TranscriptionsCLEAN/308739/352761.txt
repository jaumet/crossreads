 Monday 14 August 1916 Went to Shepards for Parcels for Lieu. Chisholm. Left for Romani by 11 a.m. Train.  Arrived in Camp at 10 p.m. Found all well, but weary after the long Stunt. Major Bruxner took charge after the Colonel got wounded, & confesses that His arduous duties were almost too much.  The Enemy did considerable damage at Bir el Abd with their Heavy Guns, & knocked out many valuable Horses. 
 Tuesday 15 August 1916 In Camp all Day fixing up Mail & Kit Bags for wounded. Regiment returned from Bir el Abd yesterday. Ridgway received wounds to-day from Cartridges exploding in Incinator.  This careless habit of throwing all rubbish in the fire without examination should be stopped as anyone attending there is liable to get killed or seriously wounded.
