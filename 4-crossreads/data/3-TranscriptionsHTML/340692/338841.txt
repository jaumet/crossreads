<p>our meal that the first shell was landed near us.  It is a strange sensation this shell-fire, when you have it in your mind that it is just you they are trying to get.  For the first two or three that was landed close by that day, I had the sensation of wanting to crawl inside of my steel helmet, I felt as tho' I could not get close enough to the ground.  But time &amp; use soon overcomes this feeling, for often since then, we have had them burst right alongside without causing us to halt in our stride.</p>
<p>But on this particular day nothing happened to any of us, &amp;</p>
