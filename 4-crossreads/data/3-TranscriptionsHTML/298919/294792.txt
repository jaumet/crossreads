<p>merchant ships that we passed had a gun mounted aft.  Steaming down the Thames Estuary, we caught up with a fleet of 8 trawlers proceeding riverwards.  One only, evidently the flagship was equipped with wireless.  At 7.10pm I received msge from warship that a Zeppelin was flying over England steering N.W. south of inner Yabbard.[?].  About this time we passed the mast of a sailing ship showing above water which was of one which <strike>been torpedoed</strike> &amp; sunk there many years ago.  At 8pm the sun set but the darkness did not descend till 9.30pm, twilight intervening.  By 9.40 we were outside the mouth of the river so it was decided to anchor for the night.  Since entering the estuary we passed dozens of ships outward bound, Destroyers &amp; Submarines cruising at intervals.</p>
