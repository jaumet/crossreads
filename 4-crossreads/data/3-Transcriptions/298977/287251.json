<p>-2- 31st August 1916.</p>
<p>put to the test, they all come up to the scratch, and it takes "action" to bring out a man's quality all right.</p>
<p>Now Roumania's into it, we are all feeling very optimistic again.  Speaking personally, judging by the amount of ammunition Germany has been throwing at us lately, it is a long way from finished yet, but of course its not this, but infernal politics that will end it.  We have read letters taken from German prisoners captured up here at Pozieres, which have a very despondent tone, and we have seen hundreds of Germans themselves who have a very dilapidated and dejected appearance which makes us think that things are not as they ought to be in the German Army.</p>
<p>We are going off this front for a spell now, thank goodness, though I suppose wherever we go things won't be too quiet.  These Australians have earned too great a reputation over here.  It doesn't pay.</p>
<p>The fine weather has deserted us.  It has been raining now for over a week, and made things very miserable in the trenches.  We made a great picture coming out I can tell you.  Covered in mud from head to foot and I looked like a combination of a mud house and a brick.  Have only just scraped the last of it off.</p>
<p>Well, as I'm not thinking of writing a book I'll knock off, though I could go for weeks I think.</p>
<p>Let us hear how the Stud Sheep Sales went off.  Sorry to hear you were laid up with a cold again.  Think we'll all have to go away on a trip when we all get back.  Sounds Irish doesn't it.</p>
<p>I wonder if the Mitchell has gone yet.  It will be very great sadness if you haven't one to meet us on the Wharf, when the ship pulls up at Woolloomooloo.  It will upset all my plans if there isn't.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to all in the Office.</p>
<p>Love to all at Home.<br/>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
