  
 In one of the ruined mosques of the citadel, I was shown some human bones. Remains of derelicts hanged from the top of the minarets & picked to death by scavengers (birds). From here I also obtained a good view of the tombs of the Mameluks & the Turkish prison at Maadi 
 5th Dec Sunday & no work. I attend St Joseph's Church at Cairo a fine building    &  beautiful interior. In the afternoon again visit the Pyramids. Feeling tired go to bed early. 
 6th Dec:- Have been transferred to Central Enquiry branch to-day. Casualty records    &  on 3rd  & 4th Batt. work. Rather monotonous but a change for a time.
