  
 Solomon Isdrs. On altar under glass is a tiny piece of the mat in wh. The body of Coleridge Patterson was wrapped after his murder. Everything in perfect taste. Visited Sol. Isdr chief, Fipe. House like inside of a great barn. Women's qrs on right, men on left. Grass mats on floor. All natives fine physical specimens, women so plump &  cared for. Introduced as "missionary big battle ship". They grinned a huge welcome. Chief gave me wooden pillow, very quaint &   a fly whisk of cocoanut fibre. I paid him. We talked in pidgin English &  when at leaving I said some native wds, niggers rocked with laughter &  shook hands, the women also who were as shy as school girls. Awfully funny. Landed 3 or 4 times. Visited Club, Grand Pacific Hotel, &   two or three long walks in the country. Lovely place. For nine mos of the yr good place to live in. Natives made ship huge gift of bananas &   sang old battle songs for our benefit.
