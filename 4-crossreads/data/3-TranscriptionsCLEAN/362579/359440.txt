  
 Left the station about 8 p.m. with our luggage in a Taxi. I'll tell you we were jolly lucky to get one. Arrived at Queen Mary's Hostel, 40 Bedford Place, London W.C. - It is a Hostel for Nursing-sisters   &  V.A.D.'s - We were invited   &  am really charmed. shall write   &  tell you more about it later on. 
 Had a very comfortable journey  down here yesterday. It took nearly all day. Left Lond. at 10 a.m.   &  reached here 5 p.m. Mrs Copp is a charming woman   &  has made me very welcome. Sorry I cannot stay longer. Mr. Copp is very kind   &  good - a little like Mr H. Copp. They have a very comfortable home   &  are very happy. Poor Mrs. Copp only returned from a Private Hosp. on Friday. Had small operation on her neck/ she is feeling stronger to-day. 
 Mr. Copp is Mayor of the Town so has a lot of call oon his time   &  his wife helps him a lot.
