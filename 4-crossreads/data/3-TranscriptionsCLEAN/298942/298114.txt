The engineers sleeping in a tunnel next to ours & leading off the same house like part of the hop factory, arose at about 7.30, so I turned in then & slept till breakfast time at 1130, when Walter came & woke me.
News greeted me that we were to be be relieved tonight by 1st Field bearers.
Am packed up ready now, expect to leave in about 3 hours time.  Considering the front we are in, we have had a fairly good & fortunate time for the eight days or so.  No casualties & not too
