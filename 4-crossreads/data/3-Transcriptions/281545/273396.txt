<p>Hut very much.   I did not take much notice as I thought that a Big Gun had come up the Line &amp; had fired a shot, which they often do, but when the Engines came down at 4 Pm for relief, one Driver told me that a Terrible Explosion had occurred at the Zouave Salvage Dump &amp; had killed about 50 men &amp; injured about 100 &amp; that they had an exciting experience putting out fires with water from the Tender &amp; prevented any further explosions taking place.  There were great excitement in Camp all the Evening discussion the Explosion.</p>
<p>Thursday 10/1/18, I signed on at 8 am &amp; went up to St Jeau Yard &amp; did some work &amp; then I had an oppertunity of going over &amp; viewing the siding where the Explosion occurred, Zouave Siding is about 100 yds from the yard &amp; had first been used as an Ammunition Dump but latterly part of the siding is used as a Royal Engineers Park for storing material &amp; the other part as a Salvage Dump for all kinds of damaged shells &amp; bombs. There are two roads running paralel about 15 yds apart, &amp; between these roads was were the Explosion took place.   On approaching the Siding I was horrified to see pieces of flesh &amp; clothing laying about everywhere &amp; lumps of Mud laying about, right between the two sets of Rails.  There were two large Craters, one about 30 ft<br/> </p>
