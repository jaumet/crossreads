<p>c/o Sis<br/>5.11.1916</p>
<p>[This letter appears to have been  incorrectly dated by the writer and to have been written on 5.12.1916. Letters dated 26.11.16 (saved from page 249) and 6.12.16 (saved from page 257) put it into context.]<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>Have only very few minutes to scratch a line for the mail closing tomorrow (6th) via America. No doubt Sis has told you in her letter today all the news about me - I am doing famously and if these chilly winter winds don't shrivel me up I should be quite fit for anything in a week. The oriental tinge has quite left me and I am back on ordinary diet &ndash; The foot is still a little weak but improving rapidly. I go before a Board on Monday next and don't expect they will send me back to France under three weeks, so am hoping to spend Xmas here</p>
<p>Mum's letter received here last week gave us the news of Pat's enlisting &ndash; I do hope he is not in camp yet and will have Xmas at home at least. I cabled</p>
