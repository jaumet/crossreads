I shall be expecting Aust. letters this week. It seems strange to get yout letters answering mine of last June. I'm sorry I cannot remember that I wrote in letters that have gone astray.
There is nothing exciting these days but I'm very well   &  comfortable. Shall be quite ready for fun when on Leave
Hope you are all well   &  happy. Must have some tea now to warm myself.
Fondest love   &  kisses to you all. Love to all my friends
FromYours lovinglyEdith
