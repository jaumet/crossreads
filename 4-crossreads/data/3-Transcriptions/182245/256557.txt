<p>1917 FEBRUARY</p>
<p>11 SUNDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny &amp; the warmest day we</p>
<p>have had since we came to</p>
<p>France. Cleaning up in the</p>
<p>stables in morning, &amp; Bill</p>
<p>Hunter &amp; I went up to Point</p>
<p>du Neippe in afternoon to</p>
<p>get some stores. Looking over</p>
<p>old snaps in evening &amp; they</p>
<p>bring back old memories all</p>
<p>right. Good Lord what wouldnt</p>
<p>I give to get back home</p>
<p>again. There was a hell of</p>
<p>a strafe on from 7.45 pm&nbsp;to</p>
<p>11.45 pm, the heaviest we have</p>
<p>had yet.</p>
