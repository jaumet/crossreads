Dear Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 58&nbsp; 71 &amp; 7V&nbsp; + the
Thank you for taking
off photos of the original old Binnie&#39;s
photos (or paintings). I see in George Binnies diaries
that he says &quot;Reading my Father&#39;s diaries 1858
on his trip to England he must have been
very ill all the time he was in Britain, but
he buzzed around and saw a lot, note his
father was born at Coatsbridge near Edinburgh&quot;.
That trip was nearly 10 years after his
Californian trip and 5 years after he was
married to Elizabeth Williams. Did she go too?
did he go to England later again? Also in
George&#39;s diary 1905 Jan 19th Uncle Richard died
89 years a good man gone&quot;.
Pam lent me a small diary (but not his
proper diary, this was more records of 4D) the
night I was at the Club. Alec&nbsp; is being most
helpful but says all he knows of family history
he got from his Uncle George and my Peter -
Ken I remember after George died took his grand-
father&#39;s diary being the eldest. Please look
up for me &mdash; All well here and such a
thrill having my great grandson - waddling
round, he&#39;s now a year &amp; I see lots of him very
advanced and so like Jimmy. We&#39;ve all
