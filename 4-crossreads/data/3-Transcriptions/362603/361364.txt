<p>Bulford<br/>8-1-17<br/>Dear Dad,   &amp;   Mum &amp; George,<br/>Nearly all my Friends voted yes for the Referendum, My own Parents   &amp;   George, but I Myself voted No.  A man's life to the Military Heads is worth only about 1 &frac12; d.  It is too big a concern to go right into but any man over here would not see another Brother go through what He has to go through,   &amp;   that is the view I took of it.  If you send all the Australians they will use them up,   &amp;   give the other Troops a spell.  Our Boys have to do all the dirty work, just the same as in Egypt   &amp;   on the Peninsula.  I was sorry to hear that Dad could not take His Holidays.  Things must be in a dreadful state in N.S.W.  Where did George stay at Katoomba?  It is just about time that the crowd took a tumble to Billy H.  The Boys have no time for Him at all now.  I can just see Mum rushing out to bring in the washing.  I wonder how she would like to be in this country trying to dry the washing.  Everything has to be dried indoors   &amp;   it takes a long time.  I thought Mum sent all the washing out.  She is so foolish to do it.  She is every bit as bad as Mrs Ali.  What does George do for sport now?  Surfing only I suppose.  The Parade Money that He gets will hardly pay for His fares.  Whereabouts does He parade, Manly or Sydney?  Mum gave quite a graphic account of the progress of the orchard.  Did the peach Tree that we bought from Manly bear any Fruit.  What were the Guavas like?  We bought the large yellow guava in Egypt.</p>
