 25 November 1914 Wednesday Reached Aden 5 pm 
 Write home to Nell Revielle at 6 After an uneventful night we arose to find ourselves in sight of the Arabian coast &amp; about 1 pm came in sight of the rock that commands this part of Aden a marvie piece of masonry on the top of which are the forts manned by imperial artillery &amp; territorial forces man the lower defences. The harbour is at present full of ships &amp; 4 Indian troopships. The township is out of sight at present the country is vey barren &amp; rugged no place for a pleasure trip. We expect to move again in the morning on to Port Said. The warships inside are keeping us interested by their searchlights then the three light houses are busy too. A large school of porpoises have been playing round the boat all night &amp; the men have been fishing &amp; got a few cat fish. Ran wireless engines &amp; found them alright OK Bed at 9. 
 26 November 1914 Thursday Left Aden 6 am 
 Revielle at 6 We moved off at 6 the other boats taking up their old places. During day we have passed no more than nine Indian Transports on the way back from the old dart &amp; saw the largest school of porpoises hundreds of em just outside Aden is even busier that Colombo for ships have been passing us every hour in [indecipherable] about 2 pm we passed through the Gulf of Aden then through the straits of Belan [indecipherable] passed Perim a fortified coal port sighted the African coast then entered Red Sea &amp; passed round Hells' Gates a gap between two immense rocks on which are two large lighthouses. The New Zealand boats have pushed on &amp; left the Hampshire in charge of us the Jap has finished her job. The old tub has been steaming 11 knots all day to make up lost time. Expect to go through the canal about Tuesday it being 1200 miles from Aden. Lights out early on account of danger.
