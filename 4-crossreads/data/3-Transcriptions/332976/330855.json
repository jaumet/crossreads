<p>May 1917<br/>9th.   This morning I started on a new job, making the butts &amp; targets at a range for a sniping school which is to be held here.  The position is an ideal place for a rifle range of this description &amp; the Tommie Labour Battalion, who are our "fatigues" have dug the trench into which the targets are to be fixed.<br/>10th.   The weather yesterday &amp; to-day has been gloriously fine, the temperature being between 50&deg; &amp; 60&deg;.   We continued with the rifle range &amp; started on the dissappearing targets.  I have five sappers with me, &amp; two Tommie carpenters, as well as about 40 of the "Labour Battn."   The remainder of the section are working over at the chatteau.</p>
