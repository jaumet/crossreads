  
 A London policeman is a real live policeman, he is full of information, not a single question I put to him, did he fail to answer, which proved to be correct in every case! 
 The endless traffic of buses and other vehicles is a revelation to one unaccustomed to such a city.  London is certainly cosmopolitan to the fullest extent, from the beggar to the aristocrat and royalty to be seen at all times of the day in London. The twilight in England was a new pleasure. 
 I renewed my acquaintances in the way of visiting my old friends such as the Abbey, the Tower and numerous other places. London is certainly a mighty interesting city. I like Temple Thursston's book "The Garden of Resurrection" very much. his description of winter time in London is very fine. 
 Not feeling too  much  well on the next day I paid a visit to Millbank hospital
