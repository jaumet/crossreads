<p>were conspicuous by their absence, &amp; month after month was allowed to slip by before help of a pratical nature was forthcoming.  The Enemy was given ample time to strengthen His defences, &amp; each month the price of success rose Higher &amp; Higher.<br/>After the disappointment at Suvla Bay the Government was unable to decide whether to press forward, or hold on or evacuate.  The stormy season began in October.  The Austro German Army was advancing through Serbia &amp; communications between Berlin &amp;  Constantinople were certain to be opened before Xmas.
