I doubt the resisting power of any earthwork or redoubt against these heavy shells. They plough huge craters in the ground & their size may be judged by the fact that one of the base of one wh was fired last night could have covered a large dinner plate with ease. And they stand 3½ feet high.

Gen. Godley, accompanied by Lieut-Col Heaton Rhodes returns from Mudros.

The first was beautifully timed – it came with a deafening whizz, glanced off the back wall of the cook house & went clean through one of the escort’s dug-outs as if it were made of tissue paper. It came to a dead-end half a dozen yds above the General’s quarters. A second shell planted itself near the wireless pole & a third tore a crater in the earth at the mouth of the gully near the Indian Camp. And then followed a fusillade of two or three shells a minute. The strong & cantankerous wind planted them in all sorts of odd places & interesting places but fortunately no one was injured. An Indian gunner received a slight chest bruise from a shell planted
