The Commanders, officers and crews of Britains Iron-clads stand-to and give us rousing cheers.  By submarine destroyer.  cruiser & battleship bearing the "Jack"  and in some cases the "Stars & Stripes" we are truly honoured in a British manner and given a farewell so sincere & spirited that the passing years cannot possibly efface its stirring memories.
With a stilled tongue
