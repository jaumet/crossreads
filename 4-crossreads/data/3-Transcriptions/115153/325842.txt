<p>There were also 400 wounded Germans being cared for in the Fargo Hospital which was in the vicinity.</p>
<p>After we had been at Salisbury Plains a few weeks, we were notified that we were to attend a review by His Majesty the King. The day came, and we were called up in the morning a little earlier than usual, to prepare ourselves, in that we had to clean all the brasswork of our equipment, clean our rifles extra well, and make ourselves look smart generally. The review was to take place at Bulford Camp Training grounds and necessitated our marching 4 miles to reach there. It was a lovely sharp morning; just ideal for marching, and we wended our way over grassy hills and down valleys until we reached a nice country road, which bore us to the Camp grounds on which the review was to be held.</p>
<p>The review was a grand spectacle, for it comprised, roughly speaking, 60,000 soldiers in the march past, with a massed band of 400 to 500 instruments playing continuously while the march was in progress. The troops marching represented every branch of the Australian Army, from the infantry up to the highly technical units, and the bands which composed the massed bands were all Australian Brigade bands. The time occupied passing the Flag base was about 11/2 hours, and when we had finished the march-past we all formed up in a huge close mass formation, when the King rode through tracks that we cleared in the mass so that he might have another look at us. As the King rode through  the mass on this occasion there was a roaring din of cheering the whole time, and hats were waved on the tips of bayonets fixed to the rifles.</p>
<p>The Review being over, we had to march home to our respective camps again, and I regret to say the weather took a turn for the worse and it rained all the way back, consequently we were all wet through.</p>
<p>Another few weeks hard training went on and we were due for our London leave which was 4 days. It was called London leave but it did not stipulate that we had to visit London, as we were allowed concession fares all over the United Kingdom and Ireland; the men going to Ireland and some parts of the North of Scotland getting a day extra.</p>
