<p>It's not bad at all especially after six weeks at sea. Last night I lay out &amp; listened to the noise of the bush. Every sort of jabber imaginable until a couple of leopards started a sing song in the gully just behind us. The silence broken only by the hurried departure of various monkeys.<br/>There are three dreaded man eaters on this mountain  the mamba &ndash; a poisonous tree snake, very ferocious, the Cameroon Ape, a grey side whiskered party who is harmless enough by day but a terror by night &amp; the black leopard. The latter are numerous &amp; with the muskcat are the only dangerous felines nearer than Koro. Lincoln refloated.<br/>2nd  Returned to ship to remove baggage. M Gr's commandeered to handle cargo. Ship leaking badly &amp; no good as troopship.
