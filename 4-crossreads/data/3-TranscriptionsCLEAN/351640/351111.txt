 [Newspaper clipping:] He Looked Up "The spirit of the Navy remains unchanged whatever the dangers which confront it," writes Mr. Ashmead Bartlett. "I do not think I can describe it better than by quoting what was found by the Censor in the letter of a young bluejacket:- " 'Mother, it is sometimes very hot out here when the shells are dropping all about you and the submarines are hovering round, and you may strike a mine at any minute. At first I was a bit scared, but I remembered the words of the padre last Sunday, when he said:- "Men, men, in times of trial and danger look upwards." I did look upwards, mother, and if there wasn't a blooming aeroplane dropping bombs on us!' "
