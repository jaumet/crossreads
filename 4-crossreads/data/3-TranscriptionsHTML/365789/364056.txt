<p>Queenslanders marching out two days later with a step which would do credit to a Guards regiment going in.  So ended a fight as hard as Australians have ever fought.  The Western Australians were robbed of the victory which their great charge deserved.  The Tasmanians, in some ways, had the hardest fighting of all.</p>
<p>Head-Quarters, France,<br/>21st August.</p>
<p>The Germans call it Trommelfeuer &ndash; drum-fire.  I do not know any better description for the distant sound of it.  We hear it every day from some quarter or this wide battlefield.  You will be sitting at your tea, the normal, spasmodic banging of your own guns sounding in the nearer positions five, ten, perhaps fifteen times in the minute.  Suddenly, from over the distant hills to left or right there breaks out the roll of a great kettledrum, ever so far away.  Some one is playing the tattoo softly and very quickly.  If it is nearer, and especially if it is a German, it sounds as if he played it on an iron ship's tank instead.</p>
<p>That is the trommelfeuer &ndash; what we call intense bombardment.  When it is very rapid &ndash; like the swift roll of a kettledrum &ndash; you take it that it must be the French seventy-fives down south preparing the way for a French assault; but it is often our own guns after all.  I doubt if there are many who can really distinguish between the distant sound of them</p>
<p>Long afterwards &ndash; perhaps in the grey of the next morning &ndash; you may see outside of some dug-outs, guarded by half-a-dozen Australians with fixed bayonets, a group of dejected men in grey.  The cold Scotch mist stands in little beads on the grey cloth; the bayonets shine very cold in the white light before the dawn' the damp slippery brown earth is too wet for a comfortable seat.  But there is always some Australian there that will give them a cigarette. A cheery Melbourne youngster or two step down into the crowd, and liven them with a little friendly chaff.  The blue sky begins to show through the mist; the early morning aeroplane hums past on its way to the line, low down, half hidden in the wrack.  The big bushman from Gippsland at a neighbouring coffee stall &ndash; praise Heaven for that institution &ndash; gives them a drink of warm stuff.  And I verily believe that at that moment they emerge for the first time out of a frightful dream, for they are the men who have been through the trommelfeuer.</p>
<p>Strong men arrive from that experience shaking like leaves in the wind.  I have seen one of our youngsters &ndash; a boy who had fought a great fight all through the dark hours, and who had refused to come back when he was first ordered to &ndash; I have seen him unable to keep still for an instant after the strain, and yet ready to fight on till he dropped.  Physically, almost a wreck, but with his wits as sharp and his spirits as keen as a steel chisel.  I have seen others who, after doing glorious work through thirty or forty hours of unimaginable strain, buried, and buried, and buried again, and still working like tigers, have broken down and collapsed, unable to stand or to walk, unable to move an arm except limply as if it were string, ready to weep like little children.</p>
<p>It is the method which the German invented for his own use.  For a year and a half he had had the monopoly of it; our men had to hang on as best they could under the knowledge that the enemy had more guns and more shells than we, and bigger shell at that.  But at last the weapon seems to have been turned against him.  No doubt his armaments and munitions are growing fast, but ours have, for the moment, overtaken them.  And hell though it is for both sides &ndash; something which no soldiers in the world's history ever yet had to endure &ndash; it is better for us at present than for the Germans.  I have heard men coming out of the thick of it, say, "Well, I am glad I am not a German."</p>
<p>Now here is what it means.  There is no good done by describing the particular horrors of war.</p>
