<p>Monday 23 August, 1915</p>
<p>Have been talking to some Ghurkas. We cooked our breakfast in the trenches, water is scarce but we have been well supplied with food so far.</p>
<p>We have been busy improving our trenches all day. A few stray shots have come our way but no one has been hurt, we have had plenty of food &amp; water.</p>
<p>We are still 700 yards behind the firing line. We have had several casualties. The enemy have sent a few shrapnel shells against our trenches, severly wounding one man.</p>
<p><s>The Gurrkas made a slight advance during the night and</s>&nbsp;the stray bullets have been very bad. We are becoming expert cooks, with the limited utensils at our disposal.</p>
