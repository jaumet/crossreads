<p>then. I cant make Berts letter out wanting money sent across to the Commonwealth Bank. He may be sent to [indecipherable] Zerland from Germany but as for my getting to <strike>Australia</strike> England well I don't think it all likely until the war is over. The only prisoners they exchange in that way are men unfit for further service. Unless he is working things to make a break from there. If he does well he will find plenty of help waiting him in England. Will you see if I can get some money transferred from Savings Bank to the Commonwealth Bank in England anything to &amp;pound;50. You see I am due for leave to Paris also to England in a month or two. We cant get our leave unless we have &amp;pound;10 in our pay book or show it is waiting us in England. If I can get the money transferred across to the Commonwealth Bank I can draw when I want it.</p>
