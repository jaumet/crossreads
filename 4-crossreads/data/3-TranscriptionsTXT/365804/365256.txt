 Dear Mrs.Richards I regret exceedingly to be compelled to break to you the news of your dear son's death. Captain Richards during the days he passed at this station became a great friend of many of the officers and tho' not of my religion &ndash; I am a Roman Catholic Chaplain &ndash; he took a fancy to me and often wished to chat with me. I cannot tell you much his death was felt by all who knew him. But of course it must be a very grave trial to you. You have, however, the consolation of knowing that your son did his duty in this awful war, with unflinching courage; all his officers are loud in his praise. Well then, his wound were so bad that had he lived his life would have been a misery to him. He had to have both legs amputated. I know these considerations are insufficient to lighten the load of your grief. I think God will help you courageously to bear up under this heavy burden 
 Everything that medical skill and scientific nursing could suggest was done to save your son. And I must say the poor patient was most appreciative of every little kindness we endeavoured to show him. 
 Accept then my most sincere sympathy and believe me, Yours faithfully (Sgd) E.J.Cullen. C.F. R.C. Chaplain No. 3 C.C.S. B.E.F.
