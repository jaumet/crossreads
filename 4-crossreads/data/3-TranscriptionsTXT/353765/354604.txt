June 19161st - Was the only bomb out of eight to do damage. 3rd killed a camel others went wide. However it was enough. Four killed outright, three died shortly afterwards & another died after leg had been amputated. Leg in frightful condition knee cap & thereabouts shattered into fragments the largest being about an inch. Another had half jaw & face blown off, another had deep wound in buttock, breaking pelvis & injuring internally. May be peritonaeum only or may have been intestines. Rather pathetic when putting him on operating table. Poor beggar, with a very poor chance of living said, "Don't lose my tunic, Matey its got a photo of my wife & children in the pocket of it" Hope he survives. In terrible pain. He & man with face not expected to live. Treated 21 with anaesthetics & about three without Number of compound & complicated1st - fractured & some very bad wounds. They were all nasty & some hit in about eight or ten places. One chap was hit on top of head, both arms R. side of abdomen, thigh & below knee. Had two operating tables going hard from 6.15 am to 5.30 pm. Long operations in the morning. Did not get any breakfast & by good luck managed to get a drink of poor tea & some bully & bread. Kept the sides from touching that was all. Cleaned us roughly after tea. About 40 horses killed & reports say about 60 wounded but a V.C said they had only 13 to treat. Probably others slight wounds only. Scattered in all directions. Bomb that killed a camel & bowled a nigger over fell about 100 yards off camp. Evidently tried to bomb NZs, only also & missed. Turned MG on to Railhead as well as our camp. Did no damage with it. Antics of some of our men very funny
