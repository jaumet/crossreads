<p>1/5/17<br/>Favreuil<br/>Another fine sunny day. After breakfast with Spiller rode up to Vaulx-Vraucourt the roads were heavy with dust and passing motor lorries made them unpleasant. In Vaulx a number of the German proclamations are still on the walls and their signboards remain. At the junction of roads in the village there is a large crater where the fork has been blown up. Many heavy guns with their large stocks of shells are in position among the ruins &ndash; rather a good job "the Heavies". Just outside the town on a piece of green bank backed by a hedge is a large crucifix undamaged. A Taube was over spotting for a heavy battery whose shells were landing on the road about 500ft  from us. Selected a suitable valley in which the Battalion can assemble and rest prior to moving up to the front line. Returned to camp again much enjoying the ride over the paddocks. Skylarks and other birds filling the air</p>
