Sunday 16 September 1917
Alex:[The following paragraph crossed through.]Had a letter from Dolly but none from home yet. Some of the photos I sent Dolly she returned the Censor having put them through a Bath blotting the whole lot. I hope what I send you are not so treated.. Everyone tells me I'm looking very fit again again, anyway I'm having an easy wait but am naturally very impatient at the delay.
Intend going St. Marks Church near Matron Aly's Club at 10.50 this morning.
