  
 cut by a piece of shell. Poor chap last I saw of him he was watching the Signallers playing cards now he is buried. 
 Thursday. 17/5/17 Been much quieter altho a good few shells came over yesterday afternoon & last night some of them gas. Take it all round there was not anything out of the ordinary except that they came from one quarter only viz on the left. so that it is probable that he is retiring one sector at a time. There are expectations that we are to be relieved tonight but nothing definite, the sooner the better. Pay 17/1 25.12.0

Pay. 18/1. 25,13.0. Our planes were out early this morning so we might learn where he is not been able to go up for 2 days.
