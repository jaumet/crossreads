<p>Saturday Jan 26. 1918.<br/>1272 day of the war and 14th and last day of my leave.<br/>It is dull and cloudy this morning. The weather during the past week has been remarkable fine for this time of year. This is Australia day and a man is selling wattle blossom on the street in front of the War Chest Club. He has a basketful of fine large yellow bunches the first I have seen since I left Victoria. It is today the 130 anniversary of the settlement of Australia.<br/>I am posting this diary to my wife today together with some post cards.</p>
