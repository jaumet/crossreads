Rabaul - Lucky we've wireless - I did that job - If I hadn't been there I don't think those sick wd have ever left the pier - I sent men out to collar transport in the shape of trucks - They came back with a hand cart & a truck without a deck - Sailors are fools - The wheels of the handcart dropped thro the planks of the pier & what damned good the bottomless truck was God knows - I told a few men to come with me - In five minutes I had seen a truck - 1/4 mile off - I told the men to bring it along - This they did because I'd told them to & it was a definite job - I got my sick inboard with their 'ammicks & off we went - Got to hospital & discharged cargo - piled their 'ammicks in a corner - got my shore crowd together & off I went to the Fantome - Fitz had asked me to lunch on some chickens he'd got - First chicken I've had - Jackson, Bond, F & I enjoyed 2 chickens & cold beer - Then we went to the Una & jumped from the ship's side &
