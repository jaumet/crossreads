Dear Dad, Mother & George, I am Orderly Corp to-day & as I have 2 P.C.'s left I thought I would send them Home. We had nice light Soda Biscuits, butter & cheese, figs, grapes & dates with Lime Juice to drink besides Bread & Jam for dinner. What Ho that for a feed. We often get a feed of figs & they are really lovely. The dates which I have eaten for the first time are luscious, & not nearly so sickly sweet as when we get them packed in boxes. We had  2 saved out of Rations in some way & the 2, Masters Assistant bought the above with the Money. We are living such a lazy life & there does not seem to be any chance of moving.  Love Harry.
