When a Russian Jew will offer 8 or 10 marks for a pound tin of "bully" it means that he can obtain 15 to 20 marks for it in Brandenburg.    The usual prices are 8 to 10 potatoes for one portion of German bread - last night I bought 6 eggs for a tin of "bully".    One haggles in German with these dealers.   Our menu today, to celebrate the launching of our Mess, was elaborate. Breakfast. Eggs and Bacon Lettuce - Hot chocolate. Dinner.   "Biled Murphies" & bully beef. Preserved pineapple. - Cocoa. Tea.   "Grape Nuts" with Nestle's Milk. Sardines - Biscuits - Coffee. 
 The above made a hole in our grub-box which would have made The Black Douglas (R.S.T.!) groan for a week. 
 Fri. 21st June In Brandenburg "mit dem Wagen". Twice daily a wagon goes to Brandenburg Post Office to bring up the prisoner's parcels to the camp.
