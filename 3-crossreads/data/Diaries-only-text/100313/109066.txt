21/1/18 Edinburgh
Up early and breakfasted with the old Colonel. A dull foggy day with snow piled up on the roads where it had been scraped from the footpaths. A cab called at 8.30 and we drove to the Caledonian station through the streets of the sombre dull Edinburgh type. The passersby all serious people on business bent, their dialect broad. "Ay" instead of "Yes". 27 Abercromby Place belies its exterior and is splendidly comfortable. Much appreciated a hot water bottle in the bed. These are here called "pigs". Took train for Crieff at 8.55 and the journey lies through countryside all snowy. Condensed vapour on the windows prevents looking out and a mist is hanging over the landscape. Passed Stirling, the Bridge of Allan c but could not enjoy the scenery unfortunately. The country does not look anything like as good as it did when I was here in the summer time of 1916.
