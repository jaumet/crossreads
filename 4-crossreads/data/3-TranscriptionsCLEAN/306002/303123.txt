  
 27.4.15 Tue. 27th.  Six o'clock reveille this morning, & were tired enough to sleep for a week when the bugle went.  We had a buckjumping exhibition & Maxwell was there.  The 6th L.H. has an outlaw that has not been ridden, he succeeded in throwing three of our riders this morning, no holds are allowed, & have to ride him in the military saddle, so the men had very little show of riding him.  We had a good trip from Maadi to Heliopolis through Cairo.  We arrived back in Camp about 2.30, & found there is no water in the pipes or troughs & had take the horses to the Vetinary troughs & found Arthur Welch is camped, came from Mena last Saturday, to bed early.
