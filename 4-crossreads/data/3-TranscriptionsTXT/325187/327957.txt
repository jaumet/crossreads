 [Wednesday 2 August 1916] 
 Night outpost tonight very quiet &amp; very weird.  This Desert is fine Sand different to LIBYAN Desert which is stony &amp; you could  hear  any one approaching. Here Camels are absolutely silent- while  our  horses neigh &amp; rattle bits &amp; irons.  MONITORS shelled enemy lines from Mediteranean today. I said yesterday the Devils dropped  no darts  but in another part of the Camp they threw out 1000s especially over the poor CAMELS, Little 6 inch steel arrows like they dropped on the Peninsular &amp; capable of going clean through a man-   I believe the [indecipherable] setting Flags stick Pins in one too !!!!
