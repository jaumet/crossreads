Dear Mick
For the past 7 days we have been more or less stranded at Chanak on the Asiatic side of the Gate of the World.  Snow Blizzards, Ice & general discomfort.  No coal or wood and a damp gloomy fifth rate house called the Lion Hotel, may I live to forget it.
Apart from the delay & the temperature this place is interesting & the surrounding country very beautiful & fertile and not at all what one is led to believe from the geographical lessons of childhood which gave me the impression that Asia was barren rocks & desert.
The Turks here are a most murderous looking lot but awfully like Gilbert & Sullivan opera.  The troops (British) in occupation here have established themselves fairly well & there is a theatre when a jolly good imitation review is performed by remarkably able soldier actors.
I have managed to make four sketches, quite passable, of points of interest but we look over towards Anzac & I
