11-12-16Mon 11thThe Anzac Troops took a pack horse in today for canteen stores & we had Mr Frost with us for dinner. An enemy 'plane came over about dinner time & had us standing to our horses, she dropped 3 bombs 300 yards from the 3rd Regt lines but did no damage, she was too high for accuracy. Snowy Wride returned from the School of Instruction today & reports a good many batteries of Artillery & Scottish Infantrymen on the road out. The Infantry march from Kantara to get fit, they march on wire netting rolled out along the desert & it makes a very good road to march on. The gunners at Mazar boast they scored a hit with the third shot yesterday damaging the tail of the 'plane.
