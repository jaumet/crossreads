  
 We went to a Garrison sing song & then to the Club & had Beer - Ajax becoming declamatory & telling his press news & vaunting up Old England & the militia & Hull - we went off to the Beach - Who goes there? Friend - Advance friend & we got to our boat & to the Fantome & then gave Ajax a night cap & sent him to his own Elax - Ajax wants looking after ashore - at sea he's reliable enough but ashore he's adrift - Ajax gave me potatoes & onions & has promised me more pig - Ajax likes me & I understand these Sailor men & their ways - 
 Thursday Jan 28-15 -  Fantome went down Simpson Hafen 4  miles to Matupi to coal - We shall take some days at it I fancy - The Una came in last night - Here we are - 5 ships of war - What's our next job? We got up alongside the Matupi pier - then Fitz & I went to the hot springs & bathed - Boiling salt water issuing from the rocks & steaming & smellful like a laundry -
