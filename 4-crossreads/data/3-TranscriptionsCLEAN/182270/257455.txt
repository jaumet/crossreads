 FRIDAY, MAY 23, 1919. 
 Fine, with a few odd showers. 3 pts 
 Rode round bottom end with 
 Peter in morning and along 
 the trail I made yesterday. 
 The rabbits had been playing 
 all about it, & taken lots 
 of the baits but only found 
 one dead rabbit. Round the 
 Hill paddock with Peter & Linda 
 in afternoon.
