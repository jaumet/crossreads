Court again. We start on another Case today I cant tell you verdict of 1st one until it has been confirmed.  Hope to see Nowel tomorrowThis Court Martial has been a complete change to the Desert & Patrols & a treat to get away from the Dust & Flies-There is no use any lady coming to the front unless in really good health, they only go sick and then it takes 2 sound men to look after themI am glad Harry [indecipherable] has gone back he was quite [indecipherable].
