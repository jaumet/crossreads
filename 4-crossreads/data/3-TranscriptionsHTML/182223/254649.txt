The dust coming again strongly it began&nbsp;<s>jus</s> at 7-45 a.m. when I was galloping midst the splended air of the Lyssian plateau, blowing from the&nbsp; South.

<p>Wednesday 31&nbsp;March 1915<br />Ride before breakfast. Air warm. Locusts. Snails on shrubs, glued to stalk by gum at open End, Alabaster, bones human &amp; other, petrified wood. Moisture deposited on stones before sun rise then evaporated by the sun light gives a coolness&nbsp;to the atmosphere on the ridge of the plateau.&nbsp;<br />Ride during the afternoon across the cultivated lands. Looking at the Locusts on the banks of the Canals, where they were in large numbers <s>being</s> the females being impregnated, &amp; it may be getting ready to deposit their eggs.
