<p>May 15th<br/>23 miles today.  Up at 3 am &amp; on the track at 4 am.  Not feeling too well today fairly knocked up tonight.  Heat in the valleys intense therefore we all are as brown as berries.  Dick Hooper pretty bad with dysentry.  Also Young, Lake and Southgate our batmen.  These lads require all the attention instead of being what they are supposed to be, but they do their best.</p>
<p>May 16<br/>Easy march of 8 miles taking advantage of a rest.</p>
<p>May 17th<br/>18 miles today negotiated big pass, climbed 8000 feet.  Road made by Russians, fairly good.  Had to cross stream after coming down</p>
