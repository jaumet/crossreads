<p>THURSDAY, JUNE 26, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine. Down round the bottom end</p>
<p>all day. Got a ram out of my ewes</p>
<p>&amp; put him in 4D. Put ewes</p>
<p>into Mountain, except a</p>
<p>couple with young lambs. They</p>
<p>are lambing very nicely. Took</p>
<p>the ferrets up to woolshed in</p>
<p>evening &amp; got a few bunnies.</p>
<p>Jo &amp; Peter took Jessie into the</p>
<p>9.30 train at night. The little</p>
<p>car seized up at Midway</p>
<p>coming home &amp; they had to</p>
<p>walk. Met them in front of</p>
<p>Abbotslea.</p>
