A big raid which had been premeditated for some time came off last nigh. Eight hundred N.Z ders went over last night and caused considerable damage and capturing eighty prisoners.

We had over a hundred brought in wounded including 13 Germans. Some of them were very badly wounded. One of them had his intestines hanging out of his body. The men seem to be quite jubilant over their starring experiences last night, at least the slightly wounded are.

March 5th.

Snowing to-day.

Took a walk with W. I out to Sailly. Parts of the road has to be screened because the enemy can see troops and transports passing at these parts and shell them at favourable opportunities.

There are two pretty large cemeterys at this place One is full of graves of Scottish & English soldiers and the other is an Anzac graveyard only having been opened since the Anzacs took over this part of the line. It is pretty well full up already in spite of the fact that the Anzacs have only been here about ten months.
