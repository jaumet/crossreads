Mercy Kamerad Souvenir Kamerad at the same time throwing their arms away tendering their Helmets to our men. They were sent to the rear of course.Whilst observing the Gun Fire a very curious shell nearly got me. It seemed to burst high up then fall in flames, but it looked very pretty.The Cathedral still stands in Albert (That is the Image) but the next good shell will finish it. We were kept awake all last night by the furious fighting they got very close to our Horse Lines camp with shrapnel, it bursting on a Ridge close by.They scored one god hit with a Jack Johnson by hitting an ammunition stack exploding it. You never saw the like in your life it went up with a roar a vast sheet of flame rained bullets for half an hour after.Our Sleeping Lizzie however, got onto the culprit with a few well placed shells entirely silenced it. The above Gun is a gigantic 16 inch on a Railway runs up to its position after firing a few shots goes back again, but the report from the beggar makes one sick.The 9' 2" Howitzers kick up a deuce of a row there is a Battery of them right close to us, so imagine the Headaches.
