<p>February 26 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Got out at 6 as usual</p>
<p>Off to Fashn this morning so had to hurry about a bit, had a fair trip &amp; got back early.</p>
<p>In the morning 1 battery of 18 pds &amp; one Mountain Battery had battle practice assisted by the aeroplanes indirect firing was good I believe but they shelled the hills opposite with battery fire &amp; didn't it remind us of the Penni, the niggers were thunder-struck with the row &amp; think that after all we are going to do for them.</p>
<p>Went up the town at night &amp; met some of the boys then came home &ndash; went to bed at 9.35.</p>
<p>Weather frightfully hot again, horses feeling it very much.</p>
<p>February 27, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>Went to church this morning &amp; afterwards groomed &amp; cleaned my horse, she is nearly OK again from the kick she received. In the afternoon Capt Chisholm &amp; I went out to Nazlet-el-ebeit on the motors, had a fair trip out, he came off a couple of times but nothing to speak, had plenty to eat on arrival there for I had afternoon tea in the officers mess left at 10 to 5 &amp; got home at 6 to find a mail awaiting me, one from Nell, Mother &amp; Pater, filled in a pleasant half hours  reading. Wrote answers to them &amp; turned in at 9, wrote also to Alec who I got one from.</p>
