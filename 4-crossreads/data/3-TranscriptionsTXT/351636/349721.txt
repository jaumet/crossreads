Dear Mr. Horsfield -Could you kindly assist Mrs. Nelson wife of a soldier in camp again, after being returned wounded, Mrs. Nelson has been seriously ill & is without means to pay her rent or get food till her military pay comes & until she is strong enough to take a situation - She is very proud & unwilling to take help which we offered before but now compelled to do so.
Yours trulyE. H. Bennie.
