<p>Dear Mum,<br/>This corridor is above the Room where Raleigh was imprisoned. The door which is just past the right hand corner leads to the Room where the Princes were murdered. The wall is 7 feet thick just here  &amp;  in fact all around the inner Tower. We met 3 Australian Nurses on Furlough from France just here  &amp;  we volunteered to take them round. They knew   &amp;   had as orderly Dave's best chum in France. They are going to send some comforts to Cyril Whitehead too so we did well to speak to them.  Harry</p>
