 My dear Mother 
 Tommy came over to Bhurtpore Barracks to visit me the night before I left. He's awfully cut up about Alan, and brought me a letter from Mary  from  to him to read. Poor old Una, what a brick she's being. Tommy is very upset to know what to do. He thinks that he should not write home to you because of the unfortunate laps of time since you got the news. I think if you sent that sheepskin vest with flannel sleeves it would be handy. My word its as cold as charity. I've a bit of a cold but am well. Lovingly Dene
