Dear Judge FergusonYr letter only reached me at Heliopolis where I was detained thru illness, & cd not come on here with the Batt. But I am glad to say I am now quite well & trying to do my best here with my men. I found them in good form but a number have gone sick since they took up this position, go sick among this number & today our strength is 730. We on list receive our 3rd Reinforcements, they were sent to the 18th Battn, which had had a bad time but our 4th are I hear now in Egypt, & will soon be across to join us, and we are wanting them. I am very pleased to Report that we received a good consignment of Ref. comforts yesty (about 8 cases) & have distributed them to the men, the warm articles were much appreciated. Mr Burren at fairs had charge of them & I understand he is the Authority there to receive & forward on these refreshments. To facilitate transhipment it is best to have the cases one size, about the same size of a Kerosene Can but shd be securely bound and well stencilled address, on at least two sides of case. I'd advise having stencil plate cast & let 20th Battn in large letters. We are in position known as Russells Top a very important post, but have orders this morning to hand over to 26th Batt & go into rest quarters for a time
