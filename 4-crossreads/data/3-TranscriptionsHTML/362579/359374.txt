<p>My dearest Belle:</p>
<p>P.S. If there is enough money in Bank, could you buy some Equity Shares from me! Ask Mr Thomas what he thinks! Suppose it won't alter my   <u>Will</u>, so leave it where it is. Don't be alarmed but business is etc.</p>
<p>If anything should happen to me   &amp;  my luggage arrives home safely, which I very much doubt I should like a little souvenir given to each of my friends &ndash; in Melb., leave it to your judgement.</p>
