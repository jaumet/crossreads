<p>[Monday 2 October 1916]</p>
<p>THE DAY<br/>Well at 10.45 AM I was married at St Thomas Church by The Rev Mr Ellison, to a dear little girl Dorothy Marguerite Isherwood &ndash; Laura travelled to London with us &amp; we are now at Berners Hotel clearing out from Somerset after dinner as the little wife did not like it &amp; our room had not been reserved.<br/>"Jones" does not seem to understand the word STUNT &amp; prints all sorts of variations-<br/>It is an Americanism used a great deal these days in speaking of military work.</p>
