<p>up &amp; crawled over us, must have been dreaming of the Huns. Sunday 7 July It was lovely to have a nice quiet day of rest again here behind the line, although Fritz sent over a shell that sent us scurrying into our dugouts. It's funny, one seems to be more frightened of the stray shell here, than the many in the line. Had a letter from Bon today, wrote to him after tea. We went &amp; had a look at an anti-<strike>aircraft</strike> tank gun which our chaps captured in Hamel in the hop over. The Tommies were firing it back at the Huns, they found some ammunition for it there. Monday 8 July We went down to Corbie for a hot shower &amp; change of clothing this morning, it was a treat after the trenches. I was amused at a notice I saw on the wall of a shell torn building in Corbie, it was in pencil "13,000 miles to Griffiths Bros', teas," with a railway signal drawn near it, like the notices one sees along the railway lines towards Sydney. Had an easy day, reading &amp; resting. There are guns galore all round us here, I saw a chap named McIntyre on one gun, he used to be in the Light Horse, &amp; was in the same ward as I at St. Andrew's, Malta in 1915.  Tuesday 9 July We went on the usual old digging fatigue today, had to go a long way down through</p>
