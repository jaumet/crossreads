<p>4-1-17<br/>Thurs 4th<br/>Another wet night &amp; a cold miserable day. I went to Bde HQs this morning &amp; saw Capt Hudson about my leave but as Mr Kater does not arrive back till tomorrow I am waiting till he returns. Col Granville says he feels sure I will miss the boat if I go down before the 10th, so I am in a query when to go, but can get away any day I like, but am only allowed 3 days at Port Said. 30 English Tommies are up for a court martial &amp; they smuggled 25 jars of rum &amp; all got drunk on it, one man drank himself to death. Roger gave me another lively time this morning; Septic sores are very plentiful at present;</p>
