November, 1915
Monday 22
Discharged from hospital.
Feeling good.
Cheese & treacle are beginning to be issued now.
Have developed an enormous appetite.
Carrying becoming rather strenuous work.
[indecipherable] J. Boyd Smith both of ours killed by a high explosive Jack Johnson round on the left to us.
Shells are getting thicker every day now.
Horrible howitzers are falling all round & in the camp.
