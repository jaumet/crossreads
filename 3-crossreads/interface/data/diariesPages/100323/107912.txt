22/6/19 London
A very fine morning. Rose late and went to Hyde Park very crowded and gay. Rotten Row had a good company of riders though what they can see in trotting up and down like public performers before multitudes of people I cannot understand. Met 2 Australian sisters from Salonica and walked up and down talking with them until 1 o'c when I tubed back to Paddington and had lunch. Then caught the 2.40 express which reached Westbury in a splendid non-stop run at 5 pm the engine picking up water as it rushed along out of long troughs beside the rails. The countryside was looking very verdant after the rain. Settled down on arrival to a quiet evening in camp.
