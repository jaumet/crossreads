Dear Mother & FatherRecieved your letter dated 7 June, and was very pleased to hear that you were all well. I am back with the battalion after ten days in Hospital with my tonsils. I had a bad time while they were swollen, but for the remaining five days I was well looked after & had a good time Next time I am near a hospital I will have them taken outBye the way I heard Captain Linklater is a prisoner of war. It is pretty correct tooI am feeling tip top and as fit as a fiddle. The allies are going ahead well & if the weather will only keep fine, there will be a big difference in two months. I wish we were moving back to Sydney. I have sent my Medal to Aunt Florrie, as it is too risky to send on to Sydney just yet. Will write again soon.Hoping you are all keeping wellHeaps of love & kissesYour loving SonTom
