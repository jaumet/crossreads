<p>We are to be granted leave from 10 am till midnight : I clicked for port piquet but didn't do much : went to police station &amp; found out our duties : very easy " the "cases" brought in by the police amused us greatly as we were able to listen to the questions that were put to them : went for a round trip in the tram</p>
