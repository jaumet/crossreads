  
 post & some by hand. I typed the substance of your very interesting letter from the Aerodrome & let friends see it, & I dont think any of them, Greenwells, Newtons, etc., get so much news. 
 I hope you get the newspaper scraps. It is hardly any use sending whole ones, as I feel sure that the post office wont guarantee to send heavy papers (3 part advmts.) & books & so on, to the front. So I cut out the interesting pars & send as printed matter. I assume in Egypt you get plenty on sale, but in Gallipoli it must be different. Let us know as well as you can, if it is any good sending papers, or parcel such as socks etc. I suppose the Commissariat issue certain supplies. 
 In the bush, there was a class of chaps called "toe-raggers", because they never had socks, but wrapped rags round their feet. It can be done to good advantage too, so long as you avoid lumps. 
 Look after yourself personally as well as you can, it may avert illness. The others have all written at various times; no doubt  some  letters may miscarry. 
 With best love Father. (Pass round the [indecipherable] enclosed)
