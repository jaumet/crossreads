 only in for forty eight hours &amp; it was quite long enough they had no sleep, &amp; were covered with mud. We expected to go back a couple of days after, but the rain came &amp; made that impossible, so here we are still wallowing about in mud, never saw anything like it. We have shifted from where we were the first night, &amp; [indecipherable] lucky enough to have got a place in one of the few tents. We sleep at night packed like sardines, it is a difficult matter to turn over. Last night Fritz sent over a good few shells, the most of them turned out to be duds. They landed four or five hundred yards away, but sounded much nearer. It is a queer sensation, to ly down &amp; listen to these shells, comming over one at a time, knowing that they have come six or seven miles or more, you wonder will the next one come nearer. Casualties have been few so far. They say that we will be back in [indecipherable] the 23rd of next month, will not be sorry. They have the artillery here all right, there is a heavy bombardment on nearly all the while. Received letter from Lou, Tom &amp; Wilfred. Tom has left England. We are getting plenty of food, &amp; it is not quite so cold but muck in galore.
