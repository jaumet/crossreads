<p>8th October 1918</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I wrote a scrappy note to you yesterday, but as I&#39;m still here in Moascar waiting to go down to the Rest Camp, I think I might as well start now and tell you what I can about our latest stunt. The dates of the letters I got from you were 22nd July and 2nd, 6th &amp; 13th August. The parcels had not arrived when I left the regt but I asked the postal sergt. to deliver them to Cpl Edwards, and he will send me in any notes or anything in them to answer. Now about the stunt. For the first couple of days after it began we did nothing; just stood to an listened to reports coming through of how our troops were getting on round Nablus</p>
