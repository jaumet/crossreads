5 ThursdayOwing to a couple of arguments about work here, I threw over the job in the dressing station as I was expected to work outside as well.  Went on gas picket from 9.30 pm till 12.30 am.  Received 7 letters 2 from Doris, 3 from Olive Turner, 1 from Ellie Bennetts & 1 from Mrs Blackwood, this is the first mail I received since July 13th, so I can expect a few more letters also papers which Mrs B has sent.
6 FridayOur principal pastime here is ratting, but I am afraid the rats know too much for us, because we never succeed in catching very many.  We had about twenty minutes gas helmet drill this afternoon the shortest time was six seconds. I very seldom go down in the dressing station now, for since the argument I had I only work about outside.
7 SaturdayIt still keeps on raining, although it is a beautiful moonlight night.  Filled a cart with bricks in in afternoon.  We get the bricks from the damaged houses about (some of them are only a heap of broken bricks) but we run the risk of the Belgian Police, who if they catch us tries & makes the military pay for what we take they are red hot.
8 SundayDone gas picket from 12.30 am till 3.30 am.  Since we have the a stove set in we have Scones, Tarts, Pies etc, we have a fair cook.
