yards away had food but they could'nt get to each other.  I believe he will pull through they gave him a cigarette and he was perfectly happy.  The Germans made no fight for the trench but their Barrage fire was awfull.  The prisoners were treated well & glad to be taken. Their infantry made a counter attack but when they neared our trench they threw away their arms and dived in.  I believe their own Artillery shelled them.
Sunday 6-8-16Went out at 6.0 P.M. yesterday and worked carrying rails to the Rail head near the wood.  Fritz was as usual very liberal with shells only more so especially at the Rail head.  I was nearly run over twice & had one of my puttees almost torn to pieces by a loop of wire projecting from the rails.  Fritz followed us all the way home with shells & then kept shelling all night.  this persistent shell fire is beginning to make one jumpy.  I must make a reference to the free coffee stall near the beginning of Sausage Valley.  The guns in the latter place have nearly blown me off the rail several times when walking home by night.  A funny incident happened  on the night of the charge 4th Divon.
