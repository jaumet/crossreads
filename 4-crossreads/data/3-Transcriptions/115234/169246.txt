<p>defence the denizens of the New Cut thought my Hamlet was immense&nbsp; 30 years ago?&nbsp; I can hear them shout Bravo&nbsp; When after fighting armies I couldn&#39;t show a scar&nbsp; That time alas is gone and the light that erst while shone is the light of a fallen star&nbsp; Patrons of the circle too I had my meed of praise&nbsp; The ladies all admired me in those happy halycon days.&nbsp; My Charm of manner, easy grace</p>
