<p>This is Easter Monday, and this year the Christian festivals coincide closely with the Jewish passive, the Coptic Easter, and the Moslem holiday Shem-el-Nassim.

The whole a travesty truly upon the expectation of such wise people as Miss Rose Scott, Mr. Holman, Mrs. Holman, and their friends who a few years ago were preaching far &amp; wide</p>
