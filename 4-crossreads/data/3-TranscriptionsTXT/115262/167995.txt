Thursday 16 August 1917.
Heard that mail for Australia closes today. Posted letters.
Paraded with arm which has turned septic. Put on no duty & treatment. Had arm dressed at 5 pm at Convalescent Depot and went on leave to Cairo to get more camera supplies for taking up the line.
Wrote home this afternoon.
