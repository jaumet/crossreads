a perfect storm of cheers, & we cheered them back, very easy to see the good feeling that exists between the Navy & the "Aussies" they gave us a stirring send off which must have made the blood run quicker in the most cold blooded man, theres one thing this war has done & that is drawn the Empire closer together than ever & what a wonderful example the British Empire has set the world, not one of the far flung Dominions pulled out or showed the slightest anxiety to do so, not even when things looked black & hopeless & defeat stared us in the face, sink or swim together they decided to do & they made a pretty good swim of it, but I am wandering again.We passed on our way through the great yards & workshops some or I should say enomorous great guns all laying out in the open ready for putting in warships at any time but I don't think they will ever be wanted for battle purposes for I cant see the British Navy doing any more fighting for some time.
