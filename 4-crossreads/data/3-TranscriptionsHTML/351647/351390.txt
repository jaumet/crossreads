<p>The stunt was good but the weather was vile.  Things are very lively here &amp; the noise at times <strike>was</strike> is fierce.</p>
<p>I had to go up the front two or three times quite my worst ordeal so far.  Very trying.  How I'd be if I had to live there I don't know.  Go stark staring mad if I were on the guns, I know.  The noise &amp; racket drive me fair dilly &amp; really I can't think.</p>
<p>The liveliness goes on all the time.</p>
<p>I have been too busy &amp; the weather has been too rough to get about much.  I like to have a run away now &amp; then although there's not much to see or do.  The town &amp; villages within reach are simply packed with soldiers &amp; I hate the sight of them.</p>
<p>This is the weirdest land especially a twilight, its like a toy box come to life, the trees &amp; houses &amp;c.  Haven't got to Paris yet but hope I will next month.</p>
<p>Have been keeping my eye open for the Cooklet but haven't struck him yet.  Struck his Co. but he was on leave.</p>
<p>I met Duncan Macfarlane &amp; the Morrice lads</p>
