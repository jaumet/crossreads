he gave us 75 francs to distribute among the crowd. Stan Wright and about 5 others of us went into a house where we had a great feed of eggs and chips, which we greatly enjoyed, as we haven't had a decent feed for some days, rations being very short, we left H.Q, at about 3, and marched about 2 miles to a big paddock, where the 8th Brig. were loading up in Motor lorries. Gen Tivey and most of the heads were there watching us load up. We dashed off at about 4.30 but I'm afraid that B.Sec. did?nt make too good a shewing. After a very pleasant ride we arrived at the little village of Strazelle, where we are billeted at a farm. We are camped in a big barn on nice clean straw and were not long in getting to sleep.
Sunday 15th
Arose about 7.30m and had a sumptuous Breakfast on bread and butter. Then we got orders to "fall in" at 9.30 in full marching order. Then we went for a route march. The N.Z's relieved us at our last post. They have just returned from the Somme, where we are on our way to. The country round about is very pretty I would very much like to write to M.S, but its out of the question, worse luck. After dinner Mac I went for a stroll through a couple of villages near by. It is glorious country around here, the old thatched cottages with their pretty gardens, the wind mills blowing round in a leisurely manner and the fat cows chewing their end and looking quite content with their lot. It seems a rotten idea that we are here for the purpose of taking part in a war. The trees are looking well, and there are tons of blackberries growing along the hedges of which we had a good feed. It was too late for tea when we returned so we went into a wayside cottage and a good feed of chips, eggs, and coffee. I had a rotten cold and it tightens up on my chest at night.
