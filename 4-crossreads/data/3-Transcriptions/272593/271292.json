<p>&amp; block up an old gap in front of 22 B. so off we go &amp; get the wire rotten stuff to handle too.<br/> It did not take long to fix her up but my wanderings have not finished yet for he wants Mr Broughton the next officer on watch &amp; I to go out &amp; reconnoitre an old German Sap in front of 21, we do this &amp; get within 10 yds of the German front line where we can see the Huns quite plainly  after doing our job back we come, &amp; the tea &amp; rations are just beginning to arrive so I have to take charge of these &amp; see that they are issued fairly.<br/>5 oclock at last &amp; still snowing so I call Bellchambers &amp; turn in to snatch a few hours sleep.<br/>1st February. A lovely morning after the snowstorm &amp; the sun is shining</p>
