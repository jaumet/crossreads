Glasgow River Clyde. left at 10.40 am from the river wharf at the Jamaica Street on the steamer Lord of the Isles and went right along the river to Dunoon Lochgoilhead calling in at Greenock, Kilcreggan, Kirn, Blairmore Carrick Castle as well. We passed all the ship building yards and it was a great eyeopener. Miles and miles of stocks and slips. Saw Harland Noff's yards Boron's, Yarrow etc. some yards had fleets of torpedo boats under construction others had submarines, big and little and here and there much larger vessels. In sheds and behind screens other work was doing. Liners and cargo steamers were also building and these miles of liners of industry resounded to the rivetting and clashing of intense work. The scenery when the open country is reached is very fine, the bare rugged hills go straight up from the waters edge and the green of pasture and woodland sets off the little stone villages. It was fine going out but it rained like the devil all the way back and detracted from the pleasure of the trip. Crowds of people aboard ? many munition workers 'spending up" their high wages. Hordes of babies and shawled women carrying them. Reached Glasgow again at 8.30 pm. Cold damp.
