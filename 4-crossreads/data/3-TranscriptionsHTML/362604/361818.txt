<p>parade about once in 10 weeks &amp; one night in 10 on Duty from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. &amp; then it is only to be on the job if wanted.  Nothing has ever happened since I've been on &amp; I generally sit in the Mess by the Fire &amp; write my letters.  I am writing in this Y.M.C.A. waiting for Ellis to come down to join me.  We have a good show on every night &amp; it takes till about 8 p.m. &amp; then we have plenty of time even to walk</p>
