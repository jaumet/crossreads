  
 the men unnecessary fatigue. 
 11th March 1915. A couple of days ago we had a board, not the wooden sort, unless heads count as wood, but a real military one to sit on a missing bayonet. This consisted of Capt Simpson Capt Herring & Lieu Marks. With great solemnity a couple of hours were spent in taking evidence, numerous witnesses were examined and when on the point of arriving at a momentous decision, the missing bayonet was found in a box on which one of the members sat. Really & actually & literally the board sat on the missing bayonet. 
 Punishments are rather inconsistent, for instance Major Ellis when presiding gives punishments somewhat in accord with the offence, but the Colonel strike>or  "Claret" as we call him, has some queer idea. For one thing he refused to hear of the discharge of a man yet with the dismissal of about 20, 75% of crime in the battalion would be removed. The same few men come up time
