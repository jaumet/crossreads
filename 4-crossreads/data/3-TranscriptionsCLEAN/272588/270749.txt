Monday 5 AugustNothing doing to-day but we are warned to move off in the morning at 12.45 to entrain at I think Wizernes for Longpre near Abbeville, where we are to join up our corps. Pictures to-night were decent. It is a ten kilo march to the station & the night is wet.I hate wet night marches above anything.
Tuesday 6 AugustOn the Somme for the fourth time!!!  At 12.45 this morning we moved from Racquingham to Wizernes about ten to twelve kilos & entrained & travelled via Calais & Abbeville to Pont Remy about 11 kilos form Abbeville where we detrained.  We then marched about ten miles past our old billets at Bouchon, over the Somme, past L'Etoile to Vauchelles le Domart, where we billet for to-night. Although raining a little on the early march we did not get wet & this last march was in beautiful weather. A stunt is eminent & our division is participate even after over 100 days at a stretch on the Hazebrouck.  I would be surprised if our ambulance does any part in this stunt, but on exactly what front, I cannot say.
