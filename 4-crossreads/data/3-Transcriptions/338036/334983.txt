<p>[12th Dec. contd]<br/>for us.<br/>A party of us left in a lorry for Neuve Eglise to play for a combined Divisional Team v combined Engrs &amp; Pioneers &amp; in due course arrived at ground &amp; was having a kick around when a squadron of Gothas came over &amp; sighting us dropped bombs galore on &amp; near ground.  Only two got onto the ground (one a dud) but 1 chap was killed &amp; 7 or 8 wounded.  We were only 20 yds away from this one &amp; were very fortunate.  It made a mess of the side wall of the YMCA &amp; caught two or three men inside.</p>
<p>Then he went over to another ground &amp; also to Westhoff Farm, eventually causing about 68 casualties. but he lost two Gothas one in flames so we got a little back.  Bad news reached us during the afternoon when we heard that our Despatch rider Denver had been blown up by a bomb &amp; died instantly.<br/>[Ralph Denver, No. 12104]<br/>Thursday 13th<br/>Denver was buried at Pont D'Achilles Cemetery this morning.  In the afternoon our Team (minus three usual players) played 26th Batty AFAB but was defeated by 13 &ndash; 0 to nil, they proving to be a superior combination than ours.  I played &amp; found it to be however</p>
