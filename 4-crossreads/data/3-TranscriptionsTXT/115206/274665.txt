 April 1918 Friday 5 Mid to 8 am. On Road   ---houssoye?  Arrived at Billet at 7.30 am after all night on the road. &ndash; very rough trip too. Rained throughout the night fairly heavily. Watered horses at river. A few shells  - high bursts of shrapnel over, Albert Amiens road. Seager and Piper returned from Doullens. Boys fairly bright under circumstances.  .Awfully sorry I had to miss the company of Adianne.
