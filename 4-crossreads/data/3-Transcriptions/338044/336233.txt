<p>7th August:- Monday<br/>After a good rest. A soft bed is always appreciated &amp; usual small breakfast. 9 am work.

However there's enough work to keep going &amp; no time to look about. The casualties coming forward are enormous, especially for the 2nd Division. Yesterday afternoon we had a tram ride to Bonsecours a pretty little church situated on top of the hill near Rouen from which a great view of the town &amp; river is obtainable. The Cathedral stands out conspicuously</p>
