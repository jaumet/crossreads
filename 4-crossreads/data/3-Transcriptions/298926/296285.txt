On the other side of the wharf <br/>was a large hospital for french wounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>On the wharf and at various places round the harbour are very high iron stands on the <br/>top of which are very strong lights which throw a large circle of light.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <br/>[sketch of light tower]</p>
