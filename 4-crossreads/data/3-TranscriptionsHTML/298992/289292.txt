<p>passengers. We reached Newcastle at 9.30 a.m. on Thursday 5th inst, and after passing the Doctor proceeded to No. 7 Crane to load our Coal. This we expect to be finished about 6 a.m. tomorrow (Friday), and should thus arrive in Sydney early tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>As you will see, we are several days ahead of the time-table set down for us on our departure from Sydney, but knowing how anxious you were that we shaould be back at the earliest date possible, I think I can safely say that no efforts on either the Officers' or Engineers' parts were spared to ensure this quick return.</p>
<p>Yours obediently,</p>
<p>Purser.</p>
