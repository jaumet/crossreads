<p>VI<br/>Supper" and Etty's "Judith &amp; Holofernes" -<br/>We left Edinburgh at midday yesterday for Ecclefechan on Mrs Brook's invitation to spend a few days here before returning &ndash; We will be going down to London on Tuesday night &amp; reporting to our reserve Brigades at Warminster the following day.  Altogether this holiday has been a revelation &amp; although we could go on travelling about here for weeks, we are both feeling quite O.K. &amp; must be on the war</p>
