ToDo:

1) JS:

DONE  - Add the same fake-grid image functionality in oages.html to index.html

- Reader
DONE  * Reader separated in partials/reader.html
      Add page metadata:  
DONE  > page index/total
DONE  > diary metadata (title, author, date)
      > page chart 

      
      * CHECK page images: check empty diaries. Try downloading lacking images.
      * Add mouse-over div-border to page-square
      Functionality for the rest of buttons
DONE  > Add button to close the reader
      > same topic 
      > same topic group
      > same author
      > similar date
      > just random page

      Random subsets: 
      ----> Design and effect  (spinning rullette idea) when jumping to a page: 
          IDEA, simply move the div-border div from the page we are to the page we go, quite slowly & smoothly. Give a colid color to the backgroung div-border.

    * OPTION Context with same date-newspaper articles from Trove! (check notes on data=[rpcess.txt file
    * CSS-animate popup/hide reader in index and pages

- Clean 3-Transciption pages that have. e.g. "a6602036.html" in the top.

- Timeline view -> add it to the dropdown. Probably needs a timeline.html file

- Save visited pages w/ HTML5 storage (as in crossreads III)

- subsets/ for top pages by topic/topicGroup ...
  > May be it needs a top.html

- Create three fake-grid images sizes, for fake-responsivity

------------------
2) HTML & CSS:
  
- STYLES
  * fonts
  * CSS
  * colors


- Header: with partials: 
  * Links
  * title(diggersdiaries)
  * feedback
  * Legend/sublegend for topics -> as buttons like in vIII? Then what happens onclick?? 

- Welcome page:
