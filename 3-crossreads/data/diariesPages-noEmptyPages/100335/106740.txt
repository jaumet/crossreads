I as well as the rest was scanning the Water in the direction were the Boat was rowing, I then was told that the Man was on the Starboard Side and went over there, and saw that another Boat was lowered and going away and then I saw the Man swimming towards it, also two Life Buoy's floating near him, but he did not trouble to use them, he swam to the Boat and was pulled in when a great cheer went up from aboard, he did not seem to be distressed for after being in the Water about 30 minutes, and had got rid of his Boots and Singlet, in a few moments the Boat and all hands were hauled up aboard and a little later the other Boat started to return after a Signal from the Bridge and after and in 20 minutes was hauled on Board and we again started on our journey after a delay of about 1 hour. The man turned out to be one of the Ship's Fireman who was taking up his Post whe in one of the Boats when the Parade was sounded. As it was Tea time being 5 O clock I went down and drew the Tea for our Mess and afterwards at 7 O clock went down aft where a Dance for the Married Folks was going to take place. The Band on Board played splendid Music for the Dance and kept good time and the Young Couples soon were enjoying themselves, the Man who fell overboard came along and started Dancing and soon was a source of attraction
