<p>one of our officers got a tin of Petrol &amp; spread it all over the ambulance &amp; the Huns &amp; set fire to it &amp; burnt the lot &amp; got rid of the beastly smell of dead Huns.</p>
<p>Our first night was the worst I remember, as we had not been in the trenches very long when we all put to improve the trenches by digging a bit deeper.  shell fire was very constant &amp; in the next bay to where I was with 4 others, there were, one officer four stretcher bearers &amp; 2 signallers,<br/>a shell came &amp; got the lot (wounded) the officer got wounded through both wrists &amp; the others in different parts of the body    well all had to be bandaged up as best we could, that left 4 of us one sentry who got blown down off the firing step &amp; two others who had shell shock one chap was crawling on his Hands &amp; knees saying Oh where am I, where am I, &amp; the other one was silent &amp; like a drunken man, useless of course to me</p>
<p>there I was on my pat, with two shell shocks &amp; a sentry who did not know where he was either    I thanked God when day light came as the trenches were being flattened out as once I looked over the top to see what which direction the shells were coming from &amp; there were flashes from directly in front &amp; from the right flank &amp; when daylight came what was left of us were taken out &amp; moved to a trench which was a new one &amp; put there to reinforce some other men of another Battalion they were only 33 strong out of a company &amp; we were 14 so that made 47 in this trench &amp; we were close</p>
