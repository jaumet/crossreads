As I worked a shift on Christmas Day I was given New Years day off until next Day at 16 oclock (4 Pm).   I obtained a Pass in the morning for Poperinghe & as there were a light Engine going into Peselhoek at 11-20 am I got a lift by it.   On arrival at Arrival Farm   a few mide  about 1 mile from here, instructions were issued to the Guard on the Engine to Proceed into P.A. Siding a little further down to pick up any empty Trucks.  This Siding has a large Ammunition Dump alongside & it receives a large amount of Bombing & Shelling at times, the British West India Boys do all the unloading of shells & they don't worry the Driver not half for Coal, permission was given to two to fill their Sand bags & soon the Tender was alive with Niggers, the Driver soon had to stop them or they would have seen emptied the Tender.  On coming out of the Siding I was shown a Nessian Hut which a Bomb dropped by Fritz the night before had hit the Hut right in the centre & made a complete wreck of the Hut, killing 5 soldiers who were inside at the time.  A little further down I saw a Baru which also had been hit the night
