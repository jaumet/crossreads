  
 Monday 19 November 1917 An Australian letter at last, one of Ida's written 16/9/17.  So strange to read of all the old familiar home interests & now I am so far removed from them all. A busy day in "Maxwell".  A convoy arrived 4.30 p.m. of which we got 3 cot cases, 2 walking & as one pt. remarked, "there are plenty of men waiting up the line to come in" so our rush will continue.  6 pts. out of wards, 5 in so one empty bed. All wounds are septic operations and all but gradually heal. Usol. saline peroxide are the lotions & foments on about a doz. out of the 39 pts. (of old lot).  All such quiet little Tommies & so uncomplaining.
