"The Pilgrimage"It aint no use in swearin,It aint no use to fretIt aint no use agrousinOr getting all upsetThe wilderness is rottenAll dust & flies & tearsBut the Israelites they stood itFor years , & years ,& years
The Willie - willies choke youThe dust storms get you downThe red sun spoils your beautyAnd burns you blue & brownThe drought is simply shockingAnd the thirst our Squadron fearsWill only be abolishedBy Beers, & beers, & beers.
The war wont last for ever,This scrap will soon be done,And we'll have done our little bitA straffing of the Hun,And when we get back home againAnd greet our little dearsAll thoughts of Egypt will be drownedIn Cheers & cheers & cheers.By Bluegum
