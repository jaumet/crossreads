& the costumes gorgeus not in colour but effect -
(
Jan 26th  We stayed in bed late & went without breakfast. We went through the Louvre art Galleries (Musee) in the afternoon & in the evening we saw "Faust" at the Opera  We had the worst seat in the house I believe right behind a big pillar. but as we went there more for to see the building & effect than to follow the opera which we could'nt understand, we had an enjoyable evening
 
Jan 27th  Sunday - But the best times must come to an end & I woke up in the morning to find this my last day in Paris - we got up late & went without breakfast - we went to Bois de Boulogne in the afternoon the place of sunday crowds & came back down the Avenue de champs Elyssee & had supper at Cecilles. we finished up on champagne & I told them that I would be down in Paris again as soon as possible & I would sure come & see them - I caught 11.40 P.M. train from Gare du Nord after a splendid holiday which I was very sorry had finished so quickly, the Canadians who were on 14 days leave saw me off & they remained as they had three more days still to go.
