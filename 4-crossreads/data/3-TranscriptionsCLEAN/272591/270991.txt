Supposed to be earliest known printing (this is only a facsimile); also a lot of the ancient statuary from the Parthenon. Saw some ancient relics dating back 1600-2000 B.C. Could only go into 4 or 5 rooms in the Museum, all the rest being closed up on account of the war. They are now removing sandbags from the different rooms etc. Left there about 4 pm and went down Museum St, Great St Andrews St, Seven Dials, St Martins Lane & Whitehall to Victoria St & the Anzac Buffet for tea. When there again met Bruce Hutton so we went to War Chest to the pictures. Pictures were the same as we saw last night so we left & went to a social in Tothill St in the basement of Central Wesleyan Hall. Had a very enjoyable time & met some nice decent young ladies. Left there at 10 pm & went home per tram from Victoria & to bed 11 pm.
