any papers with us, things looked to be in a pretty mess, so I as a Sgt took command of the party which numbered 16, the first thing I done was to look for the R.T.O. but was informed that he was down at New St station so I had to slip down there as quick as I could they knew nothing about it, so I rang up the Hall, it appears that they had forgotten to tell us that a Sgt was coming from another Hos. with our papers tickets that he would take charge of the party, so back I hurried to Snow Hill St. there I found the papers Sgt, we left Birmingham at 12.35 after a wearisome journey arrived at Harefield at 5.30 here
