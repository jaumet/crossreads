<p><u>May 20th 17</u>:&nbsp; During the past few weeks there have been no events of great importance on this Front.&nbsp; Our forces have been chiefly engaged in constructing two strong lines of defence, the main line being on the West side of the Wadi Ghuzze running from Gaza South, &amp; through the Shellal positions recently evacuated by the Turks.&nbsp; Our Brigade has been engaged in reconnaissance patrols &amp; also in outpost duty along our advanced outpost.</p>
