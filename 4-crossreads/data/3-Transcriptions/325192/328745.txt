<p>We allways enjoyed the joke imensely. One day I meet a Soldier wich had deserted out of Camp. He had served in the Light Horse Camp and still wore his Uniform. On him telling me his plight, of being also anxcious in getting arrested, as the Military Police wher looking for him. A chance and good idea struck me. I offered him Civilian attire, wich offer he eagerly asceptet. Wending our way to the Hotel at wich I wher residing, we soon transferred our Clothing. The Soldier in a smart Civilian attire and me a proud Australian Light Horse Soldier? We wher in close company for about one Week. Owing me being hardly detectible by my tomage to be a foreigner being taken mostly for a Welshe Man, I wher very cheeky.I never gave a liable arrest a second thought. I never thought I stood a good chance in getting two yeahrs in Government Jail, if caught masquerading in the Kings</p>
