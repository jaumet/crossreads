Spent morning  round the place in the delightful sun and spread canvas over the billet trenches. The enemy shelled our trenches at the bask tearing a very large crater with one extra big shell. A good many were duds. At 3.30 fell all hands in for rapid loading and there was great slackness in No. 9 for which gave them extra drill and roused Craner up.

Went down to Halfway House after dark passing rumbling transport everywhere. Bombardments have wrecked the whole place round the \"clink\" and shattered the place to pieces.

The post office and Mairie still are quiet intact and mark the business centre of the village.
