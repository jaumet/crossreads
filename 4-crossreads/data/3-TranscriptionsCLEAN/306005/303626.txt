Roger objected to going out so early without company & gave a good exhibition of rooting. The day before yesterday our secret service agent (a Bedouin) went out through our lines to pay the enemy a visit & bring back information, he proved a good friend before the battle of Romani, bringing in news of just what was going to happen:  I am having a very easy time here & do just what pleases me & have no parades at all to attend.
