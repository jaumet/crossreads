<p>On the 15th, the following day, we were relieved by 20th &amp; came back to rear-reserve in a gully, from where we did front line fatigues every night.</p>
<p>The 18th:  This morning at 10 a.m a small party of the 18th Bn hopped over &amp; pinched an outpost off Fritz in broad-daylight. The following morning, the 19th, the 6th Brigade &amp; some of the 18th hopped over at 2 a.m &amp; took every objective with very few casualties. On the 21st I went up with the advance party to front-line to take over the trench stores before our crowd came in.</p>
<p>The following night the Bn came up &amp; relieved the 20th.</p>
<p>We were in for five days &amp; the 20th relieved us again &amp; we came back again to rear-reserves.</p>
<p>June 4th Fritz came over, 250 strong, on the 19th &amp; they chopped him to pieces.  Another "gutzer". Everytime he bumped our Brigade he got chopped up.</p>
