21 ThursdayWent on sick parade, & as the doctor informed me that I was too weak to walk about I was to be admitted to hospital.  There are a good few fellows evacuated to General Hospitals from here.  Nearly everyone in the Ambulance are still very crook, suffering from colds & Influenza  It rains nearly every night now.
22 FridayConsidering our position here we get looked after fairly well.  The Hospital is an old barn & we are sleeping on straw, Great hopes of an enjoyable Christmas being spent are anticipated, arrangements are now being made for an enjoyable time such.  I am taking tonics & am just picking up my appetite again.
23 SaturdayThe weather hasn't been too bad of late, we actually get a glimpse of the sun now.  I was informed today that the 21st of Dec is the longest day here, but it still remains very cold well into the month of march, so we have a long while to go yet.  There are a large amount of Xmas pcls coming in now.
24 SundayDischarged from Hospital.  Not feeling too bad now although rather week.  Plucking geese for tomorrows spread this evening.
