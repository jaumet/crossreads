 March 1918 Saturday 23 
 Messines Weather beautiful and warm. Had a swim in mine crater &ndash; small one, quite close to our home. Smithy trotted into Dranoutie with Laurence.  Went for a stroll during afternoon with Ken and visited canteen, also wireless Boe's. Very little shelling all day ie. From Fritz, our hows and 60s did some splendid work. 
 We had a little snipe at a few Fritz officers. All leave cancelled also. All schools &ndash; looks like a stunt
