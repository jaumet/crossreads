  
 Sisters and a few of our men Staff. It was lovely on the water and we had quite a jolly picnic. Had morning tea on board & returned about mid-day - Had a good rest until 5.30 p.m. then went for a swim. Then my devoted friend & his pal took another sister & me to Dinner at the French Club. It was a lovely moonlight night & in this place we all mostly live out door after sundown. We got back just a little before 10 p.m. so had a ripping day. most of us sleep out - we have a balcony all around & it is just an ideal spot for that purpose. I have been doing so for some time now. I'm as brown as a berry. The bathing is lovely & try to go every day. On Wednesday-night a party of us went after dinner &  it was great. Thursday on duty until 2 p.m., then rested until 6 p.m. went for a swim, returned about 7.00 p.m. had dinner & then went to dressmaker.
