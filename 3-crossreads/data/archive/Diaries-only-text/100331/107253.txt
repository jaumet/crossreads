I signed on at 3 oclock for an Emergency run stood by until tea time when I had to take several trucks of Ammunition up to Reigersberg Siding (Gas Shells) after making a good run placing the trucks in the Siding I received further orders to go further up past the Canal for to bring back two trucks of Duck Boards, off I went on arrival at Reigersberg Nth there were no pilot there so as it is not permissible for two trains to proceed over the Canal I had to return to Regersberg then was ordered to go back to Trou Trois Siding pick up a full load of Empties for Peselhoek. After waiting line clear for some time I was let go soon arrived at the Siding we had to pick up a lot of trucks on one road put them on another when my train was complete, this siding is used to unload the shells from the Broad Gauge into the Light Railways. After several delays I eventually arrived back at 12.40 am
