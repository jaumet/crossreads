<p>"Cyclists" today &amp; enclose Ross's letter for your perusal.<br/>My dates from France are up to 17.4.1916, and the reports are good.  They got some birthday honours, I notice:-<br/>Holmes, CMG (?KCMG)<br/>Lamrock, of 20th, a C.B.<br/>Wisdom, 18th, a C.B.<br/>Travers, 17th, a D.S.O.<br/>which will, I am sure give great encouragement.  The dear fellows will do well, I feel certain, come what may, for the Brigade is an excellent one, &amp; well led.  By mail after next we ought to hear details of the engagement of 5th May.  From the lists of casualties we have on hand, I think they must they had a brisk encounter.<br/>With kind regards,<br/>I am<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>Wm. J. Sherbon</p>
