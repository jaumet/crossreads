1/9/15 Scotian
To the tune of "Three cheers for the Red White and Blue" they sing a song with a refrain "If the odd numbers don't mark time two paces How the hell can the boys form platoon". Made arrangement for issue of 150 rounds and an iron ration to every man and had 3500 rounds belted up for our machine guns. Some of our English officer passengers again "well oiled" tonight. One hiccuped "Bai Jove, you know, 'twould be a terrible thing to be torpedoed while you're drunk don't ?cher know!"
10 pm
