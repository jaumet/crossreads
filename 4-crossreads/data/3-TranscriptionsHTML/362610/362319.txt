<p>Thursday 13 April 1916<br/>A beautifully fine day after all the rain, but cold in the easterly wind. In all directions could be seen great-coats, rain-coats, boots, &amp; clothing of all descriptions spread out to dry. Was very glad to get my saturated things dried.<br/>In the morning the 3rd Battn. moved into the tents erected on the ground I laid out yesterday, &amp; headquarters also came along. I had to get 4 marquees put up for them &amp; was all day at this &amp; similar work in the camp. Most of the men were on various fatigue duties, but a few companies had their men on parade during the afternoon.</p>
