captured 3000 prisoners during the charge.  By 7 a.m. we had also captured a gun section, 4 guns & 5 Hun officers, ambulance & personel & 70 camel loads of ammunition.  Instead of being sent after the retiring enemy, we went to Polusium at 10 p.m., drawing rations & camped for the night, thus allowing the enemy to escape after having them beaten & on the run.
5:  At daybreak we scoured the field for wounded, seeing hundreds of enemy dead & bringing in two hundred enemy wounded.  Not one of our wounded had been left out overnight.  Our casualties in Bde. yesterday were 18 killed, 357 wounded.  Picked up 3rd Bde. coming from Duedar & pushed on to Katia, going into action again at noon.  Mounted men charged with fixed bayonets over half a mile of country through gun & rifle fire, which was too strong to break through.  Enemy made things lively with 6" howitzers & at 7 p.m. we were forced to retire, as the 3rd Bde. failed to reach their objective on our right flank.  Returned to camp & gave our horses their first drink since 6 p.m. on the 3rd.  Infantry had come up & taken over from us in case of an enemy counter attack.  We brought in 2000 prisoners & 400 camels.  Our casualties were 27 killed, 180 wounded.  Camped out for the night at Romani.
