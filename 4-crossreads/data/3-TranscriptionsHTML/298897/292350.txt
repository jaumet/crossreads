This meant that I had to bring up the orderly officer to decide the point &amp; as there really was ground for complaint he referred it to the O.C. for decision later.  Rations Call had to be blown when these men were issued with bread jam cheese etc &amp; then I had a respite until tattoo at 9 oclock when a roll call is held.  The last duty of the day was to blow lights out at 9.45.  During the day we had a fair amount of rain everything being wet under foot necessitating a number of duck boards being laid.</p>
