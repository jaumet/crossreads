 Saturday 22nd Slept in till about 10 , then wrote to Lill . A few wound continu to pass through , but thing are becom normal again . Everyon rush to buy a paper this morn expect to see a big account of the scrap , but all it had was just about 3 line to say the " Anzac " had taken part in a raid . It is hard to realis yet , what a small part we are of this huge armi . We paid a visit to a shop kept by two young French women . They told us some veri interest yarn about the hun , when they were occupi this villag . Bac St.Maur one of ?em the better look of the two , said all the time the German were at their place she sat by the fire in her nightdress with a shawl over her head and made out she was sick . One day a German Officer came into the room and saw her , he said "you sick " " Oui Monsieur " said she , " no good to me then " said the Hun . There is no mock modesti about the French Peopl , and they tell us thing like this just as natur as though they were speak of the weather . I bought a pretti littl silk apron and sent home to Lill . It was a good shop and one could get almost anyth there . ? Sunday 23rd Sent P.Cds to Cis , Nell , Kath , Arthur , and David . yesterday we were paid . I drew 20f . Thing get quiet again . Mac and I went for a good long walk in the countri . It is look fine now . Buttercup and daisi grow among the long green grass , the beauti big shadi tree , and the bird sing merrili and yet onli a short distanc away are number of men still lie out there with their face to the sky , kill by other men and neither parti know the reason whi . It is a glorious thing to listen to the tale of how our fellow leap over the trench to get at the Hun "leg in the air " go top of the Wazza " they sung out , and then away for their live and into ?em .
