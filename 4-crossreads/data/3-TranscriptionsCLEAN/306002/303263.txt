26.8.15Thurs. 26th.  Very heavy firing from the warboats to the south of us last night, on our right flank there was a good deal of rifle & machine gun fire also but along our front of the firing line there was scarcely a shot fired & we could quite plainly hear a dog barking behind the Turkish lines opposite the right flank;  I should reckon we have a fighting front of from 10 to 13 miles, 3 or 4 miles to the right of us & the remainder on our left but our position on Popes & Walkers Ridge is probably the furthest inland although the left flank is practically level with us & the right is not much behind.
