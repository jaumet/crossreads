<p>May 14th  During the past nine days things have been quiet &amp; spring has been gradually putting the finishing touches of beauty on the fields &amp; trees.  The Australian 20th Batt seem to have lost some machine guns &amp; mortars through a bogus gas attack &amp; officers are accused of leaving their posts.  Our runs to the trenches have increased &amp; now we are down to 24 on &amp; 48 hours off.  Experience two of our shells premature exploding to close to be comfortable.</p>

<p>May 19th  Retire to Rest Camp at Doulieu.  It appears that the brigade does one month on duty in the trenches two battalions at a time.  For this month things have been on our sector.  (Fleurbaix &ndash; Fromelles)  very quiet having only three or four casualties per night.  While at Laundry I had good chance of seeing the temperaments of the French women.  They are extremists &amp; when things run smoothly, even though at any moment their homes may be shelled they are very happy but when they hear a shell en route for an object perhaps a mile away they become hysterical.  They are as brave as their men at Verdun &amp; work willingly at all things even to a mile or so behind the front lines. (In front of our guns)</p>
