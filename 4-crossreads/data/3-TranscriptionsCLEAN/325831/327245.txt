 O.A.S. Sunday 4.2.17 
 My dear Judge, 
 Your letter of Dec 10th to hand last Sunday. At that time I was spending three days with one of our field batteries - to learn something about gunnery & also as part of a liaison scheme whereby cooperation between aircraft & artillery will proceed on more sympathetic lines. Strangely enough, & by pure chance, I went to the battery in which is Theo Thompson, eldest son of J.A. Thompson (the Solicitor) in Sydney. I have known him for a good many years & he is one of the very few fellows from Sydney whom I have chanced upon since I came to England. During my stay there I had an afternoon in the front line trenches; it was interesting & also absolutely quiet; the same evening I was under shell fire at the battery for 11/2 hours immediately on our return.

We were pretty safe in dugouts & no one was hurt; damage to battery also practically nil, but the gas made our eyes smart & gave us nasty headaches which lasted well into the following day.
