The wharf shed was a mass of flags and flowers, & we breakfasted to the strains of a bagpipe band (surely a unique breakfast "orchestra"?), the meal being interrupted by Lord Mayors etc making speeches of welcome.
After breakfast we expected to slip quietly away to London, but got the shock of our lives.
The "Ficaria's" passengers were breakfasted before the "Primula" people landed and we then went to the exit - to be assisted on to one of a string of motor lorries draped with flags to resemble movable pedestals.   Ted's gorgeous uniform caused him to be pushed to the front seat of state, I sat modestly behind.
Ted was known evidently, & as the huge line of lorries drew away a little two very smart warrant-officers and a lieut. came over and congratulated him - and me, then.    Then the procession started - and the fun began.   A triumphal arch with "Welcome Home" in huge letters barred the dock gates - swinging into the town (we were near the head of the procession) a hoarse cheer went up
