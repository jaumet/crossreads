<p>4.8.15<br/>Wed. 4th.  Between 7,000 &amp; 8,000 Tommies were landed last night, we went on duty on the 'Phone at dinner time to-day;  early this morning a German Taube flew over us &amp; dropped a bomb amongst the Tommies;  water rather scarce.</p>
<p>5.8.15 (War Anniversary)<br/>Thur. 5th.  Another demonstration last night;  at 9 &amp; 10 oclock everything looks as though we shall make a move before long, a meeting was called this afternoon &amp; all the O.C's had to attend, we were issued with iron rations to-day.</p>
<p>6.8.15<br/>Fri. 6th.  Some trenches on our right have been changing hands lately, they were taken by the Turks yesterday &amp; retaken this morning by the 6th Light Horse, a good deal of shelling has been going on lately &amp; two mines on Quinns exploded this morning.  We suffered heavy losses on the right;  today we have been sewing white bands on our sleeves &amp; a white patch on the back of our tunics, so as the artillery will not mistake us for the enemy.</p>
