30/9/17 Dominion Camp. Esplanade Saps Ypres
A fine sunny day. Early reveille and cleared the camp by 7.45 a.m. Marched to Ypres. Baird evades by first self inflicting a wound with barbed wire in his hand and then being warned for trenches throws a fit on the road. Sent the doctor after him. We are quartered in the ramparts in dugouts and cellars ? good protection but dirty and miserable. At dawn there was a tremendous bombardment lasting over an hour. Last night Taubes were over the camp all the time dropping bombs. What with them our m.g. fire there was not much sleep for anyone. Searchlights very active and pinned one Gotha for quite a good long time. Went over to see Duggan and the General found them established in the Cavalry Barracks. A Nissen hut being finished we took it for the night. Good deal of air activity a little shrapnel. Specialists went up tonight. Arrangements for our assault are now well forward. They have the red diamond painted on the helmets.
