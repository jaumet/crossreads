We advanced from a flank as it were &amp; extended taking the heights overlooking the pass from the right rear.  Then when the column had passed through we came down &amp; followed on as a rearguard.<br/>[Sketch]<br/>The camp at night is laid out four square with gangways running east &amp; west, north by south through the tents.  Each of the four sections are responsible for the fronts of their own area &amp; in case of alarm each man hurries to his appointed place facing outwards.  Any height overlooking the camp is picqueted &amp; sentries are also posted throughout the camp.  Horses are only provided for group commanders &amp; the C.O. the remainder of us slog it on foot.</p>
