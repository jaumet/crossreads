afternoon as souvenirs    A couple burst in the next street to our fillet. Two soldiers & four civilians brought into our Hospital.
Tuesday 28th September.One good point in favour of this Sanitary job. Going our rounds we can obtain a good inspect of the town. It is really a cruel sight. Street after street is one mass of ruins & debris & quite deserted. The main square is in a pitiable condition. Fine buildings such as churches etc. are no more, they are battered out of recognition. Fritz still sending a few souvenirs into the town.
Thursday 28th SeptemberAbout 4 p.m. the Germans started shelling the town again. About [blank] civilians were brought into our dressing station by our town stretcher bearers. Hideous sights, it gives me the creeps when I think of it. One shell landed in a workshop killing 8 workmen & wounding several others. One of my old pals in A Section Alf. Polten was hit by a piece of shell but fortunately he is only very slightly wounded. Our unit has  been exceptionally lucky we have only suffered two casualties. The other one occurred on that terrible day July 22nd. this fortunately was also a slight would. Sincerely hope our good luck continues  (We all had charmed lives on July 19th & 20th)
29th SeptemberAmbulance ordered to take shelter in the cellars of a brewery. The British Artillery are going to give the Huns a severe bombardment & of course they expect Fritz to reply. In the cellars for about 2 hours. but very little bombardment owing to so much mist hanging about. Watched a German War Balloon being bombarded, it was brought to the ground in flames.
