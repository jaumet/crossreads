<p>to the theatre the guide took us through the underground &amp; Tube Railways, &amp; revolving staircase. I had not the least idea where I was. On Sunday morning I enjoyed a beautiful sleep in, no early morning parades or drill etc, "this life will do me". About 11 a.m. I visited Petticoat Lane the famous Jewish market, I believe these markets have been handed down for generations, it was a sight worth seeing. I travelled there by the underground &amp; tube railways. I am tickled to death with the latter. On the way back to the hotel I visited that very historic &amp; famous building the Tower of London. It was a very interesting morning. Shortly after dinner I visited Wembly about 5 miles out of London &amp; called on Mrs Cruickshank a sister of Mrs Underwood. She was a great sport like all her sisters, spent a very pleasant afternoon &amp; evening there. The file miles journey back to London on top of a motor bus was very enjoyable. One would not think that there was this fearful struggle going on only a few miles across the channel.  Of course at times it is brought home to us when we see the poor fellows who are crippled for like around London. On Monday the 13th inst I spent a very pleasant morning purchasing gifts,to send to Australia. Called on</p>
