<p>No. 3 Australian General Hospital<br/>Cairo<br/>23-v-16</p>
<p>Dear Judge</p>
<p>Very many thanks for your letter of 5th March just arrived.  It has been over to France &amp; then back here.</p>
<p>You will, I know, be sorry to hear that I have after all to come back to Australia.  I have been in Hospital for nearly 10 weeks now, <strike>but</strike> and though I have done my best to beat them, the Medical Board are adamant, and have ordered me to go to Australia for a couple of months trip.  l suppose it is a good thing, though very disappointing.  I feel pretty fit &amp; have got very fat &amp; practically do not limp at all.  I hate the idea of coming back with all my men in the Fire Trenches &ndash; and I know what a terribly difficult thing it is to get away again once one gets to</p>
