April, 1915Saturday 3Easy day today, but off duty with Tonsilitis.I am anxious to know if you have received any of this Diary, no acknowledgement so far & I would not post if I thought never to reach you. My French is improving & I can manage the garcons & waiters easily now. Am enclosing Charles letter from Ypres.
