<p>Saturday 16th Sept 1916<br/>On Tuesday I started work at the dispensary<br/>I have to keep a few stock mixtures supplied, make up special prescriptions for the hospital, &amp; other things such as ointments.<br/>There is not a great deal of dispensing to do, &amp; I am under the Corpl. L/C --- Cap. Binger    There are three others who attend to the dressings; among them a Lance Corpl.<br/>My  &pound;10 arrived from Australia yesterday, showing that Rita is alright, but I have had no letters yet.  She might be sick for all I</p>
