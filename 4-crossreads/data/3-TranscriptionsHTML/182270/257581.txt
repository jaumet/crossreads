<p>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot &amp; muggy. Looked like</p>
<p>a storm at any time but cleared</p>
<p>off again. Arrived in Maitland</p>
<p>early &amp; stayed at Grand Junction</p>
<p>Hotel. Caught the 12.30 pm train</p>
<p>from Maitland to Quirindi.</p>
<p>Came as far as Scone with</p>
<p>Clyde and Arthur Grigson.</p>
<p>Had tea in Quirindi and</p>
<p>Bob Bullock brought me out</p>
<p>after.</p>
