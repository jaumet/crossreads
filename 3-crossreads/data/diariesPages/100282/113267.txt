A Sgt had to be sent to Hazelbrouck this morning, to act as escort to Sgt Adams, who cleared out the morning the Battalion went to the line, I guess he will cop out unless he has some very good excuse, a man of that sort deserves it, hot strong.
5th Great commotion last night at 12.30 the bugles blew "Orderly Sgts", we knew this meant something out of the ordinary at this time of night we all guessed what it meant, a hurried trip to the line, after Orderly Sgt, the bugles sounded the "fall in", how we all swore as we got slowly out of bed shook our single blanket off mighty cold it was, we all dressed got into full marching order then the order came down that the Band only was wanted that the rest of the men could turn in again. It was funny when the quiet rest of the Camp was disturbed by the screaming blasts of the bugles great arguments followed as to whether it was dinkum or whether the buglers had gone mad but unfortunately it was only too true.
