  
 only middling. I am alright though feel damed cold but otherwise alright. It wont be any good sending that stuff along I mentioned previously as the winter is on us & by the time that parcel arrived it will be over, we were told the winter wouldn't start till January, anyway dont send the goods, I believe we are going to get gumboots capes & cardigans shortly so wont do too bad. Well dear I will close with fondest love to self R & B from your loving brother Ken
