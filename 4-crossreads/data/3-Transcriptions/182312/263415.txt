<p>they would even assume the importance that has been thrust upon them</p>
<p>during the past 18 months.&nbsp; French youngsters shout as the train goes</p>
<p>by for &quot;souvenir&quot;, &quot;Souvenir&quot;, our badges and buttons being especiall</p>
<p>sought after.&nbsp; Our lads soon ran out of these and in looking round</p>
<p>for something to give away one genius thought of the hard issue bis-</p>
<p>cuits.&nbsp; These were autographed and donated in large numbers.&nbsp; They</p>
<p>formed excellent souvenirs as you can write quite well on them with</p>
<p>an indelible pencil or fountain pen, and of course it is impossible</p>
<p>to break them except with an axe.&nbsp; I have heard it said that if you</p>
<p>soak them in water for a couple of days, you are able to break them</p>
<p>with your hands but I have never seen it done.&nbsp; If any particularly</p>
<p>pretty girl asked for a souvenir as the train went by she would get</p>
<p>a shouwer of biscuits thrown at her, and beyond a few chips out of</p>
<p>them (the biscuits, not the girls)&nbsp; I dont think I ever saw one</p>
<p>break despite the fact that they often landed up against stone walls</p>
<p>railings, etc.&nbsp; As the men have plenty of money they buy bread and</p>
<p>won&#39;t eat the biscuits and it&#39;s very funny to see the uses they make</p>
<p>of the latter.&nbsp; In muddy weather they make little paths up to their</p>
<p>tents with them, also door mats to wipe your feet on whilst many an</p>
<p>ornamental garden round about the camps is bordered by biscuits much</p>
<p>the same way as some people delight in using bottles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From here on I must necessarily be vague, otherwise I shall be</p>
<p>offending against the Censor and having been one of these myself I</p>
<p>know what to expect should I transgress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our camp is a good one, elevated and well arranged.&nbsp; We were</p>
<p>the first Australians to come to this part and we formed the 2nd.</p>
<p>Australian Divisional Base Depot.&nbsp; The second Australian Division</p>
