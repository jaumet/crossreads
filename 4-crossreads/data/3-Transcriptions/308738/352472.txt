<p>July 3 Saturday 1915<br/>About 25 soldiers left here for Australia this morning.<br/>Not feeling too bright<br/>I notice some of the 2nd L. Horse Brigade has been in action at the Dardinelles.</p>
<p>Sept. 4th<br/>Rather a strange case &amp; a pathitic one came under my notice today. A wife writes to say that 1st a cablegram was received by her from the military authorities to the effect that her husband was killed in action, after a week of mourning she received word that he was only wounded, &amp; was likely to return to the front. He has constantly written to say "no letters received  &amp; the wife says letters are being sent every mail boat. She does not know where her husband is &amp; anxiously writes for his address. Strange to say the day she writes is the day he sails for Australia as medically unfit for further service. Let us hope the days of mourning &amp; anxiety is at an end for many a day</p>
<p>July 4 Sunday 1915<br/>Quiet day feeling better Col Ainsworth of Salvation Army England spoke to us.<br/>Went into Cairo for couple of hours walked back feeling tired.<br/>Posted letters home&amp; to Major Fuller re my letters.</p>
<p>July 5 Monday 1915<br/>Another sultry hot day got a cough that hurts me.  Swelling of the glands at pit of stomach.<br/>Ladies brought around jellies cigarrettes etc.</p>
