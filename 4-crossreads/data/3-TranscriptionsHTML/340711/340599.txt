<p>The voice, the presence of the speaker, the subtle undercurrent of magnetism and sympathy that makes the great vessel of conversation brimful of expression---how a letter lacks this! One thing only seems to help one to be patient and that is that one is a passing thing while the other is permanent. And of course one has to recognise and accept that where distance separates there is no alternative.</p>
<p>Clouds similar to those of our own skies---atmosphere more hazy if anything for the type of weather. The sea varies from grey-green to deep blue, and is now, much calmer. There is no pitching of the boat and only a slight rolling.</p>
<p>Thursday, 8th:<br/>Heavy tropical rain. It has quite a peculiar effect on the water, quite unlike anything I have ever seen before. Where before there was a sharp, clear spray upon the edge of the rollers there is now only an oily looking and smooth sea, with only <strike>the</strike> a soft rolling motion on its surface that moves but does not break it.</p>
<p>Drill (Signalling) a great farce but which the Officers consider a great method of keeping the men from being homesick and getting "slack". It is of course impossible for 1,500 men to drill decently on board a 10,000 ton ship even by making shifts of it. Wrote 25 P.Cs and letters. Not feeling too good. Woke up feeling very heavy. Restless during night. Discovered this was common to most. Expect we are feeling the after effects of the inoculation.</p>
