 The attached papers are the notes (diary) written by myself whilst a prisoner of war in Germany. I was wounded &amp; captured at Reincourt near Bullecourt, France 11th April 1917. Handed over to the Dutch Military Authorities 8th May 1918. Arrived in England 14th May 1918. Disembarked at Fremantle Western Australia 23rd January 1919. 
 History of my diary For the purpose of secreting my notes I have used ordinary British note paper. Firstly, I carefully opened the flat end of the tube to insert the notes. Secondly; When softened &amp; tightly folded, the papers were easily inserted into the centre &ndash; or thereabouts &ndash; of an ordinary large tube of Colgates tooth past. 
 The paper was received by myself in a parcel from the Prisoners Department of the Australian Red Cross Society in London; the tooth paste was obtained in a similar manner. Very thin paper rapidly absorbs moisture, consequently, had I used same, the notes would have been too much mutilated for later reference. On the other hand had I used very thick paper my tubes would have increased &ndash; also this kind of paper will not fold suitably. So I have tried the ordinary note paper &amp; have achieved excellent results. Of course, I had squeezed most of the paste from the tubes before enclosing the notes; leaving sufficient however, to beguile the Huns should they have made an inspection or rigid examination.
