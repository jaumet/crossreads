what they are I don't know. One thing is that Colnl Rosy is going up a step, and taking command of a Division of Artillery now being formed here, which will make him a Brigadier-General. He thoroughly deserves it, and we are all jolly glad to see him get the command, even though we lose him from this Brigade. Major Burgess is to command us, (the 3rd Brigade) but we really don't know what happenings may take place any day with the enormous increase that is taking place. Don't know whether I will get a step out of the shuffle as I am pretty junior in my rank, but one never knows. Hope by next mail closing to know a little more of what is doing.
Had a great Sports meeting here among the Artillery last Wednesday. the boys thoroughly enjoyed themselves
