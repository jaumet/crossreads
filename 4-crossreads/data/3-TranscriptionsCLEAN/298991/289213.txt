Thursday Sept 13thVery misty. Everyone is looking forward to pay day now, boat rolls are out of the question. Went to the pictures in the Gym, not too bad.
Friday Sept 14thI don't know what I will do if I don't get my pay book back befor Monday, which is pay day, as I have only got four penny stamps now. Tal Robinsons sends me down a good few cigarettes. Still very misty, at times you could hardly see your hand in front of you. This is supposed to be a very big base, but nearly all the guns are now dismounted. I saw where some 12.5 guns were mounted, but they had been old muzzle loaders. Seven years supply is supposed to be here, in case of a blockade.
Saturday Sept 15thIt was a lovely day today, one could not wish for better. The weather is very changeable here now. It came over very misty tonight. Went for a walk to Portland, but it was very quiet down there. It was a very big strain coming back up the hill.
