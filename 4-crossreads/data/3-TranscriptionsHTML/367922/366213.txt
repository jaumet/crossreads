<p>few days you can guess we might easily have more comfortable quarters.</p>
<p>Still we are not doing too badly all things considered. Please give my warmest congratulations to Hazel and tell her I will write as soon as I can. I went a few weeks ago to see Olly but he had just gone away sick &amp; so I missed him.</p>
<p>Meantime, kindest regards to all at home and love to Aunt Carrie.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Harold W. Fry.</p>
