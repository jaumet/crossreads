Parcel from Jake arrived with socks, handkerchiefs chocolate &c which came to me in terms of her letter although it seems bad luck the consignee missed them.  One man wounded today in. Rained.  Letter from Jack from hospital at Lemnos saying he is getting on alright but has diphtheria. sure enough Turkey (or this part of it at least) seems a devil of a place for centipedes.  Watson got a nasty bite. CO complained of flies in his cap but could see nothing.  One time later a 6" specimen thrust his head out.  He had apparently been living there some time. Despatched it with a bayonet.  They find harbourages in the crevices between the sandbags and come out at night. The sound of a little thud as one drops in the darkness of the night in the dugout is quite enough to cause a frantic grab at the adjacent bayonet & much striking of matches.
Censoring letters - one man heads his Vermin Villa. RSM unwell - hope he has not been trying to do too much.  He is a willing lad and does not speak out if he finds too much is being put on him.  A cold night and quiet here.  Rumble of artillery over towards the Narrows.  Close escape from bullet, scattered dirt across me
