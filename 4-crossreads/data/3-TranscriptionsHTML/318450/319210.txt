<p>name of Toulon which is also used for a coaling base, besides as I learned after, a fashonable seaside resort.  We remained here only one day, as we had to get our order's where to proceed to.  As I said we only stayed there a little while before getting a move on, which we did the next morning very early.  We headed for our destination, but this only took about four hour's, but I must say, we got a very rough time while doing it.  I besides others were very glad when we reached port as we were just about done, and as I was mess orderly, I don't think they would have got any dinner if it had gone on much longer.  We reached Marseilles in the afternoon, and at night about half past eight we disinbarked.</p>
