<p>1/9/15   Dr Maplestone a good trencherman. Rather interesting to watch his development. We expect to make Lemnos tomorrow morning but the Master expects to lay off a couple of days.</p>
<p>10pm. Darkness everywhere on deck all saloon windows are covered with thick blankets. Still passing among islands had a good blow on saloon deck and so to bed</p>
<p>2/9/15  Up and had a bath &ndash; "very goood very nices very klean". Fresh sea &amp; wet decks, no land about, issuing ammunition &amp; iron rations The men quite amusing in their excitement &amp; earnestness. "How much do we get, where do we put it", and so on. Each man as he gets his allowance getting away into a corner by himself like a dog with a bone &amp; stowing it away in his cartridge pouchs. Lemnos in sight a long rugged barren looking island the sea in between - shining in the sun &amp; covered with white cliffs. Coming into harbour swing round large cape, score of big transports &amp; warships in sight &ndash; a beautiful place 3 hospital ships &amp; big camps beyond. Glorious blue sky &amp; sea. Embarkation officer just aboard HM Southland. 63 off. 1362 men (Bde Div [indecipherable] 21st &amp; Co 23rd  ) sunk by submarine just behind us. Much afraid Jack on board her</p>
