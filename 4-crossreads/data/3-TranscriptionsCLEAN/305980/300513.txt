 December 
 2:  Orders to be ready to move at 7 a.m. tomorrow, shall be glad to get off. 
 3:  After 18 days on board we transferred to the "Hendon", thinking that at last we were going to the Peninsular, but were disgusted when told to get off at Lemnos landing stage.  Marched to Anzac camp - 4 miles- carrying all our gear, officers gear carried in wagons.  Pitched our own tents & after learning that tea would not be provided, turned in at 7 p.m. 
 4:  Food filthy in camp, having our meals in canteen.  Lemnos is a fair sized island, occupants mostly Greeks & charge exhorbitant prices for food & fruit.  Three of us tried to get away with men for Gallipoli, but were caught on the parade & sent back to camp.
