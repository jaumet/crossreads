Its about 9 am & we are off - out to sea - There is some talk of Germans & a G-ship outside - "Give peace in our time" says Mr Bumpus with a solemn wink at me - Well - we're off out God knows where - but this ship's company is as fit as fiddles & our guns carry ? 7000 yards - Out we went & I saw the most wonderful masterpiece of seascape I have ever seen - There are no end to the reefs & islands but this particular vista was a vista that ran between two islands - palm fringed - The Fantome, the deep blue sea with its coral bottom - then green of the greenest water & white foam - then the islands & reefs & foam & beyond more white strung breakers, then the deep blue again of the Pacific & then main land with fine huge mountains right in the back ground - The day was a superb one & the play of light & color over this vast panorama added to its superb beauty -to be seen
