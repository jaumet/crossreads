We got a splendid view of the city of Perth and also of the Swan River.  It was one of the finest sights I have ever seen.  The Park covers a few miles of ground.  There are beautiful drives in the park and a thing that enchances this appearance is the Red stones which is sprinkled over the surface of the road.  There were a few beautiful monuments there also.  One was in memory of a Governor of W.A., a statue to Queen Victoria, a momument to W.A. men who had been killed in the South African War, bronze tablets on the sides of it depicted scenes that happened during the war.  We passed by the Observatory on our way back to town.  We also passed a statue to one of the early explorers name Forest.  The commemoration tablet was so obliterated that we could not learn the exact nature of the deeds done by him.  Strolling along the streets again we made for the station arriving there not a moment too soon in order to catch the 9.30 train.  </p> \r\n <p>We had to wait on the wharf till the N.C.O. in charge of our party came back.

It is one of the finest places of the kind that I have been in, it is a place of real educational value.  One outstanding thing that made it so, was the manner in which the exhibits were placed.  Instead of the birds or animals being placed in plain cases, they were place in natural surroundings.  I saw the full value of this manner of doing things when I looked at the case of birds of my own native country.  They seemed very real and lifelike.  Went into the baths and had a swim.  Took train to Queens Park, and then back again, out to Subiaco.  I had a good conception of the size of the Kings Park as it extended out as far as this place.

The Captain and other officers of the ship went out to look for them in motor cars.  We saw a few of them being brought up the gangway in a more or less helpless condition.

As the officer was about to pass him a few words passed between them and they both got into the motor car.
