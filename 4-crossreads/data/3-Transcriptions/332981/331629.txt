<p>Tuesday 25/2/19</p>
<p>Enjoyable tea, at 7 pm we were put on our train and at about 9 pm our French Chef arrived and we took our departure and made a good run without a stop as far as Darras Siding one kilo from Fontinettes where a portion of the train was taken off and we were ordered to take the balance on to Calais Maratime. Passed Calais Ville the main station, as it was midnight I called my relief and they took over and I being tired and cold and as it had been raining for a long way I was glad to turn in and had a good sleep.</p>
<p>When I awoke we were in the depot finished and all was quiet, when one is tired the jolting of the van does not wake one up in fact it lulls one off to sleep.</p>
<p>It was now Tuesday 25/2/1919. At 10 am we were told that we would be returning to our depot any moment and in the meantime, would be waiting orders, and would not go away on any more trips, which we all were sorry to hear as we have been having a bon time on these runs so interesting and seeing so much, anyhow</p>
