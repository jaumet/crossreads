 1.11.16 Wed 1st Feeling pretty bad today on account of the shaking up my pony gave me yesterday afternoon &amp; went to the Dr again this morning &amp; although he assures me I am alright I am far from well, but have decided not to go to him again unless I get worse as he may think I am malingering &amp; he seems to think I am O.K. Received an order through this evening that we are to leave here at 9 oclock tomorrow morning on out trip back into the desert &amp; we have been very busy in consequence &amp; had our last dip in the Suez this afternoon. We are still short of a good many saddles but some may come tonight.
