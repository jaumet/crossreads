<p>I had a bath in the canal this evening near Blangy Tronville about a mile from our camp. I enjoyed it. I made a small milk jug for Geo Deveroux this evening</p>
<p>Friday Augsut 2, 1918.1459<br/>After breakfast it started raining and continued. In a few hours the sand was again wet &amp; slopprey. The rain continued all day &amp; I stayed in my tent most of the time reading making souvenirs and packing one to go away.</p>
<p>Saturday Aug 3. 1918. 1460.<br/>Much finer today. Last night a limber driven by C.P.Wilson had one of the wheels<br/>smashed in a collision with a tank while crossing a bridge. 4 spokes were ripped out &amp; 4 [indecipherable] broken.<br/>For the past few days it has been known that a big push is to take place all along this front and tonight a portion of the stores were sent up to Corbie so that when the advance does take place there will be less stuff to remove from here. It was the intention tonight to make a gas attack but the wind is not favourable unless gas shell is used. 3 of the cookers are to go forward tonight.</p>
