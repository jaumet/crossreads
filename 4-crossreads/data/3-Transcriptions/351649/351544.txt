<p>previous days to bridge the network of trenches to get there, fill in little ones and so on.</p>
<p>And as the country here is bare as the Riverina plain, I waited for a very dark night &amp; <strike>rain</strike> ran a light wire all the way to guide us by in the dark, and had 40 infantry to help lower it down a bank into its gun pit.  All went off well, though the flares, which the Germans use all night long, nearly showed us up.  Both sides are very nervy now, and always firing with machine guns.</p>
<p>Yesterday 26 of our planes flew over the German lines through their anti-air guns:  it was noticeable that they were in closer formation than they usually are, and the Germans were lucky enough to bring one down:  this is the first time I've seen one shot down out of a travelling squadron;  though unfortunately there are, &amp; always must be, many casualties among patrol &amp; reconnaissance planes:  what started me writing of them is that we don't often see as many as 26 flying together on a raid, though frequently one counts more than that number up.</p>
<p>Tell John I got the last letter of his written from Narrandera:  the rain was good, and the way it fell must have helped things along.  I'll write to him again soon:  by the time this letter arrives you will be nearly finished shearing, &amp; wondering where you will go off for the summer provided the season remains good:  which let us pray fervently it will.</p>
<p>John writes a glowing account of 'Little John' whom I'm sure is growing into a great boy who will grown up and do Toganmain great credit, although I hope and trust he will be human enough to stray occasionally from the straight &amp; narrow track &ndash; just enough to make him worth liking:  &amp; I'm sure he will from knowing his parents (meaning of course he'll be properly brought up.</p>
<p>Goodbye, best wishes &amp; luck<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>Jock C. Ellis</p>
