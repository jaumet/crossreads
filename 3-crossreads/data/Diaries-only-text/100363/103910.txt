of admiration for those old peoples whose monuments alone are the testimony of their greatness, and who themselves have become as the desert sands. Yet here the pyramids stand, untouched by time, and as indestructible as the very sands which surround them. And there is the Sphinx. Gazing in solemn silence into the future, into the rising sun, and behind it the thronging ages which days are countless as the desert sands. And what I thought as I gazed into that pensive staring face, are all those crowding years, compared with eternity? Why was ever man created to live but for a moment? Surely such objects as these can alone convey some slight impression to the senses of Time and Space. Kingdoms rise and fall, Nations become but names, but still the Sphinx gazes on , heedless, inscrutable, and unwrinkled.
