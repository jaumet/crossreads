Being large calibre high velocity shells they burst with a tremendous crash without the slightest warning screech whatever, practically no hole being made in the ground, shewing that they burst on the slightest contact.   C Section went away today & I guess are congratulating themselves on the fact.    Practically all the back areas are being shelled, Bailleul getting a bad time & from all sides reports are coming in of a like nature & then to cap all we read in todays paper, an article by a correspondent Percival, in which he says - fruitless shelling of back areas, our men tickled & amused at the Huns wild shelling & so on.   A greater insult to the Soldiers could not be imagined as this kind of shelling is one of the most trying & causes numerous casualties besides disorganising things, quite a number of units having shifted their quarters.   In one camp about half a mile away over 50 horses have been hit & yet this waster says that we are amused.
