<p>10 July, 1916<br/>Rail Head  Romani<br/>Slept on the Kitbags last night, comfortable enough except for an inquisitive flea, who awoke a blood thirsty feeling within me, nor was I satisfied until I heard his soul depart the body with a crack.  The miserable waiting here,  We cant get the camels until 4.0, to make it worse a chap has to hum [cadge] all his tucker &amp; I make a poor hum though when it becomes necessary I do it unblushingly &ndash; I saw Tom Sherry, he came over to see old Bill off who has gone into the camel corp [indecipherable];  I am sorry I was not able to have a word with the old chap before he left.  The Reg. have been out on another stunt &amp; shot one Turk &amp; captured two Bedouins.  The boys are very much disgusted as usual at the way they are taken out there, get a sight of the enemy &amp; then hang off until he has time to imshie<br/>[imshee = go away]</p>
