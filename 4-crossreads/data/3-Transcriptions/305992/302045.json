<p>Went up to old Taranto the streets being only the majority about 20 feet wide. Old fashonable houses &amp; flats. The Italian inhabitants swarmed like bees in the narrow streets. In the poorer working class part of the town the filth &amp; poverty was awful. The sanitary system exceedingly bad consequently filth &amp; smell everywhere. They have cases of small pox, plague &amp; no wonder, by far more dirty &amp; filth about than Alexandria. Personally a disgrace to the Italian government. The slums of Melbourne &amp; Sydney would do credit compared with the main streets of Taranto.<br/>No doubt the working classes are suffering badly on account of the present war. Pracically no money in the town &amp; the Italians being of a filthy race by nature. The town is under martial law, armed guard of Italian soldiers &amp; sailors parading the streets. They are to their credit neatly &amp; clean dressed.</p>
