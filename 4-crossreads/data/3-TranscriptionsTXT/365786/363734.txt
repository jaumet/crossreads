 What is the use of 100,000 more men?  100,000 men in reserve is an incalculable asset to any general.  Thrown in at a crucial point, 1/10th that number can turn defeat into victory.  The battle of the Marne was won by the extra weight of 8000 men, rushed out from Paris in taxi cabs!  Further have the Anzacs in the trenches been of no value to the Allies? Men so far &ndash; Of total 270,000 men in A.I.F., 100,000 are in the trenches, 100,000 are in reserve &amp; 70,000 are casualties.  The 100,000 in reserve are reinforcing the men in the trenches &amp; at the present rate will last till the beginning of next February.  Thus the September 1916 volunteers will be the reinforcements going to the front in March 1917.
