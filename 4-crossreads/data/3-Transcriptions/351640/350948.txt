<p>My dear Girls/:</p>
<p>After dreaming about the boys from New Guinea, the idea most upper in my mind relates to the part which alcohol played in the giving to the members the reputation which they gained.   Sorry.   Very sorry.  Both the boys with me last night seem to have been all right and to have survived the ordeal, but they were very loath to speak about the expedition.

<p>11.8.15.   9.30 p.m.   Last night; or rather this morning when I was walking across the grounds to my sleeping room, I was, as is my custom, examining the sky.   Away up in the Eastern heaven was to be seen in full brilliance the Pleiadies, not far away A in the head of the Taurus, and the belt of Orion with the dagger in its accustomed relationship.  These all reminded me of home sweet home, and of the heaps of times that my eyes have rested upon them when my feet rested upon the pavement of Macquarie Street.   Away in the</p>
