<p>24 Monday<br/>A very hot day.  Sea rather calm.  Sports held on promenade deck in afternoon &amp; Boxing at night.  Wrote P.Cs to Olive Turner, Mrs Blackwood &amp; Florrie Whitehead.  The next thing to look forward to is Egypt &amp; going through the Red Sea.  A good few games introduced in the sports, handsome prizes are given to the winners, such as an apple or a chocolate, etc.</p>
<p>25 Tuesday<br/>Sea very calm.  Rather a <strike> very</strike> hot day with westerly wind blowing.  Passed Minnaco [Minicoy] Island about 9.30 am.  Boxing arranged for but no pugilists turned up &amp; was therefore cancelled concert held on promenade deck in evening.  The O.C. seemed very annoyed at the non-attendance of the "pugs"</p>
<p>26 Wednesday<br/>Got Films from Dispensary.  Wrote letters to George Owens, George Handley &amp; Jim Griffiths.  Sports held on promenade deck in the afternoon.  A very nice day.  Sea very calm.  The ship seems very slow &amp; can only do on an average about 9 knots an hour.  Every day there is a guard put on to guard the gang ways etc, also fatigues.  I have been fortunate as I seem to miss all these.  Each state takes it in turn.</p>
