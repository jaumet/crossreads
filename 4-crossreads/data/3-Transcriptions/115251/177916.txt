<p>2<br />I myself, K.B. Mueller, am the representative of two firms here, F. M. Rondahl a Swede, and F.O. Morton, a British subject. I am married, and since your fleet entered this harbour I was living with my wife in the Katholic Mission at Herbertsh&ouml;he to which the bishop Monsigneur Coupp&eacute; (a Frenchman) is a witness.</p>
<p>The other prisoner, W. Schmidt, is an employee of the firm of F.M. Rondahl (Swede), is also married, and has his severly sick wife in the hospital at Herbertsh&ouml;he. Witness to this is the [medicant?].&nbsp; Since some days before your fleet came, he lived in the hospital at Herbertsh&ouml;he</p>
