Thursday 2 August 1917
Slight Tonsilitis & Bronchitis & with Septic leg I may go Field Hospital for a few days - nothing serious only usual small worries. Brigadier inspected Horses & told me "he was a bit of a crock himself" so the opinion was I was put on the Train at 4 o'clock & sent to No. 14 Australian General Hospital Cairo . There is nothing much wrong only fed up with Boils & Bronchitis etc. so will stay in bed for a week or so.
Jim Ayre is in the same Hospital & will soon be O.K. I won't be here more than a few days & then will be sent to ALEXANDRIA.
