<p>After a   <strike>quilt</strike> quiet night with only intermittent firing we take   <strike>a</strike> stock of the position<br/>Our trenches are on the ridge *   &amp;  the Turks are on a ridge opposite about 200 yds away   &amp;  the valley in between is covered with dead bodies of Australians and Turks. At other parts the distance between the Turks   &amp;  us is only from 15 to 30 yds   &amp;  at night both parties throw hand bombs into each others defences<br/>* Pope's Hill</p>

<p>At daylight the 13th are called out to support the 15ths positions * (who lost heavily in a futile charge during the night) but were not required. While we were near their trenches the wounded kept coming down in all stages of mutilation, Heads shot off, faces smashed   &amp;  bullet holes in almost every possible place. the sight was shocking.<br/>* Quinn's Post.</p>
