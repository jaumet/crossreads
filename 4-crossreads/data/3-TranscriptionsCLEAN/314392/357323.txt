  
 11th About 8 am Fritz greeted us with a repetition of Nov 23rd. Gee! He did sock it in. Still I stayed in bed for it was too cold & muddy outside Ha Ha. No casualties however. About 11 am it started snowing. 12th Cold and raining. Fritz was fairly lively to day, sending over high explosive. 1Convey was hit & several men were wounded. 13th Snowing. Things were very quiet all day, tho, our artillery was active during the night. 14th Snowing  & miserable. Conveys reached their destination & returned home OK. Fritz sends over a few shells during the night. Too close to be pleasant
