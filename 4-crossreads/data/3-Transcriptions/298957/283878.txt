<p>Mamelukes, old windmills built by Napoleon may be seen. At the entrance to the big Mosque or church known as "The Tombs of the Mamelukes" natives insist on visitors having canvas slippers fixed over their boots, so it was amusing to us when we had to submit to this old custom. Inside, the ornamentation is simply gorgeous. It is hard to credit such artistic work. The tombs of old Pharoahs, rulers, and great men are wonderful. Gold or silver inscriptions on or around the tombs, the fine tiled floors, coloured windows, domes and beautiful lighting arrangements</p>
