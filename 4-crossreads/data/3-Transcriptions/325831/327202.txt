<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I suppose Uncle Dowell will have told you of my second visit to "The Somme" &amp; all that happened to me there. Although, wounds &ndash; if not too serious, are always looked upon as a subject for congratulation, I was really very disappointed to be put out of action so soon.</p>
<p>Still, although I had a rough time with tetanus at Rouen, I was really wonderfully fortunate to be away from the dreadful cold &amp; mud; which has certainly caused us more casualties in the form of trench feet &amp; sickness, than the Enemy's Artillery, Machine Guns, etc.</p>
<p>I believe Australia's Divisions are now away from the line, but expecting to take over a quieter part than the Somme. Certainly every unit is in need of rest &amp; re-organisation, while re-inforcements are unfortunately none too plentiful.</p>
