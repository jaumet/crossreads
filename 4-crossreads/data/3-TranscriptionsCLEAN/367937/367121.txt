  
 I have just had ginger nut chocolates & cigarettes galore and feel grand but there is one poor chap close here been hanging over the edge all day. 
 Had to stop & fill my pen. There is a good canteen on board but it gets away with a lot of your money especially on a calm day. It is a funny arrangement about the price of things; while we are on the Australian coast we have to pay ordinary prices for things but once we leave the last port, tobacco will only be half price as there we wont have to pay duty on it. Thus an ordinary 2 oz tin of Capstan costing 1/- at home will only cost 6 p. when we leave.
