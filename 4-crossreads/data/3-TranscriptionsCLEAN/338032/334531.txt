bed clothes, pats me on the head & presently I drift away into dreamland.Two days after a clean uniform & overcoat.   I & my comrades are saying Goodbye to the nurses and old stagers at the hospital.   There is a world of wistfulness in the tone of an old Londoner as he says "Going to Bly-tee?  Lor lumme I aint seen it for two years."    We are unaccusingly styled lucky dogs to be bound for "Blighty."The world seems bright again as we motor over the Cobblestones of the old collegiate town to the station.
