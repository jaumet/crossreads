Apl 28 pretty good, but theres a shortage of water. Plenty of cigs & there are flowers & ferns placed here & there.
29  Another 2 Batt chap here now: - Carr). Believe Australians don't go to London.  Rotten luck for me. Must apply for leave from H Qs. Made my own bed today as all fit patients do. Also did some dusting & incidentally a skirmish with the Matron. Met another Aust cobber from the 2nd FA. He says we travel overland to Marseille & embark there for Australia. Wrote to Andy Fisher re leave of absence to England. C of E Parson came round & I told him I was a freethinking Australian. Lovely weather the last few days & its great, lying on the green grass out in the glorious sunshine. Can see part of the Harbor & the piers from the back of the Hospital & now & again a train rattles past on our left.
