 We were informed today unofficially that that the C.O. had been relieved of his command. Later we heard that Major Robinson who had been away temporary in charge of the 40. Batl. refused to take command. The Batl. is determined to stick to Colonel Storey. All the officers are in accord with the men but cannot say or do anything in the matter but believe that the men will succeed. [shorthand symbols] The lines have been repaired and the trains are running every day &amp; night now both on the light &amp; heavy lines bringing up war material.

 Early this morning there was a terrific bombardment on our left. The Battalion delegates went over to the 38 Camp this afternoon to interview Mr Hughes who is to visit there today. There are rumours of many brilliant French &amp; American victories in the South. This afternoon is a half holiday. I packed up a parcel to my wife containing 1 German haversack and a paper protector for enemy shell nose caps. We had an issue of American &amp; Australian tobaccoes from the Comforts funds today. Our delegates after chasing all over the country failed to find Mr Hughes.
