This afternoon Captain Hewish handed me my furlough pass for England! 10 days of the best and brightest from tomorrow! Went and saw the Medical officer and was pronounced free of vermin, scabies, and other contagious diseases. Received a certificate to this effect. Went to Div.H.Q. and got some clean clothes. Will start tomorrow. Tonight we will celebrate. A Glorious Day!
