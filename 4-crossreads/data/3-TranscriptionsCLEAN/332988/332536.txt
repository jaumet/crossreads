  
 trained gunners out in that deep shell hole in front "somewhere" on the big white expanse of plain that comprised No-man's Land know this "possy" well. 
 The flash of their guns could be seen first. The sentries ducked their heads and a second or two later they heard the bullets Phitt! Phitting by. Fritz knew their "possy" all right and kept it warm, but our Machine-gun crew from the post on the right advanced into No man's Land and from a shell hole fired a burst at the flash of this gun. 
 Then they retired. By that means they tricked him, and at the same time kept their own true position secret; for Fritz then wasted his ammunition on the spot where he had seen the flash of their gun. The sentries were left in peace for some time. One. of them suggested a bombing raid on the bold and troublesome Fritz gunners, but the idea of death or  V.C. preceeded by a very long cold crawl in No man's Land over the snow did not meet with a very enthusiastic response, and so the aythor of the brain-storm subsided. 
 At day light the five men on the desolate outpost No 5, crept into their snow covered shelter and lay "doggo". This ground was watched by day form the many silent machine gun positions iin rear who, in case of attack would open up and so warn the camouflaged piquets in front.
