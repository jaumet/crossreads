Dear Mr GarlingI arrived home invalided with the last batch of wounded & I think perhaps you might like to hear from me.  I had the great pleasure & I say without any exaggeration - honour, to belong to your son's Battery.  We were great pals having belonged to the first Australian Division.  I loved Terence more than I could have loved a brother & like everybody else who came in contact with him admired his splendid manliness.The Major 'Terence' was about three yards in front of me when a 4.2 high explosive shell burst just near & a fragment struck him about halfway between the knee & hip in front of his left leg.  It made a hole about the size of penny.  I assisted to bandage him up & had just finished & was talking to him when a shell landed close by & I was wounded in the stomach.  We were both taken to the Casualty C.S. together at Heningcourt where our wounds were dressed.  I became unconscious & on coming round found myself in a schoolroom at Warloy - about 3 miles from Heningcourt.  Terence was lying on a stretcher just near me.  I noticed that they had just operated on him.  He did not seem to suffer any pain from his wound.
