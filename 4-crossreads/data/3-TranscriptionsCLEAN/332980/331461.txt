Walls left standing, the Fine roof of the Station is smashed likewise the Walls knocked about, Railway lines about the yard lay twisted & broken everwhere in fact the whole place is practically one ruin, As soon as we had put more Vans off we left with another Pilot to go on to Three Kings a siding about a Mile further along on the Main line towards Menin passing the new single line to Roulers, also Shrapnel Corner, which is laid bare, not a Tree left standing neither a house & shell holes everywhere, The Traffic along the main Road at Shrapnel corner being fairly heavy, mostly Motor Wagons, As soon as we had placed the remainder of our Train in the Siding, the Motor Supply Wagons came alongside & in a minute all hands were busy unloading their supplies for the Advanced Areas, As Fritz is retreating so fast it is very difficult for the Supply Wagons to keep in touch with our Boys Advancing, with the result a lot of Rations have to be carried by Aeroplane packed in bags of Sand & dropped from a low Altitude, the line to Roulers
