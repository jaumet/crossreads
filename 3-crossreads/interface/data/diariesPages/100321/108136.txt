15/1/19 Gourdinne
said he would call for me tomorrow morning at 9.15 for our motor tour to Namur Brussells. Returned for lunch and spent the afternoon on routine work. On telling M'slle of my trip she said ?What about the hare?!" so I arranged to dine with them tonight. She was making pancakes (called gallots) one at a time in a sort of press which she held over the fire. These people live well as regards food but bodily cleanliness is not their strong point and baths are rare. Had a splendid dinner at 7.30 and plenty to eat and drink till 10.30 with Fernand, Raoul, Marthe, M'slle Gorman. Becaisse and lievre were the pieces de resistance. With beer Burgoyne we made revel. These Belgians eat tremendously and cook well.
