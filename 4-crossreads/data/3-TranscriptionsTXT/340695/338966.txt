 2-1/17.Spent new years day in Amiens with Acko &amp; had a splendid time. Partook of an excellent dinner our companions at table were a French Adjutant &amp; his wife. The former spoke a little English &amp; with my little French had quite an interesting conversation. Roamed round the old city sight-seeing myself having been there before acted as guide. Only once did the place turn right around but were soon righted by a friendly kiddy. The beautiful strains of an organ enticed us into a fairly large church but the service finished soon after we entered. We were both sorry the organ was lovely I was all out in goose flesh.
