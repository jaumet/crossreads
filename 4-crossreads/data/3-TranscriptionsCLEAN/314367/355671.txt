can be said or done - For absolute freedom of discourse & comment give me a naval mess - We wind up at 11 pm - Lights out & bed - Fitz let all the Ship's company over the side yesty - This is very good for the men - I have just sent to Sydney for 6 lbs of Quinine. Fitz thinks we ought to have a good bit & so do I especially if we go up Rivers - I was a the Hospital yesty & saw Strangman & Fitzherbert again & talked Malaria - I've never had any dealings with Malaria - I got some good hints - of course here I cant do any blood work - mine's simply clinical observation & treatment -The S.S. Sumatra has had queer treatment - The naval brigade officers had it her as barracks - They've been put out in the stream & some 120 malarial patients shoved inboard with them - Lambton is furious & I'm with him. Fancy sleeping close to 120 malarial cases & a ship full of mosquitoes who bite & transmit - Fitzherbert has already had an attack of malaria -
