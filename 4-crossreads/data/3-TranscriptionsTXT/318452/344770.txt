 Sunday 14th Church parade today, under difficult conditions wind &amp; wet. I held a service this evening in one of the huts Subject "Calvary" As a German plane with bombs came over we had to put lights out quickly &amp; the service finished minus the benediction. 
 Monday 15 \Spent the day writing. The camp dried up a little the weather being fine. A Bright night is the sure sign of Bomb dropping activity &amp; about 6 oclock a fleet of planes put in an appearance Search lights from all quarters made a fine sight. The Bosche dropped a bright light which hung in the Sky.
