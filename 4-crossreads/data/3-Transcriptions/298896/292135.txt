<p>Truly 'tis a great effort &amp; we are anxiously awaiting news.</p>
<p>Friday 9th Aug.<br/>Practically nothing doing at this Station bar an overflow from the new M.D.S. which is established near Villers Bretonneaux. The first paper containing any news gave that the first count was 7000 prisoners 100 guns and an advance of 7 miles. New troops are going forward and everyone most cheerful. Troops engaged are the 4th Army (Rawlinson) comprising English, Australian &amp; Canadian, and a French army, all under Haig's direction. The papers state that the Communique issued on the Western Front will in future comprise all the Allies combined. News also published that we are going to have a Gallipoli medal issued, all those who landed on the Peninsular being eligible, thus ends a great controversy.</p>
<p>Saturday 10th August<br/>No wounded coming through as this station has been cut out so that we expect to move forward. Latest reports give 17000 prisoners 300 guns and an advance</p>
