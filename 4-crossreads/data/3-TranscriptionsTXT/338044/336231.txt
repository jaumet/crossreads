 Taking a walk all around the main streets until 10 pm &amp; a cup of tea at the hotel &amp; bed. 
 6th August:- Sunday Awake at 8 am, still tired &amp; this is a change into some luxury. A wash    &amp; hurried breakfast, &agrave; la Francais, of rolls &amp; butter &amp; coffee. It is even difficult to obtain an egg. The French are satisfied with this snack    &amp; never breakfast. Am afraid this won't suit us too well  However we'll just carry on . Arrive &agrave; notre bureau &agrave; 9.10 am. Tr&egrave;s tard mais je m'en fiche. Plenty of work as I soon find out &amp; as I get straight to it on casualties of the 2nd Division. It's just go at it &amp; not time to look round. At any rate, there's not the slightest doubt in the world that one has to earn his crust here. At 12-30 pm work is finished for the day &amp; with Legge we waste no time but set about looking for some lodgings. Have lunch at the Salvation Army
