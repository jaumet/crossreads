 The day was taken up with general preparations for embarkation.  Active service kits were packed;  and then the remainder of our personal belongings we placed in our black bags, fastened them up securely, and piled them up in heaps ready to be stored at the Base.  An infantry soldier takes to the front only what he carries on his back;  so you may be sure that nobody is very keen to carry an superfluous articles of clothing around with him. 
 A muster parade was held to-day and amongst the absentees a good sprinkling of be-ribboned, more-bother-than-they-are-worth, old soldiers (or veterans as they like to call themselves) were conspicuous by their absence.  The Colonel reminded us of the order "No leave to be granted" and how necessary it was for every man to be on the spot, ready to quit camp.  Also, his little talk on the severe penalty for "Desertion while on Active Service" went well home and made a decided impression.
