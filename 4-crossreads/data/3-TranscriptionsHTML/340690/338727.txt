<p>having everything mobile and slept out in open on grass and slept very well although very heavy dew.  Fine.</p>
<p>9.8.18<br/>Called at 6.30 and had breakfast and got mobile straight away and then waited about &amp; wrote diary and had a look at part of the village.  Fine.  Moved about 9.30 and up through Vaire wood and on to tracks towards Bayonvillers.  However went past and camped near railway line on left front of Guillaucourt.  Moved up very slow with numerous rests &amp; in artillery formation apparently acting reserve to the attack.  Big dump of wood, wire, etc. just behind us near railway line and a good few dumps of shells along line.  Also one 8" howitzer in distance.  Camped alongside 10th Batt. cookers.  Very quiet coming up except for 3 H.V. L.R. guns firing near balloons.  One balloon was continually moving but in end something happened &amp; 2 men came down in parachute drifting quickly towards Fritz and soon after balloon came down in flames.  No tea or anything and dug in for night in open air bank and soon slept although some doubts of moving several times.  All night aeroplanes were over dropping a good few bombs.</p>
