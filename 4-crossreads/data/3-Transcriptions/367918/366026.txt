<p>My dear Judge,<br/>We have just received the official intimation that [indecipherable] ship is expected to arrive in Melbourne on 4th August I suppose if the boat is up to time he will be here on 6th or 7th August. They may of course be sent over by train</p>
<p>Unfortunately we are in a difficulty as my son Arthur is down at my house with pneumonia influenza &amp; is very bad. Mrs. Lucas is also down with influenza of the milder type but is also having a severe attack. I am alright so far &amp; hope I shall be able to meet him. Dr. Lamrock is attending to them both.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>E. Lucas</p>
