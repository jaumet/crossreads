<p>Thursday 28 August 1919<br/>Nice &amp; bright today. Old Botha is dead. Crossed over to the bluff in a ferry &amp; walked a few miles along the beach to a big whaling Coy's cutting up &amp; melting down station. No whales in. Had a look at the place. Nothing in a whale is lost at all. Oil, bones or flesh. Flesh &amp; bones made into manure. Went back to the boat over the hill. Took the sweat out of us too. After lunch went into town &amp; down to the beach. Had one or two ices. Did some shopping &amp; then came back to the boat. It had moved over to the coaling station. Have to go &amp; come by ferry now. Expect to go to Pietermaritzburg tomorrow. Have two parties.</p>
<p>Friday 29 August 1919<br/>No Maritzburg for me today 'cos the Court of Enquiry is on. We didn't finish this morning but have one more witness to examine. After the court Osborne &amp; I were put on guard so that we could go to Martizburg tomorrow. Finished my letter to Nettie. Went on Guard at 5 pm &amp; came off at 1 am. [indecipherable] starting [indecipherable] during this guard. Rained fairly steadily during the night. Had a big thunder storm at 1 am.</p>
