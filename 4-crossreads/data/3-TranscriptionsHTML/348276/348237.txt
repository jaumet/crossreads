<p>War Diary<br/>1915  20th Oct.<br/>full of M. Guns, and that the description of bombardment (so many shells) was worse than nothing (especially at night) as it was merely "ringing the bell" and telling the enemy we were coming.  All these opinions were waived aside, but they were facts, and it now transpires that we could have poured in wave after wave with the same results.  Unless prepared to pulverise irrespective of expenditure of shell, a promiscuous general shelling of impregnable trenches is worse than NIL and it is better to trust to an unprepared surprise attack in broad daylight;  At dawn the enemy always "Stands to Arms" and he knows our ways and habits, which even yet are too orthodox and per F.S.Rs. [Field Service Regulations]  --<br/>All our successes have hitherto been from the unpreparedness of enemy, who was surprised completely at Suvla Bay but not followed up  -  These troops dug in for half a day with nothing in front of them &ndash; hence the whole show was botched.</p>
<p>I am progressing well with cubicles of trenches for men to sleep in and rest when actually not on watch.  We lose by having so many men and so few M.Gs. in trenches.  Turk Ts are full of M.Gs. with most of men resting conveniently.</p>
