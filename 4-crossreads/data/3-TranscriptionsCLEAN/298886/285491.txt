  
 miles out from Sohag. 
 This diary keeping is hard work I look at the top of the tent for inspiration but nothing comes of it. 6 bags of parcels today 
 23rd April  Sunday(Easter) 
 We are breaking all records as regards mail - another 8 bags tonight Thousands of letters. I have to distribute them all No one has the handling of a single letter apart from myself we did that one time on the Peninsular which led to utter confusion  So they all sit round meek &  mild and if the boys start an argument during the time I am calling out the names God help them! I have all spare letters to readdress when all the sorting is over and that takes some time, some rapid writing and some thinking out. But there is no hesitation I must go right on otherwise I would be here all night. The weather was frightfully hot today. And at times scarcely a breath of wind The very clothes seemed literally to burn one's skin - A Battery of Royal Horse Artillery arrived today and are Camped close to us here. 
 24th April Monday (Easter Monday) 
 Very hot! Most of the horses have been innoculated for the second
