<p>Apl 20  know there was a war on, everything is so quiet; although there are about a thousand guns within a few miles radius. Good tucker today &amp; self cooked. Steak, fried &amp; maconochies in a stew for tea. Very little wood supplied, so one has to forage along the trenches, &amp; get dry or wet stuff.</p>
<p>21  German anti-air guns wasted about 150 to 200 shells on one of our planes &amp; now they're after another Looks A1, the shells bursting all round the machine &amp; yet missing it. Rain &amp; still more rain &amp; cold, it would fairly freeze a fellow to death. Believe Fritz has sustained big reverses in Russia &amp; at Verdun Little or nothing doing here, in fact it's a home from home, only for the mud &amp; cold rain. A couple of loop holes put in tonight for sniping &amp; observing during the day. [in margin] <u>Easter Friday</u></p>
<p>22  Rotten night last night, only just woke up &ndash; 12.30 pm. Recd 2 letters from Eng &amp; Aust. Things are dead quiet &ndash;</p>
