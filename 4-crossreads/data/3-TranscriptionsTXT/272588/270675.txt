Friday 15 MarchA wounded case this morning.  Fritz attempted a raid on our left this morning & we heard his barrage.  No idea as to results. Glorious day. Fritz shelled our vicinity heavily for the greater part of the day but fruitlessly. Glorious day & Ypres stands out very distinctly. The German bombardment last night signified also a raid by Tommies on our left at 9.30 p.m. but no idea as to results.
Saturday 16 MarchA beautiful Spring day. Fritz shelled about our dugout this morning & to-night he is continuing it with heavy stuff & fifty yards away are the [indecipherable] distance.  No carries.
