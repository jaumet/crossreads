<p>Troopship "Kyarra"<br/>Alexandria<br/>17th Jan ?. 1915</p>
<p>Dear old Mrs,<br/>I have written a long letter to you to London, I addressed it London as I thought you might not get it at any of the intermediate ports.   I am sending this to Capetown, Tenerife, Plymouth &amp; London.   It is just to tell you that we are landing here, that we will be quartered at Mena House near Cairo &amp; that we will probably be here for about two months.   The No 2 Gen. Hosp. is to be at Mena House, a large hotel quite close to the Pyramids.   The other hospital units are to be quartered at different places near Cairo.   I have been feeling tip top but am at times very homesick.   Fred also is A1.   I hope you have had a good &amp; pleasant trip &amp; that you are all A1.   I received your letters dated 9 &amp; 15.12.14 the latter with the cutting about the vomited lettuce slug &amp; the message from Mrs. Langer owen.<br/>Best love from<br/>Yr loving old man<br/>Will</p>
