<p>Thursday 1 April 1915</p>
<p>The battalion left camp early to-day on bivouac.  And a pleasant surprise was in store for us.  Instead of making for that dusty, uninteresting district around the old Suez Road, we turned down through Heliopolis, and passing by the rear of the New Zealanders' camp at Zeitoun, made tracks for that fertile country near the Nile.  We soon came to a place called Marg, [also spelt El Marg] and were in the midst of a big date palm plantation, owned, we were told, by Sir Thomas Lipton.  Everybody seemed light-hearted and cheerful, and we all enjoyed the luxury of having a shady grove through which to march.  A "tram" with accomodation for four passengers and drawn by a donkey, called forth a roar of laughter from the Colonel downwards.</p>
<p>Reaching our destination, we had an enjoyable luncheon in the shade of the palm trees.  And how nice and soft the Lucerne felt beneath us!  Then we rested until tea-time.  And after the evening meal the band joined us, and we had a concert and sing-song.  Retiring to our luxurious beds at ten, we slept till day-break when, after a meal of excellent curry and rice (on Good Friday Friday) we returned to camp well satisfied with our 24 hours' worth.</p>
