<p>straight into the line near Albert.</p>
<p>The 3rd will be running the A.D.S. &ndash; which is the most forward Ambulance position (the bearers are always in the forward area, whichever post their unit is running, unless things are quiet) and it appears there is likely to be a stunt on. I hope that the bombing experience the 3rd underwent on their last hurried trip to the Somme, will not be repeated. The hurried recall either for that matter.</p>
<p>Lovely evening &ndash; clear &amp; warm</p>
