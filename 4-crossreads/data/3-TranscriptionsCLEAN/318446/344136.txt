This diary centres on his time in the Sinai Peninsula in the areas of El Arish, Beersheba, the Rafa Raid and Palestine.  He describes these locations in detail and the surrounding countryside.  The noise of the battle, the planes flying over, the bombs dropping, their living conditions, all feature in his descriptions.  The diary ends when he is near Khan Yunis and at this time he is hopeful that his application to transfer to the Camel Corps is approved.]

Though on the whole I don't mind foregoing my fireworks this year!  Tomorrow we reach our destination & - pronounced Gillar.
