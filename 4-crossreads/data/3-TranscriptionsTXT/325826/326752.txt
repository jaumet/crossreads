 Cairo Wednesday  Ma  April 5th. "16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R  5.5.16 My dear Home People, I have just received the enclosed from Rid with a personal letter for myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was stupid of us not to have a clear understanding about it, but I am not sure whether he has posted a duplicate copy to Box Hill or not, we forgot to talk about it at all.  Perhaps you can tell whether there has been a duplicate taken off and if there has he is almost certain to have posted it to Box Hill.  If you think there has not, would you please mind sending it to them, telling them that I was uncertain whether they would have already had a copy.  And please don't be too proud to keep an account of all this postage I cost you, it mounts up, and withdraw it from the Bank added to anything else you may be fixing up for me, like that Beard Watson's business. The only thing that Rid has not mentioned in the general letter that I think may interest you is that for two days he was troubled with his throat again, one day only slightly the next with a sharp pain there.  The doctor said it was not tonsilitis but pharingytis whatever that is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It troubles me rather all the trouble he has had with his throat &amp; I only hope it does not become a serious drawback to him, he would be disappointed to have to throw up his work yet, though there is not the slightest hint of any such thing in all he says; he was quite right again when he wrote. Again much love to you dear ones, Your loving daughter Olive.
