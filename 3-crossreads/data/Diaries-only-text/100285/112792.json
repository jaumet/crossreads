the views are magnificent, we stopped round Ramsay for a few hours, during which time we bought some souvenirs I sent home a pair of serviette rings with the Isle of Man's coat of arms on, Laxey was another little town we visited it is the prettiest little place that ever I have seen being on 2 sides of a big deep valley every house is of stone as white as snow while flowers trees are everywhere, the wonderful Laxey water wheel is here I took a snap of it, we reached Douglas about 9 oclock that night went down into the town to get some tea we went to a good restaurant the Cabin Caf, here in Douglas you would never know there was a war on there are no food restrictions, you can get meat sugar butter
