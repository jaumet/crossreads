<p>Left Wardan</p>
<p>Got word at 4 this morning that we had to break camp &amp; entrain for somewhere we therefor broke camp &amp; got everything ready for a speedy removal, but nothing came about all day, we filled in by playing footy, after tea we had a concert &amp; I made weird noises to the tune on the organ to "absent" someone had to fill up so of course I fell to it we had just turned in when we got orders to entrain at once, it took us two hours to clear out &amp; entrain horses, byks, &amp; stores, the train finally steamed out of Wardan at 11.25.</p>
