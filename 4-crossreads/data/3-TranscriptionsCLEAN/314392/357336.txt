Fritz sent over some big shells about 5pm. Wounding several and killing 2 men. Billie Walsh came over. 12th Cold & misty. Slight shower of snow falling. 13th The sun is shining today & the frost on the ground has melted leaving small pools of water. Once again we experienced mud. Taubes up but no damage done. Artillery active. 14th Once again the sun shines which of course makes things seem more cheerful. At night Bill, Dick, Mac & I
