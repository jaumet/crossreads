 Climate lovely now. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  Just recd. your Cable of Congratulations. All's well for which many thanks. I hope you get my letters even if later than in the post. 
 I am not saying much about the GAZA Battle it is still sub judice. Another Gun boat just passed full steam ahead. Several Monitors are helping & our Infantry are dug in. Reinforcements reached the Turks& they are holding out. 
 My troubles last night were caused by Field Mice burrowing near my face & covering my head with sand kicked up by their little hind legs. A light dazzles them & they stand quite still & stare.
