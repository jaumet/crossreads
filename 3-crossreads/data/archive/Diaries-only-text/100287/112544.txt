people behind him, what a slug for old Asquith his pro-German crowd [see notes below].
3rd. Finished coaling about 11 o'clock this morning, I shall not forget our morning in Colombo, it was the hottest I have ever felt not a breath of wind a pitiless sun, it was a touch of hell, they posted a notice up to the effect that stowaways were suspected of being on board that if they were caught between here Australia we would all be put in quarantine for a considerable time this must have frightened our lads for shortly afterwards they caught one, he belonged to our Battalion, while coming home he had been taken bad put off at Colombo there he has to stop while the town is quarantined, there are 4 of them altogether they keep on trying every ship, with the hope of getting away, I feel sorry for them.
