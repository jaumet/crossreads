 Move back to the Jordan Valley tomorrow!  it cannot be so Hot as it was but bad enough.  Am arranging for Kia-Ora-Cooee a paper to be sent direct to you.  Saddles (92) arrived at 4 AM &amp; had to be put together &amp; issued, all our old ones were damaged by Shells &amp; handed in at Jericho. My remount looks upon me as his mortal enemy &amp; flounders along I wonder how they "break in" horses in S. America!
