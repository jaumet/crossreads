  
 30 22/7/16 To-night after tea a couple of other chaps & myself went looking for a bath. We found a beautiful clear stream & followed it up until we came to a bosker pool & in we went. Cold, gee it was cold but it made us feel fresh afterwards. 
 When I got back the Corporal from the Post Office & I went for a spin into the country on bikes by jove it was lovely. I saw the first rabbit since landing in France, that is wild the people keep them in boxes. We went right up a gorgeous valley & could hear distinctly the sound of the guns. Had a cup of coffee at a dear little girls place near by here on the banks of the stream. 
 25/7/16 Went for a glorious  ride  walk
