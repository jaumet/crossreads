  
 I hear we are here for a few days, being reserve brigade, nearly time we were reserve something and we are to be put on Road Mending, it will be nice making roads through the mud, every man in the Bn is crook, mostly with colds, and its quite pleasant and rather funny to hear the chorus of coughing every now and then 8.12.16 Still in huts, been raining slightly all day, have been looking for coal but nothing doing, managed to pinch some wood and have a fire now thanks.
