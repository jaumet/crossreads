  
 Xmas Day 1914  We are at Kawieng - the capital  of New Ireland - a very pretty spot - Rabaul is known as the furnace of of the islands but this Spot is paradise - A coral isle - beset by treacherous reefs - The Eastern got on & got off without our help - lucky for her - you should see the combers on the reefs - We anchored off the Governor's residence & presently a lot of us went ashore - New Ireland was German but is now British - An outpost is here & is to be relieved - I went to the hospitals & saw several cases of disease - Ellis is the orderly & a very decent man - He showed me everything - gave me claret & biscuit - By the way I've got for you a lovely silver coin - size of a 5/ piece - New Guinea company coin - rare & will be rarer - On the reverse is a bird of paradise in full outspread plumage - I have a smaller one for Mab - They'll make lovely brooches & be quite unique - now - Word has just come by wireless that a German ship is within 100 miles - We have cleared for action - Awnings, stanchions & rails down - all ready for instant work - Guns out - loaded - Maxim ready - Everything tiptop readiness - My SBA broke his leave last eveg - Drink I fancy - He'll get scrubbed - All his leave is gone - He'll be up & toe the quarter deck & the Commander will do the talking - He's a true ass -
