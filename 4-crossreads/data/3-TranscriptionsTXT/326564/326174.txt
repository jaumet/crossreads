one of my Corporals, I reported him as on parade & he wasn't, & the best of the fun was that the Captain went round the huts & hanged if he did not catch Lynch inside, of course he wanted to know what he was doing there for he was on no duty, what a gutser, but I got out of it easy enough for I had just taken the platoon over & my roll was not complete.It has been very cloudy & drizzling rain this afternoon but we had the afternoon off & played bridge nearly all the time, it is a great game amongst us Sgts.
31st. Sunday & nothing much doing except that the Colonel sent down for me wanted to know something about the discharge cups & new bomb which had been taught us
