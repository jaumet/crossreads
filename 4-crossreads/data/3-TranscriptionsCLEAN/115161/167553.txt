  
 Our O.C. was one of the finest fellows possible (his name being a favorite of our boyhood, another name for pudding)! He had been a private himself therefore realized what we had to put up with, and always studied the men under him. He was in France for a time with the Battalion, but afterwards joined the Flying Corps, and got wounded in a "stunt". 
 I think that I told you that during the "circus" parade, we were all issued with "Light Horse" overcoats.
