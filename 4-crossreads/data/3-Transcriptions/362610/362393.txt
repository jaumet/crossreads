<p>Monday 26 June 1916<br/>A fine day but towards evening very heavy rain set in. Fairly quiet during the morning but livelier in the afternoon when Fritz again opened up on the observation post opposite our billet, landing some shells very close to us &amp; forcing us again to take to the trenches. In the afternoon had to go up to H.Q. at Fleurbaix for a gas lecture. Saw Rid as we were passing his H.Q. but found he was out when I called in on the return journey. At Fleurbaix met 2 old Uni. men, Capt (AMC) Roy Winn &amp; Capt. Barton. A heavy bombardment during the night.</p>
