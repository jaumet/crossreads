9/2/19 Gourdinne
Although the same kind of day as yesterday, today was fortunately a little warmer. In the morning I went up to see Blatchford at his Printing Office and then walked over snowy paths to see Beith and have a talk with him. After lunch made off for Nalinnes over snowy roads inches deep which made going heavy. Through the wood and down to James? billet where I had a yarn and then met the General. He walked nearly back to Gourdinne with me discussing future events. At Crochelets at 4 pm there was a family reunion and we ate hot cakes like muffins (great eaters) and then all sat round singing snatches from Rigoletto Faust Carmen. Bought a bottle of Benedictine and with it later gladdened the family's heart.
