<p>heat of the desert, it is a scene that brings a lump in a fellows throat to think that these fine men will never muster again in the same numbers &ndash; as no doubt this is our final Review.</p>

<p>Rather hot &amp; dusty &ndash; Read out in Brigade orders, that we deserved credit for our display yesterday &amp; the G.O.C. thanked us &ndash; On Guard all day &ndash; Another Kit inspection &ndash; All cameras have to be got rid &ndash; under severe penaltys for disobedience, as no Camera are allowed to leave Egypt.</p>
<p>27/5/16  Saturday</p>
<p>Had the day off for being on Guard yesterday. The Boys pulling down &amp; packing our Marquee tents etc - We are ready to move at half an hours notice &ndash; While swimming at night two big Boats went through one was the Whitecourt &amp; the other a French Mail Boat converted into a transport, it had a lot of Indians on, also a lot of mixed passengers aft, we were rather surprised to see women &amp; children we had to take to the water as we were in all stages of dress, they gave a good cheer.</p>
