<p>Part of the "Matunga's" crew came on board tonight, including the Purser and Assistant in immaculate whites.   I made George Pyne's acquaintance in a bath towel &amp; almost blushed at the contrast.</p>
<p>It is absolute hell in the hold of a night.  This bay has a close, muggy heat that one never gets on the open sea, and to be herded in the filthy hold all night is positive torture.</p>
<p>None of us can possibly wear any clothes and the decks are sopping with sweat.</p>
<p>We have a roll-call at 8 each night.   (Rees reminded all and sundry within hearing distance of "the pyjama incident" when the Amiable One toddled out to roll-call in an old bunk-curtain.    Garments consisting only of a small curtain do not suit the middle aged and portly, as Rees cruelly remarked.)</p>
