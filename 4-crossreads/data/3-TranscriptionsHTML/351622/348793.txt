<p>9 March 1916 Thur<br/>Called to see Jim Fay last night &amp; also Jack Kater. Reinforcements arrive. Dug a new cess pit the best part of the day. During the march yesterday we halted &amp; rested at the A.S.C. where I weighed myself to the surprise of putting on a stone &amp; a half since I joined the army.</p>
<p>10 March 1916 Fri<br/>Practising getting kit's ready all the morning. Aeroplanes here are very common. You see them overhead all day. Spent the afternoon on the water-waggon so never had a thirst up. Met Lieut McK. Paid again this afternoon so the old water proof sheet candle &amp; pack of cards will be in full swing to night.</p>
