<p>On the 25 Nov. the most puzzling of all things happened to us &amp; that was, that we were not to fire a shot on any account neither from rifles bombs nor guns, no fires were to be lit &amp; every one had to keep under cover &amp; not seen on any account whatsoever.<br/>That set the rumours going properly nearly every man had a different idea of what we were trying to do &amp; of all the opinions I don't think one of them guessed at the real meaning of it as we found out afterwards, most of us thought we were trying to kid the Turks to attack us, it would most certainly have been a bad day for them</p>
