<p>Reveille at 6<br/>This proved to be a day off to prepare for the morrow another mail arrived &amp; I got another from Nell &amp; mother things are anyhow at home with the [indecipherable] who had been writing home concerning our doings here.  Our new wireless arrived the sets are different in many respects, the [indecipherable] are smaller, has a [indecipherable] spark gap &amp; the detectors are in series the C O was like a big kid &amp; the cases couldn't be opened quick enough I had the bad luck to break a lug of the cradle for the saddle &amp; of course the boss said that I would have to pay for it but he's struck the wrong one to pay none of the wireless were allowed to see the sets as they might tell the Germans Bed at 9.</p>
