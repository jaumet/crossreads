<p>104 Dec 31st<br/>as a new year gift, in return for their many Kindnesses to us since being here &ndash;</p>
<p>We all caught 8 pm train for Doubledays, where we spent a most enjoyable evening, meeting a lot of new friends &ndash; It was the first time we were afforded the pleasure of listening to Miss Doubleday play the violin &amp; it was really splendid. I cannot express how gracefully she plays.</p>
