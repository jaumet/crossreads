<p>farm. Arrived at Bapaume just before dark &amp; bunked for the night in an up storey room, without door or windows &amp; loose boards laid for flooring. Our station takes up the ground floor of 3, 4 &amp; 5 Rue de Republic, part of a terrace smashed to atoms but still giving some semblance of shelter. There is no doubt every effort was made by the enemy to make the town uninhabitable, a systematic blowing up of houses &amp; burning being done &amp; the rubbish in the houses is indescribable. Practically all flooring has been taken up &amp; used &amp; such things as doors &amp; windows skirting boards simply do not exist. By closing up the windows with iron &amp; bagging &amp; covering the floor with miscellaneous boards we managed to make our room habitable although the ceiling is smashed &amp; the rear of the house has fallen out. Heard a heavy explosion a few minutes after turning in but left all enquiries concerning it until the morning</p>
