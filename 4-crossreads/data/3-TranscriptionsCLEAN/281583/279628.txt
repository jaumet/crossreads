3.9.16 Sunday
At 3 am this morning a furious Artillery attack commenced & has been raging ever since. Everything else compared to this has been childs play. The news to hand is that our Infantry attacked an important position & held on to it like grim death being opposed by Prussian Guards of which 3 divisions have been hurried up to the line. The position at the present time is both curious & critical the Prussian counter attacked, but were stopped by our fire, whilst their artillery established a barrage of fire behind our fellows so that no munitions or reinforcements could be taken up. Our artillery did likewise behind them & it is now a question of artillery ordinance. Guns are being hurried up on both sides & it is a prefect inferno what the troops are suffering could never be adequately described, The Canadians are in close support & all officers say that we will be able to swamp them with the weight of our artillery.
A place that I was visiting yesterday was heavily shelled today & I am very thankful that I was not there today. We are moving on the 6th of this month to a place where "gas" is very prevalent, so am hoping for the best, although none of us like the idea of it at all. Preparations are being made for the winter so am resigning myself to it.
