  
 Lt. McCarthy of "C" Company was wounded (died shortly after) by one of our own shells dropping short. They had the wrong range & the more we signalled an aeroplane the more shells we got. Poor Ball the bomber got struck on the chest & killed & Sam Warke wounded on forehead. It took an hour or so to get word through to stop them. After that all day long we could walk about the ruins of Pozieres & what is left of the orchards as if there weren't such insects as "Fritzs" in the world. Then poor old Bill Dixon got sniped through the head from some "possies" so we started to clear out the hiding places in the intact cellar under heaps of ruins. We got 3 machine guns & about 90 prisoners out of them but only allowed ourselves the pleasure of some of the prisoners company. One prisoner, a Medical Officer said he was surprised that we thought there would be an opposition as they were Bavarians. That's alright - but they'll turn a machine gun on to you if they get a chance. They are good fighters when there is not much risk to themselves. "Hand to hand" you can go through them as easily as a dose of Epsom. They up with their hands & put in the good old "Kamerad". Thought the "Germs" were going to counter attack this morning but it was only a party of them that were cut-off in the melee
