<p>April 1916<br/>[Note in margin:] Saty<br/>29th &ndash; saying, "The Turks will be here in half an hour" &amp; they all cleared for Kantara, leaving their comrades to be annihilated. 5th L.H. captured a German Officer on 23rd or day of scrap. Egyptian Papers press bureau reports state that British victory over Turks on 23rd. That 70 dead Turks were buried &amp; wounded &amp; a few prisoners brought in. Also stated that a LH Regt had been called up to reinforce. Understand British Gen'l &amp; staff escaped leaving beer, whisky &amp; lots of stuff of their officers mess behind. Our chaps collared it. Later after Turks had cleared out, &amp; the Staff returned, they sent over for their whisky etc &amp; they got the reply that 'it was wanted for the wounded whom they cleared out &amp; left.' Wounded were very sore over being deserted. Makes one's blood boil to think of such crass incompetency &amp; neglect costing<br/>29th &ndash; so many brave lives &amp; the heads escaping. Turks were humane &amp; left water beside the wounded but those devils of Bedouins were like scavengers after an army, they took all food &amp; water that had been left &amp; in many cases killed the wounded &amp; according to the parson the features of many of the dead were mutilated beyond recognition. Believe in course of a couple of weeks the Anzac mtd division will all be here &amp; our artillery supporting, we will advance clearing the Bedouins &amp; Turks out of Elarisch &amp; district &amp; we may eventually land near or in Palestine. Turks had artillery supports, our men had not. Even now we are greatly inferior in numbers etc to Turks. They seem to have a very healthy respect for Austns. Some expect another swoop &amp; others<br/>[Lt W.E.L. Seeward (actually William Eric Louis Seward, MC (1891-1975) &ndash; the exploit mentioned on pg. 174 of this diary is documented in a painting held by the Imperial War Museum: Concise Art Collection Title: The Seward Exploit]</p>
