<p>110<br/>Dr was detained &amp; had a fine night with many whiskies &amp; sodas &amp; has only just got up. I slip down to nearest coiffeur &amp; have a share &amp; then go off to dinner with McColl &amp; another friend we pick up en route</p>
<p>We dine at the Caf&eacute; aux Pyramides a restaurant largely frequented by the Yanks. These obnoxious intrusions on the human race are much in evidence here. In fact they are everywhere except in the fighting line but their boasting is beyond all endurance &amp; as they have won the war &amp; saved civilisation &amp; Europe (in their opinion) they consider they are entitled to boss everyone. At least that is what they act up to.</p>
<p>After dinner I propose to visit Ciro &amp; Maxims but we meet Isaackson &amp; the three of us promenade to a [magasin] where McColl wishes to buy some presents for the people with whom he has been staying. We try to seat ourselves in the open air caf&eacute; de la Paix but here one does not sell alcoholic drinks so we must move along to Bar</p>
<p>After some more Oporto flips (a drink consisting of nutmeg, whole egg, brandy &amp; some other mixtures) Isaackson clears off &amp; McColl &amp; I set off for Ciro in Rue Daunou off av &ndash; de l'Opera.</p>
<p>Here McColl meets an old friend with whom</p>
