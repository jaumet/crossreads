  
 July, 1915 Monday 19  Letters from Laura one 24th May also from Mrs Cotton, Paper from Ferrar & letters from the trenches  - Men in trenches  That other  complain bitterly of the flies & Lice, Former are bad here & with so many sore eyed niggers & Horse drives spread Disease wholesale. Day time especially 2 p.m. very hot. Cooler at night but the Desert sand blows onto everything but why growl when compared to our mates, with death Turks all around them & unburied we are in clover & really ashamed to be still here in Egypt.
