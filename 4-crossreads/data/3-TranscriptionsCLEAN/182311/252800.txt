My Dear Ones,
   Two mails it is since I wrote you at any length; today, I'll try to atone for such neglect with a longer letter telling of some interesting things I've been doing of late.
   Saturday week Novr 4th we chose to visit Amesbury Abbey for the grounds are most beautiful, they have a few good portraits by Lawrence & Reynolds & on the bank of the Avon there is an old stone room, built into the bank, 'tis called "The Diamond" & here Gay wrote the words of the "Beggar's Opera."  On the previous Friday night I had been the officer of the piquet in Amesbury & making my H.Q. at the Abbey Hotel had sought by enquiries permission to visit the grounds. 
   This permission was obtained & Sir Cosmo Antrobus in addition expressed a wish to meet us & his willingness to show us the house as well.
