April 12th 1918. The convoy arrived at "Cape Town" S. Africa about 9 o,clock this morning, went ashore shortly after arrival and were taken by train to Sea Point Camp near Lions head.
13 Touring the City, Cape Town right behind the times, considering the time white people have been there. Will perhaps wake up some day.
15 We went aboard Durham Castle this morning and left C-Town at midday, vessel tossed about a good deal during night.
17 Arrived at "Port Elizabeth" about 9A.M. Vessel discharging cargo the remainder of the day.
18 About 60 of the boys in Ship,s Hospital suffering some kind of poisoning after their midday meal (Supposed foul play)
19 Left "Port Elizabeth" at 7 o,clock to night.
20 Arrived at "East London" at 9 o,clock this morning, and steamed out again at 8 o,clock to night.
21 Sunday. Arrived of "Durban" at 10 o,clock to night and anchored out. Durban looked quite gay with its city lights flickering away, after the darkness of European City,s.
22 Vessel went into port early this morning, all Troops landed and taken by train to "Congella Camp" about 2 miles outside the City.
25 ANZAC DAY. Left Camp about 8 o,clock this morning for the Troopship "Field-Marshall" we anchored out in the harbour about 4 this afternoon (The "Field Marshall" is an old German liner that has been raised from the harbour at "Dar-es-Salaam" East Africa were the Germans had themselves sunk her during the early days of the War to prevent the British from using her. She has been fitted up in a Fashion to take us home)
26 Trouble right away. Colonel Hurcum, refuses to leave "Durban" untill ship is properly fitted up, and he is quite right. It reminds me of the Troopship "Drayton-Grange" that we were packed aboard in 1902 when going home from the South African War. They have a funny way with Troops when they are finished with them.
