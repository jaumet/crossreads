<p>We do a lot of riding &amp; jumping. You can imagine your humble as a cross country rider &amp; yet strange to say I've been complimented on having a good seat in the saddle. It often falls to my lot to lead the way over the country for our troop &amp; two or three times I've had to close my teeth tight to keep my heart from coming right out. Am in great fettle &amp; so far it has done me the world of good.</p>
<p>We have picked up a lot of our back debt now &amp; have nearly finished the furniture. Lizzie is living in a room at a friend's of Mrs French's. She is starting to look fine now that the debts are getting out of sight here. She hasn't much desire to go home to the Hill &amp; is going to stay here</p>
