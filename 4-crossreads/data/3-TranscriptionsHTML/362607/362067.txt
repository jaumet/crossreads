<p>Dear Mum,<br/>As I have no news this week, I'm only sending a P.C. of the famous Buckingham Palace &amp; Queen Vic's Monument. I went to a lovely dance last Wednesday but I was not too well having felt a little Bilious &amp; had taken medicine accordingly, so I did not enjoy the second half of the progamme at all. We played our first Hockey Match on Saturday &amp; we thoroughly enjoyed it. Of course everyone is walking around like maimed men so we had a strenuous time. We had a letter 16/9/18 where you stated that  you had been unwell. The letters previous to that we have not received stating your attack. From your letter though you appear to be on the mend. We hope you are on Deck, Mum. We want you to be A.1. now as we expect to return soon. Best love to my Darling Mother  From Harry</p>
