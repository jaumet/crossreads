every man in my platoon have got new tunics trousers hats boots since coming here they look much smarter, besides the Coy. have a Regimental barber, tailor, bootmaker, attached to us they attend to their respective duties, this keeps everyone up to the scratch for there is no excuse for being untidy, also every morning the cooks supply a big dixie of hot water for the men to shave with this is a little unusual, but you can see they are not having a bad time, a far better one than we Platoon Sgts are having for there is a tremendous amount of work falling on your shoulders getting all these things issued etc to the men you would be surprised at the amount of clerical work this entails, for the Army is full of red tape.
