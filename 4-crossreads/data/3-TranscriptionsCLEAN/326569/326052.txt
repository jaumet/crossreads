along Cannon St. & looked in at Cannon St. Rail Stn., then further along Cannon St. & Tower St. to the Tower of London which I thoroughly went over.  Saw in it the Armouries, Crown Jewels, Sir Walter Raleigh's Cell, Bloody Tower where Princes were murdered, Beauchamp Tower & all historical places.  Then went along Tower Hill & on to the Tower Bridge.  Came back then into Tower St. to Mark Lane Underground Rail Stn. & went to Charing Cross Stn.  Looked over the big Rail Stn. there & then went to Trafalgar Square, Leicester Sq., Piccadilly Circus & along Regent St. to Oxford Circus.  There took bus along Gt. Portland St. & Euston Rd.
