 Aunt Nell and from thence we went to "see" Polly and the girls. Grace Hilderbrand was at Poll's. This, of course, is ancient history. Mrs. Connor, Eileen, and Gwen, came out to see me and brought a basket full of cakes &amp;c, and we had tea down on the river bank. She sent me a letter saying she was coming out but unfortunately I did not receive it and had some trouble in getting away even for a short time as I was on duty. As it was I could only stay with them for about an hour. I was terribly disreputable too, in old white sandshoes, dungarees, none too clean, and worst of all an old felt civilian hat. Thank goodness I have now received my uniform. The leggings and coat are several sizes too large but they are far preferable to the dungarees, and as regards the tunic, it is so made that its excess in size is only noticeable round the neck. 
 A letter of yours (or from someone at home) which was received by the Sharpes and posted on to me went astray and neither it nor Mrs. Connor's letter have come to light, although it is now ten days since they were sent. You stated in your last letter that you would probably leave for Sydney on the twenty-first. Let me know in your next letter how your arrangements are progressing and I may be able to fix things up here so as to meet you on your arrival. We were all innoculated last Tuesday and again to-day. We have to be done three times in all with a week's interval between each. As I am feeling slightly off colour on account of it I will now close. With best love to all Your loving son, Eugene. 
 P.S. Mrs. Connor says that everything she has sent to Egypt has been received by Murray so I think it would be quite safe to send anything to Kevin now that he is back at his old address.
