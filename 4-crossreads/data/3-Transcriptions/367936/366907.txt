<p>When England calls for men!  More men! each day.<br/>I would be base were I to bid him stay,<br/>But I am just &ndash; a mother &ndash; Lord, and oh!<br/>It simply breaks my heart to let him go -<br/>Because I'm human, Lord, my tears must flow.<br/>But joy and pride reign o'er my grief to-day,<br/>With words of cheer I'll speed him on his way.<br/>For they across the sea, they need him so,<br/>Oh, son!  To save my honour, you must go!</p>
