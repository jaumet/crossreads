<p>Tuesday 3rd Dec.  Read the paper in the lounge whilst waiting for V. Hutton to arrive then we went along to Australia House where we inspected a collection of war trophies etc none of them being new to me however.  Returned to the hotel &amp; met Ramsay after which Hutton left for Paddington.  Ramsay &amp; I then went to the Gt Russell for lunch, very fine indeed, it being a first rate hotel.  Having nothing special to do we strolled round town &amp; I booked seats for tomorrows matinee at Going Up, at the Gaiety.  Had afternoon tea at The Elys&eacute;e at Piccadilly &amp; dinner at Maxims, going next to the Coliseum Music Hall where they had a very good show, including some Russian dancers and the Pasquali brothers who were with me on the Ceramic coming from Australia in 1914.  A very good but quiet day.  Weather good.</p>
