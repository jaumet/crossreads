<p>Fine, but not too warm. They spent the morning trying to pick out teams from our black horses, but neither Campbell or Raymond know anything about a horse so it was not much of a success. Bill Hunter &amp; Self went down &amp; saw Eric Pope in afternoon &amp; then over to the Hospital &amp; saw Armstrong &amp; Burgess. I was on Stable picket at night. Posted some newspapers to Poss.</p>
