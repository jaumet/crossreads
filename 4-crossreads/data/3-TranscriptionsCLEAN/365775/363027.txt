of the journey we are travelling through green fields, with a stretch of sand here & there & along the many canals, which flow through the greater part of fertile Egypt. passing through the once famous city of Zaga Zig & many little villages along the line, & at almost all these places, where we stopped to take on coal or water there, would be dozens of niggers selling watermelons, tomatoes & eggs "cooked". I think these devils would sit up all night to sell half a piastre of anything, but then of course they sleep anywhere, their blankets are on their backs just lay down & pull their robes around them & they are in bed,
