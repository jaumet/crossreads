 thinking of you. 
 I really think we'll be out of the line for Christmas which will be a treat.  We will be housed in some little village I hope.  I expect the W.O. &amp; the Sergeant &amp; I will find &amp; rent some little room where we can sit by the stove &amp; smoke &amp; have a dry warm sleep. 
 I did some washing three days ago but can't get it dry.  It won't dry in the open &amp; the dugout is too small to hang it up there. 
 My two special pals Jock Merklejohn &amp; Harry Purnell have been to see me the last day or so &amp; as they walked over 3&frac12; miles over beastly country I felt very pleased.  They are great chaps, I wish you knew them but they are not subtle (thank heaven).
