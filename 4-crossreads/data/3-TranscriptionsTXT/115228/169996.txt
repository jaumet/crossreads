Oct 31st:  Last night at 7 p.m. the Anzac Mounred Division, the Australian Mounted Division & the Camel Corps with a good number of guns moved out of Asluj & trekked during the night a distance of over 20 miles.  We sighted Beersheeba about 5 miles distant soon after daylight & the mounted troops approached from the north and East, not meeting with any serious opposition until within
