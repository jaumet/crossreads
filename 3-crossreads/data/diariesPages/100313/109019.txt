1/1/18 Boulogne
Had dinner at the hotel and then went up to the officers Club up the street. It seems to be a very good and well kept place and I am sorry not to have gone there in the first place. The leave boat pulls out at 10.30 a.m. in the morning. The town is pitch dark and one cannot see more than a few paces ahead. All along the streets one gets flashes of electric torch from ships that pass in the night. An intensely biting cold wind that seems to cut through all overcoats clothes. Shaded lights at the busy railway station where crowds of troops (leave, details drafts c) are marching in and out all the time. English is the language most heard in the street, a few loud brawling voices coming from out of the darkness but otherwise the whole place is most deadly quiet and there is nothing doing. A number of nurses (mostly Canadian) are staying at this hotel. In the Officers Club and elsewhere are the W.A.A.C?S ? a tremendous risk parents take in permitting their girls to take on work in an atmosphere like this.
