entrained at Ypres, saw a lot more of the boys who had come across from Blighty, some of them had not done more than 3 months.
Passed about 2000 prisoners on our way down they were taken last night. Got out of the train just outside Poperinghe had to march about 2 kilos, to where we are now camped in tents, they are pretty cold too.
Pay day today the first for a long time most of the lads are drawing extra for Xmas money.
It has been a lovely day plenty of sun things are drying fast.
Last night I received a batch of 12 letters my photos from Edinburgh, the letters were very welcome.
12th What a night we had last night 3 other Sgts I went into Poperinghe with the idea of having some fun we got it, cost us some money, though it nearly all went in presents which we were buying to send back, among the 4 of us, we spent nearly 400 francs.
