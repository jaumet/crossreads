 About the middl of June 1916 an alarm outbreak of Malaria fever swept the Belemedik . This outbreak was quit unexpect in view of the height abov sea level and pure atmospher . Near everi person becam sick and a great number die through the want of proper medic attent and poor food . It was at such a crisi that the German plus the Turk show their true spirit for they increas the labour of those who could manag to work and onli allow them to make coffin for their dead mate and give them Christian burial in their spare time . Moreov when a prison becam sick and could n't work his pay immedi ceas and he had no money to buy food , therefor he starv He was not allow to stop work without a Doctor 's certif and the German Doctor in charg of the prison was a callous inhuman blighter who onli gave his sanction when the patient was near done . Not a few even when in die curs him . He was known as " The Swine " . It was dure this outbreak that I lost three of my boatmat , Chief Stoker Varco , Petti Officer Gilbert and Able Seaman Knagg . Truli our condit was bad , but when we saw the heartbreak deplor plight of Gener Townsend 's men march as prison from Kutelamarah to Belemedik even the sick rose up to piti them . Mani a poor wretch spoke with a shudder of that aw journey forc to travel when eaten with fever and dysenteri . On the march they were driven to walk twenti mile per day . Veri often at the end of day 's march they did not get anyth but just a hand of flour or raw grain . What mean did they have of cook anyth , suffer from the extrem of climat , scorch sun by day and bitter cold by night . When they reach us they were mere skeleton and look eloqu exampl of c combin Turkish and German " Kultur" . Truli one touch of natur make us all akin . We did what we could to reliev and cheer them with gift of cloth , food and medicin . On the short anamanus amanus section of the Bagdad Railway over 1000 answer the last Roll call . [Side note : Anamanus ? or " Taurus " Date NB Place for 1st escap Aug] About Septemb 1916 a sick parti of 140 who could n't work were sent from Belemedik to Angora , but soon after their arriv instead of be allow to rest they were put to work again on a light Railway between Angora and Ezeroum .
