<p>Love to all yous &amp; don't think me a humbug &amp;c.</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Wilk</p>
<p>France<br/>24 June</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Two letters from you today, and of course I rushed them both with my ears back as I hadn't heard from you for just ages and ages.  The mails have gone dilly absolutely &amp; no one has had mail for ages &amp; ages, not from Australia anyhow.</p>
<p>And I can't for the life of me understand how it is you are not getting my letters.  It makes me feel so damned wild &amp; so helpless.  So I just feel sick but please blame it on to the service for I do write.</p>
<p>And about the address, sorry I've mixed you up but you all seem to be wrong.  It was 2 Section, 2nd D.A.C. from May 1916 to August 1916.  Then I came back to H.Q. of 5 Brigade so that it was H.Qrs., 5th F. <u>Artillery</u> Brigade, &amp; has been that ever since.  Your address was right except that you used to omit the Artillery &amp; the letters went to Infantry, I thought I told you that.</p>
<p>I don't think I've been writing censorable stuff but one never knows.</p>
<p>Well anyhow I was so glad to get these two</p>
