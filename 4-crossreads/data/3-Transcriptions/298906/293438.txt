<p>14th. Was out scouting this morning Colonel Beghy took us out he is a fine old chap &amp; travels like the wind, belongs to H.L.I. &amp; what he does not know about scouting isn't worth knowing. This afternoon we were out on the parade ground drilling like maniacs racing round &amp; round like madmen.<br/>15th. This morning we were out all around the country, &amp; when we came back we had to sketch the country we had passed over &amp; make all sorts of notes on it. In the afternoon we were on the square again drilling for our lives every man had to come out &amp; drill the squad &amp; Company in his turn, caused a bit of fun I can tell you.</p>
