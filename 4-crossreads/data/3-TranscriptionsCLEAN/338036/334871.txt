  
 past Suicide Corner and thro the trenches to Wine Av Aid Post - bullets whizzing overhead the while.  On our arrival at the Aid Post we found a very convenient dug out filled with bearers & Capt Clark of 11th F. Amb in charge.  The guns ceased after & we saw it was only a blind.  We had about 11/2 hrs to wait for  next  real stunt so sat quietly whilst outside the Tynesiders who were going over filed past with their peculiar "waddies" revolvers or whatever they selected. 
 At last after a tedious the whole heavens seemed to bark with flame and every gun in the district spat out death to the Huns.  Fritz replied at first with a few "minnies" [minenwerfer] and one of the boys in our dug out walked to see the fireworks - only to stop a piece of fragment in his chest.  There were two of our boys standing immediately in front of him.  Another uneventful 1/2 hr and then - the next 4 hrs was hell.  Imagine after a few cases had been bandaged & patched up - a floor covered with a couple of inches of floor & bloody swabs cotton wool shell [?] dressing all over it.  Our hands were never free of blood and the fresh blood smell was nauseating
