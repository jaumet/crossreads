 chocolate goes through before it comes in to our hands, we sampled all the different sorts on our way through also the biscuits, &amp; very nice they were, after we had gone through most of the factory our guide took us in to the visitors room where cakes bread &amp; butter &amp; cocoa were provided free &amp; real good this was. from here we completed the tour of the factory &amp; then went into the gardens &amp; etc. I took a snap in here but I don't think it will be much good for the day was very dull when we had finished we were all given a souvenir box with little illustrated booklets &amp; chocolates &amp; so ended a most enjoyable little visit to one of the largest chocolate &amp; cocoa makers in England &amp; also one of the best &amp; generous employers.
