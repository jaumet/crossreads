  
 Sunday 11 March 1917 
 Went Cairo to Hospitals to see wounded & sick. Am sure the change will have done you & (MARTHA as Daisy is) good & JOE must find the monotony killing at times, he & you all are doing more in your way than we are who live an exciting life. 
 Met me know if you get the Turk's revolver & the photos I send by Capt. PEARSE of Pastoralists Review. I ran into STANLEY BRAIM at Heliopolis Hotel last night, he is I think drinking more than is good for him, I am afraid. I will write Eleanor but don't tell her this.
