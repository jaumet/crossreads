<p>food and clothing; but these poor unfortunates bear their misery and torture, silently gallantly and nobly. I detest sitting down to a meal in the presence of these dejected men; but what can one do. Nothing! beyond giving a little occasionally. I am glad to say most Englishmen do the same. In my Barrack there are two Russian Sergeant-majors, one of whom speaks excellent English, and is a well-bred and educated man. It is pitiful to see his haggard face and starved body, bearing the marks of long years of suffering in Hun hands. His veins are shrunken, his bones protruding, but the heart withing is still staunch and brave. As I have already stated, he is one of thousands of Hun victims. Sundays usually bring a little excitement. Hun people promenade the road, which passes through the fences. They stare and gaze at us. The prisoners gather round the fences to see the people displaying this curiosity. This practice is strictly forbidden, but the Hun posterns seldom interfere unless an officer or under-officer approaches, which very often happens. Much shouting generally announces their presence. The crowd usually disperses, until the "Donnerwetting" ceases. The damp is very unhealthy and although the weather is mild; I sincerely hope I shall be liberated before the summer months. Urinals and refuse pits are covered by a few inches of sand, and fresh ones are made nearby, so that the camp is more or less a huge refuse dump. One is never free from bugs and lice. I use a whole packet of naptholene daily. The vermin and lice still swarm in my clothing and blankets. The bath-house is open daily and by continual washing one can alay the irritation.</p>
<p>Mch. 1. The weather is ideal. A party of Englishmen left here this morning to cross the frontier. Many still await the happy day of their release. My leg is very painful and I think, contains some foreign substance. My health, is improving and I am increasing in weight; thanks to the care of the Red Cross Society. The English provided a concert last night, which I enjoyed immensely.</p>
<p>2nd &ndash; 10th. Awfully fed up and bored. I am keenly anticipating repatriation, but I must wait patiently. A case occurred today that really deserves mention. Two men, one of my own battalion</p>
