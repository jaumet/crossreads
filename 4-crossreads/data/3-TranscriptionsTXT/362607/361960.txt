 11.4.17 Dear George, Dad, Mum, I have received about 6 letters from you all but we are so busy that I cannot answer just at present. I am expecting to go to Grimsby with Dave for 4 days on Monday so it may be some time before you all get a letter from me. We are both well &amp; happy &amp; the Spring is on us, also Daylight saving. I went to Church in the little wee Milstone Church on Sunday. It was a so quaint. I am now real thorough Church of England &amp; can pick up the Common Prayer Book  always at the right place, and never sit down at the wrong time &amp; vice versa.  Love &amp; good health to you All  From Harry, Ellis &amp; Dave.
