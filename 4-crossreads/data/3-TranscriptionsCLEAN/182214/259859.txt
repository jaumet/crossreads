  
 the Medeterranean Sea fairly sparkled in the sun. I often wondered what Gallopoli looked like & here we were within two or three days run from that famous place. our trip proved to be a quiet uninteresting one & rather warm It was not a large boat & we were well packed. We were the first to leave Egypt & the last but one to reach Marseilles where our band played the Marseillase & other tunes as we entered the port we got no reception we arrived in port about 8 AM June 23rd & went ashore about 4.30 PM marched to the trains we saw german Prisoners working in the goods yard. they look very well & fit & one felt as if he hated them all ready
