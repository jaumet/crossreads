 Monday 26 November 1917 Connaught again &amp; in charge 2-5.  All peace during that time then over to 14 A.G.H. for a bit of "home" &amp; life.  Saw Dick &amp; had a laugh again. Matron on duty after 4 days honeymoon but going away for longer leave.  Happy &amp; gay as possible. 6 empty beds but convoys always come daily &amp; hosp. must be up to its full capacity.  1800 pts. in one night lately &amp; most of the new arrivals lying about for several days before sent in here.
