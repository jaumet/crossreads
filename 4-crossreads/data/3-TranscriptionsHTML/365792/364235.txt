<p>June 1 thusly &ndash; "You were unlucky enough to stop one"? &ndash; Yes. "Alright &ndash; you needn't wait". Exit me.<br/>Tip top Concert tonight. First class singing, reciting &amp; acting, &amp; a slashingly original comic &ndash; one of the best ive seen. The party comes down to Harefield every Thursday night.</p>
<p>2 Reveille woke me this morning. The twilight lasts for such a darned long time in this country, that a fellow cant get to sleep. Passed one Board but have to go before another tomorrow mng. Rec'd 9 letters from Aust &amp; 3 from Eng &ndash; all addressed to Egypt. Waited round the Office for 2 or 3 hours, &amp; was told to come back &ndash; later &ndash;</p>
<p>3  Won a game of Croquet; "for a wonder" Rather chilly in the shade but good on the Lawn.<br/>Went before the board, but know nil. Also saw the Major re a glass eye. Am to visit him again on Wed &amp; the dentist on Monday.</p>
