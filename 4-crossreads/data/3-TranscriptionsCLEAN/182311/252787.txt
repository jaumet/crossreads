 My Dear Ones, 
    Sunday - and such a Sunday too, as I sit in my hut I hear the wind howl and whine right off the plains.  I have just been out for half-an-hour's walk, inspecting the sentries and I'll have to do it again after 11 p.m. tonight, so I'll be able to send you quite a long letter this time.  I hope you will have time to read it. 
    Yesterday we had quite a nice afternoon visiting Earl Radnor's castle. L a  o ngford Castle is its name, and it is distant about three miles from Salisbury; while passing through this town we heard that only on   Wednesday is it open to visitors, we felt disappointed but decided to try and get in, so hired a noble looking car off the rank and proceeded to cover the three miles to the Castle; arrived at the lodge we tootled our horn, the lodge keeper opened the gate and saluted respectfully, then for quite half a mile we drove along a path through the park until flanked by noble trees, Longford Castle was seen. 
    We drew up in front of the main entrance in great style and the Captain Lansell asked me to negotiate the Entrance by saying - "You have the most cheek" of course I wouldn't move until he amended it - "You are the most resourceful" that was enough, with due attention to swank, cane, gloves, etc. I summoned the maid, sent in my card and found that being officers  we  were permitted to enter.
