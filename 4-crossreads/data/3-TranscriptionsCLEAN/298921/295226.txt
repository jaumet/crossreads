  
 September, 1915 Sunday 12 At my request I am shifting to "El Hoyat" Convalescent Hospital Helonan - This is another immense Hotel built for Tourists, you may remember we trekked here & bivouacked for 4 days last March. There are about 30 officers here & the main trouble seems to be the dirty Nile water which being in flood is like the Yarra - Heliopolis water is from an Artesian Bore - Travelling shook me up a lot & I'll sleep well - Got a bit of Rheumatism want of exercise I expect.
