 I have not been quite up to the mark since last I wrote had a bit of a setback again feeling jolly weak but getting much better. The doctors tell me they want to get me away to Egypt as soon as they can arrange traffic very congested there at present Very cold last week snow & sleet, lot of poor chaps frost bitten badly on Peninsular - very busy here, so much to be done it is rotten lying up. Doctors say I must & it is alright Thinking of you all love to the boys & Amy  Remember me to old Bill No need to worry I am feeling much better send letters to same address will forward writing you soon Just had your letter glad to hear & have paper Love to all George 
 Wish Graham happy returns birthday
