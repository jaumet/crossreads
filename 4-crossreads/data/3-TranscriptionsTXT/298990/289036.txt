 Ypres 13/10/16 Furphey today:    General Birdwood has been to Salonika and has just received 300 German taken prisoner and passed our Div this morning.  A dull day.  Played poker in the afternoon and came out square on today and yesterday.  Went down to the ruined Belgian barracks for a bath before tea and then went down to open grassland near the gaol and watched our' string' party practice crawling and so on.  Some gun fire, the flashes casting a weird illumination everywhere.  The Tommies practicing too and they blew up a little mine or small bomb near us.  Fellows keen and should make a "do" of it.  C.O. has gone up to front line tonight as we are sending out a party of about 9 to tackle a little post in an old trench in No Mans Land.  Doctor and stretchers also standing by.  This town full of transport at night and crowds of troops moving to and fro.  In this billet tonight are over 1000 men.  What a haul for Fritz if he put a shell circle round &amp; then got his heavies on to the centre of it.  [O.M &amp;I.O?]  come up nightly and have unenviable jobs one way and another.  Doing work every night must pall on them.  Robertson did not return from Blighty when his leave expired and now writes that he happened to strike the bad luck of being stung at Boulogne en route.  The Battalion could do with a month's intense training plenty of hard drill and no fatigues as we have so many green reinforcements who are not like our old proved returns.  My nerve since Pozieres is damnably weak and the screech of a shell overhead causes me to experience a sinking feeling in the stomach.  It was not always thus.  Getting wounded has frightened me surely.  Stayed up late awaiting C.O.  9 of our men went out tonight to bomb a post of Fritz's but found him out.
