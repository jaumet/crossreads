December 1915Deer Vale Dorrigo is pretty sick with jaundice & was sent to hospital  The Infantry attached to us went away & we got a Squadron of the 5th Light Horse over with us.
Monday 13th to Sunday 19thWe were relieved at noon on Monday from Wilson's Outlook where we put in a fairly quiet time.  Except for heavy sniping & machine gun fire on our parapets they attempt little else.  We keep the Jap mortar & the catapults going at intervals.  The week has been generally warm with 2 or 3 chilly snaps which did not last ling.  The one topic of conversation is the evacuation of Anzac & whether it will be successful or not.  Our advance guard has left & we are getting anything we want supplied Dates, porridge, milk, McConochie's rations etc in abundance, also cigarettes matches
