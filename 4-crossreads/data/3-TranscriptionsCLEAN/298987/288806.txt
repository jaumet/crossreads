  
 on an open hill side near a village which is or rather was Hammell there is not much of it left. There is a fine water hole here sort of swamp beside the Somme canall. Have had a fine swim this afternoon. Some were trying to get fish with bombs but did not seem to have any luck. Have been able to post letters first time since we left the North. We are about 3 miles from Corliu.

Bombs as usual & bullets fell in the camp no harm done Am Observation Baloon went past this morning fastened to its truck about 100 ft up There were 5 motors of  different kinds & 60 to 80 men in the turn our - quite a circus.
