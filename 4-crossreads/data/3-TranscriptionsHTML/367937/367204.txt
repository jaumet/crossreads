<p>I have got the films that I took out at the Pyramids developed, and they have come out rather well so I am sending you a some copies of them in this letter and will send the films to the boys in a few days after I have got some more prints off them as Rostron wants to sent some home.  There are two films which I took on the voyage over waiting for me down at Tel el Kebir and there are three films of Alexandria which are to be finished for me this afternoon.<br/>I have some good fun here getting photos sometimes; the other afternoon Rostron and I were walking along the Alexandrian "Sussex Street" and I took a photo of a building there; a nigger policeman saw me and immediately rushed up and wanted me to take him so I took Rostron &amp; him standing together and then he wanted me to give him his photo straight away.<br/>It took over half an hour and about six interpriters to make him understand that it had to be developed first but we promised to give him one in three days and My word! he was pleased.<br/>We have been to two very interesting places lately; they are the Mex and Nouzha gardens; at Mex we saw The Armenian Refugee camps and the salt lakes and the Nouzha gardens are the most lovely I have ever seen: I got some beautiful photos there, one of a zebra and some of the ponds and fountain ought to be jolly good.</p>
