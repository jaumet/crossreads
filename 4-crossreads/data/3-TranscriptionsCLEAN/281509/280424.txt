Issued with steel helmet.Move of from Vadencourt wood not back, but foward still to next village & take over casualty clearing hospital for an indefinite time. "Chatty" blankets. Hunt for a feed, 1/3 rations "no bon". 12 a crowd in tent. Fierce fighting going on foward. Germans shell Albert heavily. Numerous casualties among Australians. Admission to hospital bullet wound in hand self-inflicted.
