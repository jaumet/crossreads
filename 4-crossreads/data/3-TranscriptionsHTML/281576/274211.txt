<p>Mon. May 7.  Last night we had quite settled down to Bunk when Sgt Thomson came &amp; sung out the names of 100  Bearers to be ready to move off at a moments notice &amp; my name was among 'em.  It appears that the casualties among stretcher Bearers is very high &amp; we have to go out to relieve them.  After Tea we had a run through our Programme for tomorrow night at the Reinf Camp.</p>
<p>Tues. May 8.  Our Concert is knocked on the Head.  The 15th F. Amb is coming to relieve us tonight &amp; our crowd are taking over the Main &amp; Advanced Dressing Stations.<br/>Later.  Busy Day packing up &amp; handing over.  Payney, Nick Coxon Jack Edgar &amp; I had a Farewell Gathering in the Mess Hut.</p>
<p>Wed. May 9.  Got up bright &amp; early &amp; fell in at 8.30.  Packed up &amp; fossicked around for Rations.  Had Dinner at 11.30.  Payney, Bricky &amp; I dined in the Canteen.  Fell in at 12.30, boarded motor Lorries &amp; came out to this Main dressing Station, through Poziers &amp; Bapaume.  The country looks much better than it did on my last visit as the grass has grown &amp; covered up the shell holes to a certain extent.  We got a drink of Tea &amp; are to bivouac in the open for tonight &amp; move up to the Line tomorrow.  There are plenty of planes about &amp; its good fun watching 'em.<br/>Glory Halleluyah!  Got 3 Letters 2 from M.S. &amp; 1 from Nell  Good old Blue Eyes.  Your Letters bucked me up fine.</p>
