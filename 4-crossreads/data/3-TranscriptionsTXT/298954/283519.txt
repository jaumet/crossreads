 1917 Wed. 5th Sept. Yesterday I left the hospital and came aft again. 
 She reached the entrance to the Straits safely and all night was busy mine-laying.   "Wolf" laid the most complicated fields &ndash; she would run for 15 minutes and drop a couple of mines &ndash; would then go on again and drop a few more, etc. 
 She laid 110 mines, and it is a field which will not easily be swept up &ndash; last night's work is going to cost many lives. 
 As daylight came on the work was completed and the Germans cheered loudly on deck. 
 The mine-laying did not prevent me from sleeping well &ndash; even the cheers did not wake me. 
 This morning we saw a welcome sight through the holes in the bulkhead, - the mine-chamber was absolutely empty and our chances of being blown kite-high by a single lucky shot from a patrol-boat are much reduced.
