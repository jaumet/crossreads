 Monday 28 May 1917. 
 The hottest day so far. 
 Physical jerks in morning. 
 Saw hundreds of flying fish this morning. 9 to 15 ins. long &amp; wings varying according to size of fish. Wings are really large fins &amp; are transparent. Frightened by boat they&nbsp;(fish)&nbsp;rise 3 or 4 feet above water and fly away from boat for a distance of from 20 to&nbsp;75 or&nbsp;100 yds. when they are no sooner in one wave &amp; out into the crest of the next. 
 &quot;Mock trial&quot; (for bigamy) on the upper deck from 3 pm to 5 pm.&nbsp; 
 Wrote letter this afternoon &amp; missed&nbsp;the&nbsp;trial. 
 Sleeping on deck tonight in deck space allotted to A.C. B .F.A.
