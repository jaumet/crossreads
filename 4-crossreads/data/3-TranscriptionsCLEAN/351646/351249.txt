Last night '&acute;Encounter", "Warrego" & "Parramatta&#148; left to go to sea for two days, and we were in hopes of some fun thinking we were going to attack Koenig Wilhelmshaven, but no go. However, we went off to search all the harbours round New Britain & found a few lovely spots &, as the "Whats-it-matter? went in always by herself, had a shot at alligators on the mud banks as we went by. But this morning unfortunately we found a native who offered to show us where the "Comet" was concealed & we took him on board & prepared for some excitement; she was only a couple of hours run away & just a little better armed than ourselves. We of course reported the news to "Encounter". She was at the time at G.Quarters exercising "action" but immediately ordered us to land Native & join her; she then went full speed in opposite direction to that indicated by native (who spoke English by the way) and made us return to Rabaul !! Gallant Captain Lewin! Leeuwin I believe is Dutch for lion; ours is a mangy beast & can only do circus tricks it seems &#151; or parlour tricks; he found someone unfortunate enough to marry him two days before he sailed; poor girl! Have heard it suggested on board ship that he be entered for next egg laying competition; he might do for an incubator but feel sure he1d never lay an egg try he never so hard! Should like to direct his attention to one of the articles of war which says "Any Commanding Officer who neglects to use every means in his power to bring an enemy's ship into action shall suffer death -- or such punishment as is hereinafter mentioned." Wish we had a real man in command, not a cast-off. "
