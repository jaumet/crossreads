finished my teeth. That's distinctly awkward because I have paid 10 to get the job done and as things stand at present the main job is not finished yet. However I have heard today that there is a good dentist in Minia who is good at his work and I have made out a pass to go into town tomorrow and see what he is like. I hope he can do the job for me. If not I am in an awkward fix indeed the hole in my tooth gets bigger and nearer the gums and it has just taken a fit to ache occasionally & thats no good on active service.
The trumpeter sergeant has just gone out to blow "Last Post" 9.30pm and I thank that will do for tonight
16th February. Thursday 17th Minia.
Two troops and the Machine Gun Sections have gone out on outpost duty to a couple of the surrounding villages and we are to be connected by telephone and heliograph. Later - News of a rather startling nature has just come to hand - We shift tomorrow! Where? Why? Who? Those are the questions uppermost in all minds and the everlasting answer is "Don't know"! 'Wait & see' so to speak.
