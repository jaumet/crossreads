<p>(1041) Saturday June 9. 1917.<br/>It is fine but cloudy to day.<br/>The artillery bombardment lasted all night with varing intensity, and is continued this morning but with less intensity, &amp; appears to be gradually dying down.<br/>The 4th. Division got too far ahead yesterday &amp; were cut badly by our barrage. Our Battalion also suffered the same way. At dinner yesterday there were some 500 &amp; for tea only 86.<br/> There are hundreds wounded but not so great a number killed as one would expect under the circumstances. Most of the casualties are caused by being too eager &amp; getting under our own barrage.<br/>The enemy suffered terrible destruction by our series of mines, &amp;pound 1 million worth of explosives (aminol) being used, the greatest explosion ever known in the areas history. Our aeroplanes also did terrible execution in the trenches, pouring machine guns bullets in the trenches, engaging hostile planes, &amp; dropping bombs.<br/>I have not heard any particulars about Lieut. McNicol or Sgt. Robinson<br/>Haig reports on Thursday 11.5 am "we attacked at 3.10 am this morning the German positions in the Messines Wytschaete Ridge on a front of over 9 miles We have everywhere captured our first objective" from N. of Lee Douve Brook to N. of Mont Sorrel. Up to 4.30 this morning over 5000 prisoners have been brought in "An attempted counter attack was completly broken up by our artillery fire, 9 enemy aeroplanes were brought down &amp; 9 others driven down out of control"</p>
