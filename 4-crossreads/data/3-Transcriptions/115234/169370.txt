<p>six graves.&nbsp; We buried these poor boys where they fell.&nbsp; Perhaps some day, crosses &amp; wreaths may mark their last resting place.&nbsp; Today, a mound of red earth &amp; an empty beer bottle form their sepulchre:&nbsp; Today I stand &amp; gaze in pitying silence&nbsp; Tomorrow I may tenant as hastily scratched <sup>a</sup> grave myself.&nbsp; So do we live veritably from minute to minute, hour to hour &amp; day to day;&nbsp; Good Night &mdash;</p>
