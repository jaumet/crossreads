<p>A Quota on arriving in England would go through something like the following routine:-<br/>On marching in it is met by the G.C.C.Group and the Group Staff Captain, and Standing Orders  and general instructions are issued to the Quota Adjutant. It was laid down that all troops must have their embarkation leave three days after their arrival from Overseas. During this three days the O.C.Quota finds that his men have to [be] issued with fresh clothing, be given their Leave Pay and all applications for Family Ship, Non-Military employment, Discharge in U.K.and Marriage Leave together with five copies of a complete nominal roll of his strength in both alphabetical and lexigraphical order have to be rendered to Group Headquarters. Towards the closing of No 3 Group, it often occurred that Quotas were allotted to a transport before they returned from Leave but in the earlier days this was not so and upon the return of the men there was nothing to do but wait, excepting however the boarding of all men not boarded in France.  A transport was as a rule allotted to a quota some twelve days before the date of sailing and when only seven days were left they were medically examined for Venereal Desease and scabies and ticked off on the Group Roll which was submitted to London. The day following they were paid their Voyage pay. The troops again marched past the M.O. the day immediately prior to embarking and their names were again checked off, this time from the London Roll.  At the same time their kits were inspected by the group G.O.C. or his representative for the purpose of bringing to light any unauthorised Government property or any indecent literature. The Quota finally cleared up its own camp and its O.C.</p>
