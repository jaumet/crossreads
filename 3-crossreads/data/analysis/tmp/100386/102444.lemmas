 Organiz of Bread Suppli . Account Receipt and issu for all Bakeri . British and Australian . I had decid to use an old Australian recip for Yeast in view of the fact , That the suppli had onli Potato to draw on . When British Bakeri arriv the master Baker of 11th . who had 20 year servic was determin to use his own recip regardless of the splendid result we achiev . His effort was a complet failur and 26000 ration were condemn . After that instruct were issu that Yeast suppli would be control by 13th . A.A.S.C. We were fortun I suppos as not one Loaf was condemn bake under my instruct dure the whole of my servic . On one occas the C/O an Imperial Officer told me I would sure get a D.C.M. as Headquart had given definit instruct the Australian Bake Bread "on " was to be suppli to Headquart . I certain thought on one occas I would get a G.C.M. as I neglect dure a shortag to suppli Headquart for two day . Our A.D.S. was a sport and made a joke of it . As a matter of fact our own Camp was on Biscuit at this time . Some of my charg had a larg piec of the Devil in Them . Most of them I suppos , but when it came to a question of loyalti to their comrad in the line , they were veri staunch .
