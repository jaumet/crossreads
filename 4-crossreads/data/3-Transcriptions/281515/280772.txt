<p>care about as they broke two of my teeth trying to chew them while I was at Herbertshohe.  Every time now when the moon is up &amp; full or about full the natives make a great row &amp; dance at nightime they call it sing sing plenty,  Englishman good fellow, plenty Ki Ki he give, they bring along all sorts of things, Fruit, shells, catseyes Bows &amp; arrows &amp; model Catamarangues, (native boats) already they are swarming round the camps not feeling frightened at us one bit, at first they kept their distance &amp; seemed afraid of us but when we treated them well they got quite bold.</p>
<p>Sept 30th<br/>Out of Couriousity I visited a native village to see their dances etc, it was very interesting to see them working themselves into a sort of slow movements until they seemed to be completely out of breath  I visited the Calabush (Prison) where they had some prisoners one they told me was a canabal so they kept him under lock &amp; key for safety The Women are called mary's &amp; if a chap wants a wife he can buy one for &pound; 5 and she has to work for him all her life, if in the ordinary way as we do it by love etc he can divorce as many as he likes it is a great crime to steal one anothers maries</p>
<p>Oct 1st<br/>just about this time there is a great deal of stealing going on, Houses &amp; Stores being broken open by our men who getting so much time on their Hands try &amp; find something else to do &amp; shake up things in general</p>
