<p>Fri. Jan.3 (cont.)<br/>After Tea we passed a pleasant Hour in a Picture Show near the Alhambra. Quite the best I was ever in. There was a fine Pipe Organ &amp; somebody could play it real good. The "Bing Boys" was good, but not so good as I expected. I have seen shows equally as good in Sydney &amp; Melbourne (to my mind, anyhow). George Robey is very funny &amp; Violet [indecipherable]<br/>is real good too. What struck me was that there was not a decent singer in the whole Show. V. [indecipherable] sang a very fine song "The old Love" but she had not a very good voice. As usual it was raining, but we were lucky enough to get a train. Had supper before returning.<br/>Sat. Jan. 4. Had Break at War Chest. It is easily the best place (for a man of limited means) in London to get a feed. After Break strolled around City. Saw changing of Guard at Whitehall. Imposing, but useless ceremony. Raining , of course. It is muchh lighter in the City at night than in the day time, now that the Lights are permitted.</p>
<p>Jan.4.(cont.) In London on 4 days Leave.<br/>London is full of soldiers, &amp; it's difficult to get a seat at a Threatre or obtain a Bed, &amp; the Restaurants always seem to be crowded. Went to Coliseum at night. Good show. Very fine orchestra. Max Rarewski conductor.<br/>Several first class items. One Performing Seal was really marvellous. It was almost human. The Russian Ballet is [indecipherable] a lot, but I didn't care for it much.<br/>Jan 5. Sunday. Attended morning Service at Westminster Abbey. The singing was beautiful but the service was dry as dust. No wonder people don't attend Church; the Services are so monotonous &amp; dreary. On my way to Dinner met Bill [indecipherable] so I hopped on to a Train &amp; went &amp; had dinner with him at a place in "the Strand". They charged us 4/6 each, &amp; I was still hungry. Being Sunday there was not much doing, so we went for a stroll down "Petticoat Lane" &amp; saw some really remarkable Bargains. Bill bought a pair of kid Gloves for 8/-.</p>
