daughters Miss Adelaide & Lilly invited me out for the Afternoon for a walk which I was pleased to accept. We were not long out before another young lady joined us & the four of us walked along the Embankment a beautiful Walk which was crowded with People, we turned up some Road & soon was in The Strand . This place was also crowded with beautiful Ladies dressed in beautiful Clothes as it was a lovely Summer Afternoon The Strand was crowded & every body looked a their best. I thoroughly enjoyed the Walk with the young Ladies who were Charming Companions. After taking a Train we eventually arrived at King's Cross Road & upstairs to my Friend's Home. People living in Flats was very strang to me. This House was 5 families  5 Flats each occupied by a Family it is built on the Top of the Tube
