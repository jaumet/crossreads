2/9/17 Campagne
Sunday. Left Major Matthews in charge of the Church parade and went down to Bde HQ	 with Stewart to conference of Battalion Commanders Adjutants and argued there until 1pm then riding home. Polygon Wood is going to be a well known name to us soon and today the maps that are the forerunners always of a move forward came to hand. A fine day. Received orders to carry on a stunt for General Plumer on Wednesday next and will have to get the orders out. Slept during part of the afternoon. After mess lectured to all of the officers on what I have heard today and then had a long yarn with Sgt. Bill Green D.C.M. who came down for the evening from the 24th. Being the night after pay there are few loud and bibulous voices to be heard in the highways and hedges. ?Excessive drinking will be your trouble you Colonials? said Plumer addressing some of ours at a school of instruction. Davis back from Paris.
