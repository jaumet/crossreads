<p>thought I may be hurled into Eternity, but I can honestly say I was <strike>not</strike> no more afraid than if I had been at home.  Well ultimately we landed.  These people on the drome saw our position, the ambulance rushed out to the spot they calculated we would hit, &amp; awaited results.  As soon as we hit, the propellor went into a thousand pieces, and the machine was smashed to matchwood.  I was in the pilot's seat in front, but my safety belt saved me, &amp; we crawled out with only a couple of scratches &amp; a shaking up between the two of us.  I was granted 3 days leave to get over it, and had a very pleasant time at home with Elsie who also managed to get some time off.<br/>I have been flying again since, &amp; had 1 &frac12; hours in the air solo today.  I am pushing forward with various aerial tests I have to do, &amp; hope to have my commission by the end of this month.<br/>No letters from home since I last wrote, but I hope no news is good news.<br/>We are very comfortable here at present, and the food etc is very decent.<br/>Must close now, Father dear, with love to you all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
