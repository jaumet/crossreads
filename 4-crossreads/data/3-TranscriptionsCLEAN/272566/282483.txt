  
 Friday 9 February 
 Arrived Southampton at sunrise.  Luckily got off the boat early enough to catch the first train arriving at Waterloo Station London at 11 a.m.  Tea & cake and French money changed on the platform, Com. Bank & A.I.F. Headquarters.  Dinner at War Chest Fund rooms opposite A.I.F. Headquarters.  Put up at Imperial Hotel Russel Square.  Out for tea elsewhere and afterwards went to the Hippodrome Theatre to see Zig-Zag - Very Fine Indeed.  It's a treat in bed tonight with our heads sunk into the pillows, quite a change from that wretched France.
