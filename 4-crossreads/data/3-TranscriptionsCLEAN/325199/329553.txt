We were allotted to various Houses before dinner, 3 pioneers in each house along with a platoon of B. company. Our House is No 14 & it's accommodating 30 men. There is plenty of room & tables for writing. 
  Tuesday  Thursday July 27. 1916. A hot steamy day, most unpleasant. I was drilling with B. Company. Paraded sick this evening as I had a sore throat & chest. [Following shorthand is not transcribed.]
