  
 Saturday 8 December 1917 
  Malta  still. We visited the underground vaults of grain & forage 7 years supply as Malta has little good  soil  in fact years ago every ship had to buy a certain amount of  soil  as Harbour dues. 
 Then we went to St. Paul's Cathedral in the old Capital 8 miles by rail. Cette Vecchia or NOTABILE or MEDINA according to the Arab reign or Spain. The Paintings & Marble Statuary etc. is beyond anything I have ever seen. Not least interesting was one of the Silver Crosses of the Crusaders brought from Jerusalem. 
 Outside the Children were making the Malta lace, with PINS & wooden bobbins, a quaint country of BELLS, SMELLS, & YELLS. Many Churches & much cruelty to animals.  Went Opera again Rigoletto.
