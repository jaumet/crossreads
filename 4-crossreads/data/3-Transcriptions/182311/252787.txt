<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday - and such a Sunday too, as I sit in my hut I hear the wind howl and whine right off the plains.&nbsp; I have just been out for half-an-hour&#39;s walk, inspecting the sentries and I&#39;ll have to do it again after 11 p.m. tonight, so I&#39;ll be able to send you quite a long letter this time.&nbsp; I hope you will have time to read it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday we had quite a nice afternoon visiting Earl Radnor&#39;s castle. L<s>a</s><sup>o</sup>ngford Castle is its name, and it is distant about three miles from Salisbury; while passing through this town we heard that only on&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday is it open to visitors, we felt disappointed but decided to try and get in, so hired a noble looking car off the rank and proceeded to cover the three miles to the Castle; arrived at the lodge we tootled our horn, the lodge keeper opened the gate and saluted respectfully, then for quite half a mile we drove along a path through the park until flanked by noble trees, Longford Castle was seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We drew up in front of the main entrance in great style and the Captain Lansell asked me to negotiate the Entrance by saying - &quot;You have the most cheek&quot; of course I wouldn&#39;t move until he amended it - &quot;You are the most resourceful&quot; that was enough, with due attention to swank, cane, gloves, etc. I summoned the maid, sent in my card and found that being officers <sup>we</sup> were permitted to enter.</p>
