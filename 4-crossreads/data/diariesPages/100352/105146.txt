Breakfast. Mutton tea bread (usually) extremely useful for killing porpoises, 
Dinner Mutton bread (but no tea) 
Supper Mutton tea bread.
The monotony of the course was somewhat relieved by plum duff (just as weighty as the before mentioned bread) for dinner tinned herring for tea.
The monotony of the daily routine was also relieved by the news that a sailor lost 10 at "banker", that an individual (whether sailor or soldier we do not know) was captured as a spy just as he threw the sights of one of our 4.7s over board. He was removed to the "Sydney" where in all probability he will be shot. Lucky dog!
