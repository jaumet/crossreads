  
 Nothing we do can ever die: All that we have seen & heard, Every moment we have known, Every dream, and deed, & word, Growing one with memory Is embedded in the brain; Often when we are alone We must live it all again: Often through the dark I see A puppet stage, a shadow play And phantoms acting wearily The tragedies of yesterday:- 
 Alec Waugh "Introspections" 
 July 1 238. Commences July, and a hot, sun beating silent day, and till this evening on new defense scheme maps of M.G. barrages. 
 Today I covenant with myself to break away from my mind the feverous accumulations of poison and disease:  my sins have been against myself, and they have fed a stranger within myself, lately I have come to know him. 
 So I covenant to school my senses, my imagination and my brain, and strangely the most difficult schooling will be my quick irritation at Tom's maps, windiness, and his anxiety to see always great sheets of details growing before each draftsman. 
 So I covenant to clear my body, my mind and my soul, that dying I may look the deed in the face. 
 Christ God hold this blackness that I may lose it.
