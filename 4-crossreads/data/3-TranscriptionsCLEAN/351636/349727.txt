 Dear Mr. Horsfield, Could you help Mrs. Chippendall who is in difficulties owing to debts & whose husband has not left her an allotment. This is being enquired into but is evidently a complicated case & there has been much delay over it. We are enquiring with it now. 
 If you could give a little temporary relief I should be glad as she seems in need of clothing. 
 Yours truly B. Booth -
