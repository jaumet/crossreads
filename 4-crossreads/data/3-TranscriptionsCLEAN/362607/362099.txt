Dear George,We expect to arrive at Adelaide tomorrow  &  Sydney about 21st July or after. Most likely after, The sea is very calm but this boat is infinitely worse than the Kuring-gai for rolling. Gee! I'm fed up with rolling about. I have not been sick once but it is very uncomfortable.Will see you soon Boy  Love Harry
