hospital are wounded, accidental or Self-Inflicted. These men have got to pass before a board of inquiry to prove whether their wounds have been caused by accident or have been self-inflicted. If they have been caused by gross carelessness or by self-inflicted intentionally they are sent to a camp there to be tried and probably find that they get imprisonment for anything up to two years imprisonment.

Some men wound themselves in the hand, or the foot, in order to get out of the fighting line. It never seems to occur to them that they will be found out, but the fact of the matter is very few escape without punishment.

Often I have seen men brought into the C.C.S. wounded and by there whole attitude they have given themselves away. When one looked at their wounded limb one felt instinctively that they had been self-inflicted especially if it happened to be in the hand or foot. Often if the shot had been fired at close quarters there would be the black smoke mark around the entrance to the wound. Some dodges were tried to obirate this such as putting oneâ€™s hand above the parapet or contriving to make the bullet pass through a tin of Bully Beef before it entered the hand or foot.
