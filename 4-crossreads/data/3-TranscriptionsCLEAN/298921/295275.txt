  
 October, 1915 Sunday 31 Find that while Blankets are best they show the Fleas up, we are simply eaten with them when colder we may get relief - Bullets shells Church service today in Shrapnel Gully x Later a swim in the sea - on a clear morning we can see the Bulgarian Coast, no doubt some extra artillery will come along from there ere long. Did I mention [indecipherable] Fetherstonshaugh & his Squadron is attached to us & he lives only 10 yards away. A new name has been coined in the Trench viz posie, short for Position, i.e. for dug out fire position, everyone uses it, also Pukkah for instance. X  my rank of Capt at present is only Actg not yet in Orders X later when confirmed it will be a Pukkah Capt.
