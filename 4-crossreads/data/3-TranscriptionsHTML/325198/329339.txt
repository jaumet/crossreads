<p>[Contd. from page 154]<br/>Our arguments continue till tea time<br/>On subjects we all know about<br/>And during the noise amidst all the boys<br/>Old Pippo starts yelling [indecipherable]</p>
<p>But although we argue &amp; argue<br/>And that to only one thing all agree<br/>Which is of course &amp; that I think you'll endorse<br/>That we'll soon be "civvies" &amp; free</p>
<p>So here health to Australia &amp; England<br/>And a curse to the bumper of war<br/>And that Mothers &amp; sisters &amp; sweethearts are happy<br/>Is the wish of the Permanent Four</p>
