at 4.30 p.m.  Left the boys at there ward & then met Dorothy & we left about 5 p.m. for Cairo.  I tried to get a Panama but they are all sold out.  We have a regulated band & panama hat now for out-door uniform but I have to still wear my old one -
We had dinner in Cairo & came back early about 8.30 p.m. & went to bed.  Slept very soundly.
When I arrived here Sunday found 2 or three letters for me but none from home.  Anyhow to-day I received two Nos. 24 & 26.  Alice & Ethel's, so I am very delighted.  Have had a lovely lot of letters to-day.  One from poor old Keith, written on a Hospital Ship but he did not know where he was going - thought England - but will write and let me know.  A lovely lot of bags to hang onto the patients beds from Mrs. Boynes, so I have given all my patients one & they were very delighted & asked me to thank my friend
