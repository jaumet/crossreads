<p>to try &amp; improve sleeping conditions in the tents, the first parade could hardly by called a full muster.</p>
<p>In the afternoon however men were detailed off to proceed to the Hun trench &amp; collect a supply of duck boards. As many men as possible "jumped in" to do this work, as it would practically mean putting a good floor in each of the 8 tents for each Company but although B C &amp; D Coy's were allowed to so use the duck boards, A Coy had to place them outside the tents to form a walk from the Orderly Room tent to the end of the line in order (as the men put it) so that the officers could walk along the line of tents without getting their beautiful boots covered with mud.</p>
<p>A Coy had then to collect from the Hun trench any old clothes or blankets to spread over the tent floor upon which to place the oilsheets to prevent the mud oozing over them, when slept upon.</p>
<p>So anxious were A Coy men to have a real good wash both of body &amp; clothes &amp; so anxious were they to avoid being so zealous about work, with the previous days result, for the first day or two most of the men would clear out of camp just after breakfast &amp; proceed to the ruins of Ligny-Thilloy there to light a fire, wash, shave &amp; rest.</p>
<p>Many of the men would not go back till dark knowing it only meant being put on to some totally unnecessary work under NCOs, while the officers loafed in their tents. The men had seen enough of this sort of thing. Work essential Yes!, but work just to "keep fit" when the officers do no "keeping fit" work No!. In the charge where were they? Were they first up to the Hun wire? If so it is strange A Coy men did not notice them! They certainly would have "heard" them!</p>
<p>During these days the Sentry had been ordered to lie in his tent till the Doctor returned from the Aid post. The morning after his arrival, on Sick parade 131 reported unfit for duty including the Sentry concerning the latter the Sergt explained how he had been for months working on &amp; in front line AMC</p>
