<p>I have been thinking of getting you all over here but there is so much uncertainty as to how long we are likely to be here that for the present at any rate I think it will be best to do nothing in the matter.   The climate here is beautiful just now this hotel is very comfortable &amp; I'm sure you would have a grand time here but it would be very awkward if when you got here we received orders to move off to France or somewhere else.  I even went so far as to select rooms for you all at this hotel and was planning all sorts of things to be done when I met all my dear ones once more, but just at present I think it will be best for you to stay where you are.<br/>I met General Williams the head of the medical services in Egypt</p>
