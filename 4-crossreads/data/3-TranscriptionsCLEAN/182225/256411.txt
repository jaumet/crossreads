OCTOBER   THURSDAY 19   1916
Fine & warm. The 3rd Division Artillary went out & did some work as a division but I believe it was not up to much. I was on ration fatigue with Bill Hunter but went out for a ride as horse holder to Col Richards as he made his inspection of the camps. Went & had a look at the concert (9AMC) in YMCA at night. I forwarded 5 papers 3 letters & a parcel on to Poss.
