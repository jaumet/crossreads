  
 hospital ship came, to take patients from there to England - They had to Staff the boat. Glad I was not one chosen to stay there. Want to get to England as soon as possible. Fondest love & kisses to you all, shall write again before we land. Am very well & feel much better for the rest. We are not working on board. Hope you are all well.
