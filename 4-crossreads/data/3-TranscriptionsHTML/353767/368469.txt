<p>were on our way through the Red Sea we were calmly &amp; politely informed by the Brigadier that all previous arrangements had been cancelled &amp; that were going to Egypt to relieve the regulars in order to enable them to be sent to the Front.  From the above you will see that I had two good reasons for not at once informing you of my joining.  In the first place had I been rejected well that would have been the end if it &amp; in the second place I though I would be better able to explain things in person than by letter, as however we are not going to England it is impossible for me to see you in person (for the present at all events) that being the case I must do the best I can by letter.</p>
<p>I don't mind admitting that not only myself but all hands are extremely disappointed at being sent to Egypt for that means we shall see nothing at all of actual warfare but instead will have to take the place of the Regulars &amp; garrison Egypt.  Had we been informed in the first place that we were not going to the Front I doubt whether they would have got a tenth of the men they wanted.  Speaking for myself I know that I would never have turned in my billet &amp; spent about 18 or 20/- in train fares etc. had I known that we would not be sent to the front.  However I reckon "it is of no use crying over spilt milk" &amp; the only thing one can do is to take it all in good part &amp; hope that we shall either be relieved by another Force</p>
