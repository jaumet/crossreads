Five bob a day they told youWould be your daily legal payBut they knocked you down to two bob boysT'is just their usual waySave your money
8 Don't fill your guts with luxuries7 At the hill Robbery Co8 Go buy a tin of polish, Boys6 And give the heads a showJust think of the grub you're gettingAnd the duff you never seeBuckle your belt up tighter boysBuy a tin of the great KiwiBut always turn out neat
