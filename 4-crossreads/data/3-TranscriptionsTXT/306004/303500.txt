 28.8.16 Mon 28th Had some lamp practice last night; Neither of the Jeffries were tried today &amp; I think Freds case must fall through, the Adj gave orders to place both under arrest, &amp; he cannot find a charge against Fred as he was in the vicinity of the Camp all day yesterday &amp; altho' he was merry was far from drunk, Capt White (Adj) has been waiting to catch both of them. It is said that we are going to   Sity   Sidi Beach (Alexandria) for a few days spell in batches shortly, but we hear so many rumors we cannot take any notice of them; had some more Lamp practice again tonight, &amp; have orders for a 5.30 reveille every morning &amp; have to do 1 hours drill
