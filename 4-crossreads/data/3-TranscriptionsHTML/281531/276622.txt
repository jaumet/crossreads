<p>16/8/18<br/>Herleville<br/>Stayed in bed until as late as noon when Sale came in with word of a hopover to be carried out in a couple of days. They are relieving an English division with the 5th Division. Truly they are trying our Corps to breaking point. The Boche stuck repeated bursts over on us here and landed several 5.9's bang up against our door and put out the candles. Went down to the 23rd Bn and saw Colonel Brazenor about a few details of the advance and made mutual arrangements with him. As we returned we had a few shells quite close enough for anything but we managed to dodge the pieces. A Vickers gun officer called and I detailed his action.</p>
