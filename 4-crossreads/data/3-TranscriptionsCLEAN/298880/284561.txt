  
 13th Dec. 
 We handed everything over to the 56th Bn in good order. They were pleased at being able to speak so plainly to the companies in the front line. Their luck was out however, as I believe the line on the right was broken soon after we left. We put in a rotten night that night trying to get some sleep in dugouts which were in reality waterholes I lost my boots and puttees & so did several others and didn't the Q.M.S. roar when I told him. He gave me a new pair though. We picked up our packs again at Bernafay camp and came on to Montaubau huts where we soon got a fire going & made ourselves comfortable.
