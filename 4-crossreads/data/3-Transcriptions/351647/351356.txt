<p>just now.  They are like yours, a very varied lot.</p>
<p>We have cricket matches &amp; football (going out fast weather too hot) &amp; feats of strength &amp; agility.  I don't take part, I sit &amp; watch &amp; make ribald remarks as per usual.</p>
<p>I have no news at all, things are much quieter here but anyhow you'll know more about it than me.  Nearly all our crowd are out &amp; away, we are the last, the <u>un</u> lucky last.  I shall be thankful &amp; glad to get away &amp; hope we never come back here &amp; so does every one.  We've had rather a rotten time.</p>
<p>Fritz is rather annoying at times, he splashes his little souvenirs round at odd times.  I sometimes lie in bed &amp; listen to them coming over &amp; landing about quite handy.  I don't quite like it.  Still we have astonishing luck &amp; its marvellous how little damage &amp;c. he causes.</p>
<p>You know that picture of Bainsfather, [Bairnsfather] "My dream for years to come", well that's me, only I'm in a tent.</p>
<p>Do you remember Ted Watkins, he seems to know you, he is in the Battery, you'll know which one I mean &amp; I like him.  He's quite well up in books &amp; music &amp; we swap literature.</p>
