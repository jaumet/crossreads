I have a return of the beastly rheumatics in the knees   Every night without fail I am awakened with the awful twinging, almost forcing a groan out of me.  As soon as I can get to a chemist I will fix myself up with amm. tinct: of giucum guiacum.When up before the Medical Board this morning, I was given a good overhaul & classed B1 A2.  I was recommended for 8 weeks light duties & have put in an application for the job of hospital orderly on an Australian Transport.  Strange to say they are short of men (A.M.C) who have had at least 6 months service in France, & also men of hospital experience; as I can fulfil both of these demands I hope my application will be successful.  It is thus faintly possible I may be [text missing] to N.S.W. before many months are out.I have a fairly heavy cold on me at present & a bit of an attack of laryngitis, but otherwise I am keeping A1.  Weather here fine but very, very cold.Must close now, with love to Walter, & all at home,Your loving son,Leo.My last mail from home was dated about 3rd October received two months ago.  Expect there is a bunch of letters about for me somewhere.  Keep to the old address.  Leo.
