  
 You must understand this was an attack after the primary surrender of Herbertshoe - a threatened recapture of the town by German & Native police  -  They surrendered in time because they'd have got little quarter  -  Now I've heard more about the fight at Kabakaul - the fight for the wireless station & why we lost men & officers  -  There was no preliminary shelling of the Bush & too few men were used on the job  -  Resistance was not anticipated  -  There was a road up to the Station & dense bush on either side - very dense jungle with high leafy trees  -  I send a diagram  - 
 [diagram]  Later  NB They don't seem to have gone up the side  -  Elwell stepped into the road & was shot - anyone on the road was shot 
 You see the Beach & the road up to the station from the beach  -  The N  Brigade & our Tommies deployed & went up the road at the double  -  Presently they came to wire entanglements & a trench & then they were met by a hail of lead from behind & above & if the niggers had been white men, few out of our crowd wd have come out alive  -  Niggers cant shoot like the GI rifle club chaps can - shot high but all the same our men fell thickly & fast  -
