 9.4.16 Church Parade this morning at 11.30 A.M. but as we had our horses to do we were excused and I was glad as it saved us changing into our uniforms. We expected to be off for the afternoon but much to our disgust we were ordered to exercise our horses and there were rumours of strikes etc but nothing came of it. I attended my first church service to-night an impromptu affair in which was much hymn singing and then an address. It was rather queer especially when various men were asked to get up and sing as solos popular hymns.

One man who was sitting watching the proceedings was asked by a none too popular officer to go in but he refused as he had one bath already that day and when asked again he said he had a cold and later on when he was taken to the doctor his temperature was over 100 however he was arrested and to-day I believe is to be brought before a court martial. last night I had to turn in early with the rain as it was so heavy and got some of my blankets wet and this afternoon we had all our blankets examined and the wet ones put out to dry as there is a decided chance of malaria if one gets a chill owing to the humidity of the air.
