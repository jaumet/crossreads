 1915 Oct. 1 Fri. Kept pretty busy all day to-day. Received several letters from Australia including one which informed me, as I had previously suspected, that the A.S.M. was not capable of taking charge of my Troop of Scouts , &amp; further that he was unpopular with the boys &ndash; Sorry to hear this. Had a visit from Ben. Champion &amp; Art. Felton who are still in camp here in Egypt. My promotion to Sergeant (see under Nov. 12th) dates from to-day.
