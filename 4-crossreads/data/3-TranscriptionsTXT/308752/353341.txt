 Tuesday 6th June. Orders today that all extra clothes or comforts etc. such as socks balaclava caps, mufflers, waistcoats etc. etc. were to be returned. Hundreds of these articles were  burnt , I think it was a great sin to [indecipherable] such an action, the poor Belgians or Servians or even the people living in the slums of Sydney would have been greatly pleased with these fine comforts. It was a great shame to see all the good work of our mothers &amp; sisters etc. treated as a heap of rubbish. One item was noticed,  none of the officers comforts were to be found when this order was given out.  
 By some unforeseen reason our departure from Egypt has been postponed. The Brigade was supposed to entrain tonight. We may not go for a fortnight or a month. It is very disheartening to think that we will still have to endure this stifling heat for a considerable length of time. Especially as almost every afternoon about the same time we have been greeted with horrible &amp; discomforting sandstorms. The heads are disgusted also. From now till we get orders to leave the Division will be given a well earned rest. 
 Wednesday 7th June. Our well earned rest starts off with a route march in full marching order,  packs  also carried. It has been decided to hold Divisional Sports on the following Tuesday. Our Brigade sports held on Saturday 10th inst. Ambulance well represented the competitors keeping the good name of the A.M.C. to the fore. Our Transport Section obtaining first prize for the best turned out limber. 
 Sunday 11th June. Memorial Services in honour of Lord Kitchener. Capt. Ward conducted the ceremony. Jack Jordan just arrived with reinforcements for the 30th Battalion. We looked very well but is extremely lucky to miss nearly 7 months training in the desert.
