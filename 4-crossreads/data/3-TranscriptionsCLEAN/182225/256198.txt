 FEB.   SATURDAY 12 1916 
 Fine most of the day, but there was a few misty showers. Got away from camp early & had breakfast at the Metropole. Met Linda & Jo at the Stores at 11 oclock & had morning tea with them. They came back to Lisheen to dinner & I went up to T.K.S for afternoon  It was Commemoration day there & I saw a lot of old mates. It seems very funny to go up there & see fellows that were at the prep in my time amongst the Old Boys now. Was back at Lisheen for tea. Linda & I took Jo over to meet the Allison's after tea & she went to "So Long Letty" with them
