<p>When marching at night any obstacle is passed back to those in rear to keep them wary. Our tired chaps tottering along the road towards camp one night. One &ndash; nearly done was muttering all the time. "Mind the wire, mind the wire!" &ndash; the b-wire was round his own feet and he had been dragging it for miles.<br/>Bob Smith to a Colonel:- Take your &ndash; mob to &ndash; out of this."<br/>Col:- I beg your pardon Sir.<br/>BS- Take your &ndash; rabble to &ndash; out of this and b-b-h someone else's show. Is that plain!!!<br/>A funny sound like a joke out of eternity</p>
