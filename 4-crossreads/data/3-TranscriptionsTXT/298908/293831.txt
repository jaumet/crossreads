have said before, the reasons I am keeping on the straight track is on account of a girl who lives many miles from this country.I think I am about the only financial member of our hut the rest are totally broke, but thanks to Mr. Duke I am well cashed up.
4th.  This morning turned out gloriously but at 12 oclock up came the rain it looked as if it had set in but luckily about 2 oclock it cleared up nicely & I went down to the Tram terminus to meet Miss Nissen who was coming out.  We went for a stroll down towards Tamerton Foliote.  This is out in the country & it is a very nice little walk.  I took my camera out & got a few snaps.  We came back to town again about 6 oclock & went into Genoles a high class restaurant for dinner.  We had olives, soup, fish, pheasant, tart & custard, cheese bread & butter port wine & coffee, cost was just on 1.  I suppose lots of people will say how extravagant
