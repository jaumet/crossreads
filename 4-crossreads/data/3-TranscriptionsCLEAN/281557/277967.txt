Continued     (4) How I won the V.C.
Just a bayonet stab through the gizzard& a crack from a bullet ot two.But I nerved my strength for the conflict& just as the darkness came downI was under their parapet resting& knew I had beaten them brown.For this was the scheme I had worked onTwas a little bit mean you will sayBut I knew that the turks were half famished& fought on a biscuit a day.& the tins of Fray Bento's I carriedI chucked in the trench then & there.as I heard the poor beggars pounce on itI knew they were caught in the snare.Next morning broke calm & peacefulWhat a shame that we soldiers must fightTwas a pitious scene met my visionwith the first rosy quivers of lightWhen I peeped in the trench not a turk sirwas left of that legion accurstFor they'd whacked the Fray Bento's between them
& each man had perished from thirst.
Thats my tale & if you know our mob sirYou'll know how our Colonel can smileHe said to me Pte Juggin'sYou've dished up the beggars in stylePromotion! some say I deserve it.But thats really nothing to me.I don't want honour or glorybut thats how I win the V.C.
