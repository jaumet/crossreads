<p>March 1917<br/>16th continued   &amp; all the infantry here in reserves are "Standing to"<br/>17th.   St Patricks Day to-day.   Fritz has cleared out!   There has not been a shell fired over here all day, &amp; rumours have been running wild.   During the afternoon we got the news that the Australians have occupied Bappaume, Boulencourt &amp; a few other small villages &amp; that the 8th &amp; some of the 14th Brigades shared the honours of being first in the villages.<br/>Le Transloy which was captured by the 29th Division (Tommies) &amp; lost a few days later, was also entered by the 14th &amp; some of the 15th Brig</p>
