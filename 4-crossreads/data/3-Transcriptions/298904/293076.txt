<p>our boat was heavily guarded against submarine surprise for we had about a 100 sentries on guard &amp; dozens of machine guns ready for a go &amp; one 4.7.gun.<br/>Our food was not to good,  &amp; many were the complaints about it, our officers kicked up a row about it &amp; done all they could for us but they found out that we were getting Imperial rations &amp; they couldn't alter it . I pity the poor Tommies if they don't feed them any better than that, we never had a bit of jam the whole way over &amp; the cheese was nearly always rotten the boys used to count the tucker out nearly every meal time &amp;</p>
