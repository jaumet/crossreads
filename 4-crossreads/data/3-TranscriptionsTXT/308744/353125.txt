 dense low lying clouds. Frequently the reconnaissance machines had to fly at very [low] altitudes below the clouds, to gather the information they were seeking.  Their trips usually involved flights of from 150 to 200 miles and took them from 50 to 70 miles behind the enemy's line.  The territory reconnoitred during the two months referred to extended to AFULE in the North; AMMAN and KISSIR in the East, thence down the Hedjaz Railway to KUTRANI and ET TAFILE, South East of the DEAD SEA. The whole of this country was closely reconnoitred. 
 KUTRANI, which was a fairly important station on the Hedjaz Railway, and the Headquarters of the Turkish Force operating against the Arabs in that locality was first reconnoitred early in February, and bombed on several occasions later in the month. This entailed a flight of 200 miles over the most desolate and rugged country, peopled in part by Arab tribes who were notorious for their treachery. It is scarcely necessary to say, therefore, that this was not a very popular neighbourhood with our Airmen. 
 In addition to all enemy dispositions throughout the whole of this area, all roads, railways, caravan routes and tracks were closely reconnoitred and fully reported upon by our Observers, who from time to time received the congratulations of General Headquarters upon the complete and accurate information they furnished. 
 On January 17th, while out on a reconnaissance in the neighbourhood of NABLUS,  one  of our Bristol Fighters &ndash; Lieut. L. Potts (Pilot) and Lieut. F. Hancock (Observer) &ndash; encountered two formations of Albatross Scouts, one of five machines below, and the other of three above them. The three above  showed no inclinations to attack. The Bristol Fighter thereupon dived on the rear machine in the lower formation and after a good burst from the forward gun, the enemy machine was seen to turn over on its back and go down completely out of control.  All the enemy aircraft broke off the engagement. ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE. The regularity with which our machines flew over the coastal sector, and the AFULE, JORDON and AMMAN areas, soon began to alarm the enemy. He was not long in realizing the futility of relying upon his flying service to drive off our inquisitiblr machines, and accordingly resorted to other means in an endeavour to obtain some means of protection against this persistent observation. This took the form of intensified Anti-Aircraft Fire. Several new batteries were brought to the front and installed at various points, while the batteries that were already 'covering' his main defence systems, Railway stations and other places of military importance, were noticeably strengthened. In addition, a number of mobile Anti-Aircraft guns, mounted on motor lorries, made their appearance. It was their special duty to patrol the main roads and devote their attention to any of our machines that might venture along these routes. This new departure was apparently entered upon in the hope of protecting troops on the move against aerial attacks; but subsequent events showed that the crews mobile guns were no better able to withstand the determined onslaught of our machines, than the men in other arms of the service. On frequent occasions they were observed to abandon their guns and join the other forces attacked, in their search for cover. 
 The Anti-Aircraft Batteries for the most part were manned by Austrian and German gunners, whose shooting at times was 'uncomfortably' accurate. Batteries were installed at AMMAN, HERICHO, HUWARA, TULKERAM, MESSUDIEF and KALKILEH, while one or two guns were discovered from time to time, operating from other points which the enemy desired to screen from the searching 'eye' of our reconnaissance machines. 
 The "Hottest' corner was probably around TULKERAM and KALKILEH, where several of our machines were hit by Anti-Aircraft fire. During each of these successive flights over this area, Lieut. Fraser's machine was hit, in one instance the damage being such as to necessitate the renewal of two of the planes. On two occasions Lieut. Kenny's machine was damaged by fragments, while, during a low reconnaissance carried out by Lieut. A.R. Brown escorted by Capt. S.W. Addison, both machines were hit in several places. Capt. Addison's machine was shot through the lower main spar, the tail plane and one wheel, while Lieut. Brown's port extension and tail
