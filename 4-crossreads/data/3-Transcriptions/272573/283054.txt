<p>off Anzac. Apparently our O.C. and Adjutant were ashamed of us. They seemed to be fully dressed themselves to go to church but they handed over the parade to one of inferior rank and went back to their tent.</p>
<p>Capt Dexter gave the address.</p>
<p>Two troopships crowded with troops passed up the Canal this afternoon. One of them was the "Kyarra" the ship that I came over from Aust &ndash; with. Not being a Hospital ship this time she was painted black and she had still the same old list to one side.</p>
<p>The "Corsican" passed down the Canal loaded with "Tommies". They are on their way to Bombay.</p>
<p>More Light Engines and waggons have been put on the light railway which goes away out into the desert to the trenches.</p>
<p>The rumour goes at present that two million pounds are to be spent on the Sinai side of the canal in fortifications.</p>
<p>Stretcher bearer to the canal, patients evacuated in barges to the hospital at Ismaelia.</p>
<p>Feb 14th. Mon.<br/>Very showery weather. Food is pretty good at present. A regular supply is being brought up in the ration boat on the canal.</p>
<p>More troopships passed up to-day.</p>
<p>Met R.P. &amp; H who came down from Tel-el-Kibir with No 1 F. Amb.</p>
<p>Full dress parade. Letters read from the "K nuts with Red Tape" regarding discipline amongst the troops or rather the lack of discipline. They might as well read them to the moon for all the difference they will make</p>
