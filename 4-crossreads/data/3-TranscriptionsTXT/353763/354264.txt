& some dropping beer bottles on the pavement - smash finish  -  Several of them fell off the pier into the harbor & had to be fished out - sobered  -  The fleet was enjoying its 'ruddy' self I can tell you  -  The pubs did a roaring trade  -  Evy  -  place was chock a block & beer in Suva ran low  -  The whole show was very funny  -  Of course pickets were out to look after the men  -  I saw one chap quite oblivious to eveythg including the fleet & gently tended by two native police till he got better  -
I saw an officer of the pickets courting a nice young girl while his men drank & roared  -  The officers have a vy  blind eye on these occasions  -  I saw another officer with spots of blood all over his white jacket & he informed us that a stoker was going to smash his (the officer's) buddy nose but he smashed the stoker & got splashed doing so  -
