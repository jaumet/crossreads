<p>Apart from the special devotions on Friday services are also held every day 6 a.m. 12 noon, 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.</p>

<p>The second largest mosque in the world is the Mohammed Aly Mosque which is at the highest part of the Citadel.  Before going into the Mosque proper, at the place where the Mohomadeans wash their hands and feet there is a clock said to have been placed there by Napoleon.  This part of the mosque had no roof over it.  Going into the part where devotions are held we found it laid with beautiful, soft, carpet.</p>
<p>The walls are made of alabaster.  One small part was pointed out where imitation alabaster was place by Napoleon who took away the real kind.  The difference was very noticeable after it had been pointed out to us.  In this mosque there are about 200 lamps which are lit at certain times of the year.  At that time it must be a very pretty sight.</p>
