I was lucky enough to escape but I was up nearly the whole night doing what I could for the poor devils.  I hear the Ras-el-Tin Lighthouse is in sight so Ill close as I want to get the first glimpse of Alexandria.<br/><strike>Hal thinks he has ptomaine but he hasn't, he's eaten too much Turkish delight.</strike></p>
