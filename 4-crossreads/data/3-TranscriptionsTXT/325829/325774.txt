 The Regt left Wadi Ektief at midday on March 22nd &amp; early the following morning crossed the Jordan at Hadjula ford over a pontoon bridge. The ground was very boggy &amp; difficulty was experienced in getting the limbers over the broken ground. The Regt formed up with the rest of the Bgde on the flat East of the Jordan. The Bgde was operating on the right of the 60th Division who were advancing to attack Es Salt via Shun Nimrin. We marched by No 3 road &amp; occupied Kabr Mujahid without any opposition &amp; awaited orders from Division. In the afternoon General Chaytor arrived &amp; we had orders to march along No 3 road. About 2miles N of Kabr Mujahid the road became impracticable for wheeled traffic, it being a mere goat track on the rugged side of a hill, &amp; after we had manhandled the Guns &amp; limbers up the first steep bit, it was decided to send all wheeled traffic back. Shortly after dark it commenced to rain &amp; we were marching all night up a steep hillside &amp; through narrow gorges.
