CopiedPacked & said Goodbye to El Arish, going back 4 days march for a spell on the Flank.
[The following paragraph crossed through]Papers from England & magazines from the new wife. Weather warmer but still pampering my neck. And all the way from Bronte came my old African spurs & the lighter racing ones, thank you for posting both.
Also letter card from May saying how busy she is & forwarding her song. Please acknowledge if the Power of Attorney reaches Joe I posted 2 mails ago. A Parcel of Tucker from the wife also came along - We have a canteen here now & the Railway feed us.
