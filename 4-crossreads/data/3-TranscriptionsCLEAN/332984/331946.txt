He informed me, that he grinds 25 bags weighing 85 Kilos each per day.  The mill he said was 200 years old.  I saw 1804 and 1844 cut on some of the beams myself.  I went up the stairs, the mill was working, rocking like a ship at sea.  The fittings were mostly all wood.  Hundreds of these mills all over this country.  A most noticeable building in these villages are the Churches.  Butcher shops are few.  In each village is a Brasserie or brewery.
