<p>Monday 3 December 1917</p>
<p>This is an old ship built 22 years ago &amp; RATS &amp; ANTS are plentiful now that the warmer weather is here. Many of the P. &amp; O. are in use as Hospital boats, Despatch Boats &amp; some are armed as auxiliary cruisers.</p>
<p>About 4 p.m. we got a S.O.S. wireless from a submarined boat north of us, but we did not alter our course as the Navy attend to that. Rough again <strike>&amp; the little wife did not sleep.</strike></p>
