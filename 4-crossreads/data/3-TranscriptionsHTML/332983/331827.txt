<p>Office 9 A.M. more evidence about the driver striking the Indian sentry Court martial. Getting a nuisance. Very quiet so far this morning, no shelling. Still another rumour that we move from here in seven or eight days. Some nasty shells over 10 A.M. again pieces were flying over our horse lines. A lucky thing that most of them did not burst. A warship put 2 shots into the Turkish communication trench must have been a 14in, and then the field Btys opened out on them They started to run. The same ship put in 5 more shells into the Turkish trenches. This happened at 8 P.M.<br/>27/10/1915<br/>Very mild morning, cloudy, flies simply awful. The French firing salvos at regular intervals during the night. The enemy very quiet. A Battleship firing on the Asiatic coast. Had to parade at R.H.A. Head Quarters, re Court Martial to identify the Indian sentry. The Officer with the Indians had a most peculiar beard the colour of a door mat, a rusty colour. The Naval Division down from the trenches</p>
