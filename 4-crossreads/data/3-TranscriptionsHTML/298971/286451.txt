<p>for certain today but weather conditions are too bad, so the event has been put off indefinitely.  3000 guns were going to throw and lift a barrage at intervals of 4 minutes.  Informed that our division will be relieved in couple of days.  So it should be.  270 on sick parade from one infantry Battalion yesterday &amp; a large number today.  Only 44 from close on 300 of our unit could be mustered for stretcher bearing today.  Wounded are coming in in one continuous stream, some dying on the way in and being buried near the A.D.S.</p>
