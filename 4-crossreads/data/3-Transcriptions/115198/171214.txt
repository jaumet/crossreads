<p>We saw Scotland and loved every bit of it - the country of Robbie Burns and Mary Queen of Scots. We found the people charming and. as we were in uniform all were interested in talking to us of their wonderful country. Went by coach to the Trossacks, returning via Aberdeen and. then back to London.<br/>When I went up for my board I was posted to Moore Barracks at Shorecliffe. I was on night duty in Ward 34 and very busy as there [are] many very sick boys. It was Xmas 1917 and we made little gifts for the patients, wrapped them in coloured paper and tied with, red ribbons. They all agreed it was the best Xmas they had bad. We enjoyed it too, singing Carols through the wards witb the patients joining in, and all expressing the wish that by next Xmas the war would be over.<br/>I had a young lad from Canada in my ward (far too young to have joined).<br/>He was very ill with rhumatic fever and when the painl got bad he would swear and nothing would stop him. One night I sat on his locker and as he swore I repeated the words after him. After a few moments he said "Sister I cannot stand it" and I said ''neither can I". It was not so bad after that and if he did start up again I only had to walk towards his locker and he would stop. He was such a small person his blue trousers kept falling down. We finally had him well secured with safety pins, much to the amusement of all, including himself.<br/>Dec. 26th transferred to Ward 19. These had been married quarters for the Army in peace time, and we found it hard to work there.<br/>There were about 14 whitewashed fire places and each ward held 14 patients.<br/>In February had three days leave and went to Chester to see Sister Hunter, an Australian Matron in charge of the Officers' Convalescent Hospital. Hawarden Castle, the home of the Gladstones had been lent to the Government for this purpose. There were a few patients, but the place was so large it was impossible to find one's way around without an escort.<br/>On Saturday night the Officers gave a concert and afterwards we danced.<br/>I met Miss Gladstone, the youngest daughter of the Rt. Hon. Gladstone along with other ladies present, a Mr, Donaldstone and Capt. Thacher, the M.O. Elizabeth Hunter and myself had supper with the Colonel and Mrs. Beethon. (When Miss Hunter returned to Australia she became the Matron of The War Memorial Hospital in Sydney " a delightful woman and a very good nurse.)<br/>On Monday we left the Castle for a visit to the town, a quaint interesting place and more so to Miss Hunter, who knew it well. Left in the afternoon for London and Folkestone.</p>
