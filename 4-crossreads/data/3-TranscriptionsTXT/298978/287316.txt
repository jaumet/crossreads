 sleeping in the open. 
 Nov &ndash; 3 a.m. Feeling very miserable &ndash; ten minutes to get kit together &ndash; we are shortly moving off, to leave behind probably for ever, my dear friends and everything else that was of any count. I pray God when we get to it I shall not be found wanting. Rushed to a telephone to bid goodbye to Lady.G 
 7 a.m. Entrain for Fremantle &ndash; 12 noon, on S.S. Dimboola en route for Melbourne. 
 Nov: Reach Albany. Once spent a very happy sketching tour here; little did I think that I should ever have to venture upon such a terrible mission. 
 4 p.m. Leave Albany, suffer much from mal-de-mer. I obtained permission to remain on the officers' deck for sketching &ndash; I tried to do a little; mal-de-mer too much for me. Dimboola a beast of a ship. 
 Nov; Reach Adelaide &ndash; four hours's leave. Dash off to the Art Gallery to see one of my favourite paintings, "Circe invidiosa" by Waterhouse &ndash; colour glorious and general treatment most decorative &ndash; also a very fine picture by Adrian Stokes, "The Wet West Wind," full of atmosphere and good in tone. For its size the Adelaide Gallery contains an excellent collection of pictures. Visit James Ashton (artist) &ndash; Willie Ashton is away painting &ndash; rotten luck, wish I could have seen him.
