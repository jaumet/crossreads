10 30 A.M. both ships proceeded in N.Ely. direction giving New Ireland a wide berth.We found about 250 other prisoners onboard, some having been here 5 months. We are all housed on the No 4 tween &ndash; decks, sleep in hammocks &amp; hot as hell when everybody is chased down below. Spent a most unpleasant night amongst sailors, firemen &amp; riggers all in a state of dripping perspiration.7th Aug.10 A.M. ships altered their course to N.W.200 pm. Both vessels stopped to allow "Matunga" to clean tubes, as she was getting very poor speed.530 pm. Went ahead again about W.N. W.From 8th to 13th August proceeded about West, nearly on the Equator. Had permission to sleep on deck at night while the tween-decks were being painted out.Always 3 armed sentries on guard over us, whether on deck or down below.Food at times is bad, but the bread is the worst, just like chewing dough, otherwise things might be worse.
