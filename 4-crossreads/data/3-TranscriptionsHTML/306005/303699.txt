<p>13-1-17<br/>had beaten them. Had some sparring tonight with a professional boxer from Sydney named Barr; he is in the Anzac Troop &amp; won the middleweight championship of Egypt a few weeks ago. I would like the opportunity of meeting him for the title; Taube paid the camp a visit at 9.30 one night while I was away &amp; dropped bombs in the moonlight but did no damage. Two came over again today &amp; dropped a few bombs &amp; the empty cases &amp; pellets from the Anti-Air-Craft guns were a bigger danger to us than the Taubes, but no one was hit.</p>
<p>14-1-17<br/>Sun 14th<br/>A couple of Taubes came within sight this morning but kept out of range of the guns &amp; dropped no bombs, I was down</p>
