<p>On duty all day yesterday but received about 8 letters &amp; one Argus from Australia, also a parcel from Agnes of soap &amp; a couple of handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>To-day your letter &amp; one from Ella &ndash; I got a parcel from Mrs. Swinburne &ndash; with a tooth brush, toothpaste, soap, powder, 1 small bottle of smelling-salts, butterscotch, &amp; six handkerchiefs &ndash; so you see I'm very spoilt &ndash; Mrs Baynes sent me a handkerchief &amp; a nice letter.  The Thomas family sent me &frac12; doz lovely handkerchiefs.  Sister Burke got the same, a card was in hers, I think the card must have dropped out of mine, the parcel was open.  I'm writing to thank all my friends for their kindness to me.  I told you Charity also sent me a very sweet handker &ndash;, so I'm well set up with handkeys &amp; soap.  I have not received the parcel with bloomers in yet but most likely shall in a few days.</p>
