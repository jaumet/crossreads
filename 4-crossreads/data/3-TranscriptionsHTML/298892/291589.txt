<p>is here at present undergoing treatment for an Abcess in the ear. I handed him the cutting to read and he was mightily amused at the account of his doings, although when he came to the part stating that he never had a bath he denied it emphatically, and in vivid language expressed a wish to get hold of the person who wrote it and he would knife him.  Jones had been up before a Medical Board here on the plea of insanity but his case was dismissed and he is still in camp.<br/>The cold and rainy weather is setting in here now and Tommies, who are medically unfit for service at the front, are busy putting down gratings for footpaths round the huts. They are very necessary too as the least little drop of rain makes a bog of this place. It has only been drizzling for a day and now if one crosses the yard one slips and sithers around like a beginner on skates.<br/>We are in for another long route march this week and are to stay out - possibly billetted - for a couple of days.<br/>I received the photo of Kitty &amp; co. at Cahills. I think it is a dreadful libel on poor Kit. I have been afraid to let go of it for fear some of the boys asking who they are, when I would be compelled to either lie bravely or give the show away. I have no doubt that is what I am doing now as I cannot imagine Kit sanctioning its despatch. Ask her to send me a snap of you and father and get you to take one of her. She might also get an opportunity of snapping Douglas and Kevin on their visits home. I would also like to get one of Cap or a print from one of those</p>
