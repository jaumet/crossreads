<p>Letters to Dave Gardner &amp; Mollie about last Tuesday.</p>
<p>24/5/18   Re E.M.M.&amp;B. Coy.  <strike>Bat</strike>  My O.C. will not allow me to transfer (One Gutser). Some of the Tommy Transport Drivers that come here for stuff should'nt be allowed out without someone to lead them around. If  I could only spare a little space to tell of some of their performances this would be one of the funniest Books ever written.</p>
<p>25.5.18  Some of these Labor units are a pitiful sight, they contain men who ought to be labelled L143. The Govt. responsible for their presence here ought to be Hounded out of office on this issue alone.</p>
<p>26.5.18   Yesterday at Querrieu two Labor companies passing each other by the white Chateau when a shell lobbed right into them killing 14 and wounding 46. A big bag. It looked rather awfull the bodies having to be removed to each side of the road to keep it clear for Traffic.</p>
<p>28.5   Same old planes &amp; Bombs the last two nights. The old Tanks are returning this evening (pourquoi? can it be that Fritz is pushing elsewhere. I called on the 13th Batt. the night before last to see young Dickenson but he was not at home.</p>
<p>31/5  Wrote letter to Mollie yesterday announcing "all present and correct" &amp; last night a Fritz plane dropped 6 Bombs of which two landed one on each side of our dugout each about 15 yds away. The dugout was  <strike>full</strike>  full of the fumes of the explosive</p>
