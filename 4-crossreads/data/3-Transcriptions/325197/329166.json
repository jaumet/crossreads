<p>to Right to the entrance of Kitcheners Hospital. I was put into D.3. ward, and after a good hot bath we were shoved into bed.</p>
<p>Mon 19th Aug<br/>After inspection by the Doctor I was allowed out of bed</p>
<p>All Canadian Staff in this hospital and they will always do me for kindness.</p>
<p>Tues 20th August<br/>As I am a walking case (and not bad at that) The Doctor said I could have leave into Brighton from 2 till 9pm. Free train to all wounded soldiers, and we could get onto the piers, and into the concert for free.</p>
<p>The Brighton people are very good to the boys, giving them papers and assisting them in every way.</p>
<p>The following few days I had leave into Brighton, and I will be sorry to leave.</p>
