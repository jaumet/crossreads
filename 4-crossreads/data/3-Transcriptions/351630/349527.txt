At present I am on my way back to France after having spent a very enjoyable ten days in Old England.  I came straight across from Bapaume where we had been in reserve after our smash up at Bullecourt, &amp; stayed the night at Boulogne where we went into a place called [Vidors?] Billets.  Next morning we embarked on packet steamers &amp; raced across to Folkstone under escort. Finally I found myself at Victoria Rystn [Railway Station] &amp; were marched to Horseferry Road (our head quarters) &amp; received my pay &amp; dumped my equipment  &amp; rifle etc. I then decided to look up my uncle George &amp; received a most dramatic welcome from them.
