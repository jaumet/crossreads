<p>our satisfaction, in fact we were often disappointed when we found that they were not included in the menu. The French people after indulging in two good solid meals a day, does not require much breakfast. At the hotel where we put up, a cup of cocoa &amp; a small roll of bread was sent up to our room each day at 7 a.m. I rather like the idea. We naturally did not waste much time over our breakfast, so always got an early move on, to tour the sights of Gay Paree. Naturally we could not spare too much time at the number of famous places we visited as 4 days soon pass, however we did very well, as you will see later on. I  am gproceeding too far ahead with this account, so will start from the day the three of us left our Unit for our short holiday.</p>
<p>Our happy little party left the Main Dressing Station at 6 a.m. by motor ambulance for ------   catching a train there at 8.10 p.m. for Calais. The weather was exceptionally cold, it was the coldest morning we have experienced this winder. Boarded the Paris Express at Calais at noon. The scenery from the train was very fine. At Boulogne we had dinner in the dining car, after living on army rations for so long, you can bet that we enjoyed the meal. At Estaples we returned to our car. Arrived at Gar du Nord (railway station) Paris at 9 p.m. The journey took 12 hours a very tiring journey. Our passes were examined &amp; checked at A.P.M. office, St Honore. A good meal was then partaken of at the Y.M.C .A. which was run by Canadians. Canadian girls waited on us, the tucker was very cheap, only 2 francs,   Put up at an hotel for the night close by the Y.M.C.A. &amp; believe me, it was very comfortable sleeping in a clean white bed again.</p>
<p>On the following morning we changed our diggings &amp; put up at the Hotel Nouvel, Rue La Fayette. Our rooms were very comfortable &amp; beautifully furnished. Getting an early start on we began our tour of the city. Visited</p>
