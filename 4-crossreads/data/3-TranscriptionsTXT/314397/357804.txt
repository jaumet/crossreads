Stayed there till 3.30pm. We were the Reserve Coy so until then we had nothing to do. Saw hundreds of prisoners & hear that our boys are doing exceptionally well. Do us. We moved up at 3.30pm & had to maintain the main road till midnight & then we move into a bank  north of Warfusee Abincourt & Lamotte en Santerre. Everything went well with our boys. There was very little work in the air by Fritz. Our boys walked straight thro him on the ground. Captured guns, as train load of troops coming to this front & have generally hit him hard.
Friday. 9.8.18.Had a stand to at 3am till 4.30am. Nothing strange happened tho Fritz kept going with long range gums all night. They were near here but not close enough to worry us at all. During the day planes came along & dropped 2 messages for the tanks. Our forward balloon was shot down
