14.3.16I had a long day in exercising the horses & was in the saddle most of the day.  Just as I was about to unsaddle the Postman ran up to me & gave me a gloriously long letter from Nina, you can bet I was very pleased with same.I am teaching my horse to follow me & even now he will walk about all over the place after me.  I run away from him & he will come trotting after me.I rode through Helmieh to-day, where the Howitzer Camel Corps is camped & am gradually getting him used to them.  I also went through Zeitoun & Matarieh.  Apart from the usual Transport nothing much occurred..
15.3.16 WednesdayHad a good days work on convoying Fodder to Nebu Pasha Barracks.  I also went down to the Irrigation of the Lower Nile & the scenery is very nice.Equipment for the Train is now pouring in & it looks as though we wont be long before we are fit for the Road.
