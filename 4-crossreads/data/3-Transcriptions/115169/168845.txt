<p>March 26th [1916] We passed several islands, and in doing so they were very closely examined<br/>March 27th We arrived off the island of "Curacoa" [Curacao] at dawn, - this was a rather large, flat island, and we steamed past, rather close in shore, and at noon we were passing "Oruba" [Aruba] Island", which was a much smaller island.<br/>March 28th At dawn we were off "La Guayra" &ndash; great high ranges of hills could be plainly seen, but it seemed to take a considerable time to reach the harbour and shortly afterwards Venezuelan officials paid a visit to our Captain on board, and salutes were fired at 10 AM (21 guns) &ndash; Shortly afterwards the British Ambassador came on board and left again at 1.30 PM with a salute of 17 guns, after which officers were allowed to land, and at 6 PM. we left for St Lucia examining all islands en route.</p>
