<p>Mesopotamia, but only the bare facts so far. We thought at one time that that was where we were going, but I think there is no doubt now that France is our destination ultimately. We are moving next Sunday to Moaskar about 1 mile from Ismalia, and about 12 from here, so we have a nice little march to look forward to, all across loose heavy sand too, with full packs &amp; probably 120 rounds of ammunition. The rumour is that we are only going there to be finally fitted up with all necessaries, as I don't think it will be long now before we are on the sea again.</p>
<p>We had a big day yesterday. The whole of the 2nd A &amp; NZAC were inspected by General Godley, and it was a great sight to see all the Battalions</p>
