&cycled home again.
Saw some beautiful Belgian lace but it is very expensive.  Another afternoon the Colonel took me out for a long cross country walk which I enjoyed.  He is a most entertaining man & was not at all uppish but very nice & affable & we got on O.K.  Both he & the Adjutant are really very nice to me & say they are glad to have me & that I am most satisfactory.  You won't think it swank of me to tell you these things but you know how I like to be liked & it has made me feel much
