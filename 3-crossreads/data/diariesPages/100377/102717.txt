22nd June 1916 
Another fine warm day. Mess orderly for day. Full dress parade again. Another huge laugh. I did not get dressed anyhow. Nothing of importance happened. Night hot into the bargain.
23rd June 1916 
Washing day. Day hot typical weather for Tropics I presume. "Marathon" dropped behind again. Our ship Cruiser the others slowed down at nightfall for her.

Sunday today. Church Parade held in morning. A very hot day. Went on guard at four oclock as Telephonist. Did not spend a very good time. Passed the Line at early morning hours.
26th June 1916 
Finished up guard at 4 oclock this afternoon after spending a hot tiresome day. Our ship behind all day evidently the old craft is feeling the pinch. Is gradually getting up to the other ships tonight. In bed early.
27th June 1916 
Raining today very miserable. Otherwise very quite. Our ship still in the rear.
