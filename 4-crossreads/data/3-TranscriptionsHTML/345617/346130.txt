<p>Juillet 27<br/>Not much doing. A little drill &ndash; general clean-up &amp; [indecipherable] Parade. Expect to leave tomorrow early.</p>
<p>Juillet 28<br/>Left Corbie at about 8a.m. &amp; marched to Contay a distance of about 7 miles. Had a trying march as the weather is very warm &amp; we wore steel helmets which were very severe on the head. The road also was very hard on the feet.</p>
