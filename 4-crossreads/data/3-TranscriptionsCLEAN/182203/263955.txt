I have only been sea-sick one day so far but even then able to go to each meal. We are feeling the heat a little but not too much. We have had rather exciting times since I wrote you. We were not allowed Shore-leave at Brisbane - Had three [words censored] so had to leave them there. We arrived at Pinkenba Pier (Queensland) at 1.30.pm. Thursday   but  Were told we could all go off until 9.p.m. hurried &  dressed for shore then just about to leave boat when Major came    & said "No Shore leave". - we thought he was only joking but it was too true. We all settled down &  made the most of it. The men (soldiers) were very good & contented & amused themselves by talking &  joking with the crowd on the pier. They had a lot of school youngsters lined up singing Tipperary & other Patriotic Songs. The best one getting some money. We had great excitement watching the troops embark the next day. A band was playing on the pier until we sailed away.
