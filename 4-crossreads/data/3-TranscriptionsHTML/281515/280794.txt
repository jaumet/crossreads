<p>the 26th July at our appointed camp at Heliopolis &amp; during the time we were in Egypt until we left to go to the Peninsular, we were very hard worked early &amp; late even going on night marches into the Desert &amp; digging trenches &amp; sleeping there until daylight came when we would march back, all these exercises being done with a full Pack which is no light weight on a march through the sandy desert.</p>
<p>We were all allowed to go &amp; see the City of Cairo, which seemed to me to be packed with all sorts &amp; conditions &amp; the smells which greeted one as we were poking about the different parts of Cairo  I also took a trip to the Great sight of the Spinck &amp; the Pyrimids past Mina Camp I took off my boots &amp; went inside the Great Pyrimid &amp; slid down a slope on the Alibaster Floor until one got right inside where guides had Candles lighted &amp; shewed you round the place inside, we came out again &amp; then had to have our fortunes told by an Arab who drew signs in the sand &amp; told us something about sickness &amp; shot etc:</p>
<p>I was promoted Corporal on the 14 August 1915 &amp; a few days after we started on the way for Alexandria, where we got on a ship that was to take us to Gallopoli.  This ship was named the "Saturnia" &amp; she was filthy with dirt lice &amp; Black beetles &amp; on the deck we of A Coy occupied there was a large wooden tub which I should think had had salt beef in as it was one mass of wriggling grubs from decayed meat, we soon got rid of that over the side &amp; we were all very busy now getting what is called iron Rations consisting of a tin which opens at both ends one has tea in &amp; the other end sugar then a tin of Bully Beef</p>
