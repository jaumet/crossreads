 Got Letter from Ern Harvey. Another Big day. Mr Woods greatly surprised us by shouting for all hands after the show was over. Weather Rough, Windy and Raining. 
 Went into Warminster with Jack Davis on the Car. Walked back. 
 Fri. 22 Things about the same. 
 Sat. 23 After Lunch had Bath and washed all my dirty cloths. Then commenced Letter No 9 to L. 
 Bill Beard and I were on all day, but thank Goodness we are off tomorrow. 
 Sun. 24 Squally day. Finished up about 2 p.m. Walked into Warminster. Rained all the time. 
 Strolled round the Town. Things very quiet. Went into a sort of Y.M. Hut and had Sandwiches, Cake and Tea. Some chap was playing the Piano, and pretty good too, a few others were singing and I passed away a couple of hours there. 
 Got back to Camp about 9 p.m. Finished Letter No. 9.
