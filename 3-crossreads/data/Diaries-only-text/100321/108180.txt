Took a turn up the streets which are very slippery. The shops all seem well stocked and busy. The Canal down the centre of the town must look very well in Spring when its banks are green with its tree leaves. Had lunch at the Officer's Club and there met Colonels Courlette and Ralph. A good lunch for 3.75 fr. At the station today there were many horses being entrained mostly of our 5th Division.
