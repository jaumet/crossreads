  
 of some 12-13 summers - Several of the lads were good at diving - They  swim  straight down.  This particular lad was the smallest of the lot - a little bigger than Rawdon - He jumped off his catamaran & swam down - He picked up a tin of meat from the bottom in at least 9 fathoms [equal to] 54 feet of water  - Our anchor is down to the 12 fathom mark & has slanted a bit no doubt - It was questioned on board the other day when I mentioned a white man who had done 7 fathoms - a great feat - Here's a boy does it easy - He came up like a cork - The pressure on his ear drums at that depth must have been very great - Very few men care to dive more than 3 fathoms. 
 Well we went back to Rabaul - Got some clean clothes - I had a swim in the ditch with the men & then out we went to sea - We weren't in much over an hour - Ajax came off with a fresh leg of pork - for me - I'd been his doctor
