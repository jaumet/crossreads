 August 1917 11th   We had more rain to-day &amp; at times was very heavy.   During the morning we had some Physical drill but practically nothing else was done during the day. 13th   Rain has cleared &amp; it is now quite fine.   Yesterday &amp; to-day we have been doing squad drill &amp; bayonet fighting.   Harvesting has been in progress for the past week or so &amp; the lads have been giving the farmer a hand in the field after parades.   It is quite a change &amp; we all appreciate it very much. 14th   We had more squad drill, gas drill etc etc this morning &amp; a route march in the afternoon. China officially declared war on Germany &amp; Austria to-day.
