<p>27/3/19<br/>Marcinelle<br/>Some snow fell this morning. I found myself very busy until 11.30 &ndash; holding orderly room and attending to matters of routine. The Higher Command leaves well alone here and visits from the G.O.C are rare. Afternoon said farewell to a few officers leaving for Australia and had a dancing lesson which broke me up. Stayed home correcting history.</p>
<p>28/3/19<br/>Another cold and snowy day. Spent a busy morning mostly in argument with Selleck about the next draft. Afternoon read a while and then went up the town to go and buy a Petit Parisien and then aimlessly come back. Dr Milleu came to evening mess and said he goes home soon. In the evening I went back to the Cinema and saw some good pictures.</p>
