<p>the Transport lines about 12 o'clock. Mr Chapman is now staying with us &amp; of course we have to keep a picquet. The hours are 10. pm. to 530. am.<br/>[shorthand symbols](I wrote to my dear wife today. Letter 134. 3 pages and included it in the official green envelope)</p>
<p>This evening the enemy put several shells on a road in front of us but done  no damage.<br/>[shorthand symbols] (In the last lot of letters I received from my wife she mentions that she received a shell case pack of [?] and a pack of post cards.)</p>
<p>Tuesday June 25. 1918. 1421.<br/>I am on second picquet to night from 12.30 to 3. Before I came on picquet last night the enemy shelled the road to the right of us. The shells fell close and several times showers of dirt and stones fell on our dug out. A company man named Jefferies got the wind up and ran outside without any boots or coat on &amp; stayed in a deeper dug out used for an exchange station by the signallers for a new underground telegraph cable. He with some of the cooks stayed there all the time I was on picquet. Later he got his blankets &amp; overcoat &amp; slept on the stairs until morning.<br/>I had a look around this morning. Some of the shell holes are quite close to the dug outs about a chain away</p>
