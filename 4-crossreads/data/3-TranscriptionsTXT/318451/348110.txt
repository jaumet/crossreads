One platoon has to see that no messages are sent down stream to the Bosch, everything floating is caught in a net & inspected, every carcase of dead dog or cat is opened as messages are sometimes put inside the dead animal & it is thrown into the stream to drift down.There has been great activity in the air today, 3 German planes & two baloons were brought down here.  We have a wonderful little plane which looks like a small bird in the sky, but it is very speedy.
WednesdayToday I have been into Armentiers to see Mr. McCook.  The bosch was shelling part of the town consistently, he got a few of our men.  I have been up to the Batt. after tea this evening.
