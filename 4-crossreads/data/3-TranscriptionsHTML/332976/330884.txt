<p>June 1917<br/>29th   This morning we went down to the river again although very little work was done.<br/>Rowing was more in prominence than anything else &amp; I have started to pick a crew of 10 to pull in the regatta which is to be held here shortly.   During the evening we had some rain, but it did not last long.<br/>30th   The same thing was done to-day as yesterday, &amp; I am making considerable progress with the training of the team.   A four oar team has also been picked.</p>
