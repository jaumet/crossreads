I seem have been fortunate in my fellow patients for they are not only decent companions but interesting too.Some hail from Mesopotamia where they have had a bad time, while others are from the Suez trenches.One of these is a sturdy & fat fellow in with dysentery whose main trouble seems to be a dislike for his medicine, & who presents a healthy appearance quite out of temper with his position.Another, equally healthy & like the abovementioned, one of the old Suvla boys, is troubled with cynovitis of the knees.  This His cure is to rest in bed
