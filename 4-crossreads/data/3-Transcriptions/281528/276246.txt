<p>26/3/18 &ndash; La Basse Ville<br/>Rather late before getting up.  An officer of the M.G.M.'s came in and reported himself and I gave him a very rough telling off that quite upset him and will lead most likely to his Battery taking a more active part in operations in the future.  The B.M. called in with Coglan of the Engineers.  Our patrol last night found a demolition charge evidently carried by the Hun raiders the other night.  It was covered with blood.  We had 2 men wounded slightly last night.  The enemy is wonderfully quiet in front of us and has evidently thinned his front system very much.</p>
