<p>Picture post card in black and white of "Salisbury Cathedral"</p>
<p>Poem on Card:<br/>"As many days in one year there be,<br/>So many windows in this church we see,<br/>As many marble pillars here appear (8760),<br/>As there are hours throughout the fleeting year,<br/>As many gates as moons one year does view,<br/>Strange tale to tell, yet not more strange than true."</p>
