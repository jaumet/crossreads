 of shower of glitter star and flash of sheet lighten like flare we all know at our boat picnic in Sydney . Lazi simpli permeat all life and the spirit of the men in general . But this state of bliss will not last for long , and in a veri short time now we will be in the final stage of our train for the big event . So , for a while ? vade vale ! Today is Sunday again , and we hope , our last Sunday aboard . Last Wednesday , 4th October at about 2 am . we steam into the harbour of St Vincent , in the Cape Verd Island , West Coast of Africa . The harbour is a shallow bay but it has the appear and advantag of a good harbour , for it is protect by a larg island direct opposit the township . The Town is not larg but like Cape Town , it is situat at the foot of a high hill and look pretti well laid out . I should say 30000 would cover nativ European popul easili . The nigger here are a fine athlet stamp , and are better than ani I have seen at dive for money . You can imagin our surpris on arriv at a Portugues port to find two British men-o-war lie at anchor there . But Britain is everywher and leav noth to chanc , and , sinc some of her transport were call at this port , she was look after them herself . Sever Portugues gun boat were lie in the bay too , and their work is patrol the island which are a small compact group . One of the boat was the " Highflyer " which , you will rememb , was respons earlier in the war for the run down of the German cruiser " Konigsberg " and for the sink of the " Frederick der Gross " - an arm merchantman . We onli stay here about 6 hour for sunset saw us out of the harbour . An offici who came on board was most enthusiast about Australia 's part in the war , and state that 3 month previous they had had 7 transport in at one time . They flew all the flag , and the littl Portugues mosquito fleet greet them with a salut from the gun , while a launch play them in . He said he had never seen soldier of the same physiqu anywher , and , altogeth , was most effus in his prais . I take it this larg bodi of troop was the 9th Brigad 9 Artilleri Brig , 9th Field Amb . other division unit accessori . Realli the Empire is a wonder organis , and it in out of the way place
