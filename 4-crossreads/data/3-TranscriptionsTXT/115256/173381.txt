 Sunday 2 May 1915 
 Everything was comparatively quiet this morning so we knew that our anticipated "big move", otherwise known as a general advance, was to be made.  Towards evening, water-bottles were filled, a 24 hours' ration was issued, and 200 rounds of ammunition were distributed to each man.  Early in the night a terrific bombardment was commenced, and together with the machine gun and rifle fire, the noise was terrific.  Under these conditions we advanced up through a narrow defile previously visited by the Engineers.  Having gained some ground this way, we received the order to charge.  I always thought that the Australian was pretty good on his feet, but he can do nothing against Johnny the Turk.  We didn't get near striking distance as most of them seemed to do the 100 yards in well under the 11 seconds.  But their Maxims were busy and our casualties were by no means few.  Eventually we reached a favourable position, the firing line entrenching just over the crest of a hill, the supports on the other side just below the skyline.  Digging a trench under fire is by no means the easiest of tasks, but by midnight, we had established a fairly strong position.  A terrible odour arose from the ground, the decomposing bodies of our dead enemies &ndash; the victims of our exploits of the last week.
