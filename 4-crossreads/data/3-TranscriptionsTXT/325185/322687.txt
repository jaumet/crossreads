 I think I told you I have met Harry Cross across here he looks very well.  Tell Les I have met that friend of his J. Souter he is looking very well also wished to be remembered to Les.  I have met a fair number here lately I knew on the boat.  They have been split up a bit.  Some have been wounded &amp; sent to England another is in Sydney.  I had a great talk with them.  Met them all by accident. No more just now Father will have to close.  Will write each week if I can.  Don't worry am O.K. love to all. 
 Your sincere Son Clyde 
 N.B. 30.1.16 The letter you wrote me to the Argyllshire the day we left turned up this morning.  It has been travelling a fair bit from the look of the envelope.  I am satisfied as long as you are alive the mail will eventually find you.  The letter is dated 30th Sept. 1915.
