As soon as the dough has "prooved" sufficiently, it is thrown out onto a table, and is placed in suitably cut pieces into a "Divider", and is passed therefrom after being correctly compressed and thereby made the weight required, on to a small platform, from where it is placed by hand on to the "Moulder". This machine does the necessary shaping to the divided pieces of dough.
After leaving the moulding machine, the pieces of dough are placed on boards and put near the ovens to allow of a certain amount of "prooving" to take place. Meanwhile the heat of the ovens has been brought to the required degree. All is then ready for baking.
As previously mentioned, the section comprises 23 N.C.O's and men of which 1 N.C.O and 4 men are accounted for in doughmaking. The distribution of the remaining number is as follows:- 1 Senior N.C.O.
