18th Enemy shelling our trenches this morning, very little damage done. Great aerial activity to day, planes up in large numbers. Went out with a patrol from B.Coy to night intending to rush an enemy Pill-Box, great joke, one bloke out of the 8 got a bit excited when we came to "Fritz barbed wire and threw a bomb, it certainly got some one judging by the yells that went up, but instead of them sticking their ground and fighting on, they gradually popped off. It was lively for about 5 minutes, they played with a machine gun, but fired too high, none of our party got struck. Enemy shell our trenches again to night, one of our boys wounded.
