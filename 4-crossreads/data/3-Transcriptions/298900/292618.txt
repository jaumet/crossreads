<p>Tuesday 22nd Jan<br/>    Weather very mild.   Had some rain but not enough to make things unpleasant.   Nothing doing bar the ordinary sick parades.</p>
<p>Wednesday 23rd<br/>    Beautiful mild weather.   Had a recurrence of biliousness.   Went along by car to the 15th to pick up supplies.   Had to wait for them so had tea there, then helped to unpack the stuff, about 24 cases, then set off home with my own requirements about 6.30.   We then had to sort it all out for the various units which was completed at midnight.   The Battalions have been badly treated in the way of supplies since I went on leave as they were unable to get supplies.</p>
<p>Thursday 24th Jan<br/>   Sent off all the drugs this morning to the various units.   A bright sunny day all day, really exceptional weather for this time of the year, it being hard to realise that it</p>
