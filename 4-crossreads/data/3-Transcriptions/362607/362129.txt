<p>Dear Harry,<br/>Was so pleased to get your photo  &amp;  have not finished gazing on it yet. I am getting a special frame made for you  &amp; the surfers as I think we will make a pretty group. I am sorry you missed us so much when we left but hope we will meet one day soon again. We often talk about our trip  &amp; often long for a dip! I often go about in my surfing hat  &amp; imagine I smell salt on it. How is our dandy boy. Does he still do surfing. We had tiny [indecipherable]up here last week but did not go to see them. We were wishing they were the dandies. I am getting terribly fat put on over a lb a week so the change must have done me good. How is "Iona" looking  &amp;  do you still tap on the wall. I was very disappointed you did not give us a parting tap the day we left. Sorry the P.C. is not bigger but Jess is writing so will tell you all the news. Thought you would like to gaze on where we live. Love from Elsie   Mactier</p>
