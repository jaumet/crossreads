<p>France<br/>27.12.16<br/>Dear Father</p>
<p>There's only one consolation re the mud in the trenches &amp; that is that instead of being up to your neck, it only reaches half way up your thighs.  At present we are in reserve about 3 miles behind the line &amp; though continually shelled nobody ever gets hit.  Dorothy's muffler had a very smelly end in a very mushy trench.  We were stooping to avoid some of Fritz's hate &amp; I happened to put my foot in the end of it &ndash; the muffler not the hate &ndash; with the result that it was immediately sucked under 4 feet of thick mud &amp; drowned.</p>
<p>We are in rather a historic place &amp;  it is rumoured that there was a village here before the war, it is now a mass of big shell holes</p>
