<p>of him, then it suddenly dawned on me what a changed life we are living, yet are growing accustomed to, no little children to love, no trees, no flowers &ndash; no pets &ndash; no shops &ndash; Nothing dainty or nice, practically no fruit (fresh) or vegetables &ndash; butter &amp; eggs once in a month &ndash; twice at most.  I wonder what else but I think that's enough.  Please don't infer from this that I am complaining, far from it, &amp; we have much to be thankful for.  It's only when the bad cases are concerned we wish we could get everything that is good for them.  Of course it's only natural that we would like for our health's sake to have some delicacies.  I do have them too in my dreams at night.  I visit the most beautiful fruit gardens &amp; pick the sweetest flowers, then little children are never far away &ndash; please don't smile for it's quite true.  It puts me in mind of these words &ndash; I slept and dreampt that life was beauty.  I woke and found that life was duty.  Our duty here though is a work of love &ndash; so picture us happy.</p>
<p>Good-night dear old friends just for once I wish I could be transferred to a home for a couple of days.  For a week the prevailing sickness here has been troubling me.</p>
