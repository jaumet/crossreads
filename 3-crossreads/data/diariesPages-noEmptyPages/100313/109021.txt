2/1/18 Kent London
through the soft variegated countryside all much greener than France. Many hop fields with their forest of stakes their kilns. Ran into London about 4 to Victoria Station and after trying the Grosvenor put up with Fairweather at the Belgrave Mansions. Went out up Buckingham Palace Road to make a few purchases but had difficulty in finding the way owing to the absolute black darkness prevailing. Much struck by the lack of politeness, curtness boorishness of the people in shops ? French manners politeness have spoilt us. Went up to Piccadilly by tube and dined at Scotts on oysters bitters cheese. Everything very dark here and the streets crowded with women. Walked round for a while then went saw Geo. Robey in Zig Zag at the Hippodrome. Slept long and well through until about 8.30 in the morning.
