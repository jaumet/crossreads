CHAPTER XXX1X.
ENGLAND - ON DUTY.
I fairly opened the valve of enjoyment to it's fullest extent while in Brussels, and I can quite understand how it is so many of our people in England go to the Continent for a change.  They certainly do not go there for a rest, change, ye gods! yes, and plenty of it too.
Day and night there is plenty to be seen and plenty to do.  The customs of the people are so very different from our own, but it does not take very long for you to get into their ways.  It was an education to me as it has proved to many others too no doubt.  Reading about these places is useless, one wants to see them and the life generally to appreciate it.
While in Dinant the residents were very excited one day owing to the expected arrival of their king.  Early in the afternoon he arrived without any pomp or ceremony, walking amongst the people and talking to the children.  He spent a long time looking at the walls where so many of his subjects had been slaughtered and removed his hat when viewing their graves.  Exceptionally tall and big, with a heart of a dozen, he apparently enjoys the love, devotion and unanimous respect of all classes of his kingdom.
I bid farewell to my boss who is returning to Dinant.  He has not only been my boss, but a very good friend too, and the parting is with genuine regret.  During the afternoon of the ame [same?] day, I also bid farewell to the glorious city of Brussels where I have had such a wonderful couple of days.
At about 4.30 p.m. on the 6th. February. ' 19 I leave the city on my way to Calais.  Sleep one night at a small village where the train rests for the night.  Some difficulty in obtaining a room in the place, but eventually am accommodated in an attic which is none too inviting, but as no one was allowed to remain in the train, a shelter of some kind was necessary so made the best of my domicile.
Was awakened in time to have a jolly good breakfast and catch the train which was timed to leave at about 6.a.m.
