  
 Dorking as far as the hill was concerned, but the flat country & poplar lined straight roads were without parallel in my experience. We exposed a kind of underground vault which had a small opening on the extreme end of each side wall. These led to identical narrow passages ending in nothing but wall. On one side of each were bricked up arch tunnels.
