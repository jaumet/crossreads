128& letter from Brisson I promptly answer them while I am in the humour. Having finished all correspondence & having written this up to date I decide to make some friendly calls & will probably be invited out to dinner
In the afternoon I visited Dr Courmontagne & find that his wife has returned & he is waiting for his little boy who is going to the picture show to come in prior to going to a musical afternoon at Saucet. Mde comes down dressed & we adjourn to the bureau of M. Benard who is the possessor of a cello & or rather viola without the E string.
We then adjourn to Saucet & enter the room which has one side panelled to cover a series of shelves & cupboards within - a handy way of disposing of necessary but encumbering furniture. [A small sketch inserted here].
Afternoon tea consists of cake - followed by pastry & then light round [indecipherable] biscuits. This is usual afternoon tea. Often a liqueur is added.
The playing was rather good Benard made horrible face & seemed to get some notes out with his tongue judging from the way he used to roll it it. At 8 pm we adjourned [indecipherable] Courmontaigne et supped soup - eggs - chops - cheese - pastry - (chocolate in fingers with cream interior) coffee & liqueurs Red wine through the meals.
As the family are very sleepy I retire to bed early & on arrival at my billet
