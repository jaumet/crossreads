<p>The Boys</p>
<p>One of the lads writing home:- "It is getting very cold these times &amp; I suppose the mob at home will soon be chucking the beer &amp; taking on the Hot Pies:"</p>
<p>At Pozieres a Sergt. of the 23rd was talking to Mab. Smith and turned away to carry out his orders.  A shell burst then and blew the Sergeant's head off.  Mab. had the trunk carried away and put on the parados of a communication trench we were using.  This was well in rear of our firing line.  Two days after the paybook of this Sergeant was found in the pocket of a dead German sniper out in No Mans Land.  He must have been hiding in a shell hole behind our men, rifled the body at night and then crept away only to be killed in action later.  In my Coy Sergt [indecipherable] was missing.  The same day his watch was found in the pocket of a dead man killed by our lads.</p>
<p>What strikes the new hand as callous is the way our dead boys are left lying about in the front battle line without any effort being made to bury them.  Really this is due to reliefs.  A unit marches out only too glad to get away and leaves its dead lying round.  They have no sentimental interest to newcomers and they don't bury them, leaving the task to the burial parties coming along a week or so in rear.  The lot of the surviving old hand is hard.  He has been in every charge and come through scathless but all his mates are dead.  Brave as a lion he has a nervous fear that next time he must die as you cannot tempt Providence too often.  Still he feels that he must be in anything that is doing.  Thus one after Flers, looking haggard and ill and down to be sent to the transport for a rest.  Anxious to miss nothing.</p>
<p>O.H:- "Major" I am b-----d.  I'm wasting away":</p>
<p>Mjr:- Well you'd better go to the transport for a rest lad:"</p>
<p>O.H:- I don't want to miss er stunt.  Me number's 10.  I've been in every b--- charge yet.  All me cobbers are dead but I'm one of the old heads I am, I won't go if it means missing a charge.  Those b---  German b---s can't kill me.  They've tried often enough but the b---s can't b ----  well kill me:" You know my record.  I am one of the old boys ain't I Major?"</p>
<p>Mjr:- "Yes lad.  You're one of our best.  Well off you go and lie up for a few days.  If there's going to be a charge, I'll send for you!"</p>
<p>And off goes a very brave man for a well earned rest.  Ribald, a curser, &amp; a hard liver but one of our very bravest.</p>
