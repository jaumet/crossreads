<p>You should have seen our tea tonight, there were 4 of us at it.   Jack Price (our present Sergt Major) Dave Murray (Company Clerk) &amp; a very nice &amp; decent fellow Len &amp; myself, this is what we had, tinned rabbit, I suppose you will laugh when you read of us eating rabbit but I can tell you it is fine &amp; very popular among the boy's a large tin costs 2 &frac12; franc's, tinned butter, strawberry jam, cheese, tomato sauce, about 4 lb of good cake &amp; as much bread as we needed, this is one of the great differences between here &amp; Gallopoli, for here we can get anything within reason at a reasonable price, at Gallopoli</p>
