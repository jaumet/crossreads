  
 thankyou, and will be very handy in Port Said, though I hope not to have to use much of it. The news all round seems very good at present and it really looks as if a person may soon be able to get back to the ploughing again - I sincerely hope so anyway. Well Father I don't know what you will think of this long rigmarole (would like to know if you think its readable, as this is a sort of an experiment on descriptive letter writing for me) but you see I'm only doing it for my own amusement and in the hopes that it will interest you and I'm  not  a war correspondant, so of course you wont let any of it be published! My fountain pen went dry just up there, but I did not want to go away and fill it now, so I finished off with this green stuff, which was on the table beside me. It makes the other ink look a very dirty colour; does it not? I must stop now. With love to Mother and Hal and Fred. I am Your loving brother Robert C. Wilson 
 PS. I posted you a little booklet on Jerusalem a couple of days ago.
