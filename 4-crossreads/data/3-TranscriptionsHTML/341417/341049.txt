<p>Daffadils. and you see them grow wild<br/>I came back through Cambridge and when we were about 14 miles out of Sydney I passed acres of glass houses and they are looked after by girls and you could see them full of tomatoes and cucumber they are a great price so I expect they pay to grow them in such quantities.<br/>The wild flowers are coming out and every where you look the place is full of the primrose and blue bells &amp; they look very fine when they are growing wild. All the trees are out in leaf &amp; the fruit trees in blossom and it make a big contrast after seeing nothing else but Limbless trees &amp; stumps in France. but the bulbs were out in flower when I left.<br/>I was up before a board to day and I am going to be transfered to an artillery camp</p>
