Tuesday 15/5/17.<br/>At 10 a.m. a large number of Machine Gun Troops with a Brass Band &amp; 60 Coy of the A.R.O.D. marched into Camp in dirty weather, raining on &amp; off all day. All hands gave 60 Coy a cheer on their arrival &amp; after they were allotted their Tents they were dismissed &amp; soon both Corps were together again relating their trip to each other.  <br/>Wednesday.16/5/17.<br/>After Breakfast we were paraded for a Route March through the Town. At 10.30 a.m. the Bugle sounded &amp; we formed up in our Platoons &amp; marched out of Camp &amp; followed the Train Route down the Hill on the way down we were further charmed at the beautiful scenery &amp; private Residences as we passed the Casino a very large building some one Cooed &amp; several Nurses came out &amp; cheered us they were Australians &amp; the Casio was being used as a Hospital, we noticed a few of our Lads walking about, as the streets were very narrow &amp; not to clean &amp; the Roads very rough we soon began to feel tired.</p>
