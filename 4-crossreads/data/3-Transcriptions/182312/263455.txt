<p>as it does through the garden county of Kent.&nbsp; A pretty little</p>
<p>village here abouts is Orpington.&nbsp; It had never occurred to me that</p>
<p>our well known domestic hen had received her name from the village of</p>
<p>her origin.&nbsp; But here she is in thousands, supplying the British</p>
<p>breakfast table with eggs at 4/9 per dozen.&nbsp; The whole village appears to be given up to poultry (which is not hard to understand</p>
<p>with eggs at that price) and the arrangements of the runs and shelters</p>
<p>appear to be on a model plan and one which should leave no room for</p>
<p>complaint from the hens.&nbsp; In the days when eggs were plentiful,</p>
<p>before the Zeppelins came over and put the hens off their lay, nobody</p>
<p>would buy an egg that wasn&#39;t a fair size, but nowadays they are not</p>
<p>sorted and one has to take the small with the big.&nbsp; Whether the</p>
<p>poultry farmers are taking advantage of this and exploiting a breed</p>
<p>of hen which will lay two small eggs ber day instead of one large one</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know, but the proportion of small eggs seems to be on the</p>
<p>increase.&nbsp; Some of them look as if they had been laid by a Willy</p>
<p>Wagtail, and rattle about in your egg cup in a most elusive fashion.</p>
<p>And when you do manage to secure him and cut a slice off the top</p>
<p>sufficient to insert a spoon, you find there is nothing left of the</p>
<p>egg!&nbsp; We are delayed a day at Folkestone whilst the mine sweepers get</p>
<p>busy.&nbsp; Fritzland had made one of his destroyer raids the night before</p>
<p>and it was thought that possibly he may have left a few mines behind.</p>
<p>The route is at last declared clear and away we go leaving the darkened</p>
<p>shores of England behind at the rate of over 20 knots.&nbsp; On either</p>
<p>side of us can just be discerned the long low hulls of our convoy</p>
<p>racing along on a parallel course to our own.&nbsp; Soon we are in France,</p>
<p>and now the rush begins.&nbsp; Officers and men are here who are bound</p>
<p>for every position of the British line - from the Sea to the Somme.</p>
<p>Perhaps their unit has been moved since they left it.&nbsp; Where is it now?</p>
