 25.6.15 sundown, the Howitzers that has been arriving lately opened fire on the Turks opposite Popes Hill.  I believe they were testing a new explosive, however they appeared to be doing good work, only about 6 shells were fired by us &amp; then the Turks took up the running with high explosive shrapnel, they had the range to a nicety but only one man was wounded, he received a compound fracture of the left arm &amp; was a B Sq. reinforcement.  A German Taube flew over us this afternoon &amp; dropped some papers on the Turks, (I suppose it is the Turks pay day) shells have been bursting in the gully at intervals all the afternoon but they have done no damage.  Received some pills from the Dr. to-night.  Chanak in flames on account of the bombardment this afternoon.
