<p>no one here but ourselves.<br/>We go to Jericho in three instalments, starting tomorrow at 4 ac emma we journey even unto Bethany which is distant three Kilos from Jerusalem along the via Doloroso &ndash; Tensan &ndash; Jerichosa. Tarrying there until the sun is low again we gird up our loins &amp; journey forth to Talat Ed Durum  in the direction of the Moabites, &amp; having eaten &amp; drunken &amp; (possibly) anointed ourselves on evening late of the third day</p>
