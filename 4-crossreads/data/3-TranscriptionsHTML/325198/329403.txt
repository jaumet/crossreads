<p>1 Dec, 1916<br/>Bayoud<br/>I'll do a bit of scribbling to use up the last bit of light left to the day, its a grey evening, quite exceptional here &amp; the crescent moon usually so bright just has an occasional dim glimpse of us.  Ive had a lazy day been reading all the day.  Buezie came in with a "wire" to the effect that El Arish was to be taken shortly &amp; the Light horse would then shift to a <u>new</u> front,  The "tale" is so old that it ought to be sung to the tune Annie Laurie or some thing of the like.  Harold has had a most wonderful excess of energy lately,  He &amp; Mc have clipped all the troop horses, they finished up today with the aid of the machines.</p>
