My darling Eddy,
I wonder what Santa gave you this year. Suppose you are having a very Happy Holiday now. We had a great day with our poor wounded soldiers. They all had plenty of good things to eat   &  drink.
We were very busy with preparing the decorations all last week   &  then started to put them up on Sunday.
Heaps of love   &  kisses
FromXOXOXOXOXO Auntie Eadle
