<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd May. We were warned to go up the line &amp; join our battalion. The trip was interesting we went in open trucks on the light railway passing through the shell shattered country to Bapume&nbsp; ( ? Bapaume) Posiers ( ?Pozieres) included, from there were marched to a village named Vaux. we were&nbsp; supposed to stay the night, but fritz was shelling the villiage so our officers thought it advisable to move back a mile to a trench in an open paddock. A few shells came over but at a safe distance , as far as we were concerned a couple of horses were killed a few hundred yards from us. It was raining fairly heavy , and there was no dry spots and the heavy guns were firing near us, so we did not sleep too well being our first experience, and not used to the noise</p>

<p>22nd May Was a day of waiting, as we were to move on up to the line at dusk, and I could not explain ones feelings going onto action. the first time one does not&nbsp; not know the real dangers . and it is a novel experience, but it was rather a rough trip on,&nbsp; The battalian had to hold the line in the salient at Bullecourt.</p>
