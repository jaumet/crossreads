I am afraid this is rather an uninterresting letter for you Mother but but I've spent nearly all this week playing chess, writing or reading, so there is nothing to write home about. The chap that has been teaching me to play chess has went to hospital this morning I'm sorry to say. He was a jolly decent chap. I'll have to look round for some body else now. Bill West plays I think so I'll challange him next time he is round this way. I dont think I'll send that power of attorney back for a while. I have not got any registered envelopes at present. Love to Father and Fred & yourself Mother. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson
P.S. Bill just came along and has accepted my chess challenge.
