 Mon. JAN. 1st 1917.  The great day at last.  Last night things passed off quietly as we were too tired to play up.  Sullings was on Cookhouse picket till midnight, so he woke all hands when he came to Bed & made them usher in the New Year.  Kept very busy all day making final arrangements.  As the time drew near for the Concert to start I got very jumpy, but the show went off wonderfully well.  The first part was splendid, but the second half was a bit drawn out.  Dodson, as Boko, the waiter, was a scream.  After the Show we had a little conviviality behind the scenes. 
 Tues. 2.  Slept in till about 10.  Everyone delighted with the Concert.  The Col. wants us to show in Vignacourt for the 5th  Div. so we are mighty busy getting things going again.
