<p>September 11th: -<br/>To-day there was the same joy awaiting us below, for we ran and pushed and tugged at ward fittings from 9 am until 5 pm.

<p>September 12th: -<br/>&nbsp;A beautiful day throughout &amp; work proclaimed off, it being the Sabbath. Divine service held at 11 am, Major Patterson officiating.</p>
<p>September 13th: -<br/>This morning was extremely cool and windy, sea being choppy in consequence.
