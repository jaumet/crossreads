<p>6 August 1916<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>Cold night under the appletree. Go on duty again at 8 a.m. bit of a rush slackens off about9.30 a.m. A beautiful morning, but one hardly realizes it is Sunday  The peaceful quiet is broken by the heavy boom of artillery from the firing line presaging more broken limbs &amp; mangled bodies, -- the pity &amp; horror of it. All day long the street is crowded with the impedimenta of war, trolleys, waggons, cars etc etc.</p>
<p>Left to do duty on own heavy day's work. Knock off at 8 p.m.</p>
