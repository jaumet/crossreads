 24.1.19 7 a.m. off Port Said took in a pilot & moored in the entrance of the Suez Canal at 9 a.m.  1 p.m. had orders to proceed to Alexandria.  So left at 6 p.m.  There we met the Empress of Russia full of Chow labor Corp. going to China, the Norman & Kaisgar [Kashgar] & received news by wireless of the Wyreema being in the Red Sea bound for Egypt.  Also received mails from Australia for the 1st time during the last 2 months.  The port of Port Said being full of shipping & very short of coal.  So having a few hundred tons left we proceeded to Alexandria & will coal there having heard that we are to embark troops there for Marsaielles. 
 25.1.19 At 3 p.m. arrived at Alexandria.  No escort to meet us as before the armistice.  10 trawlers were seen dragging for mines steaming from the Port of Alexandria entrance towards Port Said along the coast.  We anchored in side the harbour, the submarine nets & mines having been removed from the entrance.  The Naval Transport officer came off & told us we were to proceed to dry dock tomorrow.  The harbour is full of shipping, cargo & troop transports.  Here we met two commandeered Russian liners, now run by the Cunard line of Liverpool.  The Czar & Czaritza both taking in troops one for Marsailes & the other for Salonika.  The Greek commandeered liner Patricia was also here & the Assaye the later taking troops to England.
