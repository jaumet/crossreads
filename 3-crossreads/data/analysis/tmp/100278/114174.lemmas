 the Capt kept go never look back and there gradual appear a gap between the Capt and myself which gradual widen until there was a good 80 yard separ us and the mob straggl out behind like a mob of sheep. It was too bad so I doubl forward to the Capt and told him that he was march too fast for the men " too fast " he said , whi ca n't they keep up , I suppos it is the Coy who are so tire , no it is not the Coy I said for the Bomber are in front of us and we natur are not go to pass them , howev he said no more and I drop back and got all the Bomber and the Coy block up and march proper onli at a steadier pace , about 300 yard further on the Capt halt his men and when we came up he start to lectur us and then an argument start with a big chap
