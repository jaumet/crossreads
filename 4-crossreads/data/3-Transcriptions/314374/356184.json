<p>42nd Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<p>The 42nd Battalion A.I.F. &ndash; which was known as the "Australian Black Watch" &ndash; (having its own pipe band), has a record in the great war of which it can be justly proud.</p>
<p>It was formed (with Northern Rivers N.S.W. and Southern Queensland men) in February 1916, embarked on June 5, arrived at Egypt on July 7, in England July 23, embarked for France on November 25, went into the front line on Christmas Eve 1916, and remained in or near the front line till October 2, 1918, during which time it took part in twelve battles, and 450 of its members made the supreme sacrifice.</p>
<p>In 1920 a Reunion Committee (with Headquarters in Brisbane) was formed and is a very live body.  Since then yearly reunion dinners have been held in Brisbane, the average attendance being 90.  The Battalion presented to the 42nd Battalion A.M.F. a flag (bearing on it the names of all the engagements in which the Battalion had taken part) and also voted a sum of money for competitions, to encourage and foster the spirit of the Mother 42nd Battalion.</p>
<p>It also furnished a room for its own use in the Anzac Club, Brisbane and erected therein a fine Honor Roll containing the names of the 450 men of the Battalion who were killed.</p>
<p>A Union Jack Flag (presented to the Battalion by the citizens of Grafton in 1916 &ndash; and taken by the Battalion to England and France) together with a Battalion Colours flag, were handed over to the citizens of Grafton on Anzac Day 1930 and now hang in the Grafton Cathedral.</p>
<p>At present the Battalion history is being compiled.</p>
