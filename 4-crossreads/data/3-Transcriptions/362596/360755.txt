<p>France<br/>29/7/17<br/>Dear May<br/>Just a few lines to let you know I am still going strong over here. It is a long time since I have heard from you but guess you have not been able to decipher that letter I wrote to you in French it only took me two hours to write it. Trusting you all are enjoying the very best of health as this scrawl leaves me at present.<br/>I remain your loving Uncle<br/>Clarence</p>
