 Box Hill&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R &amp; A  7.2.17. 6th. Feb. '17. My dear Father, You really have been too good to me writing so often, and you must not do it so frequently from now on.  Do you know yours of 28th. Jan just came to hand this morning with Mother's &amp; Le's letters enclosed. They had been sent on to Sassafras by W. Oakley from here on Wednesday evening &amp; at the same time he had posted Doris a note in which he mentioned having posted them to me, (that &amp; another) &amp; I should have received them on the Thursday morning with hers.  I went down to the Sassafras P.O. again in the afternoon &amp; enquired about them but they said they knew nothing of them.  They used often to annoy me there by the careless way they left letters anywhere about in the P.O. &amp; I believe they have been there all the time kicked into some out of the way corner.    It was good of Mother to write too &amp; she must have had such a busy time with the visitors. Then yesterday morning came your letter enclosing Leo's letter to you &amp; Professor Watt's re Wal.  I was very glad to have more details about poor old Leo's doings, &amp; most interested &amp; proud to read the Professor's.  I will return them both, and thank you.  Yesterday afternoon came another from you 2nd Feb, dear me I thought I was rich indeed.  Was rather startled to hear that you had expected Uncle Bertie so soon, had no idea of it
