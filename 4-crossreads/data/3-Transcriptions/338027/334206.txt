<p>Wednesday, 7 July, 1915<br/>We got through a remarkable number of dressings, &amp; extractions in the theatre to-day, this is the work I love, Capt Fowler could not be nicer, it is a pleasure to work with him, he explains every wound &amp; operation to us, and even lets us do extracting, I am quite an accomplished surgeons assistant now, I help with the dressings and am right handed on the operation table, the worse the case the more I like it.</p>
<p>All the bearers of H section rejoin us to-day and we are all going back to Alex to re-organise the corp, Capt. Fraschi and 10 men are on a mine sweeper operating in the Dardanelles.  We have 400 men on board and as there are plenty of orderlies &amp; six nurses it ought to be a good ship.  We left Mudros at dusk and as we passed the line of battleships, the sailors on the Prince George played their band as a farewell to some of the brave lads, they all cheered, for Jack likes to cheer Tommy when he knows he deserves it.  The French are the funniest of the lot they try to cheer like the British but in broken English.</p>
<p>Thursday, 8 July, 1915<br/>A big sea running all day and this old tub rolls in a calm, consequently there were a lot sea sick, the two doctors got sick in the theatre, it was great fun sterilizer instruments &amp; all went over once , we had two interesting operations to-day, the taking out of a shattered eye with a shrapnel bullet, and a venereal operation.  Most of our patients on this trip are Britishers, there are a few bad medical cases mostly enteric fever and dysentery, three of our own chaps are down with it.</p>
