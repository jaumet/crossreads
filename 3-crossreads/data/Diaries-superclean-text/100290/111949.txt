Assisted Naisby prepare killed of yesterday for burial. Rather gruesome task. Pin them up in a blanket bury. Poor chaps.
Drill all day. Big Australian mail in. Receive 10 letters. from home different ones. Take walk up road with Cart. Net. saw tree place where bomb fell. Terrific force, shattered large tree, cut iron nails like cheese. Bombardments carried on all night.
Met Jack Coulthart.
