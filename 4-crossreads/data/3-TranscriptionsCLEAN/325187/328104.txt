[Thursday 28 December 1916]
Rum issued last night, the first for many days-  Bought a very poor fowl & 2 Eggs for 2/- from the Natives in El Arish.Forage & Rations are being landed in surf boats from Steamers outside-  No bay or harbour of any sort.  The Navy had bombarded the Fort to ruins- reminds one of ANZAC. Tin of Kero from Turks proves to be Cylinder oil but it helps boil the Billy & a pair of gloves from a Turkish Officer are keeping my hands warm.  I was not away Collecting Papers & Documents perhaps of Military value to get much LOOT.
