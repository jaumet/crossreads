<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Friday 15<br/>Artillery Lane Station.</p>
<p>Very good day indeed but during the afternoon news received that a general attack will be made at 4 oclock in the morning mainly on the left. They say that a disparate attempt will be made to get right through this time.<br/>Stormy times ahead.<br/>I sincerely hope &amp; pray that it will be successful if that is what is intended.</p>
