<p>mostly French here.<br/>Last lot of B &amp; C just left 7 30 per train for Cairo about 6 hour trip.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2nd Feb. 1915.<br/>Just finished loading our kits &amp; trucking our horses &amp; on the train bound for Cairo. Our journey by water over, after a record trip losing only ten horses &amp; the rest in splendid condition, in fact some of them better than when they went aboard. I am sure my horse looks better, never had a thing wrong with him all through.</p>
<p>We are travelling through some fine country, all irrigated, every thing beautiful a green, tis all laid out in little blocks like one great huge garden, seems to be all lucerne &amp; barley. The barley is much the same as our own but the lucerne is a bit different, they call another name, but I can't think of what it is now.</p>
<p>Just passing through some of the lower classes quarters &amp; quaint looking places they are,  built of mud &amp; go up to a peak with a window in the top puts one in mind of a great ant bed, to see the way they are built in close to one another that they only had a limited amount of ground to build on</p>
