18-1-16Tue 18thWent out for signalling practice again this morning & led the pack horse out for exercise; This afternoon it was showery again & no parade I went to the 2nd L.H. to try & find my black kit bag but with no success;
I had to hand over the Helio & Stand, also Field glasses to Traill this afternoon as he is going with 3 H.Q.sigs tomorrow morning with A Troop, A Sqd to some place on the Nile & 35 miles from here, they have to work 3 sig stations, & are on patrol to keep any enemy away as they are afraid they would turn the canal in the Nile, which is quite close & cut off Alexandrias water supply at least that is what we are told
