<p>20-12-16<br/>Wed 20th<br/>Had orders early this morning to move to Gererat as the 3rd Bde is coming here to Gimal, we arrived at Gererat at 1 oclock this afternoon &amp; just got settled when we were told we are to start out at 6 oclock tonight &amp; are to attack El Arish early tomorrow morning., we have been kept on the bustle all day we are only allowed to take a pair of socks &amp; a spare shirt with us &amp; the rest is being sent to Kilo 128. I have put what signalling gear we cannot do without into 2 panniers &amp; sending two back; Sergt Browne who does all the QM work for Head Q stayed at Gimal till sundown which gave us a good deal of extra work.</p>
