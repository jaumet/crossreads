1917 Monday 26 March
The service of last evening was very simple sincere. Ptes. Clarke Crowden conducted spoke well feelingly of him whom we all honoured admired in life now in death mourned a true loyal comrade gone from our ken. 
Had a short stroll this afternoon gathered a few ivy leaves from the moss covered boles of some shattered trees in Becourt Wood. Cold, rainy snowing again today.
