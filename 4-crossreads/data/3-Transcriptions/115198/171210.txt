<p>At the end of March when the casualties had improved we went back to No. 4. It was like going home.<br/>We were busy in the Isolation ward when a parcel arrived from Harrod's - my very good friends in Honolulu sent it. I wondered how it ever arrived as it followed me from France to Salonica. The troops and I were very excited about opening it, and we all sent letters to say 'thank you'.<br/>Divisions in Salonica - English 4. French 8. Greeks 9. Serbs 6. (very small)<br/>Sat. April 7th. received order to leave. We were being taken over by the British hospital. Forty new nursing sisters arrived, we took inventories and left all in order. Got final orders to leave at 9 a.m. so packed our stretchers and slept on the floor. April 17th. still sleeping on the floor so decided to put stretchers back again and then on to duty in the dysentry ward. Our sailing was cancelled as too many ships had been torpedoed.<br/>Had afternoon tea at 605, were we met Miss Flora Sands, an Irish woman Sergeant Major in the Serbian Army. A most interesting person. She was a V. A. D. in Serbia for 18 months and when the Serbs were retreating and had lost their leaders, she picked up a rifle and told them to follow her. Ever since she has been called the 'Joan of Arc' of the Serbian Army. She had been wounded 17 times with shrapnel and was just out of hospital on her way back to the front. When I met her she had been decorated with the Cross of Kara George for conspicious bravery on the field. We had a long talk in which she told us of her experiences. She mentioned how she missed the English papers and books, so we were happy to help out by giving her any we had. We saw her several times and always enjoyed her company.<br/>June. 2 1917 had a very good time at 605. Went to the Base M. T. concert, met Captains Rule, Collas and Burfitt at the 3rd Achelon. Also visited submarine E14. and had tea with Mr. Dickinson. Returned to No. 4 Hospital where 50 English patients had arrived, the M.O. was a Mr. Cato. The first few days were chaotic but eventually things straightened out.<br/>Whilst waiting for transportation we were sent where needed.<br/>Several officers and nursing sisters went for a picnic up the Monastir Rd. to the Cherry Farm. Had an interesting time* and met the celebrated Serbian officers and invited them to afternoon tea with us. The conversation was limited as our french was bad and their English worse. They were interested in the songs our troops were singing. We sang most of the patriotic ones, but they said "Teep-a-ree -ree", and so we all joined in with "Tipperary". We had come in an ambulance, but they suggested we return to the Camaderie Mess in their car, so that they could get acquainted with our Colonel. Frequently afterwards the Royal Serbian band gave a concert in the open for the patients and ourselves.</p>
