Saturday 28 October 1916A bitterly cold night but got a good sleep. One or two showers during the day but in general it was fairly fine & our planes were not slow to take advantage of the opportunity of spying out enemy territory. More or less on the spot all the day with very little to do. Mud still atrocious.
