lots of clothing & treasures.  The Military are not responsible & she cannot send in a claim.  Rather disgusting to think that we cannot have proper protection from robbers.  It makes one very anxious about luggage.  I know I should be awfully annoyed if my trunk had been stolen.

Sorry I could not write on some of the photos but thought Mr. Censor may get them.
