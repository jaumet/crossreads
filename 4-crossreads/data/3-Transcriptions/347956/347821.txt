<p>Sat 12th<br/>Last night the lads off the Clan Macquodale arrived sometime about midnight.  it is marvellous how well all the horses look, all the horses have been led about constantly every day &amp; appear to be as fresh &amp; lively as when we left Sydney.  I do not think they would <strike>would</strike> would feel being ridden a few miles per day.</p>
<p>Yesterday we were told on parade that one of the New Zealanders had pulled the veil off one of the Egyptian women &amp; paid the penalty by having his throat cut from ear to ear.  we have seen a couple of native funerals since we came here.  have been practicing signalling to-day &amp; yesterday.</p>
