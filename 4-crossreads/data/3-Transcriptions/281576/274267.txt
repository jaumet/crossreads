<p>Mon. Aug. 27   Slept in this morning &amp; did not appear on Parade.  Weather very rough, raining heavily &amp; cold wind blowing.  There is a little girl at the Farm named Marie.  She dodges in &amp; out of our billet &amp; is a great  favourite among the boys.  Yesterday I got quite a big bunch of mail. 4 Letters from Lill, 1 from Mother, 2 from France &amp; one from Nell.  Everybody well, thank Goodness, but surprised to hear that France is going to one of the Fronts.<br/>Wrote Letter No 31 to M.S.</p>
<p>Tues. Aug 28  Orderly Corpl.  Wet, miserable day.  Had my meals in the Cookhouse.  Tomorrow "Doug" Haig inspects the Division &amp; the crowd are busy polishing their gear.  Fierce, cold wind blowing.  Quite a lot of trees blown down, &amp; stacks upset.</p>
<p>Wed. Aug 29  Still raining &amp; the wind stronger than ever.  Some of our chaps had to go out &amp; clear away trees that had fallen across the road.  My word the crowd did look well as the marched away for the Inspection.  As my gear was not cleaned up I was excused, so stayed in the Billet &amp; wrote Letters.  Read a good yarn "The Amateur Gentleman".  After Tea went for a stroll through La Belle Croix &amp; several; other villages with Payney &amp; F. Woods.</p>
<p>Thur. 30.  Gas Helmet drill &amp; Route March. We have no duties after Dinner.  Sent "Anzac Bully" &amp; P. Cd's Havre &amp; Rouen to Lill.  We should have been paid today, but it didn't come off.  We are hoping it will happen tomorrow as everyone is broke.  Jack Daunt &amp; Bluey Stanton got their passes for Blighty.  They leave tomorrow.</p>
