<p>Went Cairo Pay Office on Reg. Buisness- The Rabbits I cultivated ere I went to Anzac are still about the Camp notwithstanding several Mongoose or should it be Mongeese which were once imported into Australia with the idea of Killing the Pest.  Here the mongoose is fairly numerous I once found one in a Rabbit Pit outback.<br/>I believe there is good snipe &amp; Duck shooting where we are going I wish I had my gun, as there will be no Turkey shooting for sometime.</p>
