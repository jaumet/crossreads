<p>The chief local colour is made up of low scrub about 2 ft. high average on sandy clay with stones &amp; gravel.  The scrub is greenish with nice dead stuff showing grey purple here &amp; there.  I propose getting a record of the various plants &amp; flowers.</p>
<p>In the gullies there are relics of cultivation &amp; olive groves, but fortunately all this patch of the world has a distinctive character and when the God, whom you and I have come to worship, simply because he has been so much hidden during our lives, deigns to look out of his possie I think that my touring England and country here at the wrong time may be justified.</p>
<p>It will be difficult to keep up a correspondence with the boys so suggest that if my letters pass your censorship they may be passed on.</p>
