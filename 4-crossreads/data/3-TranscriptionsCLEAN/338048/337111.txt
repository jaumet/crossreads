  
 A hospital train in which the nurses could be seen moving about. We went to Waterloo Stn & then were dismissed. A motor bus took Pynor & I to the Tottenham Court Rd Y.M.C.A. where we booked beds at 1/6 including breakfast left our overcoat & haversack and set out for a look about. 
 We strayed about, and tried a tube just for the experience You put a penny in a slot & there's your ticket. After walking along to the stair you stand on the top step & in a short time you are on the bottom one. If you are in a hurry you can walk down these continuously moving stairways & of course we were in a hurry. We got out of the tube at Westminster Bridge Road because the name sounded good, had to pay a penny because we had come too far for a penny ticket, strayed about and found ourselves in front of the Houses of Parliament. 
 A policeman let us in & after signing books etc got into [indecipherable] Stranger's Gallery where questions were being answered. In reply to a question as to why munitions were being imported the ministry stated they were producing at home as much as they possibly could. For example sulphuric acid. There is now a plant in England which produces twice the pre-war product of all English plants,  the  at a cost equal to 1/4 of the cost of imported product fixed a few months ago. This plant will pay for itself in 9 mos. We heard other things discussed, had a little supper & went to bed.
