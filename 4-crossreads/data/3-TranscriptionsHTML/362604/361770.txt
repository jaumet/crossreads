<p>Opera House" now a Picture Show.  It is a glorious place.  Lovely Halls, Lounge, Marble stair cases etc., all Pink carpeted with good-looking Lady attendants dressed in Pink Jackets &amp; Knee Breaches to match.  I caught the 8.13 p.m. to Bulford &amp; after 1&frac14; sit in the train in the cold at Salisbury we eventually reached this <u>nice</u> Place at 1.30 a.m.  I am just recovering from it.  Well my Dears, we are both well &amp; as I am expecting a visitor &amp; have some work to do, I'll wish you &amp; all Neighbours &amp; Friends, the Best of all Good Things.</p>
