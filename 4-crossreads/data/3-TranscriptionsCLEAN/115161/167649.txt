  
 "refresher" resulting in their memories getting blurred or their brains!! becoming fatigued.  Another reason put forward was that the authorities being acquainted with the erratic behaviour of the railways and the pace which the trains travelled, had decided that by marching the distance we should arrive at our destination much sooner, and they had met the business half-way as it were, by training part of the way and marching the other part.  Brilliant idea certainly.  But we could not bring ourselves to believe the latter, so accepted the former as being the most likely from a military point of view. 
 We arrived at Buire about midnight, the empty train reaching the same place some hours later. 
 It was always the better way when travelling by train, to walk a certain distance and then sit down and wait for the train to catch you up, and then when you are sufficiently rested get out and walk on again, and keep on repeating the performance.  It breaks the journey and gives your legs exercise, whereas if you remain in the train all the time the only portion of your anatomy which receives any benefit, is the tongue, from the continuous flow of language which you hurl at the French railways in general, but this train in particular.  Then you start to worry because the adjectives at your disposal are so limited in number.  Your vocabulary is exhausted.  You wish that you had studied French so that you could give expression to your feelings in their language.  Not that it would make the slightest difference, but it would relieve your mind considerably. 
 The main thing in this case is that we have arrived at Buire and we are "out for a rest".
