Washed clothes & had another swim in the Somme this afternoon. In the evening I discovered a canteen, had a little cake & some chocolate, & relieved the cigarette famine (born of the sudden advance) for myself & some of the tent sub. as well.
The village of Vaire, where the canteen was situated was originally just behind the firing line after the March offensive of Fritz. Considering this it is not very much knocked about. I fancy that when we captured Villers Brettoneux he must have fallen back here as well, to readjust his line. Even that would not explain its comparative immunity from wholesale damage.
