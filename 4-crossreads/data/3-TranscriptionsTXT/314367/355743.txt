Wednesday Feb 3-15 -  Oh - this is a variety show & we just come & go - I was very fit this morning because I had been most careful last eveg - Nothing wd make me take a drink after dinner - only a lemon squash - Besides I had two young medicoes with me - The guests were happy when they left - very happy as we saw them down the gangway - Serve them right said No 1 - they were very hospitable to us & it was up to us to see them 'out & under' - That's the naval Spirit - I was up early & held sick parade & then got the whaler - 8 men & I went about the harbor in style - visiting ships where I had patients - I finally pulled up at the Garrison Hospital with a Sailor man who had a bad arm - I opened it there & dressed it & then signalled Fantome & they sent a boat in for me - On going inboard I found that the Fantome was to return to Sydney - Presently Skeete of the Una sent me a note saying I was going to the Una & he to the Fantome & asked me to lunch on the Una - The Una is to be up here a year - I am told - Fairly cool I reckoned - There had been a Buz about the Fantome going South
