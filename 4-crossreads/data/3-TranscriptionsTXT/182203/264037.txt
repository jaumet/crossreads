April 5th  1916.My dearest Mother,It is nearly twelve months since I left Vic. some times it seems years &  then only a few weeks since. I do hope you are all well  & happy also things are going well with you.I've just fixed up a parcel for you dear ones, & I shall send another in a few days. They are a few articles I intended to bring home when I went on transport to Australia.It looks as if we were moving to another part of the world so thought it best to send the presents home. Hope you will like them. I did intend to buy some brassware but now we are too far away from the shops of Cairo. If I get a chance before we leave & shall send some.I want the girls to choose between themselves, which  Kimono they like best. I've got three, one each - This parcel has two (2) in, a silk (black) shawl for your dear self, a pink scarf, (given to me by a wounded soldier) which I want
