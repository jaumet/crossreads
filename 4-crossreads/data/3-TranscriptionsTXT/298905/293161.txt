leave is getting very close, & a chap must have a clean pair of pants to have a look at England in.I hear that Lieut Davidson was shot dead accidently yesterday by some of our chaps at the musketry school  I feel sorry for his mother for she has lost both husband & son now in this war Major Davidson was a bonzer chap & he was killed at "Lone Pine" on the 18th August last year, we were all very sorry he went under  The days are very long here now its light at 9 oclock in the evening & again at 3 oclock in the morning so you see we don't have much darkness to sleep in. I have seen a good few partridges & hares about here at times but of course they are out of season for shooting
