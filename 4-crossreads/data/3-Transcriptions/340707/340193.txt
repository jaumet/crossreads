<p>I may add that for to night I have taken off my belt &amp; stars &amp; appears as a real digger.</p>
<p>When matters began to quieten a little here we descend to the Boulevards again &amp; about 4.30 am I think breakfast would be nice &amp; as I know a nice little restaurant in Rue Reelle which is open all night or at least in the early morning for Les Halles we go there only to find place crowded &amp; that no more are being admitted</p>
<p>We try other places with same result &amp; then adjourn to first to await our turn. Inside I sample the famous Soupe de l'oignon which is only bread soup with a concoction of cheese on top no onion is visible hence the name.</p>
<p>At 6 am I take a trip to see if it would be possible to see procession as Brise wishes to see it. To go along Boulevarde is absolutely impossible &amp; as we are near end of route Champs Elysee is out of the question.</p>
<p>Seeing the ground a little elevated some distance from curb with a street that has not been closed up. We take up our stand with 2 hours to wait for commencement of procession &amp; another 2 hours before it reaches us &amp; then it comes.</p>
