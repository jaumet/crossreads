The Lion are fine , one old Lioness , was busi with a piec of meat and her three cub , were prowl round the cage . The Zoo is out toward the Pyramid from Cairo , about 30 minut ride in the train for which you pay Piastr . On Sunday we went out to the Pyramid . Saw the Sphynx also the Templ of the Sphynx . We did not have time to climb the Pyramid of Cheop , or go insid , The guid want 3/ - to take us round but we refus to have anyth to do with him , so at least he came down . The next man want near as much to take us insid the Pyramid , so we did not bother tri to beat him down , when the first Brigad came over here and found that everi thing was cheap they just spent their money for spend sake , and now thing that were sold for a few Milliemm cost as mani Piastr for the Nativ were not slow to see that the Australian did not know the valu of his money in Egypt , and up went the price I thought
