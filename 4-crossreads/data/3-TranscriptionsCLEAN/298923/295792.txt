6 May 1918 MondayJerusalemOn train for Ludd, 3 days in Cairo leave- had a hot bath at Fast Hotel bought some Tucker & hope to catch a train tonight at Ludd for Kantara.Very tired but happy in going to [see] wife.  Caught [indecipherable] train for Kantara [indecipherable].   Brought a bottle of Jordan water for the little Trumpeter when he arrives-   I had to fight to get it so no more worthy use can be made of it- give the KID a good start in life!!!
