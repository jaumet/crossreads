<p>Saturday 18th December 1915<br/>A start made on new diary the same time as my second year of the great war, that is my second year, starts, and a new era is about to commence from an operation occurring to the evacuation of portions of the Peninsular a move which may have far reaching results as yet undreamt of.  I am curious to know what will be Australia's opinion &amp; the world at large.  If as seems likely we have left the Turk, it is with feelings of respect and admiration for his fair, brave, &amp; honourable fighting qualities, the more so as we did not expect them.  I spent the afternoon on board the "Swiftsure" learning various items of news such as "Haigh" taking command in France, Smith-Dorrien, in East Africa, our flight in Servia, Italy, help coming through Albania etc &amp; the commencement of the final evacuation of Anzac etc. as usual I spent a good afternoon yarning &amp; brought away with me 100 Egytptian Cigarettes &amp; 2 tins of tobacco.</p>
<p>Sunday 19th December<br/>Still fine weather.  Sent off a couple of pe'pes to my friend on the "Swiftsure".  More troops arrived today &amp; the island must hold now its greatest complement of Australians it ever has done.  Rather mild excitement on the Pier today, the crowd mobbed</p>
