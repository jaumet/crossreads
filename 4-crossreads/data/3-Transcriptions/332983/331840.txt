<p>letters. A terrific bombardment started at 2.45 P.M, it is now 6 P.M. and is still on. The Navy started at a quarter to three with 9 or 10 shots and then the Field Artillery opened up with time shrapnel. Today is windy and wet. In our wagon line you can hardly hear the report of the guns. One good thing about the wind , it is in our favour, and the rain has settled the dust. It is now almost dark, the bombardment is still on. I was watching it just now from a hill, shells bursting all along the line. During the afternoon the French 9.2 were at it, firing over on the Asiatic coast the Turks answered it, a few 6in shells in our lines, dangerously close, one just skipped over our horse lines and burst with a terrific noise<br/>16/11/1915<br/>8.30 Terrific thunderstorm, lightning very vivid. A fierce attack was on during the storm, rifle fire very strong. The R.N.D. captured 25 yards of communication trench yesterday. The Scottish were to advance and try to capture a trench. Today is cloudy, inclined to be cool. Our lines were visited by Capt Stewart</p>
