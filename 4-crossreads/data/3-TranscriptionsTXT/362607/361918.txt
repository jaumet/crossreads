Dear George, I will have to answer your letter by the next mail too. This is the little old Church that we visited. It is built in the form of a + [cross]. I wrote all about in a previous letter. We are both well & doing OK. Give our regards to all the Boys & to Mr Love too. We do not forget Him or any of the Boys. Now I must have my supper & go to bed. My 3 easy days are today Saturday & Sunday so this is Thursday night & I feel alright. Now, look after yourselves & we hope to hear that you all sleep well & happy. Love Harry
