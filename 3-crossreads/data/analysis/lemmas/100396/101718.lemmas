 I ca n't say how long we will be here not long though , just while some of the boat take on coal etc . I wish I could get ashor but there no chanc of that unless I swim . We got news to day from the front the first we have had sinc we left . thing in general seem to be go on much as ever . some of the lad are prepar for a swim I think I will join them . There 's absolut noth to write about so I will desist . Much love to one all From Alan L
