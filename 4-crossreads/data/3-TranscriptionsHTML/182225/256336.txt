<p>1916 &nbsp; SATURDAY 5 &nbsp; AUGUST</p>
<p>Cold in morning but warm towards mid-day. Bill Hunter &amp; Self were mess orderlies &amp; hut orderly. Two eighteen pounder &amp; 21 howitzers &amp; some waggons came for the division in morning and a lot more in afternoon. Mother came out for me at 4 pm but Campbell would not let me go till six although I was doing nothing. Had tea with mother at Country Hotel &amp; got a car after &amp; went for an hours run round Odstock &amp; a couple of other little villages &amp; it was wonderfully pretty. Stayed at the Country that night.</p>
