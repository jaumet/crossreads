<p>[Two photographs taken in London]<br/>1919<br/>May 27<br/>with, &amp; a ticket to go over Windsor Castle.  After dinner, went with a party over St Pauls Cathedral.  We went down into the crypt &amp; up into the whispering gallery.  The old guide was very keen to display his powers &amp; was very annoyed when some of the fellows displayed theirs as well, by whispering against the wall &amp; making people move on who were right across on the other side.  I also saw the picture "The light of the World".  It is in a very bad position &amp; one has to stand immediately in front of it to see it.  A little to one side or the other, &amp; the light spoils it. Hawker &amp; Grieve (two Australian airmen) had tried to fly the Atlantic but failed &amp; landed in the water when nearing their destination in Scotland.  They were to arrive this evening so made my way to Kings Cross Station to see them.  A dense crowd had collected along the route they were to take &amp; I took up a position at the rear of several people with a 3rd Div. Officer.  A party of Aussies</p>
