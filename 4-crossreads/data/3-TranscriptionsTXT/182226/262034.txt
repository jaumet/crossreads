Still at a loose end nobody loves us & nobody wants us.
The camp adjutant has turned out a brick & is trying to get us bedding & money.
We got 8/- each & our bedding so we are all right. No leave has been given but we have taken a look round Alex, we have no time to do the thing thoughly but from what I can see it is a much finer place than Cairo though not as large.
We got unspecified orders to be ready to move off at 11 p.m., most of our boys were the worse for the 8/- but we got away all right, 130 of us with no one in charge & are now on our way to Cairo.
Hooray, I will soon be back with the boys.
