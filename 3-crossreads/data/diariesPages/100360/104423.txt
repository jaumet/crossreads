Sat. Aug. 25 The farmers were all busy gathering their crops. In some places troops were assisting & seemed to be enjoying the fun. The train pulled up a couple of times near some orchards, which, needless to say, suffered at the hands of the crowd. The owners of the Fruit must have heaved a sigh of relief when the train moved off again. We managed to get a few hours sleep during the night, despite the bumping of the train & the very close proximity of ones bedfellows. It was about 4 p.m. when we left Rouen & we arrived at Etaples about 4.30 a.m. on Sun. 26

Here we obtained Tea from Y.M. & various canteens & had Breakfast & a wash. Quite a number of troop trains were pulled up here & we met Cosier, Bob Roberts & Gibson, who were on their way to the Officers training school at Aveloy. . Staff Hughes was also among them, but we did not see him. We left Etaples about 7.15 a.m. arriving at Calais at 10.30. Our next stop was St. Omer where a big number of troops detrained. We left here about 1 p.m. arriving at Ebblingham about 2.

Here we detrained & Murray & I wended our way in easy stages to a village called Racquingham. We met Geo. Watson on Ebbm station, who was on his way to Blighty, & he directed us to the Farm which are our H.Q. It was good to be among the old faces again. The sections are billeted at farms about ½ a mile away from each other. B sec. are at a Farm, in a big barn. After Tea we sat around & had a good old yarn, then I went to Bed, sleeping between Snowy Atherton & Archie Deed. I was jolly tired & soon went to sleep.
