  
 (1). An island sighted by "Sir William Prior" :- (2). Captain Purchas, A. M. C. suggests :- It is called "Billy" Goat Island. But as Bill has "Prior" right to it, perhaps we had better "Purchas" (e) it. Seeing a man "Weedon" in the garden, he thinks he will take the ship ashore and "Docker". He also thinks we shall "Gitsham" shells with our "Hand"(s) on the shore. The Island they say is covered with "Wells" made of "Stone". Between us and the Island we sighted Mother Carey's "Chicken", "And-'er-son", that is the reason why we "Weigall" so, because we can see someone "Brune" beer. "Johns-son"" has taken "Paddy" the bull-dog ashore to "Sewell" him on to the "Wally"-by. Sone ducklings being sighted, they were immediately persued by "Campling" into a cave, whereis one large FAT "Retallack"-tight, which we will catch and "Stewart". 
 We saw a girl on the Island, but as we got ashore we saw "horizon" us, so "O'Halloran", and fell into a "(B)lake", and got a "Goldstein" on his shirt collar. The Doctor was called and he said I am a "Scot-(to)-hellier", and the Chief Mate said Great "Evans" in this "Farqu(h)ar-ter" of the world who would have thought to have seen "Jacks'-son" eating "Edwards" Dessicated Soup, it is enough to make a fellow "Cut(h)-bert" altogether. Had he said, don't eat the soup, but a-"Varcoe"-d cream, we would not have minded the small "Gibbins". The whole affair was most "Harris"-ing. Nothing was doing to windward, but they thought it would "Dooley"-ward.
