Feb 1918slight internal complaint. Showery today.
Wednesday 13thA fairly wet day. A parcel from Rowena & Thompson got 2 so we are set up for luxuries
Thursday 14thAs usual. The gravel cement etc is brought up on a light railway which runs past our job. It is all dumped about 4 or 500 yds from us & we have to put it on track & push it along to the job. Today I was getting it when along came an Officer & started to "Roar" because he sayed I was taking his gravel. I argued for a while & moved on to another heap (there were several heaps close together) Was not there long when the same thing happened again so went to a very small heap right at one end - of course the idea is to get the easiest shoveling - Was hard at it when a Canaidian Officer came. He was so nice about me takeing his one & only little heap that I went back to the other. Of course some of it is or should be ours & anyhow it is all
