 1915 Aug. 15 Sun. Paid second visit to the Armenian Scouts this afternoon when a Patrol of Italian Scouts with some members of their Council were also present . The Armenians numbered about 35 &amp; looked very serviceable &amp; smart in their real Scout kit &ndash; they are really good on parade. The Italians were dressed in their Bersaglieri uniform. Everything went off very harmoniously. First occasion on which 2 Scout organisations in Cairo have met. Met Ben Champion at 6 p.m. &amp; we had a walk round the town. A1 to get some Wahroonga news.
