<p>28/2/16<br/>Suez Canal Zone<br/>Nothing especial to note, rode around this morning and stayed in this afternoon. The most circumstantial rumours flying around about leaving for France on the 16th March, the 2nd Division to go, the others when they are organized and sufficiently trained.</p>
<p>Promulgated three sentences of Court Martial in two cases 12 mos hard labour was inflicted for uncoupling a troop train. The formation of a Pioneer Battn and of a Brigade machine gun coy. are now going on. Lewis guns to be given us and the Bde. Company to be equipped with Vickers in their place. About 500 of the men's kit bags came out on the camels. Gambling tonight after dark. "Bet a lot &amp; win a lot" "On the heart &amp; on the spade".</p>
<p>29/2/16<br/>Shorts are a most rational &amp; comfortable part of a soldiers uniform and would be ideal for our Australian climate. Around as usual this morning and also this afternoon. Announced Capt Kennedy 23rd to be Major &amp; second in command here &ndash; my junior: Lanyon (Duntroon) reported and commenced work as Asst Adjutant. No word yet about our transfers to new units, rotten being so unsettled. Peacock returned this afternoon &ndash; put him under open arrest on a charge of absence without leave.</p>
<p>In rear of camp about 200 yards a railway track is being built up and &frac14; mile further in rear a 4 inch water pipe is being laid. Long strings of camels wending their way over the desert like long snakes laden with stores and water fantasses. A remarkable scene from hill tops, undulating sand and the blue of the canal vegetation westwards, the warships seeming to float on the sand too. Our men hard at work on the trenches digging and revetting and other parties putting out barbed wire. Using a good deal of French wire on our entanglements. The Pioneer Coy. and the Brigade Machine gun company are going to take a lot of men from us. It does hurt losing our old men who served through the trenches with us and who know their officers as well as we know them.</p>
