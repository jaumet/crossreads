some stunt. Marched about all night returned today. Arch Mc was here to see me. Hope to move back out of this. My heel is not improved any by that shrapnel splinter seems to be getting worse.

We moved over to the left again this morning near the Village of Vanx. Strikes me by the amount of guns that we will strike trouble if we stay about here.
3rd May 1917.
Yesterday we moved towards the in line open order and got into positions to the left of Bullecourt. The 2nd Division has been heavily engaged here. Am confused with the procedure of this stunt. The huns seem to be all round us, and fighting is proceeding on all sides. The trench I occupy is a part of the Hindenburg Line. It is very deep and wide.
