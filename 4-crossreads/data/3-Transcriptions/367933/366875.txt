<p>Dear Mrs Vernon<br/>The other day the regiment was issued with gift shirts etc. so I am writing these few lines just to convey our appreciation of the fine work our women at home are doing for Australia's soldiers. The time and labour given so freely in our interests is something too great to express in mere words, but the boys on whose behalf I am writing join with me in the prayer "God bless our women".  We are still in the desert and though we can't get to France as we should like, we are holding the Empire's end up here .<br/>With many thanks to all our comforts fund helpers.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>H.S. Smith</p>
