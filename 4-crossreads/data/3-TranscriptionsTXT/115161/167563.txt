 Daily, certain manouvres were gone through, such as running jumping, physical jerks, or something of the like nature, to keep us &quot;fit. Lectures on the contents and general &quot;ingredients&quot; and various shapes and formations of the latest man-destroying machinery were given by those who had taken a delight in studying such matters.

I remember that on more than one occasion the relieving guard had to get the rifle from an officer&#39;s cabin.
