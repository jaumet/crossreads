<p>Noon brought my next excitement in the shape of dinner. A large bowl containing "Saur Kraut" and hot water. The odour of the stuff is repulsive, despite my extreme hunger, I could not eat more than one mouthful, which sickened me immediately. Several Russians staring wildly, with eager anticipation of the result, rushed to my bed as soon as I placed the bowl upon the floor. Then a scene of fisticuffs commenced.

For a few moments I lay astounded, wondering why such awful struggles were made over a bowl of rubbish like that. I watched the Russian Jew, who ate ravenously as he walked away; with eager repetition he thrust his fingers into the bowl and crammed the cabbage into his mouth.

Towards evening several Huns approached his bed and watched him for a few minutes, then tightened the straps. He died a few hours later. Pte. Moore also of my Batt. had a leg amputated and shared Smith's fate. None of the English were able to assist these men, owing to their own severe wounds.

Everybody's wounds are discharging profusely, and the odious smells in the ward are almost unendurable.</p>
