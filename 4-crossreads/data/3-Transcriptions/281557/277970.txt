<p>2<br/>V. C.  (by a modest Private)<br/>&amp; drowned those who fell in their sleep<br/>We fought we charged we battled<br/>Till the eighth line of trenches we took<br/>For every man there was a hero<br/>From me to the poor old cook<br/>&amp; there was the knoll just before us<br/>Some two hundred paces or more<br/>With barbed wire entanglements glistening<br/>&amp; the parapets slippery with gore<br/>&amp; the Howitzers roared like perdition<br/>&amp; vomited fire &amp; death<br/>Till we saw it was madness to charge them<br/>so halted a moment for breath.<br/>Then up came our gallant major<br/>His face lit with hopes cheering bliss<br/>Pass the word for pte juggins<br/>He'll find us a way out of this.<br/>If there's on thing I hate it is skiting<br/>when I hear it I always feel sore<br/>So you won't think Im boasting when I tell you<br/>He ought to have sent for me before<br/>A great cheer arose as I faced him<br/>&amp; said Sir I'll see you through.<br/>I've a scheme in my head that will beat them<br/>&amp; we'll wallop them black &amp; blue.<br/>Then I shook hands with all the battalion<br/>(There was only 13 of us left)<br/>&amp; they cheered me again till the foemen<br/>must have thought us of senses bereft<br/>So I gathered my arms &amp; my rations<br/>&amp; girded myself for the fray.<br/>If I live to be ninety or over<br/>I'll always remember that day.</p>
