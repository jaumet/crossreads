<p>Mr. W. H. Ifould,<br/>Lane Cove Road,<br/>Turramurra.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Ifould,</p>
<p>Enclosed please find a letter for your collection. It is from my Brother-in-law who at the time of writing evidently thought his last call had come, but fortunately is now much better.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br/>F. G. Pratten</p>
