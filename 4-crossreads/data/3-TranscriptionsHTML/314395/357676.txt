<p>2nd Battery<br/>Sgts. Mess<br/>R.B.A.A. [Reserve Brigade Australian Artillery]<br/>Heytesbury<br/>Wilts.<br/>England</p>
<p>England<br/>14.1.18</p>
<p>Dear Dad,<br/>Since last writing, things have been moving rapidly.  It was my good fortune to spend Xmas &amp; New Year in Paris, and when I arrived back at the battery, the enclosed note was awaiting me.  Hence I find myself safely ensconced in England for six months, as an instructor to artillery reinforcements just from Australia.  Although when in France, I was very pleased I had been selected for the job, now I do not appreciate it at all.  One feels so utterly out of things, this side.  If it was at a base in France I would not mind, but here, I don't like, and am shortly going to apply to be sent back to my unit.</p>
<p>The eight days I spent in Paris were glorious, snow fell a few</p>
