<p>&amp;heat unbearable. Something I did not expect here. There was a great dampness everywhere &amp; our position was getting a vast amount of earthworks on all sides. Some chocolates books &amp; cigars I brought over were greatly appreciated by our own gun section. Hills all defaced of the lovely green hedges.</p>
<p>Monday 21st<br/>A newspaper called Peninsular Press is now printed every day at our Base and a copy sent to each unit. At our gun the Officer reads out the news printed on the large leaflet. It contains most of the up to date military news from all quarters of the front. Yesterday it was a sort of visiting day for me for I took back cigars chocolates etc which I distributed amongst our boys. I also saw Cyril Woods &ndash; Olly Gunderson &amp; ohs [others]. To-day I started work but altogether I was disappointed to find that things</p>
