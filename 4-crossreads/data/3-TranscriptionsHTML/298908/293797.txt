<p>moving off, so having a little time to spare I scribbled a few lines in the diary.<br/>Before leaving the Command we all marched over to our Furlough Office where all rolls were properly checked &amp; pay books collected then we loaded our gear on to a G.S. waggon &amp; set off for Warminster headed by an original 4th Battn. piper with one of the old pipes brought from "Aussie".  On the way down we passed all the 1st T.B. out for their march &amp; many were the compliments passed as is usual with "Aussies".  It was a dull heavy morning but nevertheless it was a morning I shall never forget.  4 long years have we been looking forward to this memorable day &amp; now it has come at last, everyone was in the best possible spirits &amp; the march to Warminster was a pleasure.  We arrived there in nice time, collected our kits &amp; hopped in the train 3 extra carriages had been provided for us of which there were 150 all told.  We had a pretty slow trip to Bristol.  The country on the way down looked simply glorious.  I never saw so</p>
