<p>Friday Oct 26th Cont.</p>
<p>It was rather poor. After we had supper at the Alexander Caf&eacute; &amp; then motored back to our ship. It is absolutely the best days outing I have spent for a very long while, thanks to Mrs Morton, Miss Stevenson &amp; another girl friend. We were very sleepy &amp; tired upon arrival back at the boat. The Gardens in Capetown are lovely. Wages are very good here. Things are rather dear. No food restrictions through the war.</p>
<p>Saturday Oct 27th<br/>Sailed at 7 am this morning, I am very sorry our stay in Capetown was so short. A week could have easily been spent there without seeing the same thing twice. It is still windy &amp; rather cold. As planned yesterday, if we were to sail today, the girls waved a goodbye on the heliograph. There was rather a heavy swell on this afternoon. I was sea-sick after tea.</p>
<p>Sunday Oct 28th<br/>Feeling sick today. Very quite.</p>
