10th Another heavy barrage this morning the Canadians were going over again. We have been living like lords of late more tucker than we know what to do with. The platoons are handing in all their spare ammunition bombs, that will lighten the loads some.
Imperial troops are taking over all the line from the Australians, 5th Lancs are relieving us.
Got a bit of a shock this morning a chap said to me, youre in the 1st Battn. I turned round had a look to see who it was to my astonishment who should I see but Woodfine, I used to know him on Gallipoli when he was in the 5th Battalion he is now in the 2nd Field Ambulance.
There has been very heavy artillery firing all day long some of the big ones have been coming uncomfortably close to us to make it worse it has been raining steadily the ground is now in an awful state.
11th Well I think I laughed the most
