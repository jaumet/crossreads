  
 Have been playing bridge nearly all night  it is now 12.30  we left off to attend the funeral & then started again, so you can see we have spent a pretty quiet Xmas Eve. 
 25th. Xmas Day & the second I have spent on the ocean & 5th since leaving Australia  2 in France 1 in Egypt & 2 on the sea, this one is easily the happiest for the war is over & the world is now resuming its former quiet occupation & giving up cutting each others throats,  I slept on deck as usual & rose or rather was pulled out by Penfold about 6.30 who was wishing all & sundry a Merry Xmas & etc, folded up my blankets & rolled them into the hammock then down stairs to sling them in the bin & there for a wash to get the grime off for sleeping on deck though cool & nice
