<p>This time we made an excursion right off the right hand bottom corner of the map, or at least of the map that H.Q. supplies.<br/>We went out at 3 am on Saturday morning  &amp;  went direct to Sarghia (vids map.) reaching that delectable spot at about 10 oclock. We set out from there at 8 pm intending to travel South East to Bir el Bayud which was to have been reached at dawn. We were however at 1 oclock delayed by a  thick fog until 5 oclock  &amp;  finally got to our destination about 9 oclock. There we found a small outpost in possession of a ridge  &amp;  a long range duel</p>
