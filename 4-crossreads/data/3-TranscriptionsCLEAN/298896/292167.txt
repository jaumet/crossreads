  
 C.C.S. at Proyart, calling to see the Big Gun captured by us & previously mentioned. Truly it is an extraordinary gun, destroyed by a premature burst, over 50ft long 15"calibre & tremendous mountings set in Concrete. A tree in front was all blackened by the firing but it had apparently burst soon after it was mounted. Had dinner at the 15th Fld amb. By extraordinary good fortune we found a car about to go to Boulogne so V.H. went by that, I had previously put his two pips up so he was taken into the officers mess at the C.C.S. Saw him off the returned to Chuignolles, picked up some wants & returned in time for tea. Had our photos taken this morning with a couple of cameras still carried by a couple of the chaps. Managed to buy a paper with news of Yankee hopover at St Michiel, so far they have taken 13,000 prisoners & nipped off the Salient, a good start. 
 Sunday 15th Sept.  A beautiful day. Busy all the morning going through my section gear
