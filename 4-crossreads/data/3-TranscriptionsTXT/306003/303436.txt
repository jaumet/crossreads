20-7-16up again & out scouting;  This afternoon the 2nd Bde received orders to come back within 11/2  miles of our strong posts & bivouac for the night;  One lad of the 2nd Brigade was shot dead today (through the head) & 10 others wounded;  Two Turks were captured today & they say there is 7 Battalion of Turkish troops under 5 German officers & they intend to attack Armadier which is the name of the camp at Railhead right on the coast & which is one of our strongest positions, so we are looking forward to the attack;
It is asserted that 8000 Troops arrived at Railhead last night & 10,000 more will arrive tonight.  B Sqd of the 1st escorted some artillery out this morning but they did not go far  Hill 110 I believe, but the planes report that they could not locate the enemy's main body.  We sleep with clothes on tonight & ready to move out at half an hours notice.
