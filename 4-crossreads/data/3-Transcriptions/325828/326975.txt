<p>My dearest Father,<br/>There has been no Australian mail to hand since I last wrote on 3rd inst.  Haven't seen anything of Wal since his birthday a week ago.  Suppose you know he is a 2 star artist now.  The days are gradually closing in now, &amp; it won't be long before winter is on us again.<br/>I am keeping well, &amp; trust this finds all at "Cairnleith" in good health.<br/>No word from Rid since he first informed me he was wounded, so must take it for granted he is getting on alright.  Very cold nights here now,<br/>Love from Leo.</p>
