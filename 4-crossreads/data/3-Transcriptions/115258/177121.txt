<p>Cairo</p>
<p>22nd December 1918</p>
<p>My dear Father,</p>
<p>I sent you a short note last week to thank you for sending the tenner, so now as I&#39;m up in Cairo once more I tell you about the trip up here. This is Sunday morning, a beautiful cool sunny day; - just the ideal weather for a sight-seeing holiday. I left the hospital on Monday, &nbsp;crossed over the harbour in a little steamer (only a few minutes&nbsp;trip)&nbsp;and then came on through Port Said to the rest camp on the beach north of the town</p>
