  
 in our vicinity, two of the planes put in some very nasty work with their machine guns, swooping down unpleasantly low to do so.  There was a rather hasty rush from the blankets to the limber, which having a good load on, afforded pretty good protection from bombs or bullets.  I did not hear of any casualties, either among men or animals.  At about 2 P.M. we moved camp again, this time to cross the Jordan.  All our men are withdrawing from the eastern side of the river.  By the time we got to the pontoon there was a tremendous crowd of camel and wheeled transport of every kind already across, and a great crowd waiting to go over.  We were not long in starting across.  Owing to the recent floods the approaches to the river had become so boggy that the pontoon had to be across the flat as well as the river itself.
