  
 19 March, 1916 Gabul Mirium We put up three tents yesterday & we had a gay go in the wind   Nothing to do here all day but we have to patrol the Canal at night  Johno & Cameron are on duty on the post   Perce & I were on last night.  We are having quite a good time  Cookie took on the cook house & did great work to day.  Porridge, Bacon & steak for Breakfast Curry & rice at dinner & steak & tomatoes for tea.  Bread is a bit light & we would have had plenty only the bally camel when coming across the crossing took it into his head to sit down & think & he could not be induced to shift for a while, so our bread got wet; 
 There are 21 of us here all told. Mr McKenzie is in charge.  There was also a nigger in charge of two camels but he stayed over the other side this evening & Cookie is a bit anxious as to how we will get to morrow provisions.  The wind has dropped thank goodness I hope its warm to morrow, its too hanged cold to chance a swim so far.
