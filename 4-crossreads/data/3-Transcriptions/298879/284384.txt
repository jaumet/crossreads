<p>June 1915<br/>Tuesday 1<br/><u>Fine</u>    Our Plat. Resting, or supposed to be. We had to go for water for the Coy. twice. This is rather a dangerous job as we are open to snipers &amp; very much open to shrapnel which the Turks are likely to trot along any time. They gave us an early morning salute which we returned with interest otherwise the day has been quiet</p>
<p>Wednesday 2<br/>Scarcely anything doing today. Expecting something big to happen shortly. These quiet days cannot last in my opinion. Had a good nights rest for once again</p>
