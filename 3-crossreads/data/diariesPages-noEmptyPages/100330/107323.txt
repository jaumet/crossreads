they were out of Sight. While Tea was on a humming Sound could be heard on looking up a large number of Aeroplanes could be seen flying in a South Eastern direction. I counted 12 in all they were very high up looked grand gliding along so gracefully no doubt they were out Scouting for Fritz.
Monday 11th 1917
Orders came out that we would depart at 8 am next Morning for our permanent Headquarters. All day we were loading up equipment stores into trucks over in the Railway Yards. After Tea I went into the Village to buy a few articles went around to say Good Bye to some French People who I was introduced to by a Belgian Sergeant. These people have an Orchard of 5 acres under cultivation which unfortunately is sadly neglected for want of labour cherries Pear are in abundance also strawberry, Raspberry Gooseberry bushes everywhere. Having spent 2 hours I said Good Bye thanked them for the kindness they have extended to me. I made my way back to Camp to took up my duties for the last time.
