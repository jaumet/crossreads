  
 about 1/2 mile from Amman Village. The Railway is the Mecca to Damascus line. Amman proved a prize to the Boys. It is here that our campaign is ended. Beyond this we are told is a 50 mile desert. Practically the whole Turkish Army has been captured & Jacko is completely smashed. The area round here is a sight to see. Amman station is blocked with Jacko transport, They have practically left every thing behind. There are dumps with any amount of equipment. Dead Horses & Camels are all over the place & the smell & Flies  [indecipherable]  are very bad.
