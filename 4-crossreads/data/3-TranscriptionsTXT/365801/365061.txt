My Dear FitzJust a line to let you know I am still going along.  I ordered yr colours &   [indecipherable] this morning they had been sent to you so hope you have them ere this.  I also called on Col Massy Woods & everything there is satisfactory.  I also saw young Stewart he came & spoke to me in the street & made himself known to me, he had quite grown out of my recollection but I told him you wd be dealing with his application [now?] & advised him to drop you a line.  I see good news still continues to come thro & I hope there will be no end to it.  Weather is bad here wet & cold a little better today than yesty -
