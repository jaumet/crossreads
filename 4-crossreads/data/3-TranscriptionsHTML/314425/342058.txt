<p>two cup fulls not enough to fill a dixey. The "Daily Mail" prints today more details of the enemy push in Italy. It was on a front of 94 miles and was a complete failure. Italians, French &amp; British are fighting side by side. They rewon lost positions and took over 3,000 prisoners.<br/>After dinner today, the enemy shot down one of our observation baloons in flames. The hostile plane darted from behind a cloud fired incendiary bullets at the baloon &amp; escaped.<br/>The enemy raided our trenches last night and left with us 6 prisoners from the Prussian Guards.</p>
<p>Wednesday June 19. 1918. 1415.<br/>Cool &amp; cloudy. There was some rain early this morning which has laid the dust. I finished reading a great detective story "The Hollow Needle" by Maurice LeBlance. A French story reciting the exploits and adventures of Arsine Lupin. It is full of interest from start to finish, because the reader is kept in uncertainty and doubt about the mystery of the needle until the end. This front is very quiet today &amp; last night&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
