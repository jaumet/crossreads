W.M. Garling Esq.,"Angledene"Burns Bay Road,Sougueville,Sydney.
Dear Sir,I am in receipt of your kind letter of the 22nd inst. which, however, reached me only this morning.  I am indeed interested to learn that you are the father of Major Garling, and you will no doubt permit me to extend to you an expression of my heartfelt sympathy in the loss of your gallant son.
In brief reply to your letter I may say that it is doubtless quite correct that the place where he fell is called Millencourt.  The battle front was extended over a very large area, and was called the Battle of Dernancourt chiefly because it was from the ruins of the latter village that the main German attack debouched, also your son being a Gunner was very likely to be some thousand yards from the actual point of Infantry assault, and I well remember that there was a village or ruin of a village, named Millencourt in that vicinity.
