<p>-h their vessels, then something must give way, the best expression of it was on the 25th &amp; 26th of April 1915.   I shall finish this tomorrow.  Meanwhile my dears good night, good night, good night.<br/>[A line of Xs and Os.]<br/>Caggie. Joseph. Kitty.</p>
<p>Much thanks for the newspaper cuttings, they were all interesting to me.  It was thoughtful of Strickland to refer to Beeston and to me.  I have had several letters from him and from General Finn.  It will be strange if Larkin is not dead.</p>
<p>1.8.15. 11 p.m. Heaps to write about but it is physically impossible to give the time to what would please me most, pressure from patients is too great.  During the week if I get any chance moments I shall try to place on paper what turns up.</p>
