<p>From No 1340<br/>Sgt A.F. Fry<br/>10th Reins.<br/>13the Battalion</p>
<p>3.3.16<br/>Zeitoun Camp</p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>Have no time to write a letter now. We are moving out to Ismalia early tomorrow morning, and I am up to my eyes in work, but I did not want to take these photos &amp; negatives away with me, so will post them tonight with this note. I know it's an awful scrawl, but you must excuse it this time. I am quite O.K. and am looking forward to some hard work when we join the Battalion to get into condition again.</p>
<p>Good bye Mother, for the present, and I will write from Ismalia as soon as I get the chance.</p>
<p>Love to all the family</p>
<p>Your son</p>
<p>Alan</p>
