shortly now, we have another officer in the Company to go & then "yours truly" about seven days I think. "What oh" then dear, I intend to go very gay, a chum of mine who got his commission the same time as me is going along with me & we are going to have the time of our lives.I havn't seen or heard of Nurse Herbert since leaving Lemnos no doubt she is still in Egypt. I met Wennie Garven at Heliopolis & had a grand yam with her, her brother Artie is over here somewhere also.Well dear I will close now with fondest love to self R & B from your loving Brother Ken
