<p>The scene is one of continuous wonder   The valley of the Rhone, that fine old river, which we had in view all day, with it's many bridges is most striking. About 11-30 am we reached Vienne, a pretty town on the Rhone &amp;  were issued with iron rations (beef &amp; biscuits) for one day. Managed to obtain tea at various buffets on the stations also long loaves of bread. We reached Lyons, which I consider the most beautiful city I have ever seen at 1 pm    &amp; waited here one hour &amp; managed to obtain a wash &amp;  some refreshments. The Rhone is crossed by many fine bridges in this city   The country people all along the line seemed very contented &amp; industrious only old men, women &amp; boys working in the fields. No slackers in France  Women drive the trams &amp; women tram conductresses. Many widows  We see them everywhere. The</p>
