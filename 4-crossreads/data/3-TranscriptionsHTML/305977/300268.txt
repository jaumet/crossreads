<p>September 1915<br/>They put in a lot of shells, about 10 rounds rapid &amp; waved their bayonets above the parapets.  They didn't hop out however so they didn't draw much fire.</p>
<p>Monday 20th<br/>Another cold windy day.  In the afternoon we shifted over to the firing line relieving 'A' Squadron.  Lieut Drummond was wounded in the morning with a shell. He had his leg broken.  He took it very well &amp; laughed &amp; joked about it.  Started duty as orderly corporal (Squadron) so selected a good dug out in the supports</p>

<p>Wednesday 22nd<br/>Wasn't feeling too good. Had a headache.  Got a couple of pills</p>
