<p>March, 1915<br/>Sunday 28<br/>Posted diary yesterday will be glad to hear if you receive these notes. Am trying to get leave to go to "Luxoor" to see Temples etc &amp; Karnuak &ndash; said to be the oldest buildings in the world &amp; temples of rameses &amp; duron etc; with [indecipherable] of Sphinxes etc 4000 B.C. Terrific Duststorm today &amp; the camp obliterated in the desert sand with millions of Locusts darkening the sky, quite droughty weather but it never rains in Egypt.<br/>Saw Miss Alice McCulloch (Colin's daughter) &amp; Audrey Chirnside at the Continental Balls, but of course they did not know me. Sheila Chisholm also there.</p>
