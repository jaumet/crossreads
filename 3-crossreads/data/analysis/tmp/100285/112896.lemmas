 all the evil consequ that follow in it trail , in one way as I have said befor if you do n't booz you are out in the cold to a certain extent , but even so I prefer to remain so rather than follow the drunk , not for me , I know who is the best off at the end of the week both physic , moral , financi , the money they spend in drink is astonish noth but continu draft from Australia can keep them go at the pace they set , I do n't wonder sometim that the Govern step in limit the amount of money they could draw at onc , for it is all to their own benefit onli they or the major fail to see it , but wait till the war is over I ll bet they will then see how foolish they have been in squander their good cash for practic noth at all .
