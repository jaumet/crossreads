  
 Sun. Jan.5 (cont.) They certainly were not cheap, but as he said he wanted 'em I suppose they were worth it.  Had tea at Lyons "Corner House" in "the Strand". Here we had Tea & Toast & Cakes & sat in comfortable chairs, listening to good music for about an hour & the whole lot cost about 2 bob. We had our money's worth there alright. Then we went for another Train Ride. After that we had another feed. Eggs & toast & cake. We [indecipherable] tried to get to a Picture House but every place was crowded, so I went with him to where he was staying. The old Landlady was very particular & I had to fill in a Form before she would let me a Shower. We sat up yarning till nearly midnight. MON. Jan 6. Bill & I slept in till about 10.30 & then the old Lady came & called us & said our Breakfast was spoiling, so we hopped out & had a pretty good feed of Bacon Eggs. Bill had some Business to attend to so we parted, & I strolled back to the W.C.Club where I had Dinner. Here I met Peter Hutchison, whom I hadn't seen for ages. He was on 14 days Leave from France. He was going up to Glasgow to get married. My word, that's some interesting news for B.E. Peter & I knocked around the City for a few hours, & returned homem to Bed about 12. TUES.7. My last days Leave. These few days have passed like a flash of Lightning & tonight I return to that dismal Hole called "Littlemore". Met Sgt Berry in "the Strand". He is on 4 days Leave. Last Sat. I went to see Ted Sutton at Horseferry Rd. He gave me a note to bring to Westham. I wonder if it carries any "weight." It  should  do . It's about time my name appeared on a Boat Roll.. I don't like writing to B.E. till I know something definite. Poor old Girl. She must be about as fed up as I am.
