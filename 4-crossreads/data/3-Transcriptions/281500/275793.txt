<p>that I thought I would put it in here <br/>"Imbros"<br/>Oh misty isle of Imbros<br/>Encircled by blue seas<br/>Arched over by an azure sky<br/>On thee a weary man might lie<br/>O Gentle Isle of Imbros<br/>A man might take his ease.</p>
<p>Oh misty Isle of Imbros<br/>We look across the blue <br/>Sick men who have not ease not rest<br/>Turn wearily towards the west<br/>Oh sunset isle of Imbros<br/>We turn and look to you.</p>
<p>Oh misty isle of Imbros<br/>We know that we must stay<br/>For us, for us is no release<br/>Save only death or wounds or peace<br/>Oh phantom isle of Imbros<br/>A thousand miles away.<br/>"Anzac"</p>
