<p>The French war ship &ndash; Montcalm  lies close to us &ndash; guns out  -  By the way she put up an A1 signal this morng which I think any lady might copy &amp; some with great advantage &ndash; town or country  -  It is usual for Captains to call on the Admiral  -   The Frenchman obviated all this by this signal  -  "All visits &amp; the return calls will be taken as paid  -  <strike>already carried out</strike>" What a grand signal!!! You run it up &amp; there you are &ndash; free &amp; quiet  -  Did I mention prizes? Two were alongside of us till yesterday &ndash; SS Sumatra &amp; the Madang  -  The S.S. Sumatra was a German trader with lager beer, provisions &amp; stores  -  Mossy Lambton was sent off to her &amp; report says he scooped 1200 bottles of Lager for the thirsty Berrima &ndash; then another chap came &amp; scooped her coal &amp; now she is being fitted up with a 12 pounder gun &amp; is to be a sort of guard ship  -  Our chief officer &ndash; Elms is to be 2nd in command &amp; we drank his health &amp; wished him luck  &amp; if they want a medico I'm first on the list  -  They're going to look up the coast line for AE1 Germans &amp; what not  -</p>
<p>The Madang is a cranky small steamer</p>
