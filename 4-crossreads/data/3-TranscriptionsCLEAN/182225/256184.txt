Fine & warm. Linda, Jo and Self went to town in morning. Linda & self had our photos taken at the Burrlitz; we met Jo again and had dinner at Tissots and caught the 2.15 boat to Clifton Gardens  We saw Mr & Mrs Allison and the McMasters (Binnia) & had a swim then had tea with Mrs Allison and home for dinner at night. It was a long day, but think we all enjoyed it. Miss Earle was at Lisheen in afternoon & stayed to tea. Linda & Self sat on Tennis court for a bit after tea
