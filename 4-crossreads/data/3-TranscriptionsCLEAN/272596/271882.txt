22nd. Paraded with the Tasmanians yesterday as I belong to them now.
Another glorious morning & scarce a cloud in the sky, the sea is very much quieter too, only an occasional big roller spins us about we sighted a lighthouse just after breakfast on the "port" side they say it is close to Portland.
Tons of fun at breakfast table this morning & bites were plentiful you only have to throw out some little disparaging remark about Victoria to start things moving, & next table to us is a "Tassy" he is one of the best bites on the ship, it's the fun of the world sometimes to listen to them, Victorians & Tasmanians they throw off at one another & N.S.W. & Victorians are deadly enemies as far as the State is concerned, "Sydney Harbour"
