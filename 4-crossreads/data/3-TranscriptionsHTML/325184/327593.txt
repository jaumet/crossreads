<p>Tuesday 11th February<br/>Further skating today. Quite a change for our officers and men, many of whom have never before had such an opportunity. In afternoon visited the "Providence" Steel works at Marchienne au Pont . It is pitiable to see the result of demolition carried out by the Boche during their occupancy. The Directorate gave me an album of very good views depicting the works before and after demolition.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12th February<br/>Again skating this morning. My attempts are very poor indeed, and many falls resulted. Attended at 9.30 am at Residence of Mr Dewandie on the occasion of the funeral of his eldest daughter. Was accompanied by Lt Col Miles and Capt O'Hara Wood, but did not attend Service at the Church nor go to the vault. Very much annoyed with Col Ralston who failed (after promise) to supply 2 buglers to Sound "Last Post" at the funeral this afternoon of the CO of No 59 squadron R.A.F.<br/>Another milestone passed &ndash; the 44th today.<br/>The 6th Brigade moved into Marcinelle. Gen Robertson and Brigade Major lunched with us. Messers Lacaune arrived at Marcinelle.</p>
<p>Thursday 13th February<br/>Again this morning officers and men indulging in skating. In office all day. Received parcel of socks from Nell but no letters.</p>
<p>Friday 14th February<br/>In morning visited Corps B.F and PT School at Barbencon near Beaumont. Gen Glasgow also present.   A very good show. In afternoon took Managing Director of "Providence" steel works (Messieur  Geudarme) to HQs 4th Army at Namur. Interviewed Gen Holman to obtain return of 8 trucks of machinery (at present lying in Marcinelle Railway yards) which had been stolen by the Boche, but for removal of which they had insufficient time. I secured authority for these to be returned to "Providence" works. Weather breaking into unsettled.</p>
<p>Saturday  15th February<br/>Visited Gen Wisdom at Marchienne.</p>
