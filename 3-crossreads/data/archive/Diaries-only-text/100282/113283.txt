This little raid spoilt a dinner which our officers were giving to the nurses from round about, but it did not stop our band from playing, they blew their horns thumped their drums as if it were an ordinary every day occurence. Last night we got a few details from the 6th Division nearly all N.C.O.s we are well supplied with these now.
We had a bit of fun during our parade hour this morning, B Coy challenged C. Coy to a tug of war of course it was accepted, for it was a welcome break if nothing else from the monotony of drill. B Coy won the first match.
