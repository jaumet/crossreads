  
 10/6/19 Sutton-Veny Warm. Inspected the huts of Hinchcliffe &  Gorman's companies and found the lines excellent. Afterwards tried about 12 men for various offences giving fairly light forfeitures of pay. In the afternoon went down to Group HQ and there found James awaiting Senator Pearce and Genl McNicoll. Went over to Greenhills about 4 with Gorman &  Hinchcliffe and had afternoon tea. This place is a modern mansion and a centre of much amusement for the troops. There are croquet and tennis lawns as well as billiard rooms. The whole place is a hive of amusement and set down amid very fine grounds full of the finest trees now in full green leaf many arching overhead &  roofing the avenues.
