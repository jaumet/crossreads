Spend evening at the Kursaats (French Vaudeville Entertainment) where the various items are so different from our Sydney Tivoli. Seeing some of the side lights of Cairo afterwards &  meet a chap from the "Argyllshire" who insists on shouting for me  &  paying for a carriage drive home. Very nice indeed.
12th Nov:-Duties as usual & rather hard work. Dull day &  very hot. My shoulder gives trouble &  the doctor orders it to be massaged daily. Light duties.
Visit Cairo &   accidentally meet de Mestre & a Scotch Tommy &  we have an argument abut the respective merits of Australian &  English soldiers. Meet some A.M.C. friends who are leaving for the front next day  &  we have a good time
