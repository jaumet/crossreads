<p>Wednesday 7 August<br/>This country is looking fine, rolling miles of crops and "roses are blooming in Picardy".  This village is a typical Somme village, with a church a couple of estaminets &amp; a few houses.  Nearby is a Chateau where we are at a concert by R.A.F.  We move to-night to just past Amiens. A big stunt is eminent.  Have dinner with my little friend at Moulin Blue.</p>
<p>Thursday 8 August<br/>The stunt came off &amp; was a huge success so news from 4th Army says.  Six miles deep is the advance &amp; all objectives were taken ahead of time, tanks, cavalry, etc. operating.  Heavens, Rumours are flying, but whatever happened has been a huge success.  Australians, Canadians, British &amp; French are at least participating.<br/>We are on the move marching from Vauchelles to Saint Sauveur, on the Somme, just west of Amiens.  Our route lay through fine country along Abbeville-Amiens road &amp; we are getting, for a change, well fed. Fine day for march.  We are now at St. Sauveur &amp; here catch motor transport for Allonville.  From St. Sauveur we travelled via Amiens (where there are yet some civilians) to Allonville, where we were over two years ago.  Bivouac in the Chateau woods.  Rumours about stunt are flying.</p>
