<p>3rd June 1916 <br/>A very fine day, and also a good one for me. Sighted South Africa at 10.15 am which was a sight for sore eyes as it was exactly three weeks since we sighted land. Tied up at wharf 1.30. We were all anxious to get on shore which we did at 3 pm. A wild scramble for Durban. I went up to Post Office per tram car. Saw the sights &amp;c Had a good tea at The Savoy (with Black waiters). Had a talk with sundry girls. Went down to Beach Parade at night. A really fine waterfront. I was very surprised at my impression of Durban as it is such a fine little city. Arrived at boat at 10.15 News of the Naval fight.</p>
<p>4th June 1916<br/>Sunday morning. Dressed for the City. Left ship at 9.30 for Church Parade. Went over to Durban Side in "Sir David Hunter" pilot vessel. Church parade at the Town Hall. Successful &amp; organ played by city organist. Had a good dinner after being dismissed from parade. After dinner which was also successful, went for tram rides through &amp; around the city. City &amp; suburbs from a distance looks very fine &amp; impressive. Some tram rides we took was Unigeni, Musgrave Road, Marine Parade etc. Had afternoon tea &amp; bright evening with some nice friends we have made. Had tea at the beach, Bill Martin, Tom Scott &amp; myself, and a nice tea it was too and quite shrewd. In the day I had my first Ricksha ride. Last but not least we had a Ricksha race to the boat which resulted in a win for Bill Martin &amp; myself. Arrived home (ship) at 10.30 pm after a fine day in fact one of the best I have ever had.</p>
