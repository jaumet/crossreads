<p>Sunday Dec. 3rd<br/>Our Parade was held this morning in an old mill which has been out of use since the war, an industry ruined and valuable machinery rusting.  I spoke to about 60 men on "Ye are the Body of Christ &amp; members in particular for the Body is not one member but many".  The men listened very attentively &amp; several promised to come to our Bible Class on Wednesday evening.<br/>Visited A &amp; B Coys Billets.  One of our men had a slight wound in the head &amp; was saved by his steel helmet which caught the Bullet side on.  It made a deep dent in it but <strike>did</strike> was not penetrated.  Sgnt. Earl of Armidale was Buried today by Capt. McCook, this the 1st casualty in our Brigade.  McLean left for his new quarters today so we are here by ourselves now.<br/>Weather Foggy &amp; dull &amp; cold.  Clothes on the line have been frozen for a couple of days.  Some of our men went into the Trenches today.</p>
