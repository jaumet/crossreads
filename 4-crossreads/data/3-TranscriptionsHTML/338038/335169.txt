I have a very nice little fireplace installed in the side of the shack, and altogether things might easily be a lot worse &ndash;<br/>We have been looking ahead a bit lately as regards Christmas "dinner" and duly despatched the faithful Wilson (our mess cook) to Imbros a few days ago to see what he could get in the shape of victuals. Yesterday evening he returned with Lo &amp; Behold no less than a rooster &amp; six hens, besides vegetables &amp; fruit galore! The fowlyard I am afraid is going to be something of a worry as it will probably be the envy of many eyes, still we should be able to meet the occasion all right.<br/>Must cut out as this is last sheet of paper till I go down to the Battery to replenish.<br/>Fondest love to selves &amp; Pat<br/>Terence</p>
