  
 when we did shoot, as they were coming out to get us and it was war. 
 The two photos on the other side were taken off one of them 3 nights later by the patrol and given to me by one of the boys who got them. The Break on the side is where the bullet went through the photo, also on the top right hand corner of the other. Anyway we taught Fritz a lesson that night as he never came out in numbers anymore to relieve his men but took a lesson from us & went out one at a time. 
 Next morning I went back to the front line again just before daylight and slept all the next day.
