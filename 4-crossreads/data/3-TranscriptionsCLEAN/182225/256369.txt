 SEPT.   THURSDAY 7  1916 
 Fine & warm. Out signalling all day & I should have gone out on a lamp parade at night but the 27 th  played 26 th  football & we gave them a good go, but they beat us on time. It was too late to go out when we had finished. Things have all gone wrong today. First we were told that we were not getting away till November which was enough to turn us all wild, as we are all sick of this hole, then nothing to eat for tea but dry bread & then old Warren is being transfered to the 23 rd  Brigade. Its rotten being separated from our mates like that & Warren was the best mate a man could wish for.  Any way we are trying all ways to get together again somewhere & any how.
