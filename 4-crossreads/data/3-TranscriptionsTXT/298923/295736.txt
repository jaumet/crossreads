11 March 1918 MondayMaison Lyons Cake Oxford St London     L.H.Raining still, a cake arrived from London isnt it wonderful the Army Postal Service- 2 letters from Dolly also  Turks being driven back & we hope to be relieved tomorrow, still raining, 4 enemy Taubes over but no bombs-  A Mountain Battery got a shaking yesterday & the men have been passing us all day-  We can see Jerusalem behind us quite plainly- it is built on a HILL & we expect to be back that way again soon.Notwithstanding cold I am fit & well.
