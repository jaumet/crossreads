<p>4.  a fair number of trains &amp; the only question is whether I will be able to get word in time to get there before they leave.  I shall be fearfully disappointed if I cannot but I have to remember that this is war-time.<br/>Father dear may I trouble you to do something for me.  It is Rid's parents' silver-wedding anniversary in June &amp; he wants Doris to get something for them as he never gives them anything on birthdays or things, so would you please when it is convenient send her a postal-note or something for &amp;pound2 &amp; draw it from my account, &amp; please don't be out of pocket over it in any way, fares or anything else.  Please disguise your writing to Doris so that her mother won't notice it, she might know yours &amp; we want it to be a surprise if possible.  Have written Doris yesterday.<br/>Wal is very well &amp; I am thankful to see him fairly often, he is not likely to go any further away than Tel-el-Keber for some time ahead as far as we can see.  Have not heard yet from Le since his going back to Serapeum, but the post is so slow here that there is probably one on the way.<br/>Sorry to cut this short dear People, but you will understand that there are things I must see about in case I have to leave early in the morning &amp; it is getting late.<br/>Very much love from<br/>Your loving daughter<br/>Olive.<br/>P.S.  Would you mind giving Millie &amp; Evelyn the news as I have not written, intended to this mail, but Rid's departure has upset my plans.  Of course I don't know where they are going though the common report is France.  O.L.O.</p>
