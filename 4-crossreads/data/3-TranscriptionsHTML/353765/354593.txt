<p>April 1916<br/>[Note in margin:] Saty<br/>29th &ndash; by forming a ring of camels ten being minimum nr. Learnt of recent happenings from Rev. M. Woods &amp; also the other <strike>Wowser</strike> Cong. Parson. Reports conflicting on certain points. Appears that last Saty (22nd) &amp; Sunday, a well armed managed equipped force of Turks made a swoop on the British (Gloucester) Yeomanry. Yeomanry Patrols had evidently been slack &amp; they were taken by surprise &amp; practically wiped out. 1350 killed wounded &amp; missing. Circumstances &amp; indications point to the Turks having made a swoop down on Gloucesters surrounding them. Yeomanry evidently made splendid fight (all reports agree on that) but were vastly outnumbered &amp; probably out officered &amp; at Quatia Lord Elcoate being surrounded, told his men that he intended to surrender &amp; if any of them wanted to make a bid to escape they were at liberty to do so. 18 tried, 13 got through 5 killed. At Duidar 70 dead Turks &amp; 20 dead Tommies were<br/>[Note in margin:] Saty<br/>29th &ndash; buried. 5th just missed Duidar by an hour. They captured a number of stragglers &amp; also parts of an M.G. They pursued Turks for about 6 m. Some reports say that Turks are only 12 m away &amp; others say they are back at Elarish or Elharisch or some such name which is their base. No of Bedouins being rounded up daily &amp; as prisoners of war are being sent to Kantara. Turks evidently had made reconnaissances &amp; knew all detail as simultaneous attacks made at several points. At Bir-el-Duidar, R.S.M Randall (Camel T'port Corps) said, Turks got to within 12 yards of Tommies surrounding them, 800 Turks to 104 Tommies. Also Worcesters annihilated. Congregational padre said he heard that some* of the Gloucesters were sent for, <indecipherable> message saying "we are hard pressed" &amp; some patrol came <strike>said</strike> came in<br/>* (Later heard only 26)</p>
