<p>The Sentry was not included in the Police, for on his return, he had the very great pleasure of seeing the Military Police Sergeant himself, in the "Clink" (gaol) &amp; the Artillery Corporal had been removed</p>
<p>While staying at Weymouth, most of the Sentry's time was taken up with his friend H[dash] so that after the first two or three days it was very enjoyable.</p>
<p>The first Sunday spent at this Camp was utilized in having a beautiful Motor drive at the invitation of H[dash] during which on a journey of about 70 miles some very fine English scenery was enjoyed</p>
<p>During the course of the ride portions of three counties were traversed thus affording a series of Changing views &amp; surpassingly pleasing varieties of scenery, now on the top of a hill, the landscape, from ones feet stretching away into the distance presenting a wonderful view of houses large, &amp; small cottages partly hidden or apparently nestling among lovely trees &amp; everywhere beautiful flowers &amp; the greenest of grass. Leaving the hill the next experience would probably be a run for about a mile along a hedge protected road with shade trees in rows on each side, their branches quite interlacing formed a large bower immediately over the road itself.</p>
<p>A Motor trip through English scenery &amp; on English roads is most enjoyable &amp; gives one an opportunity of quickly gaining a fairly good idea of the beauty, the calm, &amp; comfort of residential England, outside the Cities.</p>
<p>Every where, in England Scotland Ireland &amp; Wales away from crowded &amp; congested Cities the wonderfully green carpet of grass, the beautiful trees the profuse display of flowers wild &amp; cultivated make the Suburban &amp; Country places wonderfully attractive, while the appearances of the Houses of the higher &amp; the Cottages of the lower, Classes impress upon one that solid comfort &amp; calm &amp; quiet enjoyment are much more studied here than in the younger but more pushing countries.</p>
