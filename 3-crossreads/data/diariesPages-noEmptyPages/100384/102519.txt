Brighton is an extremely pretty place with fine big buildings has two big piers the beach has a pecular formation of shingle very little sand. After spending a very decent time I left Brighton by the 2 PM train on the 25th experienced one of the Hun air raids on London the same night but it did not prevent me from having a very enjoyable evening. Next day the 26th being the last day of my furlough I left London about midday for Salisbury spent a very pleasant evening returned to camp last the same night. Next day I was warned for draft had to pass my medical dental inspection then had to stand bye. I was rather lucky for we had the next weekend in which I spent in a very satisfactory manner in Salisbury.

It was early Monday morning the 1st October that I came the bump for we were warned to proceed over seas that night. After having a fairly decent send off in camp we left at 8.30 PM entrained from Amesbury at 10.30. It was early next morn when we were aroused from our slumber in the train.
