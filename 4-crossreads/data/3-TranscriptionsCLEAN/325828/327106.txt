 My dearest Father, Your two letters of 26.5.18 & 19.6.18 arrived together about a week ago in company with one from Ol of the latter date.  I got Ol's answered by last mail, but have had little spare time since.  Many thanks for your two letters as it was some time since I had heard. I was very pleased to hear that Anna did so well with her exams.  I think she has more brains than this kid had when he was at school, or else sticks closer to her books than I did.  Do you remember, Dad, how you used to work out a sum for me, & when I was counting on getting hold of it & copying straight into my book, you would tear it up & make me do it out of my own head.  I have often wished I had you by my side here as I have struggled with my Aerial Nav. problems.  I had a hustle for over 3 hours with a wind-speed problem last night, but I beat it in the end, & had the satisfaction of mastering the principle of it.
