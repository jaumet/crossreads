<p>'Ease before elegance', par excellence. <u>But</u>, the day gets hotter still &amp; so just now my only articles of clothing are identification disc &amp; wristlet watch. And still it gets hotter!!   I suppose the disc &amp; watch will have to come off next. If the worst comes to the worst I may even have to part with my 'moustache'.</p>
<p>Dec. 8. Too hot for drill so we had a salt-water shower and a sun bake &amp; played five hundred.</p>
<p>Dec. 9. Last night I was let down from my hammock by some night-owl, who untied my rope. At 6 A.M. I had to assist the 2nd Steward and before breakfast dragged coal to the cookhouses &amp; carried frozen meat to the butcher. After breakfast we carried potatoes etc. &amp; prepared same for the cook. By ten o'clock my job was finished so I had the rest of the day to myself.</p>
<p>We have in our company a very tall, thin Corporal known formerly as the 'human gaspipe' but of late he has been called 'Good Friday', because there is no meat on him.</p>
