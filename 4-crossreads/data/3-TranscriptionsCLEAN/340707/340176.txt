Concert which lasts till 2 am is much the same as Chat Nour. Present proprietor has run show for [20] years & has a red shirt & red collar. Mde takes no interest in show but busies herself among her accounts as if the air was congenial [nay] even necessary for complicated computations. Entrance fee is 1.60 & [indecipherable] 75 centimes.
