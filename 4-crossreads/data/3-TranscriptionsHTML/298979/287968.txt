<p>exhiliarating &amp; the prospect of such an enjoyable change for the next fourteen days raised the spirits of the Sentry to the highest as he made arrangements for a visit to Aberdeen. This trip was for sight seeing only, but his principal reason for going to Scotland again was to carry out his promise to spend a couple of days with the people he had previously stayed with in Glasgow, so while taking the opportunity of seeing the much talked about "Granite City" he intended to pay a visit to "St Andrews" the Mecca of all golfers. After leaving Aberdeen he entered into conversation with the only other occupant of the R/carriage &amp; it was not long before he ascertained that his fellow traveller was a golfer this is not surprising for almost every Scotsman plays that game.</p>
<p>The Sentry explained that he intended leaving the train at the "Junction" station to be sure to see St Andrews. His fellow traveller said Oh! don't worry! I will tell you where to get out! the name of which station the Sentry also knew.</p>
<p>Conversation started at once on golf, &amp; golf experiences were mutually related &amp; exchanged. As both seemed to enjoy the talk immensely &amp; time passed quickly, of course under the circumstances the Sentry had no anxiety regarding his stopping place with his fellow traveller so conversant with all matters &amp; places locally.</p>
<p>Thoroughly entertained &amp; apparently entertaining the sentry suddenly exclaimed after a glance through the Railway carriage window Why! It is very strange but the surrounding country seems to me to be quite familiar! I could almost have said I know this place! His fellow traveller looking out said Horror! Why we are about to enter Glasgow!!</p>
<p>He looked quite distressingly depressed &amp; was very profuse in his apologies</p>
