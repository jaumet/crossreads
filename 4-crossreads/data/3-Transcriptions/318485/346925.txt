With the stimulous of <strike>songs</strike> weird singing perfect unity of action a phisique equalling that of our finest athletes, and the aid of the whip he performed almost miracles of labour.  To see a gang of Gypos shifting a length of broad gauge rails, sleepers and all is to have dispelled the mystery of their early building.  Multiply the effort <strike>the railway gangs by a of a railway</strike> of a gypo railway gang</p>
