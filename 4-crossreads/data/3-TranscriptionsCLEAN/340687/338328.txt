January, 1917. Wednesday 24Usual - one pontoon although another should have come up in afternoon. Intense cold & keen enough to cut. Fine all day and much aerial activity. Home at 4. Fritz shelled railway siding where are 4 naval 4-7" very heavily all the afternoon. Section not gone out to-night. May move on Friday so got my kit together to-night. Very great amount unfortunately.
