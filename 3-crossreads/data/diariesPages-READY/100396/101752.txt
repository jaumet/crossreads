the matter but could not find him then found out he had gone with the others, hope he enjoys himself. In other letters supposed to be my last from Egypt I mentioned the fact that the 3rd Bgde had gone to the front. I believe they are in Smyrna but cant say for certain. We will go very soon I think. some of the 3rd Contingent arrived here 2 days ago. I was told by a native of Smyrna that we should go as soon as the 3rd force had been brought here. then the lines would be clear for us. I have been given a new reg No. which is a nuisance. it's the handiest thing we have I can't see why I was not let keep my first one. so please remember. 1155A Co. 1st Batt. etc.
