<p>3.  We have had no Comforts lately &amp; we have have not had much from the Red Cross.  I've had 6 packets of 2d. Cigarettes &amp; 2, 1 oz tins of Tobacco, &amp; one shirt &amp; a face washer from the Red Cross.  So I've not done anyone of their fair share.<br/>Fancy the Post Boys eating Jack's wedding cake.  Are you sure that the Rats were not responsible?  Gee You talk about cold.  Dad &amp; George want to be here in the winter.  They have to shuffle about or they'd freeze hard.  Unless one keeps in perpetual motion, the toes &amp; fingers become numbed.  I cannot write until I have had the fire going about an Hour &amp; then the room starts to get nice &amp; warm.  Should I have occasion to go out of the room I am careful to put my Coat &amp; Muffler on just as if I were leaving a hot dancing Hall in the winter.  I have not been into Salisbury in Winter Time but If I have to stay here during the next winter I'll go to one or two dances.  I have my old dancing pumps here yet.<br/>Now Mum I have written quite a lot about nothing &amp; I've only told You about one afternoon's outing.  I have very little else that I can write about &amp; I have to write to Dad, so I'll tell Him all about</p>
