<p>"D" Camp Mametz<br/>30/3/17<br/>Showery and cold.  Battalion moved down to D Camp at 10 am.  Astonishing the amount of rubbish that comes to light on a shift and particularly annoying is the dumping of government property blankets ammunition etc that so often occurs.  Some fool put a Mills bomb in the incinerator and caused a big explosion.  After everyone had moved out inspected the lines and left a very clean camp to walk down the road to a place where 24th had left.  A similar camp to our old one but left in a dirty state.</p>
<p>After lunch all the newer N.C.Os fell in and with Alderson, Archer, McKinnon &amp; W.O. Caldwell we tuned them up to some purpose in word of command smartness of movement etc.  Drilled on a green hill side which had been shelled once &ndash; a deep trench ran across it and shell holes and empty cartridge cases told of very bloody battle.  At the foot of the rise was a small cemetery of German graves "Here rests in God" is their favourite inscription</p>
