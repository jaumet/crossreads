Having held the line without the necessity for these wires for nearly twelve months, the hasty erection of them made the men think that the head officers were certainly of the opinion that the Huns were about to make a big offensive, but of course the men in the line could see no indication of it.
The laying of all the surface wires in a large cable underground confirmed this opinion and certainly indicated that a "stay" of some duration was being looked forward to, & yet the men could not believe such an event possible.
