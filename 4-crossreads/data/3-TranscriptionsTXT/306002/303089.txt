 27.3.15 Sat. 27th.  Dismounted for a change &amp; we put the day in cleaning equipment.  Penny &amp; Nelson received a pass out from dinner time, I went in after tea &amp; met Penny at the Kursaal at 6.30.  The Kursaal was very good we then went to York House for supper, had a good time there learning French, arrived back in Camp at 10.30.  Merga Mack, Jack Plush &amp; Fitzgerald had to-night out &amp; arrived in camp about 10 oclock &amp; Mack was paralytic.  By Plush's account they had a royal night of it at Shepherds with some officers (infantry) that Mack knew.
