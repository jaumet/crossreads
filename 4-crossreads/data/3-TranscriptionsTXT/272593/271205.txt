 We have 4 cases of "trench feet" this morning in spite of all our precautions they are sending them out straight away to be attended to. I just about missed it myself for my feet are very sore this morning. One of A Coy.s Sergeants was killed up here the other day &amp; they buried him, &amp; now they have to take him up again &amp; bury him down by Bde. Hqrs  we have a small cemetery there. Shortly after breakfast this morning I took my platoon out of the line for they were about done, we had about the worst time of the lot. I had to bring them back to our old joint "Pilgrims trench" &amp; Mr Edgeley gave me a note to give to A Coy. officer asking him to clear a couple of dugouts for the men so as they could have a sleep
