Thinking that Suez air might be a change after that of Cairo I managed to get my name down as one of the 5 to leave first thing next morning. Suffered an extremely unpleasant shock when I found later in the evening (at the eleventh Hour, as it were) that my name had been taken off & another chap put on by the O.C. - Finish Suez trip - Better luck next time.
