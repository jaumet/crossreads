<p>issuing Military Officer, that that wher all I could get, as Overcoat &amp; gernsey issued previously had to last me for the period of 5 yeahrs.  I am thankfull to state that although my internement has extendet for the period of nearly 2&frac12; yeahrs, I hawe still some private clothing left, wich prevent me from running about allmost naked, like tousends other more unfortunates, wearing as stated previously, if a Internee relies on clothing issued every 6 months he will hawe to do without any clothing for at least the period of 3 months, as all the Clothing is mostly cotton &amp; of the Cheap Variety.  The shortage of clothing wher harder still for the more unfortunates as they only could earn 12 shillings every 8 weeks (providing every working day proved a dry day, as on wett &amp; rainy days, the work fell out &amp; so no shilling could be earned).  May 17, 2 shots wher fired just ,,after lights out" from somewher near the Observation tower into the direction of our Camp.  I heard the bullet of first shot distinctly entering galvanised Iron of some sort close by.  Allthough I made a search the next morning, I wher unable to find the place or any marks of bullet.  Also this shooting into Camp lines wher about 800 Internees wher quatered for the Night wher proved the next morning upon enquiries made, to be without justification.  Previously to me proceeding any further, explaining Camp &amp; life theirin I wishe to inform the readers of a statement made by our former Camp Comandant, as same appeared in the Sydney</p>
