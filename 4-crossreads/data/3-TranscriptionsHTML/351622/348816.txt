<p>The Colonials are well represented here now with the Canadians &amp; Africans. Steve leaves for the gas school.</p>
<p>24 April 1916 Easter Mon<br/>Three German aeroplanes brought down &amp; two British. More Africans arrive. Spent most of the day in the estaminet with Marsh, Keith, Sid. All making best of Easter Monday as possible. Enjoyed a good tea of steak &amp; chips. Big concert to-night in the mess-room tendered to us by one of the Tommie Ambulance.</p>
<p>25 April 1916 Easter Tues<br/>My first thoughts on waking this morning were those of Gallipoli &amp; the memorable landing that happened twelve months to-day. Yes they were up against it this time last year. Packed up &amp; left Steenwerck 5 p.m. going to an old farm where we expect to stay for a week or so. We are now about 1 &frac12; mile out of Steenwerck. Fairly comfortable but not as much as our last place.</p>
