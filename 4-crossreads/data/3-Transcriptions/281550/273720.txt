<p><u>November</u></p>
<p>the message with which we bid you farewell.</p>
<p>In the name of the German Republic.</p>
<p>Anybody reading this address would come to the conclusion that we had had a very comfortable time in Germany. But It has not been so.</p>
<p>When I first entered the country every person was war mad. They had no idea that they would eventually go under. At that time it was Deutschland uber alles. Germany over all.</p>
<p>You only have to take the Hymn of hate, to tell you what sort of a feeling the population had for Englishmen.</p>
<p>Since the Armistace, and the people can see that they are beaten, they ask us to take a message of goodwill home with us, If I had my way I would start the war again and smash the country</p>
