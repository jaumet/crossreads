Thursday 6 JuneUp at the Aid Post again, but before I left Borre I saw the most thrilling air fight of my life.  The Bosch, in a machine almost red, was endeavouring to elude four of our chaps & after most magnificent manouvering, very low down had to land at Hazebrouck.  It is said that he has twenty three machines to his credit & apparently belonged to the famous "circus" formed by the late Richtoften.
Friday 7 JuneThings are very quiet here to-day.  There has been a 9.45 mortar put in position behind us & when it fires it will draw crabs.
