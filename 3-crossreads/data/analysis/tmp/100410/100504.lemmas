 ( 2 ) Continu Contempt ? you re scarc right ; Not mnumer ? that 's true ! Nor good at talk , but when we fight More than enough for you . The Women 's Share Not our the greater glori , or the prais , Not our the danger , Lord , nor yet the pain , Although we share in all of these in way Which seem ordain for women to sustain . Our but the wait part , and our to give , To patient endur , without a word ; And , if our dearest die , tis our to live Though death may be a thousandfold prefer . The histori of our time wont mention us , tis so inde that we would have it be ; Let men have all that may seem glorious , Let us but feel our part is known to Thee .
