<p>17/11/15<br/>6 inches of water all outside, latrines flooded.  The firing line in a terrible state &amp; men spent a wretched night.</p>
<p>18/11/15<br/>Up cold wet &amp; bleak at stand to.  Does rain always make Turks jumpy?  Carried straight on instead of going back to bed, put on gumboots and went up trenches.  At intervals all the way up found parts under water, the men's dugouts washed out kits and blankets soaking &amp;amp muddy. All cheerful  and<br/>joking ; "gorblime &amp; fishermans holiday, wet &amp; no fish  Along firing line in "B" Co all muddy &amp; filthy.  Got on firing step &amp; put periscope up just as the glorious sun appeared above the horizon.  It was a lovely sight, One sudden burst of gold behind the mountains of Asiaright in rear of the Turks trenches &amp; just across the Dardanelles.  A glowing rosy blush that extended slowly across the heavens &ndash; something to remember.  Continued through 'A' Co &amp; found things still sloppy.  From B8 could see enemy periscopes, two, examining the ground in front.  Evidently very respectful of our snipers as only exposed them for a few seconds.  No other sign of life in their lines.</p>
<p>Returning through 23rd lines &amp; was talking to Ward.  Cruisers "Endymion" &amp; "Grafton' change places out here.  Only craft in sight today is hospital ship a long way out altho' sea much calmer than yesterday.<br/>Major Smith had pair of socks to spare so thought to give them away to someone in the firing line.  Approached one wag &amp; said "My people are sending me too many socks.  How are you off?" Answer "Sir I've got a pair for every day of the week"  Says Major "you're well off"  Wag," Yes but it's the same pair."</p>
