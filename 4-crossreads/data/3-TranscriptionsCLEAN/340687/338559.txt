  
 September, 1917. Wednesday 12 Day fine & windy. Spent morning finishing [indecipherable] and filling in camp shell holes. Quieter, afternoon off and going out to-night at 2 to make road just behind front. 1, 2, & 3 back about 10. No casualties but plenty of gas and fairly warm work getting in and out.
