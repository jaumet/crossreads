 it was some hours before I (after asking many policemen) was put on the right track. 
 The following day I took train from Paddington and duly arrived at Witney. I had not given my relations any notice of my intended arrival. I just wanted to go alone through the old place and live over again my boyhood. 
 It was all like a dream after my long absence. The same streets, the same names in the shop windows, everything seemed just as it was when&nbsp;I&nbsp;left. The blanket factories (for which Witney is renowned) controlled by the same people (Early&#39;s and Smith&#39;s). Only a few people had died or moved to other places.

 I left Cote House and wandered down the village and called on an old shepherd and was glad to find him home, with his wife and some of his many daughters, nearly all married now, their husbands being at the front. He has a farm of his own now, and they all have a warm place in
