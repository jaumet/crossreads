 27th Januari 1917 . Woke at 8.30 Had breakfast kept readi for go on duti . Duti happen to be up at the first line trench . Walk up to RL arriv at the trench at 2 oclock . I felt rather shaki on it . It did not turn out at all what I thought about the trench . Desol quiet abound everywher at present up there . We reel out our wire got into communic with RL through them to our Batteri . I had my first baptism of fire while at the phone . It was a live 10 minut or so I took refug in a sniper alcov which did not afford much cover . Anyhow I was dead scare while it last and am sure a heavi bombard must be aw . Our Capt arriv at 3.30 it was too late for ani " strafe " so we left the work out came away via Japan Rd Willow Walk ( a seri of trench which communic with the first second third line ) ! I was veri tire hungri when I got back had a good tea . After tea fix up the stove start our first fire . Thus end one of the most event day of my life .
