<p>Tuesday 27 March 1917 [26 March 1918]<br/>Miss Wright V.A.D. &amp; I give a whist drive to the pts. 16 in ward &amp; some outsiders to make up the sets, 9 tables altogether.  Town 11 a.m. &amp; cakes bought.  For the 1st time I notice an act of rudeness on the part of a well dressed "Gyppo" youth in Groppi's.  While taking our coffee I glanced round &amp; he immediately lifted his glass &amp; drank to me, the action was nothing to the impertinent smile which accompanied it.  Now I wonder if there is anything in the rumor that these people would love to rise &amp; are just waiting to see the result on the Western front where the biggest battle of the war is raging.  If they did rise, heaven help the women in Cairo!!<br/>Whist drive a decided success, only in the middle an order comes for "all lights to be shaded", finish in semi-darkness.</p>
