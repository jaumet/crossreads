 OCTOBER   FRIDAY 13   1916 
 Fine & cloudy & no sun. I was in charge of the party getting ashes for the stables again. Its a good job as you have nobody fooling round you all the time & you know what you have to do & do it. Heard we were going to France final week in November for certain. D [[sub?] & Campbell & Raymond went out for a couple of days bivouc with the gun.
