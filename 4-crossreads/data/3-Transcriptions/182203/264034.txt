<p>I made a list, so trust I have remembered everyone. <br/>The seven sick sisters left here yesterday for Australia. Sisters Craig, Bolton and Ralston were my friends. I also knew Sister Andrews fairly well. Sister Ricketts has gone back on transport and she has taken a letter to you from me to be posted in Melbourne. <br/>Dorothy saw one of Mrs Bastell's boys  <strike>go</strike> leaving by the same boat, so he may leave our parcels with Mr Tom Newton &ndash; anyhow they will let you know. I felt a bit homesick when I saw them leaving but since seeing Constance Murray and hearing you are all well I feel more satisfied. <br/>Fondest love &amp; kisses. Hope you will all keep well &amp; have a happy Xmas.<br/>From                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           yours lovingly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Edith</p>
