 [This diary has been written almost as an aide memoire for post war conversations &ndash; for example: "entrain at 8am and after passing through Fricourt Mametz etc we leave train at Montauban or Quarry Dump &ndash; "The Greatest Battle field of France &ndash; and what it looks like" &ndash; Our wealth of Ammunition etc."  Gibb is aware of the progress of the war and the diary illustrates just how much happens in the background behind the lines.  There is a great deal about aircraft bombings, injuries, billets, moving camps, long marches and some sport but little detail is provided.]
