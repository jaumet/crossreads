<p>Dear Mr. Layton<br/>We should be glad if you would investigate the case of Mrs. O'Connor Haldon St. Lakemba who is rather badly in debt. Her son is in camp &amp; apparently allowing her only 10/- p week out of his pay &ndash; she is owing in rent &amp; has received notice to quit unless paid.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br/>B. Booth.</p>
