Started digging gun pits. We are digging No 1 Position it is on the left of "B" Company's trenches. There are four of us & the Sergeant. We have a mile walk from the camp before we start work - full kit - & a walk of the same distance back. An engineer is in charge of the job.
We had our half holiday & we needed it, it is hard work shovelling sand.
