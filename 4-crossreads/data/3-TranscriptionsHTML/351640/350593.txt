<p>Enclosed you will find a few stamps from the Sudan.  Major Grey had a supply today &amp; he gave a specimen of those whereof he had duplicates.  If I can get into Cairo tomorrow I shall make an effort to purchase some others or some unused samples.  In the coming year or two there will likely be great changes in this part of the world, with them will come alterations in the printing <strike>and</strike> the wording and styles of the billet-de-lettre.</p>
<p>Just had dinner and wondered if a trip into town for an hour <strike>would</strike> might be improving to me.  Have decided to wait until tomorrow, when with a start in the afternoon, more time will be available to visit the Citadel and other sites that so far have not come within my itinerary.</p>
<p>Dr Scheuber, called at 6.30 this evening to enquire and see about me.  Last evening he had bidden me dine with him at the Chalet, but I was too unwell to go, therefore he called.  Was it not good of him?  He &amp; Mrs Underhill, his housekeeper, have been very kind to me, and to some other Australians temporarily residing in these parts.  He is a big man.  Should think that he weighs 17 stones.</p>
<p>Father McAuliffe told me today that Dr MacNamarra of Limerick County in Ireland, a man who was well known to Mr Macdonald, is dead, he having died recently.  He married a girl whom I used to call the Big fat lump.  How indiscreet and unkind of me.  Sorry now.  But it was not nice of me to be so bold a lump.  Sorry again.</p>
<p>Not going to town tonight:  no congenial soul with whom to go.  Instead shall write a few lines to Molly, <strike>and</strike> perhaps a few more to you before becoming tired or falling to sleep.
