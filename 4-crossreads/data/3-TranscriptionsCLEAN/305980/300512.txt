  
 16:  Destroyer picked us up at daybreak.  Anchored outside Lemnos at 10 p.m., the illuminated hospital ships presenting a fine sight.  Cold & sleet falling.  Our boat dragged her anchors owing to heavy sea & caused her propellor to become entangled in the harbour nets.  Collided with hospital ship Gloucester Castle, carrying away her gangway & boats.  Immediately after this, we ran into the Knight Templar & we received a severe shaking, carrying away our boats & causing a huge dent amidships.  Divers went down to repair the screws. 
 17:  Harbour crowded with shipping of every description, scores of submarines gliding in & out of the nets.  Orders to stay on board, living on bully & biscuits & men discontented. 
 20:  Still on board; very cold & snow fell at noon.  Food very scarce, one tin of bully for two men for 48 hours. 
 22:  Men caused a disturbance owing to scarcity of food & at 5 p.m. the authorities had heaps of provisions on board & plenty of smokes, so everything went smoothly again.   Boat alive with vermin & one has to change the clothing every day, but plenty of hot water available for bathing & washing clothes.
