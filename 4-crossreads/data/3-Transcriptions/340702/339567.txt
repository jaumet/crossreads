<p>When the casualties came into the hospital later I believe the nurses were nearly in Hysterics, Big, Rough, Anzacs <strike>were</strike> on being stripped for treatment etc, Disclosed the daintiest of Silk nighties, knickers, even Silk Stockings. There were yards of pale Blue &amp; Pink ribbons run through these garments and Altogether the nurses nearly broke their hearts over the sinfull waste I believe the Nurses grabbed the discarded clothing for their own use.   G.L. to Mac</p>

<p>Letter to Ciss 31.7.18</p>
<p>1.8.18 The Ubiquitous Fritz has just brought down 4 of our Observation Balloons all in a row All <strike>w</strike> we have to show now is 4 columns of black smoke and 6 Parachutes tossing about on their way to Earth with the unfortunate observers. There are generally two <strike>on</strike> with each Balloon &amp; there are only 6 coming down. Two of the Balloons must have had only one observer each or else two were Killed by the attacking planes. The Balloons on this sector have been getting a bad time lately.</p>
<p>Ted Welsh came back from Blighty today. There is a <strike>run</strike> rumor that we are going to shift. About 40 Tanks went up to the line last night. There must be a Stunt coming on. Fritz is very uneasy. His reconnaissance planes were over today several Times.</p>
