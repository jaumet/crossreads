<p>February, 1915<br/>Thursday 18<br/>No word from Mr J.A. Campbell so take it he intends to ignore my letter reTestimonial. The verses Mother sent me I am keeping at the end of this book. They are very beautiful &amp; I know them nearly by heart.<br/>Did a Division day today &amp; I did first day as Adjutant assistant - I am afraid I shall NOT be very popular, as it means I am promoted over other Lieutenants in the Regiment<br/>The dust is terrible here, just as like a drought stricken country, &amp; when the Column moves off nothing can be seen.</p>
