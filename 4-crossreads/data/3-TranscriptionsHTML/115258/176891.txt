<p>I met a very interresting chap last night. He came over to see me from the 3rd Regt His name is Douglas and he comes from Devonport and knows <s>all</s>&nbsp;Uncle Lou and Uncle Lisle and every body else down there, and we had a great yarn. He told me Uncle Lisle had sent him a sample of our wool when he was in camp so then I showed him all my photographs of our Corriedales. A funny thing he also seems to own all the land down at &quot;Squeeking Point&quot; that you dont, he told me he used to go down there for camping out holidays. I also had two chaps named Fraser &amp; Packam in to see me - Fraser was on Winbah with Cousin Jocelyn and Packam has been jackerrooing round Nyngan and knows every body up there. So we all talked Tassy and Nyngan till further orders. Douglas is very enthusiastic about the north-west coast of Tassy. We have all decided to go there for a holiday when the war is over</p>
