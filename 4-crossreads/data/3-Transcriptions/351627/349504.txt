<p>at present.</p>
<p>We go in the surf every day &amp; swim our horses also, I think the horses enjoy it just as much as we do</p>
<p>I have only had one letter from Artie since he returned but I suppose there is an excuse for him now that he is married</p>
<p>I am pleased to hear that Charleie has been discharged, the first wound he got was severe enough &amp; ought to have been sufficient without looking for more, am sorry his arm is so bad I hope it will improve as time goes on.</p>
<p>Well Aunty I cannot think of anything else that I may write about. Hoping you are all well</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your affectionate nephew<br/>Norman Sherwin</p>
