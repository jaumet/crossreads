Some were landed in the village and again at breakfast time some more shells were lobed in the village.<br/>I have not seen any papers since I came here but am told that the Austrians are on the run and have lost a lot of men &amp; guns. It is very difficult to get a good quality of ink, or to carry it about. I carry mine in a rifle oil bottle, but the brass of which the bottle is composed weakens the quality of the ink, making it thin &amp; watery. One often finds a bottle of ink in a dug out where some soldier has left it rather than carry it. It makes an awful mess if the bottle gets broken. So I filled my pen and bottle with fresh ink.<br/>This evening one of our observation baloons broke away from its moorings. The observers jumped out in their parachoots &amp; the baloon rose high above the clouds &amp; floated away over the German lines. The archies tried to bring it down with their shells to prevent the enemy getting it but failed. The enemy heavily shelled one of our roads this evening. There was a lot of traffic on it but all the limbers escaped. I was detailed to go up in a limber with Charlie &amp; Henry to Villiers Breton-</p>
