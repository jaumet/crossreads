 Mon. Apr. 29 Two doctors came and looked at us this morning and one of 'em told me to knock off smoking. 
 The weather is keeping good. No bloomin' mail for me yet. I can't understand not getting any Letters. Haven't had any news since Jan 9th. 
 Tues. 30th One chap in our ward was issued with Civilian clothes today. Every man in the ward looked on with eyes of envy. 
 Wed. May 1st 
 Day opened up fine, but rained towards evening. 
 They wake us up rather early in this ward. Make the Beds about 4, and bring water for washing about 4.30. Then they make the Beds. We breakfast about 7.30. About 9 the dope is given out. The doctor comes round about 10. Diner is at 12, and Tea about 4.30. 
 Dropped a few lines to Ruth today. 
 Thur. May 2 The doctor came round this morning and marked me for a Board. So now I must reat my soul in patience and wait for it to come off. Another M.O. came round after dinner and marked me Weymouth.
