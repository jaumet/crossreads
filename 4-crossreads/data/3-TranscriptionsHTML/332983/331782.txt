They were firing for about half an hour. Nothing of any importance happening this morning. Our Sgt Major has got a commission, About 5 in the Battery put in for it. He is still with the Battery, but we expect him to go to Alexandria any day. Things are quiet, we are simply acting on the defensive. Still a number of shells going over on the beach, coming from Asia. We are getting a new class of shell over, I believe they are 6in  time shrapnel. They come</p>
