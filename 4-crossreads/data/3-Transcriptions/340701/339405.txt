<p>but owing to my really magnificent ducking I only got a kick in the rear.  We dug out a 9" shell (a dud also a dead Fritz (poor Beggar) he was in an awful state.  The chap who got the 9" shell was very careful with his pick afterward.  Our boys wear tin sheets on their Backs so that the artillery won't fire on them by mistake.</p>
<p>Friday 4-8-16<br/>Had the hottest time of my life today went out on the same job as yesterday but we encountered a terrific converging fire of H.E. and Shrapnel   the Batteries were sweeping the whole length of the centre way which we were supposed to clean out.<br/>the part we had done yesterday was all blown in &amp; the trench blown flat.  Fritz would'nt leave us alone his shell fire being something awful.  at the finish I was sent on a message &amp; got lost in the Trenches.  My party went home without me &amp; I wandered about till I seen the Cap. who told me they had gone.  We have to stand by tonight there being a great attack on.  I hope everything goes off O.K.<br/>Letter to Mac. yesterday</p>
