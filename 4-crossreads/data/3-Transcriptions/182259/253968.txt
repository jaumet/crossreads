<p>..........something on our feet, as the deck was too hot for bare feet.</p>
<p>Jan 16th&nbsp; The ships gunner was to drop a cask, and have a little gun in practice. Those that were not in the know got rather a shock when the shot&nbsp; was fired, there was a rush for the deck to see what had happened, the following day our escort cruise that came with us home Free Town, had a shot &amp; blew the cask to splinters</p>
<p>Jan 21st</p>
<p>We had to have our church parade in life belts, as wee were in the danger zone. From then onward, no one was allowed to sleep on the top deck, no light showering, no cigarettes alight, all port holes closes , &amp; blackened, so the atmosphere was very uncomfortable down in the lower deck</p>
<p>25th Jan There was a great change in the condition of the sea, it was reported that two men were washed off the cruiser, but I am not sure, but I would not have been surprized there was the water was breaking over the bows. The PT Napier stopped buried two bodies, then caught up to us again.</p>
<p>28th &nbsp; We entered the English channel it was reported that a man was lost&nbsp; overboard one ship. The weather was icy cold, and we felt it very much after the tropical weather..</p>
