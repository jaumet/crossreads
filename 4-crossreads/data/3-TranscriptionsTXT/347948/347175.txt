 Through my bosom now so lonely Lightning rays of hope would dart Thou cans't with thy sunshine only Calm the tempest of my heart 
 These loved haunts then fraught with gladness Now to me no joy impart Memory brings alas but madness In the tempest of the heart These love haunts now fraught with gladness Can to me no joy impart Mem'ry brings alas but madness In the tempest of the heart
