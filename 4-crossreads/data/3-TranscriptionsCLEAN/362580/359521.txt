  
 I receive the Argus fairly regularly now but lately have not got the usual ones from Osburnes & Mollie & Jess, suppose they will all come together. 
 Sister Ralston & Bolton arrived in the same boat as Essie Craig.  I received letters from the three of them from Fremantle. 
 Sister Martin has not been at all well lately - worried about her brother, who is an  Orderley  & has been sent back to Aust. on account of bad health. 
 Think I must stop now, have told you a lot of  twoddle .  Oh, amongst some of my presents a beautiful bottle of perfume from my fried Mr C. at Alexandria with a very nice letter. 
 Fondest love & kisses to you all & just wish I could peep in & see you. 
 Your loving sister Edith
