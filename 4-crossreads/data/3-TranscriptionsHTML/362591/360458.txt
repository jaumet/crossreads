<p>We have had a very strenuous time here lately &amp; on 5th were heavily Bombared, yr. son came in for the roughest of it &amp; quitted [acquitted ?] himself like a man, &amp; I may tell you I have sent his name to Head Qrs. for special mention.  I cd. nt. describe what it was like, but for 1&frac34; hrs. they poured all sorts of shells into us, various estimates being 20,000, &amp; over 100 guns were at work brought up for this special job.  We don't want any more of it for a few weeks.  Casualties over 100.  Officers &amp; men are in very good form, Health good, &amp; food also good.  We are at present in rest billets having just done 10 days in trenches.  My wife was writeing me about the fete to be held last month in aid of the 10th funds &amp; every one seemed to be doing their very best to make it a great success, which I am sure it wd. be.  We all unite in sending our best thanks to all the good people who are ever at work on our behalf.  With kindest regards,</p>
<p>Yrs. sincerely<br/>J. Lamrock</p>
