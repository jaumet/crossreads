been "un peu de reve  Et puis- Bon Soir."It is the glorious uncertainty of this life that fascinates us all.  By the way leave has started and I expect my next letter will be full of London, theatres and all the joys of life one can rake out in ten short days.  The thought of being free for ten days is almost too much for me, no orderly sergeants to kick me out of bed, tea from thin china cups with real saucers, taxis to move you instead of feet, oh, it is all too much like a dream.
