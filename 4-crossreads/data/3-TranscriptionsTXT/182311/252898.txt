 (3.) 
 the best Division in France today. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; High praise I know but with all modesty I can say that it is true; of course any Australian Division would have done this but we were fortunately the first on the spot &amp; that too is part of the excellent work for our Artillery worked by forced marches of 30 miles per day, went into action only a few hours after the infantry &amp; moved up with us several thousand yards in the first  day  night. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It has meant hard work for us all. It has meant much danger too but comparatively speaking our casualties have been light &amp; though others  h  who have shown to the enemy a front less bold, who were less daring in their seizure of positions of vantage, have paid heavily, our cost has been much less because of our strength. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Some day I&#39;ll write of incidents in this eventful career of ours, but just at present am too busy for any lengthy epistles.&nbsp; So I&#39;ll shut off now with every jolly good wish. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; With all Love &amp; Best Love 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your  Harold
