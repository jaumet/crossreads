That we will succeed I have no doubt , simpli becaus I know your full determin to do so . Lord Kitchen has told us that he lay special stress on the role the Armi has to play in this particular oper , the success of which will be a veri sever blow to the enemi , inde as sever as ani he could receiv in Franc . It will go down to histori to the glori of the soldier of Australia and New Zealand . Befor we start there are one or two point which I must impress on all and I must earnest beg , everi singl man to listen attent and take these to heart . We are go to have a real hard tough time of it , until at all event , we have turn the enemi out of our first object . Hard rough time have of us mind but to get through them success , we must alway keep befor us the follow fact . Everi possibl endeavour will be made to bring up transport as often as possibl but the countri whither we are bound is veri difficult , and we may not be abl to get our wagon anywher near us for day , so men must not think their want have been neglect , if they do not get all they want . On land it will be necessari for everi individu to carri with him all his requir in food cloth for three day , as we may not see our transport till then . Rememb then that it is essenti for everyon to take the veri greatest care not onli of his food , but his ammunit , the replenish of which will be veri difficult . Men are liabl to throw away their food the first day out , and to finish their water bottl as soon as they start march . If you do this now , we can hard hope for success , as unf men cannot fight and you must make an effort to tri and refrain from start on your water bottl until late in the day . Once you begin drink you cannot stop and a water bottl is veri soon empti . Also as regard ammunit ? you must not wast it , by fire away indiscrimin at no target . The time will come when we shall find the enemi in well entrench posit , from which we shall have to turn them out ? when all our ammunit will be requir and rememb ?

Up till about 11.30 am everyth was taken calm then the bustl start . No one knew exact what was to be done have never move off with a convoy previous to this . In the abov , I am refer to those in charg , - not the men for I am certain that the offic in charg of the convoy did not know his busi . It was the most bad handl affair I have ever had the bad luck to be connect with . Everyon was give order and did not know whi they gave them . Also mani unnecessari thing were done , which of cours wast time and though we had near a dozen men surplus to the transport suffici men could not be found to lead the spare anim . No proper parad was call and when at last we were readi to move off , we were given the command "walk march" . If this had been obey the whole of the convoy would have soon been in utter chao . Howev the train the major of the driver save the situat and we move off in the correct way . To make matter decid wors , sever staff offic both English French were stand by watch our departur and of cours the 4th Pioneer Battalion Transport left the Stage Camp the laugh stock of the Australian Armi .
