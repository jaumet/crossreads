I went for a walk with Capt Davidson on Monday &ndash; to rest him after the strain of the past three weeks constant firing etc. He came to say goodbye yesterday and went with a very precious burden in his good ship this morning. I'll send Mother his letter to me from Imbros. I must stop &amp; go to sleep now. January 6. 1916. I must finish this letter now and post it. I am very well and have nothing to do now but rest. We do not know when we go away from here. I went to lunch on the Minnetonka two days ago &ndash; and Col McCheane gave me a heater for my tent. They are going to try to take me to Castros before we leave. Dearest love to you all In Australia or England From your devoted daughter &amp; sister Betha McMillan
