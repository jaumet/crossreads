24/5/17 Bouzincourt
Another fine spring day. After breakfast watched a domestic comedy M'selle and her father trying to get an obstinate calf along. A fresh looking pretty m'selle in neat blouse but just the giggling age and with a raspy voice. Most of these French women have unpleasant speaking voices. Received word the General Smyth would be round on an inspection but he did not turn up.. capt. Kennedy evacuated sick. The usual big crowd of Lewis gunners, bombers and others hard at work. News arrived of the award of 17 well earnt Military Medals for the fight at Bullecourt. Our parade ground is well situated and the corners are little bowers of shade of green leaf that are good to look upon. All round stretches a green and pleasant countryside. Some of our bombers have acquired the knack of throwing at good length. After lunch talked a while with M'selle and the little girl who is a dear little thing but very pale. The old man had 540000 left to him by a relative in America but did not alter his mode of life beyond erecting a good big house.
