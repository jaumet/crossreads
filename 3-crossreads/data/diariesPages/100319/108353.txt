2/9/18 Mt St Quentin ? Peronne
At dawn the 7th Bde went out through us and evidently met heavy trouble as the position soon became obscure. I stayed in bed and rested until about 9.30 when I walked down to see Colonel Brazenor many of whose people turned up alright during the night and enabled him to get a little re-organised. While down here I received a priority message from Bde telling me that I was attached to General Wisdom 7th Bde. to meet any tactical requirements. Issued orders at once for the 3 left Coys. to move at once to Tortelle Trench. The right company (Harricks) to remain in their position in Gott mit Uns Trench because the Hun is in front of it and it is practically front line. Decided to transfer H.Q. to where Davis is moving out. Davis got his I/ majority this morning. The 7th Bde report
