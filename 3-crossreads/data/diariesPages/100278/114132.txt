couldn't keep his tongue quiet but abused everyone, but he was soon keeping the others company. I had 3 or 4 pretty bad characters in my platoon and they put up a pretty good stunt.
This evening part of the 29th Division passed through here (Innskillen's) they had a very nice little string band with them and there was quite a crowd of us to see them go the majority of the British regiments have their bands with them and I think it is a good idea. A small party of prisoners passed through here this evening. Went to the pictures with a few more they had rather a nice little show it belongs to the R.F.A. and they run 2 shows per night, needless to say it is crowded both sittings for it is the only form of amusement for miles
