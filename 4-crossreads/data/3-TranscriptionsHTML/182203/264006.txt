<p>I shall buy a few more. Every fortnight we get paid and I've tried to buy something I needed    <strike>if</strike> each time. Thank goodness I brought a good stock of things, because some of the girls have had to buy heaps of things, which makes them rather short of cash for extras. I've been awfully lucky too, having such good friends to take me out. I shall miss all the attention when I get up. I hardly know anyone (male) about now. I shall not be tempted to go out so much &ndash; but really it does one good &ndash; we have not any comforts to stay in for. Only your bed room &amp; then it is too hot for anything. I'm wondering what's going to happen to me, when I'm ready for duty. Don't care if I'm sent on Transport now. Wouldn't you get a surprise if I came to Melb. to see you? One never knows what will happen next. Give my love to all my friends. Heaps of love &amp; kisses for your dear self, Mother, Eddy, Alice &amp; Ethel.<br/>From your loving sister                                                                                                                                                                              Edith</p>
