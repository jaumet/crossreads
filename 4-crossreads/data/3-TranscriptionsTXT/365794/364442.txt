 Saturday 10 February 1917 [9 February 1918] Saw Capt. Collins during morning in Connaught &amp; result &ndash; no fracture of arm, just what one thought &amp; "patience" is recommended by C. Collins &ndash; may I have plenty of it is my cry. Town 5 p.m. &amp; secured methy. for our lamp Pt. 5 per big bottle.  1 doz. photos for boys of the Connaught group &amp; posted to them at Helouan Convalescent home. So little of interest to put down &amp; yet every day is full of interest and we learn so much of other times &amp; lives. About 95 of us including V.A.D's so one only knows a few of the sisters really well.
