<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; MONDAY 25&nbsp;&nbsp; DEC.</p>
<p>Fine part of the day &amp; raining for a few hours. Mother &amp; Struan &amp; Self spent a very quiet Xmas in the Abbey Hotel only going for a short walk in the morning Alan did not come down but went up to London. I got back to camp about 9 pm in evening The boys who stayed in camp had a very fair time. What a difference from last Xmas spent at 4D with only Linda &amp; I &amp; Jo &amp; Father there. It was a nice warm day I remmember, &amp; Linda &amp; Self went for a walk up the Strand scrub uin cool of the evening. I wonder what next Xmas will bring. Home; I hope.</p>
