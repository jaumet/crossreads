<p>8 March, Saturday</p>
<p>F.<br/>G.O.C. [General Officer Commanding] makes rounds accompanied by very much Belying. I go to Y.W.C.A. &amp; play for Dance all night. It is a very nice evening. I am feeling off &amp; cannot get to sleep thinking about M.O.I.</p>

<p>W.<br/>I get my Breeches from the Tailor. I pack up for I.O.M.  [Isle of Man]. I go to Y.W.C.A. &amp; sit alone all night, reading music. Go home &amp; straight to Bed. I wait on the corner for Nothing.</p>
