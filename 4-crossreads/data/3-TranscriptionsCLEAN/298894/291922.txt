Before us lies an adventure unprecedented in modern war.  Together with our comrades of the fleet, we are about to force a landing upon an open beach in face of positions which have been vaunted, by our enemies as impregnable.  The landing will be made good by the help of God & the navy.  The positions will be stormed & the war brought one step nearer to a glorious close.  "Remember" said Lord Kitchener when bidding adieu to your commander, Remember, once you set foot upon Gallipoli Peninsular you must fight the thing through to a finish"  The whole world will be watching our progress.  Let us prove ourselves worthy of the great feat of arms entrusted to us"(Sgd.)  Ian Hamilton (General)

It must make our men wild to feel a pal underfoot.
