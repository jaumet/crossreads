On Wednesday 22nd I got out of bed because it was too cold to sleep & went for a walk to see some of the surrounding country. It is very much like Dubbo in N.S.W. in appearance, Almost every inch is cultivated, It is what the People call Hills –dales here, We in Australia call them the tablelands.

The two small villages close to the camp called Wylye & Codford we are allowed to visit after 5 pm in the afternoon till 9.30 at night. The villages are very small they consist chiefly of one street only with the houses bunched together & one or two stores & Hotels. As a rule there is a sign board bearing the name of the village placed on the side of the road at each end just before entering it.
