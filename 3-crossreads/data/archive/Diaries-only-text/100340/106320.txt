exactly myself yet. If you ever have a snap of yourself, Ivy Noni please send one over I also wish Vol that your letters were not quite so long between each other. Why it is months now since I had a letter. But then I suppose you work Ivy baby well then neither of you have too many leisure moments.
Don't you think we are winning? You saw we pushed Fritz so hard that we pushed him right through Russia now Russia has pushed back they're pushed him right into Italy. Still we're winning but then we are easily doped. Well Vol old boy I must really close now so give my best love to Sis, Noni self give my kindest regards to all your people. Must try get another leave before I go to France. Am due for it on 9/11/17 but if I am shifted to draft camp before then I will do it in. Well ta ta Vol till next mail I remain the same old stick Hal
