<p>the yearly interest from monies devised to her by her Father, but only as long as I thought she would need the help. therefore, I now make you the following proposition.</p>
<p>I will advance your Mother one hundred and Fifty pounds for your sole use in purchasing an allotment of Land the interest of which you must pay your Mother at the rate of Six pounds per centum per annum, until you either repay the principal, or she releases you from the debt this will be like my advancing your Mother 3 years annuity by the end of which she will be in receipt of an annuity from her Father's will &ndash;</p>
<p>If you and your Mother agree to this you had better call upon my Brother Joseph Hall at Mr. Lowther's commercial Stores, Sussex St. Sydney and if he agrees with you about the scheme you may consider it done. instructions respecting this will be forwarded to my Brother this mail &ndash;</p>
<p>Love dear Arthur to you and your Mother &amp; sisters</p>
<p>I remain your eff. Uncle<br/>John Hall</p>
