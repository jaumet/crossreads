Her is one little piece entitled "Memories"
- Memories -
When evening shadows fall dear,& the day draws to an endI sit, my heart still longing,For that distant dear old friendFor the dear old happy days dearWill creep out from the pastAnd memories of those dear old timesWill every for me lastI see the dear old homestead,And the church upon the hillWhere bells so sweetly chimed at eveI seem to hear them stillI can see the glowing poppies,that green amongst the cornIn the fields the cows are grazingwith the sheep all newly shorn,
