<p>Bapaume ere this.</p>
<p>Saturday 28/10/16</p>
<p>Drizzling rain &amp; blowing a treat &ndash; relieved at 5.30 pm. Had a fairly easy day. Heavy Bombardment night &amp; day &ndash; Fritz sending over plenty of H.E. Shrapnel. Had a fairly good sleep after a good nip of rum back at our dump <u>5</u> miles back. Going home in the dark. Capt Elliott, Capt Medcalf got bogged to the knees &ndash; Sergt Stevenson in trying to help got bogged worse than either. I went away &amp; got a spade &ndash; dug Stevenson out first, then Elliott, we got Capt Medcalf out minus his boots, he had to walk home barefooted &ndash; I couldn't help laughing &amp; said didn't "Bairnsfather" hit it nicely &ndash; Bairnsfather he said, what time do they feed the Sea lions. I think surely there must be a special place place in either Heaven or hell for us Volunteers &ndash; I haven't struck a man yet who didn't ease his mind by curses  when he fell about 6 ft into a shell hole. Actually got letters from Annie &ndash; Jess Hagan &amp; L. Single, all of whom say they haven't received any news of me for 3 months, this is very consoling to a bloke doing a perish here.</p>
