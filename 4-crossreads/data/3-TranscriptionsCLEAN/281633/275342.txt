Friday 13/12No snow yet.  Plenty Rain.  Got a ride on a motor to Flixecourt yesterday.  Had a meal of Eggs & Chips while there.  While so engaged a women came into the House accompanied by a one-armed Frenchman.  She borrowed some crockery, then both of them went out.  Madame then explained.  "Monsier he discharged Soldier, wounded at the War, lost his arm.  While he was fighting his Mother & two Sisters 16 & 18 years old were killed by a German Bomb".  He was going to marry the young women the next day.  I asked about the Crockery.  Madame shrugged her shoulders & said, she is a refugee.  She has nothing, the Crockery is for the Wedding?  Her Brother was also wounded, shot in the head.  This is simple cold fact and (the pity of it) so common that Madam never thought of mentioning it untill questioned.A.I.F.
