<p>March 24, 25<br/>been frightfully callous in throwing forward great masses of men, sheer weight for his success.</p>
<p>243.<br/>Mail, from Smiths, Paris, "Cathedrals of England &amp; Wales", two E.N. books of Georgian Verse, and "Limehouse Nights", a bonser letter from Mother of Jan. 27, one from Hazel, and one from Mat.</p>
<p>Detailed for Night Duty &ndash; in Cookhouse.</p>
<p>244.<br/>Lying full in the afternoon sun finished reading of "The Vengeance of Fionn".  I'll read it again.</p>
<p>245.<br/>C. Section to a station by Ravelsberg, to take over a section station.  4th shelled out.</p>
<p>Tonight saw Mick B. and Jimmy O'F., they down from Reserve, go into line posts tomorrow.</p>
<p>March 25<br/>246.<br/>Duty last night - Babbling and a damn dirty job, would sooner the Infantry than Cookhouse.  Turning in after a long night.</p>
<p>Met in Dressing room old Woollahra boy &ndash; Hoptroph (spelling's wrong).  He in the 1st Bgde. French Mortars.  A yarning of old Woolahrians and a long list of them dead here.</p>
<p>Bombing during the night, mostly towards Dickebusch, 3 kilos away.  Major Lee brings in late rumour of Peronne falling to the Boche.</p>
<p>Reading Burke's "Limehouse Nights", two yarns read and two gems, but for loveliness of description I like his "Twinkletoes".  Writing 4 pages of letter to Mother, 4 pages to Mat.</p>
<p>So to sleep, brought from A. Camp "'Dorian Gray", Ruskin and Murdock, but too tired to read.</p>
