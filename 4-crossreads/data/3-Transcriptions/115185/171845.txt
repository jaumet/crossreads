<p>P.S. Please post me a weekly paper and Saturday paper any old papers will be appreciated by the wounded men. I may be able to give you a better address next letter. Perhaps Father could enquire at Victoria barracks if our letters sent there are being sent on weekly. For we have not got any yet written C/o Victoria Barracks and we have been exactly 3 weeks in England. I was lucky to hear from you via St Cloud.<br/>The other sisters who gave addresses of Banks in London received letters too. They should know at the Barracks where we are? and be able to send them on.</p>
