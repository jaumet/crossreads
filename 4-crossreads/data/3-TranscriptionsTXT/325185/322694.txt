 I had a letter from one of the Yeo girls the other day she said some of the boys were in Sydney for tennis &amp; were going to enlist as soon as it was over.  I haven't been receiving the papers you have sent me.  In fact havint had a paper since Xmas  It seems waste of time sending them when we don't get them.  I have been getting the Guardian from Cobbora but havent had any letter lately.  I write Gran when I have a chance if there is a break you will know it is because of some order about mail.  I have heard we can't post for six weeks am writing this on the off chance. You will get it some day.  I know you are all thinking of me &amp; that I have the well wishes of you all.  I haven't forgotten Sydney either &amp; if I am lucky enough to come through alright I shan't be long getting back.  I don't think I would like to stay in Egypt too much live stock for my fancy.  I would  like to see Harold Arnold when he comes across.  I shall keep a look out for them all.  Harolds sister won't like the idea of his coming across.  I recieved a letter from Roy this morning written on the 1st Dec also a card from Mrs Field the same date
