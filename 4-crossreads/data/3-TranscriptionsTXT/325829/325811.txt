 Capt Fitzhardinge the R.M.O. reports [the handwriting looks the same as the previous pages]:- 
 Since Oct 1916 we have passed through three unsatisfactory periods: looking at it from a health point of view. 
 A The summer of 1917. Septic sores chiefly due to the lack of facilities for washing, &amp; the dust. 
 B In Nov 1917 Diarrhoea during the advance from Gaza northwards. When the Regt got near Jaffa the combination of oranges &amp; native bread (made of dara) caused a very large number of cases, which fortunately reacted very quickly to treatment. 
 C June to Oct 1918 Malaria in the Jordan Valley &amp; I am dealing with this more fully. 
 After we returned from the 1st Amman Raid we were attached to the 1st L.H.Bgde at Mt Ghoraniye Bridge head defence April 3rd-April 16th &amp; during this period the flies were terribly troublesome, &amp; we had a large number of cases of Diarrhoea which I consider was due to the sudden change of climate.
