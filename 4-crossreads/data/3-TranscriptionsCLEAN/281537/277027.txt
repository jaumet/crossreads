 15/9/15 Up at 4.15.  Raining. Clay mud in trenches, this place will be awful in winter and all rough weather comes right off the sea.  One man killed in "D" Co during the night while repairing parapet.  One bullet took half his face off.  Abdul very jumpy and firing a lot all night.  During the morning he tried some funny business waving a flag which drew some fire from us.  Lower down one put his head over and called out something signalling a washout with a shovel when our chaps fired
