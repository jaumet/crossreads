<p>Our O.C. was one of the finest fellows possible (his name being a favorite of our boyhood, another name for pudding)! He had been a private himself therefore realized what we had to put up with, and always studied the men under him. He was in France for a time with the Battalion, but afterwards joined the Flying Corps, and got wounded in a &quot;stunt&quot;.</p>
<p>I think that I told you that during the &quot;circus&quot; parade, we were all issued with &quot;Light Horse&quot; overcoats. I was wrong, there were not enough to go round, so those who did not receive an overcoat at&nbsp;the time were issued with an extra blanket. Some time later they received a fresh stock of overcoats, then on parade one day, we were all ordered to go to our huts and fetch the overcoat, and those who had not one to bring an extra blanket. We wondered what was going to happen. Were those who had &quot;light horse&quot; overcoats going to receive proper infantry overcoats, and were those who had the blankets going to receive an infantry overcoat? I told my friend that I guessed that was the idea. I&#39;m certain my tall friend had been in the army before, he always seemed to be able to tell all the foolery which took place. In this case he simply said: &quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Gill! you ought to know by now that a sensible action such as you suggest could not possibly emanate from the combined brains of the military authorities. You do the Asquith stunt. You wait and see. You&#39;ll&nbsp;find that we shall simply walk down with our overcoats, and walk back with them. The fellows with blankets will very probably walk back with them too. This is only done because our officer wanted to &quot;get off&quot; early, and is using this overcoat parade as a &quot;blind&quot; to save us going on a route march, and thus making him late meeting his girl. you wait and see&quot;.</p>
<p>Well! to make a long story short, my friend was not far wrong, there were only a very few new overcoats, so the majority carried back their blankets, and we all returned with the same overcoats. Afterwards, some time afterwards, some infantrymen got into trouble for wearing light-horse over-</p>
