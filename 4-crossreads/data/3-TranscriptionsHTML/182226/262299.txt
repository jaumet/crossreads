<p>Monday 4 October, 1915</p>
<p>Very heavy bombardment in the Anzac zone by both sides.</p>
<p>Am very comfortable here. The food is first class &amp; everyone tries to do all they can for you.</p>
<p>Have had a shave &amp; bath. I hope I don&#39;t catch a cold (?)</p>
<p>Am just lying about all the time yarning &amp; reading.</p>
<p>I am sorry in a way at being away from the firing line but I was not much use there as I was.</p>
