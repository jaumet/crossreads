20/6/19 London
Up early and caught the 8.19 train at Warminster station getting a lift in by an ambulance. It was wet and people welcomed the change after something very like a drought. The country all along looking very pretty. Reached Paddington at 11.30 put up at GW2 Hotel. Then tubed into town and went to Horseferry Road and saw Coleman. To a Jew tailors for some medal ribbons ? he and the girl who sewed them on talked in Yiddish. To the Grosvenor Hotel for lunch and then walked down to Belgrave Sq and saw Plant at the R R HQ and found that perhaps we shall go home on the Wiltshire about 4th July. Came out near the gateway of Hyde Park and rode up to the Bank on the top of a bus. A rather wet ride but a good way to see London. Today the conditions were rather unique too
