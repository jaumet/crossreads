<p>Edinburgh. Went for trip down to Leith, Newhaven, &amp; Granton. Dined twice at the Unionists Club in Princes St. Next day had a look at the Firth of Forth and its great bridge, going out to Queensferry by motor bus. In the afternoon had a good look over Edinburgh Castle and then strolled along the "histories mile" of streets to Holyrood Palace &amp; Park having various places of interest pointed out to me in this ancient part of the town. Looked up a chap living out in Sth. Oswald St, came back to Edin. &amp; then caught the 7 pm train for London. Arrived at Kings Cross Station next morning pretty early and went straight down to Wallington. Here I stayed for four days with friends and had quite a good time. Went up to London fairly often, visited the Tower, St Paul's Cath., Westminster Abbey &amp; Zoo. Paid hurried visits to friends at Southall, Streatham, Clerkenwell, Kew Gardens, Sheperds Bush, Bayswater &amp; Westminster. Had a look at a couple of shows. On Saturday evening, 20th inst. I left Wallington by the last train for London. Made an early start next</p>
