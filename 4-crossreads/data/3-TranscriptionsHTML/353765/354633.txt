<p>Decr 1916<br/>2/15 &ndash; Still at Hassaniya. Nothing of any moment happening. On Decr 13th, first news of German Peace Proposals rec'd Terms Status Quo ante Bellum excepting Polish autonomy. Foregone conclusion not likely to be considered. Bucharest fallen no doubt urged the prop. Went for a ride to Hod el Baba, Khariit &amp; one or two other smaller hods, saw where the 3rd bde of L.H. had been attacking. Quite a number of graves there also one of a Turk the leg &amp; foot of which was exposed. Horses appeared as if they had been killed while being held. Took a snap of one of graves. Meeting of Anzac Memorial committee held at D.H.Q. when it was agreed that a bronze statue of a trooper mounted &amp; on a pedestal with a plate for each Bde &amp; its details etc. &amp; that as a nucleus each man give a day's pay to the fund<br/>2/15 &ndash; Also that 2 ac. E of Kantara be reserved as a burial ground &amp; all fallen in the Sinai desert fighting be re-buried there. 15th &ndash; Sgt JJ Dunb returning from Abd brought rumour that we were to move out on 16th. Nothing to add any colour to it. Not very p't'clar whether true or not getting beyond that stage therefore treat with indifference. Aust mail arrived today. Usual letters so far, more expected. Had letter from Aunt Hannah telling me Stuart had only stayed three days in England &amp; sailed for Aust in the Malwa arriving Sydney Nov 16th. Bert going to Lithgow after request by urgent wire to report there.<br/>15th/18th &ndash; Rumour proved to be rumour altho everybody seems to think we will move directly after Xmas. <strike>Advice</strike></p>
