blown up, my Mate myself went down to our Eng what a shock I got, the Road No. 3 alongside of my Coal truck behind my Tender was blown up about 4 ft of Rail was blown clean away, The Truck was riddled with Shell Splinters my Tender Eng was covered in dirt pieces of sleepers. The Tarpaulin covering the Cab part of the Tender was full of Dirt a hole about 1 inch wide by 2 inches long was made by a piece of shell the piece was lying in the Cab, We had both left the Eng just in time as I mentioned before about the Shell exploding behind me leaving the Eng that what it was we had a narrow escape. The S. Master went along the roads to see if any further damage to other had been done came back reported No 2 at the top end had been also blown up. All incoming Trains were cancelled we did no more work at Midnight I was releived was glad to get back to our Camp as my nerves were very bad
