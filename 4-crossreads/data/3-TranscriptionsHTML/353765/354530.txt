Large town right on shores. Brick &amp; stone buildings mostly. Some very large buildings, military barracks etc, being prominent. Entrance looks well fortified, big guns standing on hills overlooking mouth of harbour. Inner harbour very secure, narrow entrance &amp; breakwater. Guns also commanding same. About half a dozen small steamers including "Dominion". "Inghoor" "Ruic", flying Quarrantine flag, tied up near entrance. All looked deserted. Hospital near beach.

Holyander trees lining streets, prickly pear also cultivated as a food. <strike>cactus</strike> Articles very cheap, postcards from 2d a dozen upwards. Cabs for 1/- an hour. Town of Silema not far distant.
