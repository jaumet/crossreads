July, August, September 1919out for pure enjoyment was when the Peace Celebrations were on in Sydney.
All or most of the Public buildings &amp; business places were lit up with electricity &amp; they looked lovely.  The Water &amp; Sewerage buildings were in my opinion the best effect.  All the Flags of the Allies was the design, &amp; they were all lit with their natural colors.
During my Leave I bought a Camera &amp; got a good deal of amusement out of Photographing people &amp; objects.
On September 2nd I started work at the Painting trade with Wintle &amp; Wintle Contractors of Mosman Bay.  This is the first work I was able to get since the termination of my leave on July 30th.  Just at that time work was very scarce about Sydney &amp; there were thousands of Returned Soldiers on the unemployed list at the Repatriation Department.  The Repatriation Department procured this job for me.  I was just about one week on their roll &amp; drew sustenance pay to the value of &pound;500.
