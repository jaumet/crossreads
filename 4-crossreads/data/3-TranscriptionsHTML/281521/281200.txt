<p>12/4/17<br/>Becourt<br/>the Battalion and gear is expected to come in about noon. The other Battns. parading as usual &ndash; bands playing. Arranged for baths this afternoon 50 men half hourly. In the morning we leave early clearing Pozieres at 9 a.m. marched in about noon and settled everyone down in the huts which had not been properly cleaned by the outgoers. Had a long cold wait before anything eatable appeared and lost touch with O.P. [indecipherable] my batman. When he appeared he said he had been having his lunch. Rather amusing! Later he went into Bapaume and did not return until late and then odorous of drink. A dag! Several officers much off color owing to thyphoid inoculation. Heavy snow fell in late afternoon and drifted into a thick carpet covering everything. In the evening C.O. assembled O.Q. Corp for a few remarks on march discipline<br/>Transport. Ours is becoming too slack Evans being fat &amp; easygoing. A change there would be good</p>
