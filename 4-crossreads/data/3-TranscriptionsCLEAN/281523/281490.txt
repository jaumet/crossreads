  
 18/9/17 Ypres Westhoeke Ridge terrific bombardment.  They started far back 2500 yards behind his line and commenced to work forward.  The sky was one livid mass of flame and the air full of acrid fumes and smoke.  Several times our dugout rocked and one was thankful for the steel rails and concrete.  Our 15 inch guns had been strafing a ridge 1000 yards away and each thud shook the foundations here.  The blow backs were enormous.  All the post guides for this flank we put into our rear recess but the other flank I am rather worried about.  The 5th Bde take over this as a battle H.Q. in the morning and already we have scores of people buzzing round, wireless and other signallers, engineers etc.  For weeks we have been deliberately refraining from shelling certain of his roads keeping them for zero day and then every place will catch it.  Hereby we trust to keep down his supply of ammunition from coming up.
