 Dear Dad, This is an Inn that Tommy and I had a drink at on our way from Eastleigh & Romsey. It was supposed to be used by Mr. Pecksniff in Dickens Famous Book. The Beer we had had been placed to near the "strong" stuff & seemed to be inoculated for it has a sickly taste. There is a fine carved mantlepiece in the Saloon off the bar & one could picture old Pecksniff in this corner & that corner & ordering his drinks in the sanded -floored top room. It is only 3 miles out of Sarum & is a lovely down Hill run from that place. It is a very hot afternoon & I have let all the Boys off. One of my chaps has gone to fetch his wife & kiddies to Durrington. I have some really good chaps & some  d.... Mongrels. Well, I must write a letter as well & I'll address that to Mum. Best Luck & sincere Regards to Otto & Mr Quinn & Mr Cocks  Love Harry  X
