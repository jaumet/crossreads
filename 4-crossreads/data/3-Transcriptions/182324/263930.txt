<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>On arrival here I got a very pleasant surprise in receiving your letter forwarded on from Sydney &amp; a breath of the &quot;old times&quot; came along.</p>
<p>I shall be more than delighted to call &amp; see you on my arrival at Sydney to receive the copy of the &quot;Yandoo&quot; which you so kindly have secured for me.</p>
<p>During the whole of the [trooping?] during the war the only two contingents we carried which to my mind showed them selves as real Soldiers &amp; men were the 7th Light Horse Col. Arnott O.C. which went home in the Second Convoy &amp; the memorable voyage on which your Son went home. The Artillery men were <u>splendid</u> &amp; at the end of the trip I was presented with a beautiful testimonial</p>
