<p>Land of the towering stalwart gum<br/>Land of the evergreen<br/>What shall our message be to you,<br/>Who sent us out to "see it through"<br/>And take our stir at the War God's brew,<br/>Where never the guns are dumb?</p>
<p>Land in the grip of a winter stern<br/>Land of the leafless tree<br/>From you who bear the war's deep scar,<br/>A message speed to our homes afar,<br/>"Well we know that the door's ajar<br/>"Love, and to you a quick return."</p>
<p>S.D. Leslie</p>
