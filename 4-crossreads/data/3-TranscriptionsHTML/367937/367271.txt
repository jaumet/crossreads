<p>In the tent<br/>Was just thinking how much I liked writting to you and Father, Mother dear, I think I could write books home if there was only something to talk about &amp; My Word I like getting your letters too I gess.<br/>We are having a really splendid time at present, not a bit like the awful times people imagine; most beautiful weather, cloudless days &amp; nights, not very hot days and nights just cold enough to like blankets.  We get up about 6 o'clock and all we have to do is feed &amp; water our horses and feed ourselves and we get jolly good tucker, far better than Liverpool, and there is no ceremony or orders or anything &amp; we are all a happy family.<br/>The flies are not really bad &amp; there is no dust &amp; we just lie round &amp; smoke &amp; read yarn &amp; write letters all day and I have never felt better in my life.  Of course we get touches of Home sickness now &amp; again but one of your happy letters always puts me right again straight away.<br/>While I think of it, would you send me a couple of woolen vests, they say the nights are very cold here in winter, but anyway vests are always very useful the silk shirts will be nice too.<br/>I have never received a paper from home since I left (got 2 Australians from Alan) but parcels seem to come alright.  Got a letter from Mrs Nicholl with yours.  Jack Glennie gets the Guardian every week &amp; hands it on to me so I am not missing it altogether.</p>
