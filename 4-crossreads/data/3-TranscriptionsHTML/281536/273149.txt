<p>9/9/19 Sydney<br/>Wet morning. Walked round Pitt Castlereagh &amp; George Sts and booked opera seats at Palings to [indecipherable] &amp; saw MacGowan re lunch. All men seem well dressed including working class and their clothes are clean. Narrow footways &amp; verandas.Visited Horderns and other "sights". Went to Faust.</p>
<p>10/9/19 <br/>Fine. Went over to Manly and had a look round getting a good toss going across the harbour. No one surfing too cold. Fine long breakers. Back to hotel dinned and then went to a matinee of "Madame Butterfly" with plump Amy Castles in the title role. Met MacGowan in the evening and went out to dinner with him at his very nice place and [indecipherable] family at Hunters Hill. Beautiful lights on the water at 11 pm returning.</p>
