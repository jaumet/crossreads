  
 Thur. Jan.16 (cont.) Quite a decent Dinner. Roast meat, & plenty of vegetables & Steamed Pudding. After dining got my pass from [indecipherable] Office & took my seat in the car for Westham. The Driver said there were too many aboard, so Sgt. Duffy & I had to walk in. Being such a fine day we quite enjoyed it. Took my pants to the Tailor in Weymouth to get the Leathers sewn on.  He promised to have them done by Monday. Then I went out to Westham & saw the Q.M. about the Cape.  This kept me messing about for about an hour, & then I got no satisfaction I'm afraid that money is as good as lost. Went up to see Col. Astbury, but he was out. So I returned to Weymouth &  had Tea at a little shop. Bacon & Eggs & Bread & Butter & some excellent coffee all for 2/6d. This was not dear considering Eggs are 5 1/2d each. After Tea strolled around the town for a while, but not meeting anyone I knew I purchased a Box of Water Colors & returned to Camp by Car [indecipherable] Fri Jan 19. Lloyd-George's Birthday, too.  This is Frances' Birthday.   I wonder how the poor old Girl is spending it. Got a nice long letter from her yesterday. She says they are having a very rough time. It is a beautiful day & the diggers are sitting about in the sun & quite enjoying it. The "Ulysses" & "Manga" Boat Roll  crowd are leaving tomorrow & they are buzzing around getting their things ready. Bert Berry is on the "Manga" & Bill Beards is on the "Ulysses", & 4 more fellows in my Hut are on the Roll. I shall be might glad to see my name on a Roll. The [indecipherable] is a long time putting in an appearance. Bill Beard came to say "Hooray". I gave him my address & told him to give us a call if ever he gets as far as Sydney.  Sat.18. Another beautiful day quite frosty. It's quite a treat to be alive weather like this. Had a Bath after dinner & donned a clean change. Washed all my dirty clothes, so now all my gear is clean. I just want a pair of Boots, & they can stick me on a Boat Roll as soon as they like. The "Ulysses" & "Manga" arrived left this morning.
