<p>Finished the day with [indecipherable] the half back for S. Sydney League &amp; a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p>4 April 1916 Tues<br/>Very late on arising just having time for a mouthful of tea &amp; off with 5th Brig H.Q. to Thiennes to draw rations. There I met Cecil Alwarth who acted as good samaritan by giving me nine packets of smokes. Saw Jim on my way out who was bound for a gas demonstration.</p>
<p>[Note in margin]<br/>Visited the brewery</p>
<p>5 April 1916 Wed<br/>Did the cooking again to-day. Jim &amp; Dick have orders to go &amp; join up with their H.Q. &amp; at 4 pm we opened a couple of bottles of vin bidding them farewell. A big sing song in the White Horse estaminet to night. All merry when the doors close at 8 oclock. Such times as these I did not think were in store.</p>
