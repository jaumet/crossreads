December, 1915
Wednesday 8
Transferred to Hospital Ship early in morning.
As  barge drew near ship I saw a nurse on board   - first white lady for 3 or 4 months.  Seems delightful to get to comfort after the hell over there.
A spell will do a man a world of good.
Taken in cradle on a crane from barge to ship then down a lift & along a corridor to ward.
Put in a cot with clean sheets, washed & put in pyjamas.
Surely the [indecipherable] Castle' is an earthly heaven!
