It is about 9.30 when we are in readiness to again be on the move, so after the roll call and other procedures are gone through, the order is given "form fours", "quick march", and we are off again on our way to go through some more experiences.  Pass through once more the now well-known village - Vauxl -, on over the same ground which holds such sad memories, through the sunken road where I first became acquainted with "Horatio", and back to the trenches which a week or so ago we had fought for and won at such a terrible cost.
Everything appears to be much the same as when we were here before, the trenches a bit more knocked about, the mud if possible a little more sticky and the bank just as impossible to secure a safe foothold.
The night is pitch dark save for the light caused by the firing of our guns or the "flares" of the enemy, which are weird and uncanny in their brilliancy.
Not so many shells explode in our immediate vicinity, "they" are "feeling" for our guns which have "moved up" since our last visit here, but still we are not altogether neglected in this respect.  "He" need not imagine that we shall feel slighted if he leaves us alone for a time.  We should rather like it, in fact.
At night some of us would be sent back to the sunked [sunken?] road, to fetch supplies, such as ammunition, bombs, and such-like things, which are far from pleasant carrying during the heavy shell-fire, and passing along in front of the village from which issues the everlasting ping, ping of the machine guns.  The way is slippery and the shell-holes many.
Some tanks arrive while we are employed on this duty, and the noise they make is probably heard by the enemy, anyway "he" increases his shell-fire, as if aware that something is taking place, which requires his intervention.  He does intervene with a vengeance too.  We are mighty glad to get back safely to our trenches.
These tanks are being brought up in readiness for the historic, but
