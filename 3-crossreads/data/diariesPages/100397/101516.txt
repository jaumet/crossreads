With the British Expeditionary Force
4.3.17
I have only time for a short note Bea. just to tell you that I am once more in France, and ere long may go up to have another interview with Fritz I left E. this week and arrived here without seeing anything exciting we werent even chased by Submarines or torpedoed or anything just came across, and here I am. The last part of my diary in England was not quite so pleasant as the first for when the ground started to thaw and we had some rain, the place was just lovely.. mud there was plenty of it, everywhere you went you found it. it was nice and sticky too and walking became first class exercise, in fact it was better than Physical drill. I did not have to put up with it long. we were sent over here and for the present things are different for the country here is of a sandy nature, and much better for camping in wet weather.. The last few days the sun has struggled through the clouds. quite a treat after the long dull winter, with it's grey leaden Sky and cold miserable days. What wouldn't I give for a glimpse of our own Australian Sunshine When I get back I guess I'll just want to go somewhere out on one of our beaches and lie in the sun and sleep for the sake of sleeping.
