<p>1919</p>
<p>New Years Day<br/>Arrived at the Bosphoros at 7 a.m. &amp; steamed through &amp; arrived off Constantinople at 10 a.m.  Disembarked some of our troops &amp; baggage.</p>
<p>2.1.19<br/>Embarked troops for Salonika &amp; left the wharf for anchorage outside harbour &amp; left next morning for Salonika.  This day went ashore at Constantinople.  Invited up to the British General Headquarters for lunch &amp; then went with some Military officers in a German commandeered Motor car all around the City.  It is a large city &amp; fine buildings but the streets are narrow &amp; badly kept.  We called at the German wireless &amp; cable head quarters &amp; seen a beautiful plant left behind by them all intact, the Germans having cleared out a few days before the British took the city over.  The streets were full of Turks &amp; seemed to be very orderly.  The best part of the shops open &amp; fairly well stocked but everything very dear.  British battleships were moored alongside the quays also French &amp; Greeks, the Harbor full of allied shipping.  It appears that trouble occurs at the old part of the City Stamboul [Istanbul?] at night generally between the Greeks &amp; the Turks &amp; several murders occur daily.</p>
<p>3.1.19<br/>At 1 a.m. we left the anchorage for Salonika at 11 a.m. in the Narrows &amp; passed the nets &amp; barrage &amp; the forts &amp; off Cape Helles at 2 p.m. passing within &frac12; a mile of the River Clyde &amp; several other transports sunk there, also the French cruiser.  Off Imbros we were escorted through the Turkish mine field by the British destroyer Hind</p>
