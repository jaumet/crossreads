<p>Monday 21st Oct 18.</p>
<p>Just finished a hard day's graft with more worry than was necessary. The cause of this was the fact that Mr Garland notified me that there would be two afternoon drills this week: Tuesday &amp; Friday; &amp; after we had made the necessary alterations in the time table, he came  along with the news that only Wednesday was to be used for special drill. This put us in a funny position, for all alterations had to be cancelled, &amp; that made matters more difficult for us although it was done, I think, (by the Colonel) as a help to us. Probably it will turn out to be better for the classes.</p>
<p>Have felt worse this afternoon than for a long time, on account of the beginnings of worry. Work is not harmful except when</p>
