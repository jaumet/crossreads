<p>arrived from Australia and were camped at Tel-El-Kebir. I asked British A.D.S. to send them up to our Bakery and I would work two shifts. This was done shortly after and we were then able to supply all Australian Units in Camp. The Flour supplied  was all from hard wheat &ndash; mostly Canadian and with 25 years experience previous I never saw a more even or better quality of Bread. I often wonder if I was fortunate, considering reflections I have heard   <strike>of</strike> caste on British Officers. (The supply depot at Tel-El-Kebir during my time there changed O/Cs three times, and each of them knew his job from A to Z.) My recollections of them will always be of the happiest. Two of them have "gone west". Five I have always kept in touch with. At Tel-El-Kebir I again came in touch with that "impossible" who had previously been at Abbassia and Zietoun. He was the most incompetent muddler possible to find. My opinion was supported by every officer who I spoke to on the subject. When Col. A took over command of the Camp all friction was wiped out. Stiff in discipline but a splendid administrator. On the 5th of March the O/C returned to his Unit after being away five months and I was very pleased to be able to hand over the Unit to him with such a clean and meritorious name.</p>
