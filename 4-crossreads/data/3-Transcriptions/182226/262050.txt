<p>Friday 28 January, 1916</p>
<p>We have had to live on bully beef, biscuits &amp; cheese all the time &amp; very little of that. I wrote a letter to the mater telling her all about our getting here but it was returned by censor who will not let us say anything about being this side of the canal.</p>
<p>A chap from the A.M.C. went into Ismalia with sick &amp; we have given him some cash to bring us back something to eat &amp; some cigarettes.</p>
<p>The bad tucker is bringing on my old complaint again.</p>
