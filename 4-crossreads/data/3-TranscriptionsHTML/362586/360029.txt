<p>Remember me to the 1st Lieut<br/>Wien<br/>Le 25 Mai 1914</p>
<p>Dear Old Fergutts,<br/>Cafe-au-lait, biscuits und womit zu Schreiber.  There I am in a little restaurant in Vienna.  I have just got the cafe-au-lait, full of whipped cream, I hope that does not mean a good old spue at 1 am tonight.  We had a simply [blickster?] time in Venice, got there last Thursday left on Sunday in an unholy Italian Sleeping car for Vienna Wien as it must be called here.<br/>I have forgotten all my German never was very much, but to counter balance this defect, my French has been understandable everywhere.  Here they think it infra dig to talk anything but German, and only two people we have struck besides Americans who talk English.</p>
<p>I am writing at a little table on the street in a halo of red light.  At the next table a two people, male &amp; female, smoking cigarettes &amp; generally enjoying themselves.  Across the road is a gallant officer, belonging to Francis-Josephs Own Imperial Hussars, with two medals, (Everybody wears medals here, even in undress uniform) But I am not minding my own business.<br/>I am just in the middle of an attack of overeating (Venice) after milk foods (Florence Scarlet fever).  The square in front of St Marks is magnificent, a huge affair, about the size of Our ground Rushcutters surrounded on three sides by palaces once belonging to doges, and on the fourth by St Marks.  Every evening a military band plays here.  There are thousands of little tables at the sides of the Square, and you can sit (provided you get there early morning as there is always a   [indecipherable] crowd) eating the most delicious bombs, and listening to one of the best bands in the world ([indecipherable]).  The guide Books describe it as   [indecipherable] open air drawing room &amp; I don't think you could get a better description.  In the evenings everybody walks up &amp; down up &amp; down that blessed square, looking at everybody else, and criticising in about 5 different languages.</p>
<p>Sunday morning was a fine sight.  There is a very very old clock tower just near St Marks.  It is absolutely a mechanical marvel.  Twelve bronze giants strike the hour on a huge bell.  The clock is faced with the signs of the Zodiac and in front of the face is a little verandah, just after the clock has struck and door opens and 3 or 4 grotesque figures (2 Kings &amp; Queens, and a Turkish monarch as far as I can make out) are moved round this verandah by clock work, When they get opposite the Virgin Mary, they bend their bodies and raise their hands to the Salute.  You have no idea what a fascination this has for the Italians, they flock in hundreds every hour to see this procession.</p>
<p>I have paid for my coffee, it was 44 Heller, 4d, there must be a mistake some where, as I had Cafe-au-lait, &amp; [buns?], then they took that away &amp; I had ice cream &amp; wafers.  I deem it expedient to finish this letter in this restaurant!<br/>We are staying in a peculiar pension, they are very full up and I have to go through a maids bedroom to reach my room.  Her bed is inclosed by a screen.  I have just come in.  This is a mad place!  I got to the gate &amp; found it locked, after some ringing the Hallporter came &amp; asked him in Excellent German (?) when he shut the doors, he said at 10, and demanded 20  2d Heller after 10.  My word they took you right &amp; left.  When I got to my room the maid was going to bed, and  after a great deal of talk, of which I understood nothing, she said Kommen sie [heir?] bitte [come in here please?] I went through nothing being visible, I shall go to bed with another curse upon my head.<br/>May 27th<br/>I have just come back from the changing of the Guard at the Imperial Palace.  To tell you the truth I was disappointed in the Imperial Guardsmen.  There were only a few of them standing about.  Each day a company of Infantry from the guard, they change at 1 PM.  The new guard marched into the <strike>square</strike> [camtzaid?], doing the Goose step and accompanied by a splendid band.  The old guard stood to attention, that is with their rifles held at the shoulder with the sling over their right shoulder and they played the national anthem.  Then while the Guards were being posted the band played.  Of course Vienna is famed for music.  The military bands are something like.</p>
<p>On Sundays the officers &amp; police wear their dress uniforms, and they are really very fine indeed.  All military men wear swords, non-coms &amp; police included.  The police on Sundays &amp; Saints Days wear, cocked Napoleon Hats, surrounded with a [indecipherable] blue &amp; red feather dusters, and have [indecipherable]  coats lined with huge scarlet stripes.  Their shoulders are covered with white roping (like an admirals).  You think you have drifted back a century or two to look at them.  They look fine and my word they know it.  The infantry officers have dark navy blue jackets (very tight fitting) Sky blue pants with a scarlet stripe and black leggings, in the evening they wear magnificent sky blue capes, reaching down to their knees and about [indecipherable] round the bottoms they make them sway like the Highland kilts when they walk.  They are some class.</p>
<p>On Sunday at noon everybody seemed to be in the Piazza watching the clock.  The men were in their best to say nothing of the women and here and there the gay uniform of an officer gave a recherch&eacute; touch to the scene, the pigeons were being fed (thousands of them) by those who were inclined that way.  The banners of Italy were flying from three huge 16 century flag staffs where once the banners of the [victorious] venetian republic flew, the noble old lion of St Mark floated from the cathedral, my word it was a sight to remember.  At 12 oclock the cannon went off, all the pigeons rose in a body and circle round the piazza (square), the huge bells of St Marks, the Campanile, and the clock tower, rang out, out came the figures on the hour, it was fine.</p>
<p>It is peculiar in Italy, everybody wants to do you.  For the slightest little thing you have to tip, you tip in [indecipherable] though.  Getting into a gondola, there is always an old cripple with a [hack?] standing by, who pretends to hold the gondola steady, when you get in he holds out his hat and looks miserable.  You have to give him 10 centimes or so, if you give him 5, he stamps and swares in Italian.  But we having been blessed by the Pope are all quite safe from such cursings. They are filthy beggars the Italians, on the main streets right on the footpaths, they have piss houses just a square bit of marble without sides, and facing the streets nobody minds.  I saw a man decently dressed leave a woman on the foot path &amp; go and use one.  Mrs Scott's cabman stopped his cab once, and used it right in front of her, [indecipherable].</p>
<p>Last night we had supper in the Volksgarten were a military band was playing.  It played Schubert, Blue Danube and some very fine Austrian things.  One was supposed to represent a battle, they let off fireworks, clashed the cymbals, and lit a blue sort of light and it was very realistic indeed.  I am afraid I must knock off now.  Don't forget to write soon, and tell us about the camp.  Have those results of the School appeared yet?</p>
