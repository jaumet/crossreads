<p>Sunday 15 July 1917.</p>
<p>Church parade this morning fell out crook and at 1 p.m. leave given to go into Ismalia (as we understood.)</p>
<p>6 of us hired a &quot;gharry&quot; and were driven through the streets of Ismailia. It was very interesting to us as everything was quite new to our <s>mi</s><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><s>nds</s> ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Coming back we were stopped by guard on the bridge entering Ismailia on the Tel-el-Kebir &ndash;&nbsp;Nafisha Rd. Marched back to Isolation Area under an armed guard with bayonets fixed. 1 guard to 2 men. Classed (<u>by officers</u>) as prisoners &amp; placed under open arrest.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Turned in early feeling crook as I was when I fell out on church parade. Leave was 2 p.m. till 5.30 pm. &quot;Gaggat&quot; &amp; the &quot;Boy&quot; were clinked in Ismailia.&nbsp;</span></p>
