of this terrible conflict. There were very few men in Civilian Clothes what there were were old Men. A large number of Women were standing in a long line with a small basket in front of them on the ground which contained Butter Eggs, people walked up down the line making their purchases Agents from large Cities come buy for their Firms repack the butter Eggs in large boxes send them away by rail. Eggs are very dear 2/6 per dozen Butter in Francs 20 Centimes for 1 Kilogramme which is a little over 2 lbs. Oranges were 5 C too dear. It was very amusing to see the way they handle the Rabbits, of course they are born in Captivity they sit in open baskets not a move out of them, they are handled by their owner replaced again they seem quite contented n their baskets. Fowls ducks have their legs tied are placed on the ground. Clothes are in some cases are laying on a canvas covering on the ground dust filth is blowing all over them, the owners don't seem to mind. They pay so much for the use of the grounds from 50 Cents
