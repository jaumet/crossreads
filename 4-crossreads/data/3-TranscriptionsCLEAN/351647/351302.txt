  
 Charley boys & Ivan MacD. but they have all gone.  They had shows of getting to Batteries & really it would have been criminal to have held them back.  I could get but the O.C. has been damned decent to me.  I like & know him so I'll hang on for a little.  Maybe we'll both get off together some day soon.  I think I'll knock off.  You must forgive me if its dull but I feel dead dopey tonight & its a pity.  I am very well & if I weren't I'd be all right as I've made friends with the medical people here.  One chap is rather decent & has the most gorgeous golden red hair & is very musical. 
 Its a beautiful country really.  I don't know how long we are here for or where we will go to next.  I hope you get my letters.  I have received all yours up to 17 (11th June & Mac's too). 
 Well I must go its too dark to see & I'm turning in.  My love to the Boss & Graham & Mac & all the people around.  I didn't know Mrs. Westmacott had left Australia.  She'd be glad.  I wonder if he would be.  Aren't they weird.  Bon soir.  Ma chere Madame. 
 Always yours as ever, Jim Wilkie
