<p>No. 11 A.G.H. Caulfield. 31.5.21<br/>My dear old Jane, Many Happy Returns of the Day. Hope you will have a very happy day and a Lucky year. It is very cold here &amp; wet tonight but hope you will have a fine day, to be able to get out &amp; enjoy the country. I went home yesterday afternoon &amp; Mother &amp; Alice were getting along quite nicely. They had a very quiet day Sunday. Alice has a sore throat but better to-day. I ran home for a little while this afternoon. Went to Melb. first for some black wool for Mother for mittens but Mrs Capp is making her a pair. She &amp; Marion called in to see them Monday night &ndash; Annie Thomas was there for tea &ndash; To-day Miss Bennett was there, so they are not very lonely. Alice will be writing &amp; telling you all their doings. She told me she had a letter from Lea this a.m. &amp; that you were all enjoying</p>
