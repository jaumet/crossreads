 about english Prisoners treatment in Germany. If the reporter of the "Advertiser" or "Herald", two leading South Australian Newspapers had wendet his way on a fine afternoon to Torrens Island, and had taken the trouble to enquire about our treatment, he would have been astonished. He would have heard true complaints anough to fill a collum for a week of tru missery and sufferings, endured by Prisoners of War in their own land, wich would hawe put all the complaints about english treatment in Germany in Background. I heard that Prisoners in Germany get new Straw every six months well, I wher interned on the Island for the period of 8 months and never had been supplyd with straw or bedding of any kind, Also with Clothing Food,soaps,ectra, it wher dealt out in unsufficiant quantity and quality to keep sickness and vermin away.
