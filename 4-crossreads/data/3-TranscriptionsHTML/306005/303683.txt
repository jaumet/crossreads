<p>5-1-17<br/>Fri 5th<br/>Rained again last night; This morning I went to Bde HQs &amp; found Mr Kater was expected at any time, rode along the beach &amp; met Mr Kater &amp; Max Wright returning. Kater said the boat is due at Port Said on the 9th. Soon after tea this evening I went to the 3rd Regt &amp; saw Mr Wint who is going in to catch the same boat &amp; we decided to go in together if possible. he has a pass from the 6th till the 12th, I then went to Bde &amp; applied for the same leave, but Capt Hudson said 4 days was the limit for other ranks &amp; made it out from the 7th till the 11th. I am rather disappointed as Wint &amp; I intended going to Suez together &amp; I shall have to go direct to Port Said now.</p>
