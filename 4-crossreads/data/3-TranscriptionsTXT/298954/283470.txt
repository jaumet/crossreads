 1917 2nd June (cont.) Finally we were passed by a doctor, our clothes we given back to us (my lot minus a long scarf which had taken the fancy of some German gent.), we were graciously permitted to dress and were then sent down a wooden ladder-way into the hold;&ndash; the Prisoner's Quarters. 
 We could not see anything for a few moments but a smoke haze and the excited crowd of grimy, half-dressed Britishers who bombarded us with questions.  Later we discovered the place to be the upper nr 4 hold &ndash; previously used as a mine chamber.  Through holes in the bulkhead we were shown over 200 mines resting on long rows on the mine-rails in nr 3 hold.  In nr 4. were herded together a queer collection of nearly a hundred prisoners.
