<p>All the evening the 'birds' have been returning home to roost &ndash; the aerodrome is about 7 miles behind us.<br/>B H.Q. have received orders to hold every available officer &amp; man ready to escort prisoners of which there are reported to be already 4000 which, if true, is excellent.  I am on picket tonight from 2.30-4.30 a.m. so shall be able to hear if the guns start again &ndash; they knocked off at about 7 p.m. this evening &ndash; which possibly means that the place is taken but I doubt it.  It will probably be an affair of a few days.  Though I should probably be very scared, I am sorry to miss seeing it for it seems to be the biggest thing that has yet happened out here &amp; the tanks would be worth seeing.</p>
