a gang of men,  another plan I fancy sometimes is of getting a job for a year with some successful farmer in the district I decide to settle in & keep my eyes open & learn the methods & at the same time look out for my land.  I don't want to rush in blindly & grab anything,  I have made up my mind to waste no time holidaying a couple of weeks in Tasmania & a week in N.S.W. will satisfy me
I am going to combine pleasure with business as much as possible & all I ask is for my discharge from the Army & let me get to work, if ever any one is sick of this loafing about it is me, I am itching to get to work once more
God only knows how fed up I am with the Army, it would break my heart to be compelled
