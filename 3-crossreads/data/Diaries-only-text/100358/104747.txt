Fritzes credit, he did not fire on them. They must have been plainly in view. Now and again during the day he shelled us. However, the trench was a narrow one, and no one was hit. During the afternoon it rained, and I noticed, where some earth had fallen from the trench wall, a fine pair of "gum boots? sticking out.
