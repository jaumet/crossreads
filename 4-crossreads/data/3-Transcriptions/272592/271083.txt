<p>We have a small Y.M.C.A. canteen in our line of dug-outs but the principal things they seem to have are candles &amp; cigarettes now &amp; again they get a supply in but it does not last long for they are soon sold out</p>
<p>We laid in bed till just on dinner time for it was raining heavily all the morning &amp; it still continues to pour down a nice time we will have of it to-night what oh</p>
<p>6th.   Fell in last night in pouring rain, &amp; just before we moved off we got an order to get in to our dugouts for a while, but about half an hour after we were called out &amp; went up to the work</p>
