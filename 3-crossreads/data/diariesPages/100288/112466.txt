aid. Marched out to an old camp about two miles out, for the purpose of bringing in some sandbags to build a dug out.
Wednesday 3/5/16
Practically the whole of the day building a dug out, - hard graft. Official word received through Intelligence Department stating that a large body of Turks, chiefly Camel Corps, are now about 40 miles to the East advancing toward where we are camping. Stretcher squads formed instructed to be prepared for duty at any time. Appointed No 4 in charge of a squad.
