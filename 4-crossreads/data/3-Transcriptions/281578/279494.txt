<p>hundreds of them in the woollen mills in the town &ndash; it was a great performance of our Australian lads to drive Fritz out of this town of Villers Bretonneux. Lately it seems always a case of the Pommies losing a position, &amp; our chaps holding Fritz, or having to win back what the Pommies lost. I had to laugh to see some more of our characters come back from the village, one chap had a tall black hat &amp; white lace parasol, &amp; on the post where our Lewis gun is hung to shoot up at any German aeroplanes that come over, is a pair of girl's white draws. Lor' isn't it funny, they take nothing, not even war, seriously, though in the trenches Fritz learns what they are made of. <br/>Tuesday 7 May Up at 4 am. early breakfast, &amp; we set off laying barbed wire. It came on to rain again at 9 am. &amp; we came back. Had to carry a box of bombs each up to the new position we are making, &amp; it was heavy work in the mud. Turned out fine afterwards, &amp; we did some more wiring in afternoon. Went to see Boo in afternoon, poor beggar was away on fatigue. I waited till he &amp; Eldrige returned, very weary, from carrying ammunition. Noticed a parcel</p>
