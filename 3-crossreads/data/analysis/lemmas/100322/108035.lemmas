 21/4/19 Easter Monday . Strassburg glass . Bought a coupl of ticket and climb the tower . A fine sunni day but strong wind made the tower seem rocki cold . Narrow stair and open side ? one could easili get giddi and fall over . From the tower a splendid view and one realis that the town has mani veri old hous . The various church and squar show up plain from this great height and then all round are open field . The Rhine run about 2 kilo away and high mountain in distanc are Vosg and Jura . A ground haze was hang but I thought I could distinguish the Black Forest . Descend to the street and went in to see the celebr Clock of Strassburg which is in a sort of side chapel . It is a wonder affair
