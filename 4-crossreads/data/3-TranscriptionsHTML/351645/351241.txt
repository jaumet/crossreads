<p>9.<br/>the Col. received a wire stating "Armistice with Turkey signed noon today". Whilst knowing they would not hold out much longer we were unaware that the Turks had sued for armistice, and the news was rather doubtfully recd. until we herd definitely that the Col. had recd. the wire. Whilst at Homs the names of the 1914 men entitled to furlough in Aust. were taken, and there being only the Col. and myself in our section and another in the mobile unit they were not difficult to find. We had heard rumours to that effect before but the Col. sent for and asked me where I wanted leave to and a few days later Utting and I recd. word to go. It was 11 p.m. when I received word to be at a dump 4m. distant at 6 a.m. next day, thence to be picked up by lorry en route for Tripoli 90M. west and over very rough country. I half expected the news as others in the regts. had received it so I had everything ready to hand over in case word came. I was at the dump in good time but the motor convoy did not turn up to 1 o'clock. We camped about half way that night and arrived at Tripoli about 10 a.m. next day and after about an hour or so of waiting went up and for the time being were attached to the 11th L.H. for rations. After about two days here we again went to the coast embarking on a 3000 ton boat on Novr. 11th, and we were waiting off the coast when rockets went up, sirens blew, and all excitement ashore, made us believe that the armistice with Germany had been signed, and shortly after the Capt. of the boat received news confirming it. The officers and officers of the boat provided whisky and health of all were drunk time and again. Next morning we left for Port Said, the coast presenting rather a fine sight, snow capping the hills of Lebanon. 9 a.m. on the 13th we anchored in the canal at Port Said, leave being refused on account of prevalence of influenza. Nevertheless some went ashore that night. Next day we went down as far as the Bitter Lakes, the boat turned and we disembarked at Kantara arriving by train at Ismalia about 2.45 p.m. there to hastily re-equip and catch a train at 8.30 that night for Suez. Blankets and all were withdrawn and we had a very cold ride in open trucks arriving at Suez about 4.30 a.m. boarding the transport "Port Darwin" and breakfasting on her before 6,30 a.m. About 6 p.m. we pulled out clear of Suez and about 11 p.m. kit bags and Red Cross comforts came aboard and at daylight we were under way in the G. of Suez en route to Aust. and said good-bye to Egypt.</p>
