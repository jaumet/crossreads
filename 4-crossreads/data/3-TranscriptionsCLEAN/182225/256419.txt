 OCTOBER   FRIDAY 27   1916 
 Raining & blowing like anything; & altogether a miserable day. Cleaning harness all day. We got some new horses in in the evening. Went to the pictures in the evening & they were as good as I have seen here. I was granted leave (4 days) in morning & orders came out at night that it was cancelled; oh Lord it would drive you mad the way the authorities fool you about here.
