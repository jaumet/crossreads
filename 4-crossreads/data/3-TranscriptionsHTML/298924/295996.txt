<p>Tuesday 14 January 1919<br/>Rafa<br/>Squadron went to Beach for a bathe, too cold for me as I have a touch of bronchitis again.<br/>Geo. Smith now a Capt. in R.E.s, France wrote congratulating me on my D.S.O. &amp; saying he was going back to H.L.A.<br/>President of another Field General Court Martial.  I get a lot of this sort of work &amp; do not like it.  Prefer now the war is over not to print anything I write now not worth it but nice for my own books of scraps &amp; to interest you in my daily life.</p>
