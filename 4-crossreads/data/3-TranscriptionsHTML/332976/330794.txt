<p>Febuary 1917.<br/>15th   During the night some light rain fell, but the day has been bright with a warm sun shining.<br/>The ice is melting fast &amp; the ground is getting very muddy &amp; sloppy again.  We heard a very severe explosion yesterday morning about 10 A.M. &amp; today we received the news that Fritz had blown up a large ammunition dump at the "Quarry" (near Montauban) destroying over &pound;1,000,000 worth of ammunition.<br/>He has been trying for some considerable time to get that particular dump &amp; has at last succeeded in dropping a bomb from one of his Taubes on to it.</p>
