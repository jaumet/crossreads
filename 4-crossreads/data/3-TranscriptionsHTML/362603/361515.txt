<p>Bulford<br/>2/9/17<br/>Dear Mum, Dad &amp; George,<br/>I have not much news but I must write to let you know that we are both well.  I rode to Salisbury again yesterday.  It was a Knock-out going in, as there was a dead-on headwind.  When I arrived there, My Mate who had gone in by train was just going to the Matinee of Peg O' My Heart.  I thought I'd go too, so he &amp; His Lady Friend &amp; I had a very nice Time.  I afterwards went down to my Friends in the "Close" &amp; one of the Girls &amp; I went again at night to give my Friend a Treat.  It was pretty late when we got out &amp; we were just in Time to get in, as the Close Gate is shut at 11 p.m.  I had supper &amp; left about 11.10 pm.  It was a perfect &amp; glorious moonlight night.  I took off My leggings &amp; made Myself Comfy.  I waited for another Cyclist, there is always a crowd riding Home, &amp; picked up a N.Z. Sergeant.  He is a good rider &amp; we made good Time.  At the Top of the Amesbury Hill we had Tea &amp; Sandwiches at the Y.M.C.A. at 12 p.m. &amp; had a nice spin Home after that.  I received a nice letter, &amp; 2 Khaki &amp; a Khaki Silk Hand-kerchief to-day from Marie as a little Token of Remembrance &amp; a Birthday Gift.  It was very nice &amp; preferable to any expensive Gift.  Times are so hard now.  I do not know How the deuce People live over here.  Food &amp; all things have increased in Price as much as 200 &percnt; on some articles.  Yet, Tommy only gets 1/- per day.  I think it is a curse that Tommy gets so little money &amp; He</p>
