25.4.16 Tuesday Anzac To dayThis was celebrated right throughout the Army & was observed as a Holiday, although our Unit had to work just a hard as ever. However they gave our Train a Concert & free spread at night & it was enjoyed by the boys.I was unable to go but heard glowing accounts of it from Cousins. Loaded plates of dainties very rarely reached the Tables before they were empty.There was a little rioting in Cairo where several Native Houses were burnt down.  It is a good thing that there were not many of Aust Troops here, otherwise there would have been the devil to pay.The Artillery is practicing Shrapnel Firing on a range of Hills at the back of our Camp & it is, at the present time one deafening roar.Weather still very hot & unbearable in the middle of the day.
26.4.16 WednesdayThis has turned out to be the hottest day ever it has been my lot to experience.  It is impossible to go outside for long & the heat inside
