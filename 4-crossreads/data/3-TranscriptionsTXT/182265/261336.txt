 Thursday - Left Codford for Lyndhurst to attend Bombing School there (Southern Command Bombing School) for one day (Friday) to pick up anything new. Trained through to Southampton where Jackson &amp; I spent a few hours wandering the streets. We were not allowed into the Docks &amp; had too little time to seek a pass for admittance. Trammed out to suburb of Shirley. Southampton seems a very tidy city for a port. The trams are large double deckers. I bought a few little ornaments for souvenirs. 
 We reached Lyndhurst Road Station at 5pm &amp; took large motor bus 3 miles to Lyndhurst, passing through some of the New Forest. Reported at the School at 5.30, were received well &amp; asked to afternoon tea by the C.O. Major -.&nbsp;&nbsp;After this we walked to the town &amp; took rooms at the &quot;Stag&quot;, Jackson &amp; I sharing a large old fashioned bedroom (No.4) containing 3 large double beds. Jackson &amp; I then went for a walk but rain turned us back. I hired a bike for 2 hours and rode through the New Forest, visiting Rufus Stone&nbsp;and Sir Walter Tyrell Hotel nearby.
