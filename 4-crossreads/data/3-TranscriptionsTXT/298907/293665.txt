these little things don't seem much in the ordinary state of affairs but they go a long way towards forming a favorable opinion of the people.
Was very 12th Was very restless last night could not sleep at all, but I do not mind this for the night nurse & I are great pals & she comes & sits on my bed & yarns for an hour at a stretch when the ward is all asleep & quiet, she is jolly nice Miss Smith is her name, I can see I am beginning to get on better with girls now, I could never understand them before, they sort of had me bluffed this little nurse brings me in a cup of hot tea each night, so you can see I am not doing too bad in this country but theres no doubt they treat the "Aussies" well & they are very popular with all, the old felt hat seems to be irrestible as ever.
