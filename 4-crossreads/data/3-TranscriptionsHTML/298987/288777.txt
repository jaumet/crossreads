<p>Saturday 29th June<br/>Was put on as Hut Orderly. Have missed the Signaling School as the others went to it whilst I was in Hospital. It would have been interesting Walked to Sutton Veny &amp; found a lot of my old mates out of the 11th Reinforcement still there. Drew &pound; 2 from Savings Bank Got my Photos they were rotten</p>
<p>Sunday 30<br/>Went to Sutton V again</p>
<p>Monday 1st July<br/>Still on as Hut Guard</p>
<p>Tuesday 2nd<br/>Being Hut Orderly or Guard I do not go on Parade. Sweep &amp; clean the Hut up &amp; see that every thing is put away correctly &ndash; Nearly every camp has a slightly different idea as to how blankets should be folded &amp; other things arranged There is usually a 'Blueprint' illustrating the correct method on the notice Board One makes it look all right on the outside &amp; shows all odds &amp; ends under</p>
