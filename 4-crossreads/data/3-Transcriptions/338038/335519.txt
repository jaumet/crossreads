Headquarters, and if I ever meet Pat over here I shall of course, take him there personally.<br/>You will notice that two of the men from Terry's battery have been buried with him, I am afraid that was unavoidable in those trying days as everything was so frightfully disorganised.  The other names are 1997 Sgt M [Michael] McFerran and 3604 Bombardier G [Gordon Henry] Iles, both of the 37th Battery, 10th Field Artillery Brigade.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope Pat is successful in obtaining his discharge as I certainly think that you family has done it's bit in the war.  My very best love and wishes go to you all in this letter dear Cousin Willie<br/>Ever yours very sincerely<br/>Max R. Shelley</p>
