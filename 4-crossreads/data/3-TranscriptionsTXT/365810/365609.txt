 In the Field 4 Octr. 1917 
 Mr Dear Mrs. Lucas, 
 Thank you very much for your kind letter of 19th July and all the good wishes you sent. 
 I am very pleased to hear that Caesar has now got his Majority;  he has well earned it and no one can be more pleased than I.  I hope his next step is not far off. 
 Thanks for the newspaper cuttings of the last night on Quinns, none who were there on that night are likely to forget it.  Yet we had quite an interesting time.  I have in my memory the little supper we had at midnight;  we all contributed something.  It was a weird meal. 
 I can quite understand the people in England taking up the Major.  He is such a fine chap and no one could fail to like him. 
 Yes I still hear from Mrs. Pope &ndash; I am a great admirer of hers &ndash; she has done so much for the boys &ndash; I shall for ever be very grateful to her. 
 Surely I remember Biers &ndash; fine soldier too &ndash; I would like to see him again. 
 Tell the Major when you write that I will always be very glad to hear from him, I hope you will get none but the best of news from him. 
 Just now we are right in the thick of the offensive so you will understand the hurried appearance of this letter &ndash; yet if I put aside the reply to a more opportune time I may have to wait long for it. 
 With very kind regards Believe me, sincerely yours, H.A. Goddard.
