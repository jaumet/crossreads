<p>No use May sending me Photo here better keep it &ndash; I have no good one of Dolly at present, later I'll send <strike>one, meantime you might spare a snap shot of Dolly for her &ndash; I see May</strike> talks of the Family growing Custard APPLES!!! in Q'land. I have no faith in these things in competition with Chinamen.</p>
<p>On a Court Martial tomorrow still waiting for Railway clearance. Beautiful weather but cold at night.</p>
