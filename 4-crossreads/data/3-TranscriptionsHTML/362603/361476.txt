<p>Bulford<br/>24.6.17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>I've managed to write a short letter to Mum &amp; George &amp; I'll now try &amp; scratch out something for You.  I've just had Tea of Bread Butter &amp; Jam &amp; Tea.  The Bread we get now is War bread &amp; it is tough I can tell you.  I never suffered with indigestion before &amp; I do now.  I know of other boys complaining the same way.  The cakes that I love so well are not to be had for love or money.  I have tried many shops but all are the same.  Any cake at all that one buys is dry &amp; crumbles like a sand-ball &amp; all are unsweetened.  The Civilians can hardly get any sugar at all.  Most of them have cut out the use of sugar except for cooking &amp; for Visitors.  My Friends always dig up some loaf sugar for me.  I can assure You that loaf sugar is as scarce as sovereigns.  Marie told me that She was going to write to You a long time ago.  By the letters You might think Her a little haughty &amp; proud &amp; also a bit of a dreamer.  But She is not a scrap like what Her letters would lead You to believe.  She is the nicest little party You could ever wish to meet.  I'm saving up my leave now for two or three months &amp; then I hope to get 6 days &amp; By the first train I'm off to the little "Isle of Man agin."  It is good to</p>
