<p>24/3/18 &ndash; La Basse Ville<br/>officer and returned to Bn. H.Q.  Remained indoors all the afternoon writing and reading.  Left at 8 p.m. for my tour of the line.  A beautiful mild moonlight night with much hum of aircraft overhead.  From his trenches the enemy was releasing peculiar little lights that ran up in strings ([see image for drawing] so) irregularly spaced.  Perhaps for guidance to his aircraft.  Our planes were over and bombed his positions just across the Lys.  Went first to Mackinnon and then to Braithwaite with whom we (self and Keith Sutherland) went out to the post.  Found No. 9 and walked straight out there</p>
