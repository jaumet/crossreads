<p>on stable picket all day.</p>
<p>Wednesday 27th [Jan]<br/>Good cool day, sea very calm.  Came out of the Red Sea in the evening.  Got fairly cold before night.  They tried the machine guns on the rocks ashore, but the distance must have been too far, couldn't see where the bullets hit.</p>
<p>Thursday 28th<br/>Arrived at Suez daylight.  All the rest of the transports also arrived.  Suez is a fine place &amp; cigarettes oranges etc can be got very cheap.  I was uncomfortably full all day.  No one was allowed ashore.  Heard of some fighting along the canal.  We were allotted places in case of attack.  B Squadron got the honour of the deck.  Was on special fatigue all day but had next to nothing to do except gaze over the ships side.</p>
