  
 Tuesday 31 August, 1915 
 A most strenuous day. Carried water in the morning, sent to base for packs at 2.15 p.m. arrived back 7.15 on guard from 8 to 10 & 2 to 4. I had to stand to arms at 4 a.m. 
 Heavy firing broke out against our trenches at 8.30 & lasted till 9 p.m. This was evidently a blind to hide operations in the centre where a furious fire was heard. We have not heard what happened but presume it was an attack by the Turks. The demonstration against our trenches took the form of a heavy shower of bombs. Both sides used flares as it was a very dark night. We spent a very tense half hour, expecting to have to bring the gun into action at any minute but things died down without the enemy taking the offensive. 
 Met Nev Hodgens, have to see him tomorrow afternoon. 
 A lot of our chaps are crook none serious but those who are well have a lot of extra work to do.
