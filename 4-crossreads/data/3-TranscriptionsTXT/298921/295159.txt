 July, 1915  Wednesday 7  Brigadier  back from the Dardanelles, Pleurisy &amp; thinner, it is no soft job. We send 120 men &amp; 10 N.C.O's today to fill the gaps but I stay behind. Will probably post this with a few snapshots and silver Piastres. Had 2 letters from Aunt Louie one from Joe, hope his eye no worse; plenty men here with only one eye now. Glad to think May is at home. Mothers letters were dated May 16th &amp; May 30th my love to you all. Personal not to be printed
