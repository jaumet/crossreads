search for us. Silly cows they would never have found us in a month.
We put the exhausted men to bed and after a good ?brek? slept the sleep of the weary. The horses especially mine, came home fit and I rode old Zig-Zag again today. He is a great horse. 100 miles between hot dawns is good going in desert country full of stony ridges and heavy sand. 
It was all very interesting and some day Ill tell you more about it. It will always be enshrined in my memory as a most interesting journey: a glimpse of the desert's heart and strange people who from its scanty breast derive food for their flock, herds and themselves. 
This letter is not for publication for certain reasons, but you can show it to your pals. Im feeling very fit and looking forward as usual to a return home. "East, west ? home's best". With love to you all and especially your dear self,
 
I kiss your hands
Jack
