<p>for Bathers watch, take it by all means.  I dont think I will be likely too need you to send me any more money as I have a credit of over &pound;20 in my book.  We have been having beautiful weather here lately, warm sunny days.  I think the the winter is quite over now, I hope it is anyway as the cold is no bon.  I am glad you had a good time at Austinmere.  We hope by next Christmas you</p>
