<p>there are three, are each almost one third of a mile in span, and the piers rise to a height of 361 feet above high water mark. The bridge took seven years to construct and was opened by the present king in the year 1890, Its cost was three and a half millions sterling.</p>
<p>After I returned from viewing the Fourth Bridge I visited Calton hill and saw the big Prison, Royal high school buildings, Nelsons Monument, The Burns Monument, and the National monument.</p>
<p>The Nelson Monument is in the form of a tower, which stands on the summit of Calton Hill. From the top a beautiful view of the country can be obtained. It has also time ball arranged on the top which falls at 1pm every day, and by which all clocks throughout the city are regulated.</p>
<p>The Natiolonal monument is the foundation stone of what was designed to be a "National monument" on memory of Scotsmen who fell in the battles, by sea and land, in the war with France, It was laid by George the fourth in the year 1822</p>
