bags of potatoes which have been smelling terribly, they done alright out of it judging by the number of mandarins they produced after coming up.
23rd. Passed this morning a group of rough rugged rocky islands called the 12 Apostles, surf was breaking in great white clouds around their bases the waves lashed to fury by a gale of 60 miles an hour easily you can scarce stand on deck spray is being dashed all over the deck showers baths are to be had for nothing this don't trouble us for it is a blessing in disguise as it helps to cool us, I am getting sunburnt badly my legs are like fire, this is quite a change
Passed another large island on the starboard this afternoon the Island of Perim I think it is, Lloyds bought it so they say erected a lighthouse to prevent so many wrecks
