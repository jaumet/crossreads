" Bluey " McMaster fell out of the train and had time to run after it and catch up . Arrive at the railhead , about 3 P.M. Detrain and march to where the Battalion is in reserv to the " Bailli " sector . Am billet in a desert farm hous , not far from the fire line , as I can see all the flare that illumin " No Man Land " at night . The German are use a curious rocket far behind their line . They look like string of flare and they rise to a great height . The front seem quiet and is noth like what I expect to see . A dispatch rider has arriv with order for us to go and reinforc the 11th Battalion .
