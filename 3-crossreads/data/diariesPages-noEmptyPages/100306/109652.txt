Needle Tr B Camp
10/1/17 Some very heavy guns at work during the night. Loud deep bursts to which our guns responded. Sat on a Court Martial with Pedler and Cull during the morning and tried a case of absence without leave rewarding 2 years H.L. Sunny and cold early and the dull patter of two aeroplanes fighting with machine guns overhead. Later cold and wintry with an icy wind. Huts are growing up fast alround with big parties at work on them. In the afternoon stayed inside all the time only going out to try an Orderly Room case and to look at a Taube which was flying very low and at which our A.A.'s were plastering shells thick. At 5.30 went down to 5th. Bde H.Q. to dine with Colonel Smith and found him housed in a dugout palace in a quarry 60 feet of earth on top of the rooms to which you descend by staircases. A wonderful place which houses many men. The boys have it that this was the home of the Crown Prince. The heavy artillery is very active tonight and keeps up an incessant bombardment. Fritz retaliates with big stuff screaming over. Chose a good old original 6 for English leave
