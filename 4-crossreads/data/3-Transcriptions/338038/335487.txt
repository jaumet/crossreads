<p>In the Field<br/>10/5/18</p>
<p>W. Garling Esq</p>
<p>Sir<br/>I have been Chaplain with the 10th A.F.A. Bde for the past two years but for the last three months I have been in England.  On my return here I am taking the liberty of sending you a word of sympathy on the loss of your son who was my friend.  During the last year we had seen a great deal of one another and like everyone else I had learnt to appreciate his splendid character.  I do not suppose there was a more justly popular officer in this Divisional Artillery &amp; it is heart breaking to think that his upright manly character is lost to the world.<br/>May you be sustained in your great sorrow.  His life may have been short but during it he has enriched many other lives.  Personally I shall carry a very grateful memory of him all my days.</p>
<p>Yours v. Sincerely</p>
<p>A.H. Stevenson, Chaplain<br/>(attached) 10th A.F.A. Bde.</p>
