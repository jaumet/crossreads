<p>Hospital system Egypt Malta &amp; England. The men are being fed well to buck them up, getting eggs rice etc also a large bottle of Stout between two men one day &amp; beer the next. Something like reasonable treatment as it prevents men buying illicit grog etc. We had commenced packing to move to Anzac when we received orders to cease &amp; prepare for 500 patients which we duly received last night. For how long our move will be delayed I do not know.</p>
<p>Monday 20 &amp; Tuesday 21st Sept. Had a swim Monday afternoon &amp; found the water cooler than usual winter beginning to creep on. Today we borrowed a boat from Pier master at 4 P.M. &amp; had a sail around the harbour, little things like this help to keep one fit.</p>
<p>Tuesday 28th Sept. and October 2nd. Last 12 days just even going. Having received some printing paper from Egypt managed to get time to print some photoes for which purpose I borrowed films from other fellows &amp; some of the officers &amp; picked out the best. I managed to do over 100 &amp; all being picked formed a very fair collection The weather taking a warm turn I managed to get a couple of swims</p>
