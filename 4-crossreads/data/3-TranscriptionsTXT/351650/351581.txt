 Dear Mrs. John, 
 Thankyou for the picture of Graham aetat 2&frac12; yrs.  No mistake, Little John, as I call him, is growing into a real good sort, he should turn out a topper. 
 Do you know I think the pleasure of watching youngsters grow up helps to keep the older ones young. 
 We have just come away from the big battle, and have trekked about 65 miles to here where we sleep in beds for the next week and then back to the battle. 
 There are so many troops operating in small areas in this war that those who are resting have to be put right out of the way. 
 The Cavalry to whom we belong have not had a decent show at all, &amp; must hate the war. 
 But we get more of it than anyone wants, as an extra six gun battery is always acceptable anytime &amp; anywhere:  we do a lot of supporting weak divisions and so on:  and other special jobs.
