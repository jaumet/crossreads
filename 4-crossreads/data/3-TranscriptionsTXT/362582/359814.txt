I think he is wise, no chance of promotion in the other Regiment and from what I see of things, every man should try for a commission if he has a chance. He is well & very pleased to have his star. What a dreadful tragedy Kitcheners death is? Awful for a great soldier. He will be sadly missed. The Empire was fortunate in having such a leader &  head at this crisis in History. Two of us are going to Church to-night so cannot write much more. Begins at 6.30 p.m. & it is nearly that now. Hope you are all well &  happy. Wish Eddy was a stronger boy. So delighted to hear that Bessie has a little girl - hope she will be a healthy baby & Bess get on well. I shall write to her in a day or so. Love to all my friends. Fondest love & kisses to you all. From, Your loving sister, Edith
