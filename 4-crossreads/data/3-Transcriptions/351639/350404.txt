<p>again the exhaustion of the troops the necessity of reserting  the units the scarcity of water and the collection of the great numbers of wounded made it necessary to break off the action until nightfall stop   only those who have been over the ground can have any conception of the difficulties of these short advances  they are a stiff climb in normal times without an enemy in front and without the climbers being encumbered with kits rifles food and ammunition stop   throughout the afternoon of August 8th the forces were reorganised into three columns [censor's deletion] New Zealanders on right [censor's deletion] Indians in centre and [censor's deletion] 38th Brigade on left for a final assault on Chunuk Bair which was timed to begin at dawn on August 9th stop  large reserves from the 13th Division were thrown into the firing line to assist the New Zealanders and Indian Infantry Brigades and the men were as far as possible rested throughout the day and early part of the 9th stop  the advance on the morning of the 9th was preceded by a heavy bombardment of Chunuk Bair and Hill Q by naval and land guns stop  the advance of No 3 Column was delayed by the broken nature of the ground and the enemy's resistance</p>
