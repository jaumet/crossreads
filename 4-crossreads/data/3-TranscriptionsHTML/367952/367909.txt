<p>Transcribers note: Kings Crest on top of Page.</p>
<p>He whom this scroll commemorates<br/>was numbered among those who,<br/>at the call of King and country, left all<br/>that was dear to them, endured hardness,<br/>faced danger, and finally passed out of<br/>the sight of men by the path of duty<br/>and self-sacrifice, giving up their own<br/>lives that others might live in freedom.<br/>Let those who come after see to it<br/>that his name be note forgotten.</p>
<p>Pte. Thomas Bell<br/>20Bn.  A.I.F.</p>
