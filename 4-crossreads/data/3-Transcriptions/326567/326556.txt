<p>I was told that one of our Drivers &amp; his Fireman &amp; the Guard had been injured up the line. As it was Moonlight, Fritz had been giving us a bit of trouble when the nights were clear, as he had been dropping Bombs all along the line. These 3 chaps were working for the 268 Coy of Royal Engineers up at Arrival Farm about 5 miles from here. There work was Laying &amp; Ballasting the line as our Boys advanced.  At about 10 Pm these 3 Chaps were sleeping in a Dug Out at there Depot &amp; as the end of the Dug Out was weak a Bomb dropped by Fritz exploded &amp; blew the end in &amp; seriously injured all the three &amp; they had been taken to the Hospital. We received several rumors that they had been knocked about very much but as events turned out they had only been slightly hurt &amp; up to date are somewhere in France in a Hospital if not in Blighty. I had a easy time all night until about 7 am</p>
