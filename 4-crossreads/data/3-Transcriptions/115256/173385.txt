<p>Thursday 6 May 1915</p>
<p>Operations still being performed to-day at breakneck speed. Some of the more complicated wounds will have to be left until we get to a permanent hospital as the appliances for carrying out certain parts of the more delicate work are not available. Meanwhile every precaution is taken against the wounds becoming septic.</p>
<p>To-day I succeeded in hobbling round the decks for a little while.  The staff of hospital orderlies being quite inadequate for the amount of work that is to be done, have not the time to serve up full course meals all round so unless you can walk you have to be content with beef tea, bread and butter and tea.  But to-day I managed to go [indecipherable] which is at present serving as a dining room for the "One Arm only" Brigade.  And a good cup of soup, cooked meat and "spuds" and plum duff to finish up with was a very welcome change to the fare of the trenches.  We now have very nearby our full complement of wounded, about 1 hundred in all.  We expect to receive definite sailing orders tomorrow.  So we will bid farewell to Gallipoli for a time.</p>
