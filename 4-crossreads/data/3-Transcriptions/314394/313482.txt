<p>War Diary continued.<br/>Boat leaves between 1 and 2 o'clock, packed with Officers and men going on leave. When the boat got well clear of the wharf, to my astonishment and annoyance I began to feel ill, and spent the remainder of the time in the lavatory. I got a Canadian Staff Captain to book me a seat in a Pullman car in the train travelling to Victoria Station. We arrived at Victoria station at about 9 o'clock.<br/>I then obtained a ticket for Norwood Junction and left by the first train, after telephoning up 72 and asking for a carriage, but not letting them know who it was for.<br/> As I am not likely to forget the leave I am skipping this part.<br/>Arrived at Folkstone on the 27th and boarded a very crowded boat, which was not expected to sail as the weather was so rough and wet. It did however much to our annoyance, and we had a beastly trip, getting drenched through to the skin, and being ill. We passed the remains of a sunken boat, which we heard was destroyed by a German channel raid by seven destroyers, two of which were sunk. The Queen the boat on which I went over was sunk by the Huns, and also a destroyer. Arrived at BOULOGNE  and had to wait till 9.15 for a train, going to ABEVILLE.  I was mis- directed by the R.T.O. and had to return and go to HAZEBROUCK. At HAZEBROUCK I telephoned and asked for horses to be sent to meet me at POPERINGHE and arrived at DICKESUSCH at about 7 p.m. I then set about making arrangements for the registration of the heavy mortar to take place on the 4th.<br/>Report of Operations herewith;-<br/>X4A Bty.  Owing chiefly to L.E. mechanisms getting out of order and one of the beds giving out it was found that the 100 rounds could only be fired from one gun. This was No 1 gun on the Craters, which fired for 75 minutes.<br/>Ammunition expended as follows:-<br/> No 1 -100 rounds on the Craters<br/>No 2 -25 rounds on the Craters<br/>No 3 -35 rounds on F.L.T. in P3D<br/>No 4 -45 rounds on F.L.T. in O4A<br/>No 5 -25 rounds on F.L.T. in O4A<br/>Enemy Trench Mortar retaliation was brisk all along the sector covered by X Bty. Artillery surprisingly quiet. Stokes and M.G. co-operation good throughout. Enemy Mortar, thought to fire shells about 12 to 15lbs. from smooth bore, range at least 800 to 1000 yds. came into operation towards end dropping 40 or 50 shells along OLD KENT ROAD. They appeared to have delay fuze but did little damage. In addition to torpedoes and rum-jars, the enemy used the original rum-jar.</p>
