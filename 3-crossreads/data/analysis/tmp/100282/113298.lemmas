 Imperial Govern in practic everyth but as regard punish the Australian author refus to allow the death penalti to be inflict on Australian without first get the consent of our Govern so this is one reason whi A.W.L. is near alway brought in , sometim I think a littl shoot would do no harm , as it would put a stop to the larg number of desert which are now take place , in 9 case out of 10 the guilti one belong to the latest reinforc . I do n't know what it would be like if Conscript were pass it almost a certainti they would also bring the death penalti in , we would certain want it , for there are a lot of rotter come along now a few year in gaol is neither here nor there to them . The sentenc today rang from 8 month hard labour , to in Adam case "be reduc to the rank ( Sgt ) in addit 10 year penal servitud , sound stiff do n't it , but he was found guilti of "desert " be an NCO they made an exampl of him , I guess these sort of sentenc will put the damper on a lot of them
