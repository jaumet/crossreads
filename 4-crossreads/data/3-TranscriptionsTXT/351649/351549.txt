 Dear Mrs. John 
 To hell with the Pope &ndash; as they say in the classics. 
 Which reminds me, Egad (Egad is popular form of English oath with its fangs drawn) that I hope you're not R.C.:  I can't really remember what denomination you are, but hope I haven't made a faux pas (N.B. French).  In fact I don't ever remember consulting Church in your company, except of course when little Tom was small. 
 Do you remember how painful that show at B'bogie [Burrabogie] was and how well we did the heavy grandparents. 
 Well now my good lady, there's nothing for me to report
