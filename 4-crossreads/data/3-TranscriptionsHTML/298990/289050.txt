<p>Longpre, L'Etoile 25/10/16  Our route was via Etaples &ndash;Abbeville and all night we were travelling.  It was raining most of the time and intensely cold and uncomfortable.  When it became light we could see that we were running along the Somme and its marshy surroundings.  There was far more water in the river and marshes and lying around than when we were last here.  We disentrained and Longpre and only had a short march to L'Etoile through somewhat marshy lands.  The village is a small one and its church its built on a projecting wooded bluff.  The first billet allotted me was in a most comfortable house but we vacated it for a deserted chateau which promises to be equally uncomfortable.  Some drunks missed the train last night and much to my disgust today "Tracker"Hunt failed to disentrain with us but turned up later on another train.  The absence of meat (see 24/10/16) in pleasant dietary and the way they thrive on vegetables bread should be a good argument for vegetarians.  Cold and bleak and the damned batmen cannot get fires to burn!  Indeed there seems to be no coal or other fuel available in the village.  Went round after lunch and climbed a bluff on top of which an old church is situated.  From the graveyard there is a splendid view for miles round.  The Somme flows between low banks and masses of poplars and elms cover the river flats.  Their leaves are autumn yellows &amp; reds.  Neat farms and open cultivation gives the scene a landscape &ndash; target appearance.  The landscape has a chalky subsoil and is not as fertile or as densely populated.  Our billet is an old chateau owned by Comtess de Lila Paola who the concierge says is an actress now very</p>
