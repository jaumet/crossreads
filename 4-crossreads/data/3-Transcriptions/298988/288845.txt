<p>about it, before I return.  It is being a hard job to hold these Australian Soldiers back as they are all just longing to get busy on those Germanised Turks &amp; I guess it will be good bye Turkey when they do. The general opinion here appears to be, that it was a mistake for the Navy to take this job on at first, without Military aid, however they all feel confident that it will be successfully accomplished this time, although it is very probable that the job will be harder now, than it was three months ago. Even as I write our Military Commandant is explaining to the Indian Soubrador (he is the Indian Officer in charge &amp; ranks as an Indian Captain), how, when we take the Peninsula our store Ship will proceed into a Bay where they will be able to pick up fresh supplies. All the Military Officers &amp; men on all the Ships are now busy packing their guns &amp; having gun carriages etc got ready for a quick landing on Gallipoli. One does not realise the extent of these operations until you get around among the various Ships &amp; see what is going on, especially on the Headquarters Ships, (Military, "Minnewaska" and Navy "Arcadian") acting under advice from the Rear Admiral on the Queen Elizabeth. There is bustle the whole time, night &amp; day &amp; it is no infrequent occurrence for a Launch or Tug boat to come alongside a Ship at 2 or 3 a.m. &amp; wake the Captain or the Military Commandant &amp; give them some new instructions.<br/>All day yesterday a big 3 funnel Destroyer</p>
