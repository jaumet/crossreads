<p>Dear Ida<br/>Just a note to let you know how things are going along. Havent received any more letters today but I daresay will get one or two early next week as the Australian mail should soon be along again. I hope to hear by your next letter that you have received some of those that were written in Egypt. By the way things are going I do not think we will remain in England very long we are now doing the 10th week training which only leave us 4 to do and then we may be shifted to France, if we are required there. By the accounts of the papers we seem to be doing splendid work everywhere and some seem to think that it will not be long before we have a big victory along the western front. The British now have a number of new aeroplanes which are supposed to be greatly superior to anything that has yet been produced and so far they have done great work against the German fortifications with them. There is a big aerodrome only a few hundred</p>
