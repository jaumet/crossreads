<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>Feb 2nd    Very busy all day at Hospital, quite tired, still very calm &ndash; quite a variety of sickness already.<br/>Arrived Sydney Harbour 3 pm.  Great reception by boats &ndash; cock a doodling, thousands of people hovering around in boats. Annie-Maud &amp; Mrs Briggs came alongside in a launch, handed up great variety of eatables &ndash; much appreciated by L.H.F.A..<br/>Dr O'Reilly called ashore, to be replaced by a returned Major Argyle. Six deserters discovered on board. Strict censorship prevails &ndash; have sent several letters overboard, requesting to post. Naval Patrol Boat hovering around all night on guard, arresting any person or boat that comes near, coaling at night. Sydney looks very tempting at night especially White City.</p>
