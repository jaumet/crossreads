<p>Dorothy &amp; I had a lovely time to-day &ndash; spent the afternoon at the <u>Zoo</u> &ndash; It is a beautiful place &amp; it is so nice &amp; fresh out there &ndash; we got dressed as soon as we were off duty &amp; had some nourishment in our room, so that we had a much longer time out there &ndash; had a huge afternoon tea there &amp; enjoyed ourselves very much &ndash; Got back to hospital in time for 7 p.m. Dinner &ndash; Dorothy is sound asleep in bed but I'm writing this first because I can sleep in to-morrow. Have not yet decided what to do yet to-morrow.  Am resting in the morning.  Shall keep this open &amp; write more if the mail does not close in the morning.</p>
<p>16.12.15.<br/>No news of the mail closing but shall finish this to-night.  Yesterday I had a lovely day.</p>
