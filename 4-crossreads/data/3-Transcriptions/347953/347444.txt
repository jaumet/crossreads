<p>Fleas &amp; Insects</p>
<p>Insects of various species commonly &amp; better known as lice, were our worst constant companions &amp; they used to stick to us with more tenacity &amp; friendship than the greatest of all our friends.  Though constantly served with clean underwear they did not take long to accumulate for water was scarce, &amp; we scarcely had even a sponge for weeks on end. the clothes were soon dirty again, the lice found their resting place, &amp; we  consequently  suffered the tortures of an everlasting tickling sensation which could only be overcome with a violent frontal attack with our nails as a substitute for the bayonet.</p>
