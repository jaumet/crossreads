has reached almost a climax of filthiness and obscenity floats on the still night and everywhere. Indeed they have enough to swear about considering all things! At about 9.40 in heavy rain we set out to march to Le Sars. The hedges and some of trees near the village are all bursting into green leaf as spring approaches and they look very well. Bapaume was very quiet as we came through. After getting through the town we were diverted into a railway siding and after some delay each Battn in turn entrained in little trucks and went to Butte de Warlencourt. Marched through Le Sars to a tent camp about  mile out and settled down there. Everything most uncomfortable and muddy. Had Colonel Watson as a travelling companion for part of the way down. Rain cleared off about noon and day muggy. No valises arrived early and my clothes were wet through about the knees. busy today making up recommendations for honours.
