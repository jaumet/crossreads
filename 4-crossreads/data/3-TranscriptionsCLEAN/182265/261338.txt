Entry Friday 7th July. 
Entertained Col. P. McGlynn at Guest Night yesterday evening, heard of General Holmes' death in France. This evening Mrs Padden's Bristol Concert Party gave a good Concert in Y.M.C.A Hall. Our Corporals also gave an Evening to which all officers were invited. I was sorry I was unable to attend but being Mess Secretary I had to arrange entertainment of Concert party at supper.
Wrote to Norman this evening. 
Reg arrived here on Tuesday afternoon & spent the night with me. We went to the Debate, of which I am President, in the Y.M.C.A. hut. The debate was "A policy for Repatriation of Soldiers." It was of a fairly high standard, McQueen (13th Bn) from No4 Command Depot making the best speech. I gave Reg 5 for his holiday which he intends to spend in Durham & Scotland. He left by train about midday for London.
Entry Monday - It rained heavily on Saturday & Sunday. Sunday afternoon between 4.30 & 9pm Lt Anderson (14th) & myself went cycling. We passed through Deptford, Steeple
