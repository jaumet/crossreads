<p>We went up to Steenwerck R.E. Dump &amp; loaded up with R.E. stores. Bud had a cracked cylinder &amp; I had to tow his lorry with my load on &amp; his also. I towed him to our destination OX Kent amunition dump &amp; then towed him back to Park. I went into Bailleul &amp; spent the evening with Jack &amp; Dick. 12<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;Bgd. in their lorries -</p>

<p>Jan 9<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine but cold in the morning &amp; snowing all afternoon - in the evening it got much warmer - we did&#39;nt go out to-day - I had letters from home</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jan 10<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;It started to thaw very much to-day, no lorries out on account of the thaw. it is quite cold on hands &amp; feet - we can get no &quot;metho&quot; now, but manage to keep the lorry fairly warm with the primus -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jan 11<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Weather still soft - nothing to do - I read &quot;the Harvester&quot; J.S. Porter. I had a bit of an argument with Joe. which he took to heart &nbsp;he went into Bailleul in the evening &amp; he came home boozed at night&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jan 12<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Still thawing. very wet underfoot &amp; there is practically no ice or snow left. I wrote&nbsp;away for Pelman course of memory training - Received a parcel from Marion as she is on leave in Blighty -</p>
