  
 "Our usual course (I said) is either up the bed of the creek, or else, through the more-or-less open bush on the left bank.  Now the last few nights have been very moon-light, & in all probability, the Turks have noted the course & - if they intended attacking, they would first secure us, to prevent our giving the alarm. 
 I propose, that we cut through the scrub on our right, and take up a high position overlooking a track, which in all probability they would take coming down."  My suggestion was taken, & we crept along the bank till we struck what appeared to be a track, I gave up my rifle to the sergeant, while I crept up this, to see if it offered a chance of progress, the scrub was so thick that a rifle would be too slow to get into position - This seemed to have been a track once, but was apparently abandoned to foxes.  I thought we could get along it though, & came back to report.  Up we crept, 4 of us - the sergeant & I in front, the other 2 behind  Sometimes there was only room for one to push through on our hands & knees - at others just force our way through holly & fuzzy bushes.  We had not gone far, before it got very dark.
