Previous to the Captain opening the conning tower hatch he warned us that we would feel a pressure on our ears, but not to take any notice of it.  Immediately the conning tower lid was opened, a thick white mist rose off everything, owing to the bad air, for we had then been submerged 18 hours.

We were not allowed to smoke on the bridge as the smallest light would give us away to the enemy, so we had to smoke inside the boat at the bottom of the conning tower.  It was not too bad as the Diesel engines were drawing fresh air down and aft to where they were situated in the boat, but slightly forward of the conning tower the air was so bad that a match would not burn for a fraction of a second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a3901017\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 17]<br><br />\n[AE 11 story continues]<br><br />\nexpel the water in them against the pressure on the outside (at 100 feet there is a pressure of 45 lbs. to the square inch).
