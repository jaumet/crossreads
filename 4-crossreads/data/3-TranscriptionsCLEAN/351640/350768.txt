  
 P. S.  Today letters came from Mrs Fraser and Dr Harris, the former writing from the Isle of White [Wight], the latter from France. 
 All my officers and men are working well.  By the time the Colonel comes here everything will be in good, working order. 
 Harris sent a "Greetings" card, & a postcard with five French mounted soldiers carrying each a standard, perhaps you received similar ones. 
 The weather here is ideal.  When the rush ends I may have time to look round.  Several operations during the last 18 hours. 
 I note that Aden was captured by the British in 1839.  Were it not for the presence of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb close by it were a useless sort of a place for anyone to bother about.  It is well at the present moment that it does belong to our empire, because it serves as an outpost where coal can be stored, & where the ships of war can rendezvous. 
 "Many joys may be given to men which cannot be bought for gold, and many fidelities found in them which cannot be rewarded with it."  Unto this last. [Essay by John Ruskin] 
 Good bye my dears.  May God bless you all each day & night at all times. 
 Your affectionate Faree John B. Nash
