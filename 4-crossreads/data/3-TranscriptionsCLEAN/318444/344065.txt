  
 Sat Dec 6th:- 278 miles of bad weather. 
 Sun Dec 7th:- We are making a course to go around St Paul & Amsterdam Islands. 307 miles up to midday & weather OK. 
 Mon Dec 8th:- 312 miles today & also maggots in the prunes they put to us for dinner. Of course there was  no  uproar. 
 Tues Dec 9th:- 300 miles (dead reckoning). We are in the centre of a rainstorm. Hostile demonstration against the adjutant & Colonel of ship. Missiles flying & I must say some of the women are straight shots. I expect to see the adjutant's name on the next casualty list under the haeding of:- "Died from a bombardment of rope quoits, uncooked potatoes & decayed fruit." At any rate he was posted "Missing" for a time after &  the beloved Colonel carried out a strategic retreat. 
 Wed Dec 10th:- 294 miles in wet misty weather.
