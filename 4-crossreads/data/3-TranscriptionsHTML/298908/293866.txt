<p>longing for the Sunny South &amp; our own girls.<br/>I have been writing todays doings in the big hall of the Royal Sailors Rest in Devonport, &amp; as I now write a chap is singing "I'll sing thee songs of Araby".  This is a fine place for every night they have good music &amp; plenty of it &amp; songs scattered in between.  The place is large enough to seat a couple of thousand people &amp; it is always well patronized by sailors &amp; soldiers.  Attached to it are restaurants, billiard rooms, reading &amp; writing rooms, plenty of good hot baths, a thousand cubicles for sleeping purposes, hair dressing saloons &amp; goodness only knows what else.  It was started by Miss Agnes Weston 60 years ago &amp; she died only a few weeks ago.  I went to her funeral.  Among the sailors for whom she worked principally she was known as Aggie Weston &amp; she was held in great affection by them, she practically devoted her whole life time to their interests &amp; the work she started so humbly has now grown to an immense undertaking.</p>
