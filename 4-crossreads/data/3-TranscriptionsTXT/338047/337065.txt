July 15On 15 July we saw the Southern Cross for the first time.  The boys gave it a cheer at the thought of getting south again.
July 16On 16 July we crossed the line at 7 pm.  The ceremony was held in the afternoon, but unfortunately I was asleep & missed it.
July 17On the night of 17 July there was a great amount of phosphorescence in the water.  The propellers seemed to be churning up fire, & the wake of the vessel could be seen shining for 150 yards or so.  All the time that I was in England, I had religiously kept off meat, & my boils had all disappeared.  On the voyage I started to eat meat again with the result that I found some hard lumps forming under my chin & jaw.[Photograph of an orchestra on deck]
