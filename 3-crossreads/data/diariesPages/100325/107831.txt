Lovely morning. Up fell in parade. Bde. in artillery formations but came in again almost immediately.
Busy all morning. More dust in afternoon. Made all arrangements for bivouac but found it cancelled. Went out to circular entrenchment round transport park and improved it. Returned early. Battalion came in after dark and the fours looked well swinging along to the band. Arrangements in connection with battle firing.
