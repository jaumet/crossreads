<p>The suit-case is just what I required &ndash; The one I bought is much larger but that will do nicely to take a luncheon etc out in. It is a great idea here to take a tea or luncheon out to some distant place of interest &ndash; so no doubt it will come in very handy.<br/>Sister Murray looks much better &amp; it is lovely to have her back again. We are going out this afternoon together. Dorothy has an admirer from Suez, so will be tripping out with him. I'm going very quietly, thank goodness all my men friends are away just now, so don't have the temptations that I had before.<br/>I have written a long letter for this mail sent a few days ago, but there is no notice up of it leaving yet.<br/>I hope the P.C. I'm sending for Eddy's Birthday will  be in time. Fancy the darling nearly six years old &ndash; how time flies. I have been busy sending Xmas P. Cards to my friends, hope they will get them in time &amp; that I have not missed any of them</p>
