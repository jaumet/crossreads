Dear Mrs. John,
I can't write a letter & I haven't had a show to write for weeks but you must forgive my seeming neglect as I really can't help it.  We have been going like mad & its been very windy & dusty & also very hot.  I think we are leaving Egypt soon & I'm not sorry.  I don't know where we are going or when exactly but I hear we can't write for weeks so I thought I'd better warn you.  I saw Dr. Lethbridge on Sunday, he wants me to try & change into something less strenuous
