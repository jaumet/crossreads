 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  Lost a horse last night &amp; found him in Camel Officers lines &ndash; one of our men had been promised a carton of whisky for a Horse. To such a state have morals sunk but Officers!! should not encourage such jobbery. Horses are much prized by Camel Officers &ndash; handier than Camels. 
 On the range again today getting men accustomed to the new High Velocity Rifles - &amp; ammunition. Dust continuous &amp; the Beach seems afar off.
