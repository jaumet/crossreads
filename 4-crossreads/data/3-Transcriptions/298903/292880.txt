<p>dinner in the train.  We reached Codford &amp; marched to the no. 4 camp arriving around 3 p.m.  A wash up and a shave was my first pleasure.  Tea at 6 p.m. &amp; everything promises to be very comfortable.  The train journey this side was a treat after the cattle trucks of France.  The whole journey so far has been most pleasant, all arrangements being splendid.</p>
<p>Sunday 16th Feb.  The M.O. who accompanied us went away today &amp; another took his place &amp; told me we were to remain here indefinitely .  This I protested against but he referred me to the S.M.O.  Raining all day and dull.  They are busy taking particulars of the men arranging for their furlough and medical examinations but nothing is being done on our behalf.  Codford a rather pretty place &amp; would be ideal for a man recuperating from an illness.  All conveniences as regards shops Y.M.C.A. library etc.</p>
