100 gathered Today!
The "Moeraki" does not go forward to Lyttelton Tonight. I must therefore tranship. Whether I go on Tonight, or wait longer in Wellington depends upon messages that I am expecting from Christchurch Today.
I had a very happy time at "Cairnleith". Every hour I spent with you dear people was restful &amp; full of delight. Many heartfelt thanks for giving me such a lovely time. My only wish is that I had sooner escaped from the Board Meetings.
With Best Love &amp; Grateful  Rememberances.Your affectionate Brother[indecipherable]
