<p>6<br/>enemy.</p>
<p>Soldiers wish according to their hopes and their hopes are facts enough for the moments, unless disaster disproves them.</p>
<p>To us the twelve pounder is safe.<br/>Hark!<br/>The tread of many feet.<br/>Listen!<br/>The clear clomp of hoofs!<br/>The clunk of wheels, and the grinding crush of them as they pass over the hardness and the [indecipherable] of the road.<br/>The distinct clink of chains.<br/>The squeeze and crack of leather<br/>The shuffle and weeze and wobble of baggage<br/>The clash of metal<br/>The tread of feet<br/>The tramps of feet<br/>The shuffle and the drag of feet<br/>The [indecipherable] of a house<br/>the weird complaint of a male<br/>a unuttered curse<br/>a half laugh</p>
