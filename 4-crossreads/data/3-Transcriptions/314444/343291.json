<p>Dear Charley,</p>
<p>Your long looked for letter arrived today.  I was highly pleased to hear from you.<br/>When it reached me I didn't happen to be blazing away at the Turks landscape or the Turks themselves as you say, so had no need to carry out your suggestion.  For a change I am in my dug-out having a spell, &ndash; I say having a spell, but I mean chasing flees all round the jolly place. &ndash; They <strike>bight</strike> bite like ants.</p>
<p>Everywhere and anywhere here there's an over abundance of the damn things. &ndash; it's very chatty.  Never mind Charley old chap, it's the only bad company I have ever kept and you know of course it's impossible to keep out of.</p>
<p>We are living like rabbits now so we have to expect a few miscomforts.  Though these dug-outs are much more comfortable than you might imagine, but naturally not as comfortable as</p>
