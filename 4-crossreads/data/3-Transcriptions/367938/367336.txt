<p>By the way, we have never heard anything of the "Comforts" that we read of in the papers for a long time back have been sent for use of soldiers generally, &ndash; the returned sick &amp; wounded even have not heard of any.</p>
<p>Have met Major Wilson (Q L.H.)</p>
<p>Have just lost my beautiful breakfast of oatmeal, toast &amp; coffee. I put it down to wearing our "peggy bags" as happens so often, treated with glycerine &amp; chemicals &ndash; pulled down over the face &ndash;. only for practise.</p>
<p>Cannot write more today as have to censor the letters. So pleased with yrs &ndash; give my love to everyone &amp; say its quite impossible to write to more than yrself. Have to wait till we get out of this &amp; settled &ndash;</p>

<p>25th<br/>Just saw outside my possy a tin of condensed milk change hands for 2/6 &amp; yet they say theres been money collected at home for our comforts. The staff gives us no facilities for feeding sick men so they go; many went 8 &amp; 9 weeks ago with influenza &ndash; a cold &ndash; gastric. Where are they now? In England, Egypt, Malta; we hear of them everywhere by letters. If the people at home who give the comforts moved the political powers to see that the base details office sent the goods per ship, we would not lose our men so.</p>
