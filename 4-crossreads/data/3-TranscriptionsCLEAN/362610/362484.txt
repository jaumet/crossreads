Monday 25 Sept. 1916Misty early but otherwise glorious. Had to attend a Gas Conference in the morning, & the rest of the day was attending to odd hobs at brigade including a bike ride to the A.M.C. for a bottle of formalin. The General came back from leave to England in the early morning. At night 2 battalions went up into the line.
