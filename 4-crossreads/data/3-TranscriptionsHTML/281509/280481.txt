<p>Cut a few pegs for guy ropes. Bob, Keating &amp; self leave to Poperinghe in afternoon.  Nose round shops, picking up trifles here &amp; there. Hot tea &amp; tinned pears. 3&ndash; tame Belgian flies. Gourmands at next table &ndash; tin fruit each. Pictures &amp; home to Y.M.C.A. coffee &amp; bed.  Bob alright again.</p>
