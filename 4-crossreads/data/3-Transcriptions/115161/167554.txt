<p>coats. Mine I carried to France and eventually cut off all that portion from the waist downwards as the combination of mud and rain, had made it too heavy to carry. I eventually bought an infantry overcoat from a chap who had two. I think I&nbsp;gave him fifteen francs for it. I might mention that some of the light horse fellows had infantry overcoats, of course it could not dawn on the authorities to effect an exchange. As before stated the war had only been going for about two years, so don&#39;t let us be too hard on the authorities, they were no doubt doing their best, yes! their very best. The results were really not always brilliant but there! what could you expect.</p>
<p>My tall friend after being in camp with me for about six weeks, left the infantry and joined the artillery. He was very tall, but he proved by his action that he had brains also. He tried to induce me to follow him, but not understanding horses, and being a bit nervous when in close proximity to their &quot;business&quot; end, I decided to depend on my own legs, and remain in the infantry. Oh yes! of course I regretted my action, but there! I was for ever regretting some foolish action &nbsp;or another.</p>
<p>My friend and I did not meet again till we ran across each other in Belgium. I was carrying a heavy pack. He was riding a mule. I was covered in mud, wet through, and dog-tired. He was clean, dry, and fresh as a daisy. I wished he had not been so tall.</p>
<p>Every morning before breakfast, we had what they call &quot;physical jerks&quot;. &quot;on the hands down&quot;, &quot;heads bending sideways&quot;, and various other contortions. These would be followed by some games such as leap-frog, relay races, &quot;O&#39;Grady says&quot;, and many other such games.</p>
<p>There was one game which I never could see any sense in, and that was a game in which a ring was formed, and a chap with a strap would drop it on your shoulders which was a sign that you had to chase him</p>
