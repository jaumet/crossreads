<p>hospital where I am suspected of having diphtheria.  Only milk "swallowable" <strike>10/11/16</strike> The procedure with likely diphtheria cases is to take a swab of the throat, incubate it and place under the microscope and by the result is known the treatment required.  Put into B5 ward and given a cup of milk and big piece of bread and jam as if one could face that.  A great dodge of the orderlies then is to procure some equally uneatable article such as a chicken and when you leave it as they know you will, they have it.  Get 4000 units of anti-toxin serum injected into my chest with a rusty needle by the feelings.  Positively stated to have diphtheria &ndash; yet feel fair.<br/>10/11/16<br/>Taken down to Anglo American Nile Coys Hospital steamer NIAGARA and steam down the canal to Port Said and jammed straight into the observation ward.  No medicine or gargles yet.  Given a blue coat, blue trousers, red tie etc etc and clean (?) shirt and sox and put amongst a lot of Tommies.  Bread and jam for tea.  Cocoa for supper.  Few ALH men in the ward thank goodness.<br/>11/11/16<br/>Feel splendid and fit for anything.  Porridge and bread and jam for breakfast.<br/>12/11/16<br/>Have 3 good square feeds and a few swims.<br/>13/11/16<br/>Go for walk to end of</p>
