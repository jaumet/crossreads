Tuesday 6th July 1915

A pleasant day on the calm bosom of the Indian Ocean. A gentle S.W. zephyr did little to disturb the tranquility of the day. The blue dome above was unflecked by clouds & reflected itself in the unruffled water unsparingly. Beyond A lazy swell, wh to the troops had the effect of a sweet lullaby on a new born child, predominated throughout the day. One accident marred the day. We lost our mascot – Miss Wallaby – overboard. Whether this be an ominous sign, we do not know – at any rate, her loss was soon forgotten wh spells much for the optimism of the troops.

The journey is becoming tiresome in its dull monotonous routine – deck concerts help one at night to dispel gloomy thoughts.
