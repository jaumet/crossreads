he was half mad because his shearers had not turned up. I asked him if he took any learners, but he would not hear about it unless they could shear a certain number per day. I am told that this the way with most of the sheds now they wont keep a couple of pews for learners the result is that each year they find it harder to get men. last year Wallangra had an awful crew and it took a long while. the federal Co does the work there, and they could not get men and so had to put up with mostly learners some of them not being able to do more than about 20 when they started. I think the high prices skins were bringing caused the trouble.
My great lament about the scarcity of news awhile back was not a hint, for you to send papers up. thank you father very much. our old boundry rider never thinks of asking for mail nowadays knowing there must be some at the station I took a ride up and had a job to carry them home, since then I have been each Sunday.
