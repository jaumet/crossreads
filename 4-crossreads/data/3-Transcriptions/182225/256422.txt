<p>Fine. Got a car into Salisbury &amp; got an early train to London. Went straight to the&nbsp;<s>Regents Palace</s>&nbsp;Grovosner Court &amp; saw Auntie Florence &amp; M<sup>rs</sup>&nbsp;Angus. Went round London &amp; did some business in morning &amp; saw the &quot;Battle of the Somme&quot; on the pictures at the &quot;Scala&quot; theatre in the afternoon. We all went to the Opera &quot;Samson et Delilah&quot; at night &amp; it was beautiful. I got the 11.15 pm train to Edinburgh from Euston afterwards.</p>
