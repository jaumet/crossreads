16/4/18 - Lavievilleno one was at all the worse.  Walked up forward to Pioneer Trench, passing through a moderate barrage and met Rodda and Sparrow discussing several matters of carrying &c.  Our guns knocked down this afternoon the celebrated Falling Virgin of Albert commonly known as Mademoiselle or Fanny Durack.  Received word that enemy massing down a couple of Divns. on our right meant that probably we would be attacked at dawn.  Sent up Miles and Sutherland and let them do the posts.  A quiet night.  Sgt. Grey wounded.
