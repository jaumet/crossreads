<p>Australian Red Cross letterhead<br/>Bulford<br/>28.4.17<br/>Dear Mum,<br/>I have written to Dad about my trip to see Jennie but I have left a little of the news for You.  One day we spent at Hull on the other side of the Humber.  We caught the train to a place called New Holland &amp; then caught the ferry to Hull.  The Ferry was a bonzer boat with apholstered cushioned seats &amp; was lovely &amp; warm.  On reaching Hull we toured all round the Town noting a Statue erected to Wm Prince of Orange.  It is painted Gold &amp; bears an Inscription which states that he was the Liberator of the People.</p>
