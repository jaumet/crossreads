 fought their first action along with some of the English Divisions. The fight was known as the Battle of Fromelles or the Fleurbaix Stunt. Whatever the result&nbsp;of the Stunt from a&nbsp;military point of view was it [?] disastrous to our 5 th &nbsp;Division who had the honour of being the first Australians to have a real stunt&nbsp;in France. Our division suffered very heavily. We lost a very large number Killed, wounded, our Fine division crippled in one bloody field which only lasted 12 hours quite a lot of this stunt has been written so I don&#39;t think I will dwell on the Battle being in a Field Amb. Iam not in a position to judge but I will say this that&nbsp;it&#39;s the infantryman who pays in all of these hardolups &amp;&nbsp;mistakes
