<p>Strange that I have not heard from J &ndash; yet. I'm beginning to think he was only fascinated for the time but I shall not worry over it. Life is too short to be miserable over that sort of thing, when there is so much to do. I'm awfully thankful I can work &amp; feel very fit &ndash; My patients are very quiet to-night, shall finish up early &amp; get away to early communion.  Have not received any letters this week from Fred or any of my friends in firing line &ndash; evidently some trouble in sending them.<br/>Hope you are all well &amp; had a Happy Xmas &amp; New Year. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. <br/>From,                                                                                                                                                                      Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                             Edith.</p>
