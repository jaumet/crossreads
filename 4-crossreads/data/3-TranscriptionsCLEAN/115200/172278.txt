 I have only briefly Described these attacks  if I was to write them in full it would take a Dozen of these books and therefore it would take to long to write out. So I am only just putting things as Brief as possible  So you will understand that it would take to much time and we have not too much of that to spare. But I am going to write thew whole of my Experiences from april the 25/1915.
