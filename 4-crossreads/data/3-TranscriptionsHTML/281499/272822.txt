<p>It was funny down in the town tonight to see all the boys ducking in &amp; out of the butcher shops buying meat for a good feed, for we were all more or less meat hungry &amp; practically the whole Battalion was in, &amp; against "orders" too.<br/>15th  Sunday is round once more &amp; when we rose this morning at 5.30 it was raining heavily, but it turned out to be a shower only, I went over &amp; drew our rations for we were camped some little distance from the rest of the Coy. &amp; by the time we had breakfast the rain had stopped &amp; things looked lovely &amp; green.  A lot of the boys got drunk here &amp; I had a terrible job to get them ready to move off in time, even then the Machine gunners left a roll of blankets</p>
