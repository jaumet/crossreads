<p>is Leanes Trenches 31.10.15.</p>
<p>Paid a visit to Quinns today the 17th Bn <strike>are</strike> is stationed there. We dug up Harry Higgs and had dinner with him 1.11.15</p>
<p>The 6th L.H. advanced about 600 yds. last night. It was really the opening up of a new firing line dug underground. There were very few casualities 5.11.15.</p>
<p>There was a small stunt on the extreme right. The 5th L.H. went out with the intention of doing great things but found the trench</p>
