<p>This is only one instance of M.O. indifference or callousness.</p>
<p>19/4/16  Wednesday</p>
<p>Very cold last night &ndash; Very fair day.</p>
<p>Corporal of a Picquet all day. Rumours that there is heavy fighting on the Canal. A lot of men are moving off. We heard that owing to the delay in leaving Zeitoun Camp &ndash; my name was called at Telekebar for Artillery &amp; not being there to answer it was crossed out.   Needless to say I am very disappointed. This is a very large Camp. I think I would be right in saying it is 5 miles long &ndash; so it is hard to imagine unless you see it what numbers of men are in Calico City &ndash; They style this Camp third line of Defence &ndash; Rumours of a lot of casualtys amongst Australians in France &ndash; also that no more transfers from A.M.C will be considered.</p>
<p>The Flying Squadron alongside us &ndash; condescended to give us an evenings music on the Band, we all appreciated &amp; broke the monotony.</p>
