<p>with Ethel.</p>
<p>It is such lovely weather just at present &amp; to look out over the tennis court (which Father has just put in order) in the moon-light it is hard to bring oneself to believe that "some where in France" such a terrible war is raging &amp; so many many of our finest boys are being killed. Last week news came through that Alan Blackett had died of wounds &amp; they are very sad over the way.</p>
<p>Bill is expecting to go into lunch with Trannie Lovegrove at Hampton Court where she is staying at present &amp; finds it much more to her liking than quiet Lindfield. She has had the operation for her eyes &amp; is so happy to be able to read &amp; knit again.</p>
<p>Dear Bill is getting a big boy fast &amp; is not so easily managed as he was. Miss Huntly has his music in hand &amp; we hope that before he gets old enough to positively hate her he may have got over the worst drudgery of music &amp; be ready to go on with some one else.</p>
<p>[The following text is written along the left-hand margin:]<br/>Aunt Soph wrote for your address to send Xmas greetings. Take care of yourself &amp; don't catch cold. We are wondering if your sheep skin vest has or will be any use to you. They are sending tanned leather ones now lined with flannel</p>
