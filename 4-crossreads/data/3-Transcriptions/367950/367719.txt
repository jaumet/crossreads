<p>(This portion of the drawing is marked STRIKER and shown &ndash; Length of pin 29 cm.)</p>
<p>This "Striker" hits the ground and Explodes the charge contained in the pear-shaped body. The body of the bomb by the way is made of cast iron and the pieces fly "every which way" when it explodes quite an ugly looking arrangement.<br/>2.30 pm.<br/>Up to now our aeroplanes have been exceptionally busy streaking across the blue dome of Heaven from one point to another especially towards midday and for some time after. But just as they have gone down again and at half past two a 'plane was sighted and lo &amp; behold she was a Taube! Now was there ever anything more annoying? Hour after hour those machines of ours had patrolled the blue vault above keeping up for hours at a stretch and at times going as high as any Taube normally goes (about 6000 to 7000 feet) There were 6 of them together circling around like huge dragon flies and no sign of the Taube and as soon as they come down the Taube appears. He drops 5 bombs about a mile</p>
