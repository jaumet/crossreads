<p>21 April, Monday</p>
<p>F. Lovely Day.</p>
<p>Everyone A.W.L. we carry on OK. C.O. arrives unexpectedly &amp; there is a H--- of a scatter to find anyone. All on booze again. I set out for T'worth alone &amp; buy Red Lamp. Home to read bath &amp; to bed. I am thinking by day &amp; dreaming by night. All the time. The boys get rabbits &amp; the game keepers nearly get them.</p>
<p>22 April, Tuesday</p>
<p>F.<br/>I go to Amesbury &amp; Bulford on bike, forget everything. Back for Tea, get medicine but no oil. Senator Pearce makes an inspection of Irrigation Hut but only on the outside. Recd letter from Jennie.</p>
