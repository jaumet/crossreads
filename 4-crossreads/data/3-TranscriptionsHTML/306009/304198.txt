<p>1915<br/>Jan. 12 Tue.<br/>Suez very pretty - Lovely Day &ndash; Bought oranges and dried figs from the Egyptians who came alongside &ndash; one cruiser in port.<br/>Left anchorage at 12.30 a.m. &amp; started up canal (87 miles long, 27 yds. Wide and 27 ft. deep.)<br/>Very pretty at entrance but afterwards dreary waste of sand on both sides, on which are being constructed forts, barb-wire entanglements and trenches by several thousand Indian and a few British troops, with which cheery greetings have been exchanged.<br/>Several camels (dromedaries) observed in one camp.<br/>Evenings, from last night, are now a trifle chilly.</p>
