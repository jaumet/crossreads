 Awakened at 3 a.m. by a loud and heavy bombardment and by the adjacent heavy batteries firing hard. Most of the stuff coming over was German and landing heavily around Prowse Point and the Hyde Park corner. It seems that they raided the 21st posts and the most contradictory reports are to hand here. Some say that 5,6,7,8 & 9 posts were raided and that our casualties are not light. Went down to the A.D.L. at breakfast time and saw Dr Simmonds who says he has had only a few wounded through and they say only 5 & 6 were raided. However there is a good fog this morning and the 21st should be able to look round and to see exactly how things stand. Abercrombie was forward
