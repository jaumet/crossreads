<p>Dear Vol</p>
<p>First of all, convey my congratulations to Mrs. Voltaire.  Secondly, accept same yourself.  Thirdly, don't do as I did &amp; come to the war when you've been married a fortnight.</p>
<p>Am A1 now.  Much better &amp; going back to my unit this week.</p>
<p>Yes, my brother-in-law died in Egypt to my great regret.  He was a fine boy &amp; full of fight.  For myself, I've done my best, &amp; am going back still full of fight.</p>
<p>London is fine, there are no lights, however, at night, as they're afraid of Zeps.  I haven't seen any yet</p>
