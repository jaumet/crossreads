<p>We put up at this place for a day and then on we went to our billets which meant a fair march, it was also called a rest, but I never got any rest.</p>
<p>Anyway we got going and after a few hours marching we came to a little village where we put up for the night.</p>
<p>Next morning we were off again (no rest for the wicked) and this time we marched a few more mile than the day before anyway we put up at another billet where we stayed for a few day's.</p>
<p>After leaving this village we came to our destination where we remained for 3 weeks training.</p>
