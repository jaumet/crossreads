<p>Sat. Dec. 15  Packed up cushion cover &amp; Photo &amp; gave to Rex Rodd, to take back with him on the Hospital Ship; for Mother.  Also sent Photo to France.  Went down to Mess Hut for my first meal.  It is not at all Bad, nice &amp; warm &amp; cheerful &amp; we get the tucker hot.  Old Bandy brought the Photo along.  It is really good.  Now I have to raise 15/- to pay for it.  Spoke to Capt Fox about getting a trip on the transport back Home.  He rushed down to the Registrar's Office where he put up a good argument, but they informed me that only C class men were taken on for those Jobs, so my chances of seeing Lill are again at a very low level.  Anyhow I finished Letter 47 &amp; posted it</p>
<p>Sun. Dec. 16.  Cold, wet, snowy day.  Very few visitors.  I sat in the Canteen eating Cakes &amp; drinking weak Tea.  Old "Bandy" brought the Picture along of Lill &amp; I, but I didn't have the money to pay for it, so he will have to wait till I've seen the Registrar.</p>
<p>Mon. 17.  One of the Red X Ladies promised to sew my Blotter Cover, so I took it down to the Sewing Room &amp; left it.  She didn't have enough material to finish it, but promised to do it for Wednesday.  Jolly good Concert in Hall.  "The Cheer-ohs"  All Girls.</p>
