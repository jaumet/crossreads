blindfolded him, he offering cigars to us thinking we might not Blindfold him, but we were not taking any chances, he asked to see the Commandant we led him along on Horseback to Colonel Watson who discused terms of Surrender, the Colonel gave him to understand that no more firing was to take place until he had seen the German Governor who he wished to see at Herbertshohe next day at 11.30 am, after all this was over we marched back to Herbertshohe leaving 2 Companies at the Hospital to stay there all night as a sort of outpost.
We arrived back very tired just flopped down wet through went to sleep no noise from the troops that night, one of our chaps collapsed on the way back he had to be carried in, being alright next day it was 9.30 before we got back making a long day of it from 4.30 am until 9.30 pm. The Germans said afterwards that it was a record march as they did not expect us until the following day, a few shots were fired during the night but everyone being so tired we all slept well.
