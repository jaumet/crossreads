6/12/17 Mt. Kemmell
Everything was frozen when we woke up this morning. A fatigue 200 strong was put on burying water pipe and the balance carried on with ordinary work. In the afternoon ran off a few events in our battalion sports and did not unearth any very special in the way of athletes. As soon as it was dark Gothas came over and the long fingers of many searchlights started groping for them. Judging by the numerous explosions they must have bombed some of the places very severely. The archies kept firing but do no good. Got a couple of officers up and gave them some rousing up look for an improvement. The searchlights were busy and concentrated together while our guns fired. Once a flaming mass was seen to fall and we think that it must have been an enemy machine brought down crashing about "Pop".
