<p>16-12-16<br/>Sat 16th<br/>Early this morning our patrol captured a Turk who apparently has had enough fighting &amp; was coming in. I covered the telephone line across the camel &amp; horse roads today &amp; have a lamp aligned on Bde H.Q. in case the line breaks tonight. Today we received a large quantity of Xmas gift goods which were very acceptable. From our observation post we can see the Spire of El Arish &amp; Turkish Outpost on the hills through the Telescope. I forgot to report that Major Smith with the Troop of C Sqdn men returned from Wady El Arish on Thursday night after a very successful trip. Early Thursday</p>
