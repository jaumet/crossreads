<p>The "Wassa"or the low &amp; immoral portion of Cairo was the scene of another disgraceful piece of work organized by some of our noble soldiers. A rumor was spread abroad that a soldier was robbed by one of the women &amp; in consequence vengeance was the order of the day. Fires were lit in a number of the buildings &amp; furniture was thrown from high windows &amp; balconys &amp; for a time one could imagine hell was let loose</p>

<p>It is not generally know that large numbers of Australian as well as Tommies are suffering from Venerial Disease of one sort or another. A Dr assistant told me that many a life had to be smothered in the hospital because nothing could be done with the sufferer, &amp; the cruel part is that even should some recover the individual carry the germ for many years &amp; of course others are made to suffer.</p>
