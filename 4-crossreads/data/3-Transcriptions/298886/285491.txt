<p>miles out from Sohag.</p>
<p>This diary keeping is hard work I look at the top of the tent for inspiration but nothing comes of it. 6 bags of parcels today</p>
<p>23rd April  Sunday(Easter)</p>
<p>We are breaking all records as regards mail &ndash; another 8 bags tonight Thousands of letters. I have to distribute them all No one has the handling of a single letter apart from myself we did that one time on the Peninsular which led to utter confusion  So they all sit round meek &amp;  mild and if the boys start an argument during the time I am calling out the names God help them! I have all spare letters to readdress when all the sorting is over and that takes some time, some rapid writing and some thinking out. But there is no hesitation I must go right on otherwise I would be here all night. The weather was frightfully hot today. And at times scarcely a breath of wind The very clothes seemed literally to burn one's skin &ndash; A Battery of Royal Horse Artillery arrived today and are Camped close to us here.</p>
<p>24th April Monday (Easter Monday)</p>
<p>Very hot! Most of the horses have been innoculated for the second</p>
