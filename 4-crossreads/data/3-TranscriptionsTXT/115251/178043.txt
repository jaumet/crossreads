 With the forces in the field were a number of men acting as Officers, who were not regular soldiers but had received Military Training in Germany in the ordinary way.&nbsp; They were Reservists who had come to the Colony and invested their capital in establishing Cocoanut Plantations, and made their permanent homes there, some of them being accompanied by their wives and families.&nbsp; Others were men employed in various Stores and Merchant Houses. 
 All these had been called out by the Ex-Governor for military service in defence of the Colony on the outbreak of War.
