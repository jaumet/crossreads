<p>Issue of tucker, I got up in a corner with a couple of my nurse friends. They covered me up with rugs &amp; the officers &amp; other nurses thought that I was one the Officers. I had one of the most pleasant evenings I have spent on the whole journey.</p>
<p>The chief engineer was one of the party &amp; he invited me down to his cabin. I went down when the girls went to bed at 10 pm &amp; had a chat &amp; he gave me a box of 100 lovely cigarettes. I have 35 packets of cigarettes as well as these. I got them for 2d a packet. They are 5d in Cairo. I have nearly enough to see me out for 12 months.</p>
