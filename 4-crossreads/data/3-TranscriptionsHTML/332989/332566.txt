<p>Mail closes tonight, just received a bunch of papers from you &amp; girls but no letters guess they are floating around Egypt.   Am glad we are out of that ancient land, it certainly reeks with all kinds of rotten smells &amp; iniquity &amp; where we are now is certainly one grand country, just like one immense garden &amp; farms &amp; orchards &amp; vineyards all kept scrupulously clean.   In the wine country it is hard to realise there is such a war going on except for the fact that you notice at once that all the work is done on the farms by women, old men &amp; children.   Still address your letters the same Sgt. G.F Alley 11th Battalion 3 Infantry Brigade, Abroad.   Hope you are still improving in health and that the girls are all fit and well &amp; finding lots</p>
