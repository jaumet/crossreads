[Thursday 2 March 1916]
On Patrol today and by invitation had dinner with another Bedouin Owdah-1 Whole Lamb, head, eye & all & 2 Turkey Cocks- came in- sweets, made of Buffaloe Milk Starch & Sugar,All eat with hands, & literally tear the food.The Lambs head was smashed with an axe- & brains Bon Bouche.  Our Host could eat a lamb himself he informed me, & I believe it-Their great ambition is to die knowing that no man has even seen their wifes. Asking when the Bedouins would rise to help the Desert Arabs, they replied- in Arabic "When two Sundays meet"  "God bless you" which of course means never but we pick our man while feeding
