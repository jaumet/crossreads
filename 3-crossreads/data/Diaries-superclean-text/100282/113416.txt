in Australia, if this is true it is not much encouragement to us who are soldiering over here, for it practically means that the people of Australia are not behind us this is not very nice to know, if Conscription don't pass I'm thinking that the average of the Australian Army will fall considerably for no one will have much "guts" as we call it to take much of an interest any further in the fighting, can you wonder at it, if you could only see the class of men who voted No over here, nearly all Catholics I.W.W.s Socialists etc, all the muck rubbish in the Army, makes one mad when we think of it, I suppose it's the same in Australia, for the Irish element is very strong we know what a down they have on the English. Billy Hughes made the greatest mistake in his political career when he let the people of Australia decide the Conscription affair by a Referendum instead of passing it through the House straight away like America did no more about it, as it is now he has put his foot in a hole properly
