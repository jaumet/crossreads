<p>I have seen strong men faint when they have been inoculated, for what <strike>I</strike> reason I could never find out for the actual pain is no more than a little sharp stab which burns a little as the steel goes in to the flesh, they shove it in about 2 to 3 inches &amp; then withdraw slowly, it certainly is not a very nice sensation, I generally get a grip of myself, when my turn comes to be butchered as the boy's call it, I think it is the same reason why a man hates to go into a dentists, the thought of submitting quietly to physical pain is no good yet once the deed is done a man feels like</p>
