  
 thought of hearing a debate, wanted to go today! Men with power & influence want to go! Men with the interests of the whole Country at heart want to go! So vital were the issues at stake, every class of men & women wanted to be present so what chance would a stranger like you, have of getting in. These answers summed up the situation. 
 However the Sentry thought notwithstanding all this discouragement that he would make a big try! 
 Meeting a business man who would probably "know the ropes" the Sentry explained his desires & then chatted about general topics. After a little while the business man said Wait here a moment I am going to see a friend about a commercial transaction & I may be able to help you! 
 On his return he just handed the Sentry a card with instructions to go to a certain man in the "House" & if he could not help you, no one would be able to! Immediately the sentry presented the card, the official "went off" into a temper & very sharply said Mr [dash] has no right to ask such favors on a day like this! It is really impossible to do anything! The House is quite crowded now & he knows it! 
 This was disappointing but the Sentry asked where the entrance was, this was pointed out, but not the faintest hope "held out" for him "getting in". 
 However standing still would mean the acceptance of "failure". 
 Walking up to the entrance it was greatly depressing to see 4 or 5 Australians, officers & men, just idling there, having been refused admittance. 
 Just at the moment the Sentry approached the door, after discouragement from those waiting, a lady & gentleman rushed up the stairs to the Usher
