  
 a lot this week. The atmosphere is foggy and it is impossible to see very far. This morning I made up a packet of 18 P.C. for my wife mostly of Plymouth & Devonport with a short descriptive note written on the back. This morning I was pleased to get a tin of Australian tobacco by post. I was issued with an Australian overcoat tunic & pants today. Also boots. I returned the Tommy overcoat and boots issued to me in the hospital. I was in Devonport this afternoon and 
 posted some letters & a packet at the Post Office. I had tea at the Sailors rest. Two sausages, potato mash a bun & cup of coffee for 9d. the cheapest place I have yet been in. 
 Sunday December 1. 1918. 21. Three weeks of peace. The time is fleeing fast. Christmas will soon be upon us. Probably the year will be out before we start on our way home to Australia. I was at a C. E. Church parade this morning in the Hall. It was poorly attended. It was conducted by the same chaplain as on the previous Sundays.
