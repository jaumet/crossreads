<p>Leave from 5 p.m. till 9 p.m.  Had a look through the beautiful church in the town.</p>
<p>16th August (Wednesday)</p>
<p>In morning marched to Baths.  Afternoon march to Sailly and back, then paid.  Two of us were yarning with a family of refined French people who own a large shop in the town.  They were in Lille previously but fled when the Germans came through that city.  These people speak remarkably good English, especially a son who has been discharged from the French Army minus a hand.  It seems that the French detested the Indians and were glad to get rid of the dirty black men, as they are termed.  The Indians were practically useless in France as everyone agrees.</p>
