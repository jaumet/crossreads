<p>This morning our Coy on parade numbered no less than 3 men &amp; 3 N.C.O's.    Some Coy. wasn't it the reason of it is that all our men are either doing fatigues or guards.</p>
<p>Entries were sent in today from the different Coy's for the spats which are coming off shortly.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a disturbance today in the cookhouse some of the boy's were "showing" &amp; a few blows were struck but no damage was done.</p>
<p>Last night I was down at the Y.M.C.A. at a concert it was the funniest turn out as ever I was at, the singers with one or two exceptions were rotten</p>
