This is a series of letters from him to his four daughters in Australia: Agnes (Sister Mary Hyacinth), Caroline, Josephine, and Kathleen. Caroline, Josephine and Kathleen lived in the family home at 219 Macquarie Street, Sydney. Agnes was a Dominican nun, usually resident in Moss Vale, NSW.

Towards the end of his time in Egypt, he visited Gallipoli and describes the voyage and the situation he found there. Throughout his letters he mentions a number of other serving medical personnel and soldiers, as well as many friends and prominent citizens in New South Wales, and news items from home and abroad, including the Gallipoli landing, the sinking of the Emden by HMAS Sydney, and the capture of German New Guinea.
The series also includes a small number of letters or documents from other people, including:An account by Lieutenant John Williams (11th Infantry Battalion) of his voyage from Fremantle to Aden on HMAT A11 Ascanius in November 1914, including an account of the sinking of the German cruiser Emden (pages 379 to 386);A letter from Sister Blanche Sutton who served at the Queen of Belgium's Hospital in La Panne, Belgium, about a fire there, and an encounter with the royal family (pages 444 to 455);A letter from Engineer Lieutenant Clarence Walter Bridge, of HMAS Australia, about the fall of German New Guinea in August 1914 (pages 546 to 549).
Short biographical details have been added for people referred to in the letters where it is possible to identify them sufficiently.

Line or paragraph breaks have been introduced as necessary to improve readability.]
