<p><u>29<sup>th</sup> April 1918</u></p>
<p>Well quite an interval has elapsed since I last scrawled herein.</p>
<p>Things have happened</p>
<p>The Priest&#39;s house is a heap of ruins.&nbsp; An eight inch shell lobbed right in the kitchen</p>
<p>Luckily we were all outside watching the acrobatics of one of our number as he manfully essayed to milk a goat.&nbsp; I am writing this propped up in bed in 3 ward of No 2 B.G.Hospital</p>
