<p>Wheeler wakes me up at 3 am to tell me there would be [none of left] Talk about [curse]</p>
<p>10 November 1916 Fri<br/>Very busy as usual put through something like 700 case within the last 24 hours. German aeroplanes overhead 8 p.m. dropping bombs. Wheeler under stretcher. Exceptionally heavy bombardment from midnight till daybreak. Heavier than Poziers. Never before have I heard such hell</p>
<p>[Note in margin]<br/>Doc came over to see me</p>
<p>11 November 1916 Sat<br/>Wrote to Mrs. Ellen Brown &amp; Peter McLeod. On finishing work the butcher &amp; Norm Burgess were waiting for me where we went to Butchers dugout &amp; partook of a stiff rum. QM turned us down on asking for a nip. Whilst having a yarn Fritz sent a few shells over about 200 yds away. Very cloudy night consequently no aeroplanes.</p>
