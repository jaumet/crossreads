number of shells burst rather too close to be comfortable. I quite expected to "go up" at any moment, but after about 2 hours things got quiet again. All the harm "Fritz" did was to explode our bomb store.
Saturday 23rd
Slept in till about 10, when one of the "Scotty's" came and hauled us out of our bunks. It was too late to cook breakfast, so we just made some tea and had a piece of bread and jam. These Gordons are a hardy crowd they wear nothing under their kilts, not even in the depth of winter. There is a party of Engineers working just across from our dug-out and Fritz's look outs must have caught sight of ?em, as he "plonked" a few shells in amongst them, but no one was hurt. A party of the 29th Batt. were digging in the sap, when they came across an unexploded German Shell one of them (the Sergeant) unscrewed the nose cap. He was killed and the other 8 wounded.
Sunday 24th In the Trenches
A glorious sunshy day. Things are very quiet and it is hard to realise that there is a war on and that Fritz is only about 200 yds away, with all his murderous machinery. A party of Gordons raided the enemy trenches last night and every man got back quite safely. I was finishing my weekly epistle to M.S. one of the Gordons got a parcel with some "Hieland" Heather in it. He gave us all a spray and I enclosed mine in L's letter. I posted a letter to France. I was cook today. Made some stew, they all passed rude remarks about it, but there wasn't a tiny bit left and "hungry Murph" cleaned out to the Pot. The Northhum"d "Fus" lrs came into the trenches as soon after dinner and relieved the Gordons. We were sorry to see the Scotties depart as they were a fine crowd and we got quite "chummy" with Cpl. Grant and a few others. Before they went we exchanged badges, for souveniers the N.F. (26th) have just come from the Somme and are full of news about the "big Push."
