<p>June 5 Saturday 1915<br/>Heavy fighting during night, attacking party commenced 11 PM with rapid shell fire. Charges were made at different intervals, when our side secured some trenches and played havoc with others. The Artillary duel continued  till 9. 30 AM. Major Fuller, Brigadier Ryrie on a tour of inspection through trenches shells bursting very close to our abode.<br/>Another 4th L Horse man shot dead whilst observing. A huge piece of shell hit Sergeant  Trecilial on side of body. He marvellously escaped being chopped to pieces as the piece was large &amp; jagged. The sergeant was at the time lying in "dugout".</p>
<p>It is remarkable the large number of men who have been killed &amp; wounded whilst bathing in the ocean. One or two cases where the piece of shell has entered near the thigh &amp; severing penus from body.<br/>Corporal Baldy had finished his swim &amp; was walking over to his clothes when the piece caught him in stomach. He was at once taken to Hospital Ship in serious state. It is a recognized fact that the trenches are much safer than anywhere on the hill or beach. A very large percentage of the casualaties have occurred whilst the men have been going to and fro,  or even lying in their dugouts resting</p>
