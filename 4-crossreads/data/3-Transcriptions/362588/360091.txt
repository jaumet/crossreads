<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>I received a copy of Commen Songs &amp; enjoyed reading same, they were quite refreshing.  I was particularly taken with "Tipperary" in Latin.</p>
<p>Arthur arrived here on Monday night.  They were exceedingly fortunate in getting in to camp in daylight &amp; finding that their camp was already pitched &amp; ready for them to occupy.  I went along to see Arthur on Tuesday night &amp; on Wednesday took him into Cairo to dinner.  It was a great treat to me to talk to someone who had something to say about Australia.  I am so deadly sick of this place and all its filthy ways.</p>
<p>I have been detailed to a School of Instruction in Machine Guns &amp; have been here a week.  The work is most interesting and I am enjoying it very much.  The idea is to have a second officer (in addition to M.G.O.) trained in the M.G. work either in event of additional guns or casualties, and I am the second officer.</p>
<p>We do not yet know anything of what we are going to do or when we are going to do it but I do hope it won't be</p>
