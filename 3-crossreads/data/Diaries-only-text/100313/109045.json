of the Virgin at which a Roundhead once fired a brace of bullets. Inside the church is divided almost in two by a big screen and doors. Some of the stained glass is very lovely. This is where Cranmer was sentenced with much ceremony and where Queen Elizabeth often came. Passed Brasenose College and turned down Grove St. ? a narrow old street with overhanging gabled houses. Looked at Oriel and Corpus Christi colleges from the outside and came out in meadows and green fields. Tried to find the way into the Cathedral from here but was not successful owing to no thoroughfare. Saw some W.A.A.Cs driving and cleaning R.F.C cars cycles ? some pretty girls. Returned past Carfax where busy streets meet. Here there is a tall old tower, sole relic of an ancient church. Worcester College and
