 Assisted Naisby prepare killed of yesterday for burial. Rather gruesome task. Pin them up in a blanket & bury.  Poor chaps. Drill all day. Big Australian mail in. Receive 10 letters. from home & different ones. Take walk up road with Cart. & Net. & saw tree & place where bomb fell.  Terrific force, shattered large tree, cut iron nails like cheese. Bombardments carried on all night. Met Jack Coulthart.
