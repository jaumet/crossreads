<p>Aerodrome, to see if we could get a ride in one of their plane's, they said that if we came next day they could probably fix us up, how I would like a fly in the air, they have easily 20 planes in these shed's some of them are mounted with 2 machine guns<br/>16th. Last night about 11 oclock just as we were dropping off to sleep the whirring sound of an aeroplane startled us, not that there was anything uncommon in that but we had no sooner heard the aeroplane than something else could be heard whistling through the air bombs", 3 of them dropped in the village quite close to our <strike>village</strike> billet, but luckily failed to explode, instantly everyone was alert &amp; our guns aided by the searchlights evidently found the raiders for they started to blaze away at them, &amp; the nose caps</p>
