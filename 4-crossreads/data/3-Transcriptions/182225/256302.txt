<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; SUNDAY 2&nbsp;&nbsp; JULY</p>
<p>A cold gale blowing, but fairly warm in the sun out of the wind. We had a church parade in the morning in fatigue dress, with our life belts &amp; water bottles on; and a Submarine alarm afterwards. Everybody was in place in nine minutes. Lay in the sun on top of the hatch all afternoon. They called for volunteers for a permanent guard in morning but did not volunteer as the guard will be last off the ship, and will have no opportunitiy of getting &amp; looking after their gear in England.</p>
