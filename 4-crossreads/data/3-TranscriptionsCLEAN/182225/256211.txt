 1916   FRIDAY 25   FEB. 
 Fine most of day, but had some heavy storms at night. We had a day off as our arms were very sore. I had a bad cold as well, so was not feeling to fit on it. Came in with Spes Wharton in a taxi and had afternoon tea at Farmer's and came over to Lisheen. Went back in a taxi with Hosking & M c Innis out of the 5/2 DAC.
