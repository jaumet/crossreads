<p>in &amp; enjoyed it well. I also managed to send some things home, photos etc &amp; received a parcel of cigarettes from Morris, all crumpled  up however by their travels. Rumours  still current about our moving to Anzac yet we are still taking patients &amp; have practically reached our former number. This morning I went to Communion, the second time on this island. Last Sunday it was a splendid service the new Chaplain being a first ranker. Concerts are still held during the week But I never go through lack of interest &amp; being on night duty or rather standing by in the Dispensary for night calls. Yesterday I designed a Christmas Card &amp; sent it home to be fixed up for me through Laughland &amp; Mackay. I hope it comes in time as it will be a curiosity for them rather unique.</p>
<p>3rd. Nothing doing during day. About 5 P.M. we took out the surfing boat &amp; had a run round getting back about 9 P.M. after having an exciting sail back in the dark. We were almost run down by a sweeper whose Captain advised us to keep our sailing confined to the daylight. <strike> Wednesday 4th</strike> I had leave all day so took our dinner &amp;</p>
