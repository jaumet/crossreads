<p>[Loose page:]<br/>The M.G Boys stick like glue, have their rally calls, &amp; as long as one is discreet, one <strike>has nothing to complain about</strike> need never get into the clutches of the "Bird Cage" while M.G.'s rule MP's by fear. Having got the upper hand, nothing will wrest away the power from this crowd.</p>
<p>Today we had a fine experience &ndash; exploding trap mines &amp; grenades - &amp; shifting stumps with cotton. The mines are  voted first class for show purposes. the shaft is sunk on a slant, the mouth facing the enemy. The charge 18 lb to 300 lb of high exp is at the bottom, on top she is filled in with stones etc &amp; packed with sandbags. There are two mines, side by side, &amp; one follows the other at the moment when the enemy is rushing up to occupy the first crater. Things happen. There is a shock like earthquake, a crash like a million bottles bursting, &amp; then up rushes a huge geyser of earth &amp; rock &amp; sprays over poor Fritz's lines for hundreds of yards. Our mine was only a baby, but it cut up about 100 by 150 yards of turf &amp; tore the leaves from tall gums 100 yards away. Not a yard of ground in that area was untouched, the stone cutting through everything. Some of the boys say they wish they'd seen it before enlisting. Personally, it was the finest fireworks ever. I hope to see some more as good.</p>
