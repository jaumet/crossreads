<p>Lecture to tent subdivision during the afternoon.<br/>Wednesday 15th. Aug.<br/>  Heavy rain during the morning the usual route march however, a short distance only.  In the afternoon received more gas lectures from our officers, one in particular being painful to listen to, he had not the faintest idea of his subject.<br/>Thursday 16th. Aug.<br/>  Route march in the morning about 7 miles passing through some beautiful country quite the best we have yet experienced in France.  During the afternoon we had the Company drill with the Officers.  The Sgts &amp; officers together practised giving orders, each in turn yelling out the orders, later we drilled with ropes, the results at times being funny.  The band visited us later &amp; so finished an event-ful day.<br/>Friday 17th. Aug.<br/>  Gas drill all the morning getting very monotonous altho' very necessary</p>
