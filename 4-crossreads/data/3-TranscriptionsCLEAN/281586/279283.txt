4The ghosts of prayers and cries and tearsThe Ghosts of Good deeds donePassing and Shuddering, gliding bySolemnly, one by oneSilently, one by one
5Ghosts of Faith and Hope and Truth,Memories brought from the WombOf byegone days, (what a host there are)Passing again to the TombThe still and Desolate Tomb
6Ah me, they are only Ghosts to day,But the Sin that slew them is hereLusty and strong, astraddle the  tomb GravesOf the past I held so dearThe Past with its memories dear.
7They pass, and a lonely road of painAs I bow my head, I seeFor the tender Joys of a nobler pastWill never come back to me.No, never return to me.
