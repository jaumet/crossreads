 I finished my epistle to L.A. and went to post it, but discovered the Orderly Room had packed up, so my letters will have to go with me to the trenches.

It is a fine big residence with an enormous garden at the back and surrounded by fine big trees. It is the property of a Scotchman, and there is a big weaving mill in the grounds. Although the other houses around are in ruins, this one remains practically untouched.
