15-2-16Tue 15thWent out to the well with 3 men of D Troop last night & found the well was right by a tomb & received orders from Lieut Wright to stop any natives from coming near the well & to take them prisoners & were to halt any number up to a dozen before giving the alarm; Nothing happened during the night & by the yapping of jackals in the desert they seem to be pretty plentiful; Sergeant Griffiths appears to be troubled with nerves early in the game as he was the Sergt. of the troop on the hill & stood his men to arms early this morning & said he saw us galloping in but he only fancied it as we had nothing to disturb us; It appears as though they expect some fighting here as batteries of artillery have taken up positions about a mile
