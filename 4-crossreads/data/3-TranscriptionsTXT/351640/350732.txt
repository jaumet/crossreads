The list of casualties from the recent fight at Neuve Chapelle in the North of France, is so long and so serious, that every ones mind is set counting the cost in the best of human British blood.  It is really beyond bearing with equanimity.
Did I tell you earlier that many men from the ranks in air forces here have been recently given temporary commissions in English regiments from the Cavalry downwards.  Amongst them was a son to Bishop Stretch.  There must be a great shortage of trained men in the home countries when the authorities find it necessary to seek, for those to fill leading places, mongst the troops that have come from Australia.
I send you a copy of the address which was presented to me yesterday by the French Christian Brothers.  Was it not very good of them?  My reply also.  Hope that you may think it to be fitting and up to the necessary standard.
15-4-15. 9 a.m.  Enjoyed a gallop on the plateau this morning, a companion, medical man from Melbourne was with me for a time, afterwards I went on alone.  The air was fresh, the wind keen, the atmosphere clear, the stony ridges in the distance clean cut against the horizon, the sand surface interrupted scarce by any hoof or paw, the stones with shining surface sank beneath the horses hoofs, the rocky masses hammered to the hammering of his iron shoes, the locusts, recovering from the nights cold, made efforts to rise as the approaching noise disturbed them, the small birds on outward flight rose in hundreds as we approached, the hawks hovered and swooped overhead, and above all the clouds obscured the rising sun modifying his rays which lighted up the earth silhouetting the great pyramids gainst the Eastern sky.  Must to the hospital to go through my patients.
