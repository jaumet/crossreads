  
 We were withdrawn from the line after six  months  days strenuous work and are now quartered in a most peaceful neighbourhood well out of the range of the guns. At present I am writing seated in a green sward surrounded by fruit trees of all kinds, particularly cherry. Unfortunately although covered with fruit they are not quiet ripe yet, but, if we remain here for another fortnight, I am looking forward to a good feed. I don't know what the french proprietor will have to say on the matter but it will hardly affect us much. We live under the trees spending most of our time reclining on the grass recuperating from our strenuous work, and all of us sleep out in the open at nights. I had an opportunity, a couple of days ago, of looking over our latest and most deadly weapon of offense, a tank, and you may be sure I took it.  They are truly wonderful and most deadly monsters, quite impervious to rifle and machine gun fire and proof against against (anything) but a direct hit from the largest shells. Numbers of them were in the present advance but not on our immediate front. I secured a Fritz helmet, knapsack, rifle-bolt, water-bottle, belt almanack and Field Letter card, as souvenirs. I am afraid I will have no hope of sending the helmet but will post the others as they may prove interesting to you. I received two letters from home dated 2nd. & 15th. April and also a book "Silas Marner", and am pleased to hear that all at home are well. The garden must indeed be beautifully decorated with the new Sunflower. I hope Kit's snaps of it and yourselves prove a success. I must conclude now as the mail closes to-day and will write again at the first opportunity. I have endeavoured to write each week but have missed some I'm afraid. When in the trenches one loses sense of time and the day we come out on a Monday, it is hard to tell whether one or two weeks have elapsed since going in. With the best of love to all at home & next door Your loving son,  Eugene.
