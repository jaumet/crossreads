<p>13-4-17<br/>vessels etc. from the first post we saw Gaza several miles away &amp; it looks a fairly large place, on our way to the other Posts two miles away, we passed over barley crops that would yield from 3 to 4 bags per acre the land is ploughed with a camel on the end of a stick plough that a man can carry about, this plough only scratches the surface &amp; does not even cut out the weeds &amp; it is marvellous that the crops grow at all, couch grass grows everywhere, there is very little or no sand in the soil here, &amp; very dusty on the roads where there is much traffic; Crossing a Wadi (Waterways that only runs after rain)</p>
