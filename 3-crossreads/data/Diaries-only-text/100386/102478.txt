 Weekly Detail. 
Strength. 1 Officer. 84. O.Ranks not including 6 in hospital, 1 on detached duty at A.B.P.O. London. 2 on leave to U.K., and 1 attached P.B. personnel in hospital.
The above is forwarded for information, shewing detail of duty to be performed by personnel. It will be noted that the doughmakers and section are shewn in shifts. The 6 am to 2 pm doughmakers make the dough which is to be baked off by the 2 pm to 10 pm shift, and the other shifts in like manner, thus allowing eight hours for "prooving". It will also be noted that the number of "details" is large if calculated for the strength of this bakery, but it must be borne in mind that the personnel in camp is about 600 (Imperial and Australian).
