Here two 14th Bn. were sniped last night, just as I left them. One got a bullet in shoulder, the other throught his ear. Our trench was shelled early this morning. I am &quot;Chatty&quot; today more than yesterday &amp; expect to be more so tomorrow as I have several &quot;nits&quot; on my singlet.</p>
<p>One Mule train is very &quot;windy&quot; &amp; they don&#39;t like waiting to be loaded with our salvage at the &quot;dump&quot;.</p>
<p>The 15th. Bn. erected a cross over their late CO&#39;s grave (Major Mundell who was killed the day before we arrived here.) &amp; also over graves of others of 15th. Bn. Two 14th Bn. killed near here night before last also buried. The weather still good but rather cold at night. We are fortunate in having no rain. Read a very interesting novel &quot;The Impenitent Prayer&quot;</p>
