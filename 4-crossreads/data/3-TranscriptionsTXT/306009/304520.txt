 1915 Dec. 4 Sat. Feeling pretty fair to-day &ndash; Put the hard word on the Old Man for a few days at Ras-el-Tin Convalescent Depot, Alexandria. He said YES so left Cairo by 4.30 p.m. train &amp; arrived safely at Ras-el-Tin about 4 hours later. Given a bed in Ward 12 &amp; turned in. Ought to have a rather decent time here. Leave everyday from 1.30 p.m. The tucker is good &amp; everyone left pretty much to himself.
