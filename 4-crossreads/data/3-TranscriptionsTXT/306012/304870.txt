25th March 1918 (Mond.)Working hard to get things fixed up for an early push off.  The 3rd & 4th Aust. & 1st N.Z. Divisions have already left to lend a helping hand.
26th March 1918 (Tuesd.)The Ambulance moved out at 10 a.m. & marched about 5 miles to Van Sohier farm where we stayed until the evening of the following day.  The weather has changed and is bitterly cold.  What a difference from my Italian leave.
28th March (Thurs.)We fell in at midnight and marched out with packs up through Remy Siding (the C.C.S. had gone - shelled out) to Hopoutre Siding where we entrained at 2 a.m. in
