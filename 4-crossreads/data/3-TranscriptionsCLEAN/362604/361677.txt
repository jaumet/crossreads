  
 times.  We are not so busy but we are expecting a big draft of Patients from another Hospital so any week we have a H-of time now. 
 Well, Dad & Mum, I must thank you for all your nice comfies in the Parcels.  We'll make jolly fine use of 'em, not now perhaps, but in the winter time. 
 Kind Regards to all the Friends & Neighbours & Fond Love to you Dad, Mother & George. 
 Yours affectionately Harry
