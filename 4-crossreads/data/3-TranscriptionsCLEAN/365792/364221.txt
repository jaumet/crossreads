May 16 Spose a fellow will get away some day. This Tommy uniform gets on my nerves every time, & in fact all the time. -
Successfully dodged all toil & then had a shave & haircut. 5 pm am up again on the wall which surrounds the Church of St Joseph. Gee its lovely up here above the crowd & the City. Heard a whisper that im booked for Eng.
17  Paraded down to C.M.I.R. this morning for what I don't know. Evidently the Heads like to muck a fellow about as much as possible Rather heavy fog, so the day should be fine - Here I am again at No. 13 Stationary waiting for the Doc to turn up. Must word him & see what can be done. - Later - Met the Doc & he straightaway sent me to Hospital again & marked me for England. Guess my luck has turned at last, he's some Doctor too & you bet I'm jolly pleased to be back again in the same Ward. Some of the boys are still here.
