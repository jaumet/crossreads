 Dearest Mother, Father &amp; Little Sister 
 I expect you are wondering how I am getting on. Well I am quite well &amp; having a good time. I am still in very good health &amp; losing no weight Under the conditions the food etc is good We all cook our own food. I make quite a fine dish out of tinned beef, onions rice &amp; preserved potatoes. I enjoy it tip top and feel in tip top order for a scrap after I have finished. There is no mistake this is beautiful farming country. I think you could grow anything. Stanley is quite well &amp; wishes to be remembered to you all , also Q M Potts &amp; Paddy Hayes. Remember me to all my friends &amp; tell them I am quite well. Now dear Mother &amp; Dorothy do not worry about me as I am safe as a church &amp; after all only doing my duty. By the way have a good Xmas dinner &amp; the good old Monopole, as it will all be over then. Give my love to Helen. Hoping you are all well With love &amp; etc Your loving Son Tom.
