<p>Twice this week did I send to No. 1 G.H., as word had been sent that letters were there for me.   When Jerom called he got some letters, but there were none from you.   This a disappointment. I shall hope for next week when an Orient steamer passes North through the canal</p>
<p>12-6-15.    We are somewhat pleased to day because several hundreds of Turks landed in Cairo as prisoners, this will impress the minds of the native population, a very desireable factor to be brought about at the moment.</p>
<p>A cable came from MacNamara this afternoon.  I have replied to it and sent a second message to Buchanan, asking that the matter be expedited.  I do not see how it can be managed here.   And now to bed.  Not in tip top fettle these days. Good Night. Good Night. Good Night.<br/>[Lines of Xs and Os.]<br/>Carrie. Joseph. Kitty.</p>
<p>13-6-15.   This is Sunday.   And 10-30 a.m.    I have just returned from Mass.  We went first to Zeitoun, to the convent chapel, but we were late for there; then we went on to Heliopolis.   I knew the time at the Basilica, but trusted to Captain Cameron for the hour.   There was a great crowd of new soldiers, enough to fill the church comfortably; I did not see amongst the officers or the men any that I knew, one man looked at me hard but I did not know him, sorry now that I did not speak to him<br/>Jolly hot this morning, and the air will heat up during the afternoon it always does in this part, the sun having an effect far beyond any thing that you know of in Sydney.<br/>We have heard nothing more about deaths amongst our people at Galipoli, you have later information, indeed the papers from W. Australia will bring to us the earliest lists, this is strange but true.   Sunday never got as far as Cairo, nor did Friday, hence all days of the week are very much alike and did one not keep a sharp look out, or consult his calendar every morning he might easily get astray.</p>
<p>A man from Queensland has told me that the Pointiana Rega (Golden Mohr tree) is common about Brisbane, and that he has seen very large specimens growing there.  He also said that he understood that the ones growing here had come from his country, Queensland, but this is not correct, because several persons informed that their habitat is Madagascar.   I enclose some of the seeds for you, others I shall send to Buddie.   They should do all right on the Maitland flats, of course there may be some already flourishing on the banks of the Hunter.</p>
