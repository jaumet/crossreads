7/11/18 YzeuxAnother dull and inclement day. Got up after lunch and shaved off about 4 days beard. Sat in front of a fire. Word today among the French people that an armistice has been signed. Our Corps deny knowledge of it. Much goz among the civilians.
8/11/18. Fine but dull during morning but rain came on during afternoon. Got up after lunch. Horse show at St Vast today. To 4 pm I heard the 24th had won the best turned out limber but no other particulars as yet. Major Dr Jno Muirhead &Colonel Dr Savage came in to see me. The arrangements for todays horse show could have been better it seems. The 22nd won the cooker and the packs. Keith Sutherland came over to dinner with me tonight - a dear and capable little chap of whom I am very fond indeed. We read today in the paper of the Huns sending over their emissaries for peace.
