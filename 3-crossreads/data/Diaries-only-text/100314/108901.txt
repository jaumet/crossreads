Versailles was evidently in here not long ago too. Dined at 7.30 in state and yarned to a Colonel of the Scots Guards with many war ribbons. A fine type of the British Regular Officer ? they are nearly always first rate fellows. His face all wound scarred and he admits that the Soudan has got him fascinated. Consumed a number of drinks before going in to an elaborate dinner. After this there was a short lecture by the Commandant more drinks and yarning and then I made off through dark streets to a cold bedroom and to sleep. The people of the house seem to be poor and evidently just barely live on their separation allowance.
