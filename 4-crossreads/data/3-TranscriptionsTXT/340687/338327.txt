January, 1917. Tuesday 23Usual - 1 pontoon. This morning between 12 & daylight very heavy almost like snow only frost. Very bitter cold day but perfectly clear day with sun which made no impression on the ice. One motor engine left out had its water jacket & circulating pipes cracked by the ice water and was utterly broken. Water freezed immediately when put out and ice about 2" thick everywhere. Considerable aerial activity on both sides & heard one Taube come down. Ingram got sack from C.R.R. & no more coal. Plenty of wood but won't burn all night. Slept very cold and glad to get up. Frost on inside of our dugout roof and curtain stiff with ice. Home at 2.30 Had a good bath in dugout.
