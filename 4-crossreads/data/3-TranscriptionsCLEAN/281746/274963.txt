 Oct. 25th The O.C. seems to be taking a special delight finding jobs for the men on board.  Most of them under the circumstances, unnecessary.  The thick mist has gathered all around and bare outlines of mountains can be seen very faintly. Hospital still full up.  Two pneumonia cases aboard.  Passed the head lights of Aden at 8 p.m. Away in front of us we can see the Red and Green lights of a hospital ship. 
 Oct. 26th Very hot this morning.  No land is to be seen.  Away in the distance we saw a whale spouting water through its nostrils. 
 Oct. 27th Passed the island of Socotra.  We have been sailing along side of it all day.  From our ship we could see no sign of habitation or inhabitants. Large numbers of porpoises are frolicking about in the water.
