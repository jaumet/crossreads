<p>was given by the Night Birds for the Bearers benefit. It was a good show. Colonel Shepherd made a speech welcoming the bearers back again. There is no doubt about it there is no place like home. The cheering was deafening when he finished his pleasant speech. A very enjoyable day.</p>
<p>April 8th 1917 Easter Sunday.<br/>A beautiful Spring day, sincerely hope this weather continues.  The twilight has started again &amp; is very pleasant. Took a stroll through the town, which is not half a mile away from the camp, &amp; noticed that it had increased in its population, the advance is the cause of this. In the evening I attended an impressive church service. On the following day we had another holiday. Inoculated to day. It is over twelve months since I was done previously. In the evening I paid a visit to the Anzac Concert Party, enjoyed the show very much. Bob Roberts acted &amp; sang splendidly. What a difference in the climate this Easter to that of last year, when we were camped in the desert.</p>
<p>I think you will agree with me when I say that we had an enjoyable Easter.</p>
