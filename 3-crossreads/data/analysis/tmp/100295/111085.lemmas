 heedless of the fact that his turn might be next instant . It 's a damnabl busi . I wake up in the morn as though I had pass through some weird wild dream . Its imposs to realis that men are just murder each other around you , that you are in the heart of a great battl . The fright roar of artilleri scream of shell though bring one to realiti , but even it pass off as soon as you leav the scene of battl , when I am back again in my cosi room at Steenvord , I quick forget the horribl do of the day after a good dinner , develop my plate then turn in with no more thought for the day , than if I had been at busi all the while , had just return from a late even work overtim !
