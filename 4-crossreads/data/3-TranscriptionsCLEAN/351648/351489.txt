My dear Babs
This will be only a wee note as I'm going like H, have got marching orders for France again & go over in a couple of hours time.  I had some difficulty in getting them to send me, but I succeeded eventually as its the only place to be with all this fighting but things look pretty black I fear, however when I get over -
Am feeling fit again & my leg does not trouble me much & I feel right enough for an Ambulance, I do hope I shan't crack up, it would be most ignominious.
