Things have been very quiet today The Germans haven’t been shelling at all. We did a fair amount and unfortunately killed a few of our own infantrymen with one of our shots. I saw Bob Prior today. He is only about 100yards away from me in another billet. Should have a good sleep tonight as Billy Hilder and I have found an old barn.

Very quiet again today. We have shot away several thousand rounds of ammunition cutting barb-wire. Wednesday – Gunner [indecipherable] wounded It was pure luck that I was away as our telephone room was blown in. Our Batty staff is now reduced from 16 to 7 as another man is suffering from shock. We kept up a tremendous bombardment all day and the 8th Brig charged at night and took 3 trenches but had to retire again to the German first line.

I am really writing this on Thursday as I hadn’t any time to do so yesterday. It was the most trying day of my life. In the morning Cpl Bosell, Jack Burk and myself went up into the first line trenches and struck a perfect hell.

The boys have been driven back again to their original positions again. We are kept very busy as we are so short handed. All our guns are out of action so we can’t shoot. They haven’t been hit at all but have been used too much and worn out. Had the unpleasant experience of carrying some of the bodies away to the Cemetery Poor Builing and Stevens were collected and never even made one man. I carried poor Dennie Le Brock.
