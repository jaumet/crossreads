<p>Village Chateau a fine big mansion. We have one of the back rooms which opens on to an old built up verandah covered in creepers.

Geo Veitch &amp; a couple more lads of the coy. came along and all enjoyed the good things. Made a large hole in Dorie's cake, it was great. The parcels were from home &amp; Dorie.</p>
