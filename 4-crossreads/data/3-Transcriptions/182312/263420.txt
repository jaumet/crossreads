<p>old London motor bus after the show and brought them up to our mess</p>
<p>for some morning tea.&nbsp; Our Commandant Major Vaughan (son of Canon</p>
<p>Vaughan) rang up their matron to ask could they stay to lunch, but</p>
<p>he got such a NO back over the telephone that he won&#39;t try it on any</p>
<p>more matrons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are having some baths erected for the officers here - typical-</p>
<p>ly English no shower, nor cold water tap all the water having to</p>
<p>come through a bath-heater.&nbsp; English folk still hold the idea that on</p>
<p>one hot bath per week is better than a shower or two every day.&nbsp; They</p>
<p>certainly look well on it, and I have not noticed them scratching</p>
<p>themselves much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The System of Forestation is very complete in France.&nbsp; As soon</p>
<p>as a piece of land has become worked for farming purposes it is im-</p>
<p>mediately planted with trees so that there is practically no waste</p>
<p>land in France, for what isn&#39;t growing crops for feeding stock is</p>
<p>growing trees.&nbsp; This must have been going on for many years past, as</p>
<p>you will frequently come across what on first sight would appear to</p>
<p>be virgin forest land, but on closer inspection it will be found that</p>
<p>the trees are in rows showing that the importance of Forestation</p>
<p>has long been recognised by the French people.&nbsp; All roads throughout</p>
<p>the country are bordered by trees - deciduous trees which give the</p>
<p>roads a chance of keeping dry in the winter and afford shade in the</p>
<p>summer.&nbsp; Australia could with benefit adopt both these ideas and</p>
<p>thus show a proper appreciation of the value of trees which at pres-</p>
<p>sent seems altogether lacking.</p>
