<p>Christmas Day</p>
<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>Heartily wishing you a Happy New Year and also all at Home.</p>
<p>The first fall of snow was last night and today the countryside around looks typically Christmas-like in this part of the world. &nbsp;But the weather has been very mild indeed and today is Good O.</p>
<p>I received some letters a few days back which I will reply to tomorrow. &nbsp;We&#39;ve had a rough time with the late arrivals of the trains, and we are a day behind even now.</p>
<p>Fondest love</p>
<p>James xxxxxx</p>
