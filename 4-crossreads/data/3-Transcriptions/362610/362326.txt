<p>Thursday 20 April 1916<br/>Very heavy rain was falling at &amp; before reveille, followed by a glorious burst of sunshine which put quite a fresh heart into one. Unfortunately it was merely a break &amp; at 8.30 when we marched out to the Training Ground the sky was quite obscured &amp; a little later the showers again commenced. During the morning was at a bombing class, followed by machine gun work. The afternoon was fine &amp; was spent in company work followed by a short walk on the beach with Prescott; after tea practised bomb throwing with stones as long as the light lasted. More N.Z. artillery going up N during the day. The height of the Spring tide was very noticeable.</p>
