25/8/17 Campagne
Morning parade held in the paddocks round the billets ? close order work bombing etc. Went round them and then to the Canal bank where our snipers and others were at work and the Engineers putting across a pontoon bridge. Barges drawn by horses passing. Spent the afternoon writing and reading. Davis left on Paris leave. The farmers busy on their harvesting operations and getting all the crops into the barns ? some of our men are helping them in this. The fumier and the stereotyped water pools are never missing from the farmyards. They use churns that are manipulated by means of treadles. The other day paid a visit to people at Dooley's billet ? quite a ceremony. All sat down while citron and wine was produced. Pledged healths after clinking and then ate cakes to our hearts content. Very kind and homely folk. The mistress has a bad time with her health consults our doctor.
