Up 7.15 am and had breakfast at 75th St. Caught bus to Penn Stn about  to 9 arriving at stn 9.15. After getting on train went for stroll along platform when an American Red Cross lady came to me and gave me a carton containing cigarettes and sweets etc. 
Train left 9.55 am. Travelled via Manhatten Transfer, Newark, Bound Brook, Pennington, Trenton Jct, Olney, Wayne Jct, and arrived Chestnut and 24th St Stn, Philadelphia at 12.30 pm. 
An Australian lady related to Stein of Fire Brigade, Melbourne, came and spoke to me, then I went to a Red Cross Lady on Stn and she gave me a note to a Red Cross Place at 1721 Arch St for lodgings for the night ? no charge being made. Then went for walk right down Chestnut St and to a W.C.C.S. Canteen at 1342 Arch St and had lunch. Then went to 1721 Arch St and fixed up about the bed ? everything being very nice and beautifully clean.
When coming into Philadelphia saw Baldwin Loco Works and on way crossed Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers. Streets here very narrow and only having single line trams. Bought picture p/cards 27 for 15 cents at W.C.C.S. 
After getting bed went for stroll around the different business streets and also looked over the Pennsylvania and Reading Market St terminal. These two stations, also Chestnut St, have no raised platforms, only a pavement about 9 inches high alongside the rails. Pennsylvania lines
