<p>faintest idea what the Battle of Posieres was like.  Under all that shelling there was fighting going on, machine guns telling out their toll, snipers adding to their bag, men shouting to their pals not a yard away.<br/>Poor battered figures wearily dragging themselves through the shell-holes<br/>back to safety.  Stretcher-bearers working at top pressure.  Parties carrying ammunition, bombs, water, food, it has all got to go on even in the midst of the thickest fighting.<br/>Back along the road we came passing under the leaning statue of the Church in Albert.  Beneath the eyes of that figure have passed thousands of soldiers pouring into the Battle of the Somme some pass twice, once forward and once coming back from the gates of Hell, some pass that second time beaten and torn in an ambulance car, some plod wearily out too tired to realise</p>
