<p>Am sending home tomorrow by one of our chaps being sent back to Australia on account of old age, a sketch that was made of me about 3 weeks ago by a Frenchman, a celebrated Statuaire from Paris. This gent, M. Cornille Theunisson was staying at Wimereux with his wife &amp; family &amp; I met them one day on Wimereux beach. I saw quite a lot of them before they went back to Paris &amp; old man Theunisson did a sketch of me before he went- He is not an artist but a statuaire &amp; has done very fine work from the photos he proudly showed me. I noticed he wore the ribbon of the legion of Honour. (98)<br/>Sunday 8th Oct 1916 (7.15pm):<br/>This afternoon I have been out to Hardelot &ndash; a seaside resort 15 kilometres from Boulogne by tram. The run out takes over an hour &amp; I had to change</p>
