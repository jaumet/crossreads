<p>Lieut Les. Wharton M.C. A.F.C. late of the old 2nd Battalion.<br/>He also told us of a riot which occurred at the Base at Le Havre whilst he was passing through. It appears that the food issued to the men became considerably short for two or three days on end in the English Artillery Camp. The men therefore decided to make a stir as complaints were unheeded or had no material effect. They broke into the Officers Mess first of all put the officers to rout and passed the whisky etc over the counter to their mates until it has all disappeared.<br/>The officer <strike>on that occasion</strike> rushed away to a safe place</p>
