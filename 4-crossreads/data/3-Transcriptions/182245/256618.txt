<p>APRIL 1917</p>
<p>13 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; fairly warm. Got word</p>
<p>in morning we were moving</p>
<p>out of the position at midday</p>
<p>&amp; we had to have everything</p>
<p>packed ready. We moved</p>
<p>off at about 3 pm &amp; went</p>
<p>round through Steenwerck</p>
<p>to some waggon lines</p>
<p>about a mile the other side</p>
<p>Our gun team stayed behind</p>
<p>&amp; brought the gun on later</p>
<p>We are on our way down</p>
<p>to S<sup>t</sup> Omer, for some open</p>
<p>fighting training I think.</p>
<p>I was on picket at night.</p>
<p>We left a very good home</p>
<p>when we left &quot;Jesus Farm&quot;.</p>
