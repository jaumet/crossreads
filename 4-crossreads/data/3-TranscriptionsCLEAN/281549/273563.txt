  
 held as usual in the morning & in the afternoon the ships sports were started such as boxing tug-o-war, etc-etc, & were continued until the afternoon of the 25th Oct when they were stopped owing to heavy rain. 
 I attended Church Parade (22nd) & for the rest of the day I wrote letters home and am going to post them at Durban S.Africa when we arrive. 
 On the night of the 25th October we ran right into a severe thunderstorm, The rain pored down for two hours & the lightening was very bright.  The following day Thursday October 26th we anchored outside Durban harbour S.Africa at 3 am in the morning. At daylight when I came on deck I was very surprised to see that we were at anchor. The first glimpse of land after not seeing it for about a week was very pleasing indeed. 
 At about 7.30am we weighed anchor & proceeded in through the heads & we soon moored at the wharf. The Newzealand troopship S.S.Devon  N.Z.64 passed by as we were entering harbour, she had a large crowd of men on board & was bound for the same destination as myself Vis - Plymouth England
