[Friday 8 September 1916]
This Hospital is in the densest of London.[indecipherable]There are over 2,500 Patients here 24 Officers in my ward alone.Flowers are very beautiful Carnations like [indecipherable] Crysanths & Roses & of course all the girls are the same with rosy cheeks so different to Egypt's languor & big brown eyes but I like the sun.Laura's views are quite English now & I don't think she will ever go to the Colonies again.Sorry to hear May broke her nose poor old girl she has no luck.Went Pay Office more like a Harem the No. of girls employed there & good lookers too.  I can understand what a little bit of DRESDEN CHINA you must have been as a girl.
