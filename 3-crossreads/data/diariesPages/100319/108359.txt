6/9/18 Cappy
A quiet day in bivouacs on the Canal bank with a pleasant warm sun and gentle breeze. Just the sort of day to do the troops a lot of good and they sat in the sun cleaning up. Went and saw James for a yarn and after lunch went to Bde HQ where we had a conference and afternoon tea with the General. The whole Division is concentrated round here just now. Cappy is knocked about and scarcely a whole house standing. Bde HQ is in the old Quarry ? the firing line of a few days ago. 
Returned to a busy evening after mess. Major Dr Drummond called for a yarn and brought a dentist friend with him. We refought Gallipoli and other battles. Charlesworth salvaged one old copper and had a hot bath prepared for me.
