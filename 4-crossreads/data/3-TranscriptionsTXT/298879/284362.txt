April 1915Sunday 18Our section had to mount guard at 9.30 AM. Church Parade C. of E.. Weather dull but very calm. Projected boat trip to Queen Elizabeth with our Platoon Commander (Lieut Dawson) abandoned
Monday 19Beautiful fine weather. Scarcely a ripple on the water. Had a good swim overboard. Water lovely. Another Aust Mail in. Had a grand little tour around the Queen Elizabeth & other warships. We went on board the Prince of Wales & were shown the works of the 12" guns. The charge is fired by a small cap or cartridge. A sailor put one in & I fired it.   The sailors on the ships are real sports and very obliging
