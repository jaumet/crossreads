So we had to turn to and take down all the tents and load them on the waggons, besides all the stores from the G.M.  Then we dismantled the latrines and set fire to them, put all the stuff that was not required on the incinerator and left the ground quite clear, by this time it was mid-night. We then had some tea and a smoke and put all our gear on and left Hog's Back Hill at about 1 a.m. The waggons all were well loaded, and only had 2 horse teams instead of 4, and as they kept getting stuck in the loose sand, Maj.
