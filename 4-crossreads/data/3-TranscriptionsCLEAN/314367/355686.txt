  
 This Friday aftn Fitz & I took the skiff & went dynamiting fish on our own - We pulled pair oar alternately - Fitz got the cartridges & fuse ready - Then he found he had forgot the matches - I said - Let's go to that German's house & get some - He said - Wd you mind going & asking? I had but my pyjamas on & said - certainly - but you must lend me your shoes - off I went - Saw German got matches & talked to him 3 very nice flaxen haired children - I told him I was a Doctor & out fishing - The two little ones took each a hand & back we went to our boat - I kissed both of them - Charming little things - no shyness. They spoke English - It was Fitz & my first time dynamiting on our own - Fitz said if one exploded near me what wd happen? I said your head wd probably be blown off badly - He was a bit nervous - The great idea I said is not to hang on when once the fuse is lit but to get rid of the thing in the middle of a shoal of fish - Well I pulled & we saw a shoal & Fitz dipped in - Two blanky matches failed but the 3rd time the fuse lit & Fitz chucked it.
