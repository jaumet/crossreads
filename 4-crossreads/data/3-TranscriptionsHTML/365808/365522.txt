<p>-2-<br/>Keith Ferguson is now convalescent and able to walk about and go out visiting. I had a letter from him the other day and he seemed to be in pretty good spirits. I also received a letter from Keith. He was in hospital with influenza. I had written to him advising him to stop in England and try to get into a school &ndash; at any rate to get some sort of base job whilst I am over here and I am glad to say that he recognises the sense of this and is going to do his best for a school. Holmes wrote him a very nice letter and advised him to come over to the 17 th as Basil is now second in command. I don't know whether this would be too good but that's how it stands.<br/>Hoping you are all well at home and that your duties are more congenial.<br/>With much love,<br/>Bert.</p>
