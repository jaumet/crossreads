  
 Saw Jack Howell about 10 days ago.   he came down to look me up he looks well, but is like myself and all the rest just about - fed up - but I fancy everyone is feeling that way.   At present we are amongst the Poplars again and can go swimming every day when not on parade, we wanted a wash when we arrived here I had not had one for quite a week so you can guess it did not take us long to get into the River when we arrived.  we had to fix up shelters for ourselves so three of us set to work and cut a good pile of reeds to roof our Bivouac then I set to work and thatched it with grass I think it will keep the rain out, but still I dont want any rain to come along, to show whether I'm right or wrong.   Had a couple of letters from Mrs. Horton a couple of weeks back   Mr H. had a touch of the new flu Edgar was not very well, and Elsie had a bad cold, so I guess the Poor little woman just about had her hands full.   She tries hard not to worry about Harold, but finds it very hard.   The parcel with tin of Tabac, Sugr etc arrived O.K. and was very much enjoyed by self and a couple of mates, we still have a little of the Sugar and some of the Tabac which was in first class condition and very welcome, as the canteen was out of decent smoking Tabac and I was trying everywhere to get something worth smoking = it is very hard sometimes to get a good Tabacco here for a great many of the chaps mixtures are not even decent imitations.   I hope the flower seeds are allright,   The Cornflowers, Poppies etc are out in full bloom here but there are not so many as when we were in this area last,   There are a few white marguerite seeds in the packet I sent, but I do not know whether they were much good.
