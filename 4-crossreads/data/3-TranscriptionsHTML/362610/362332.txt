<p>Wednesday 26 April 1916<br/>Another glorious Spring day, quite warm in the sun. Last night had a most exciting time on a/c of a Zeppelin raid. Just after midnight was dimly conscious of 3 explosions followed by Prescott saying "There are anti-aircraft guns!" At once hopped outside into the starry night, several other officers also appearing. The distant hum of the engines could clearly be heard &amp; there at an enormous altitude we could distinguish the cigar-shaped ship. It was fearfully uncanny to see it manoeuvre &amp; come, at it seemed, exactly overhead, then a whiz of a descending bomb was verified by a tiny streak of light as it dropped, ending by a blaze of light when it landed. The alarm was sounded in Etaples, trains stopped, afterwards running thro' in a bunch. We watched the airship disappear in the direction of England &amp; then went to bed again.<br/>In the morning we examined the hole where in the estuary abt. 300 yds. from us the incendiary bomb had struck. Another dropped at No. 26 Hospital &amp; others elsewhere, but no serious damage was apparently done. Most of the morning was at the dentist's, &amp; in the afternoon company work, football &amp; a swim (?) in the stream. A lot more mail in but only one (G.H.) for me. A French (?) aeroplane carrying lights patrolling the stretch from here to Boulogne during the night.</p>
