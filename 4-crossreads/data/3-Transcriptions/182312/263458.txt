<p>population of Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey,are now one single</p>
<p>controlled mass which will be worked to the last ounce of energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WE MUST DO THE SAME.&nbsp; France has already done her share of</p>
<p>it and is ready, and we owe it to her to get a move on ourselves. Amongst</p>
<p>the Allies, France has borne the major brunt of the fighting and, I say</p>
<p>it without fear of contradiction, they are the master soldiers of this</p>
<p>war.&nbsp; Their leadership, their staff work, their organisation and their</p>
<p>fighting qualities are the admiration of all eyes.&nbsp; Their attacks show</p>
<p>genius right from the time of their inception until the objective has</p>
<p>been taken and consolidated.&nbsp; Under General Nivelle they have brought</p>
<p>the present day type of warfare toa fine art and with the minimum of</p>
<p>losses to themselves.&nbsp; We ourselves have done wonders with our Armies</p>
<p>in France and Flanders, specially as we never prided ourselves on being</p>
<p>a military nation, nevertheless the French held practically the whole</p>
<p>line until such time as we got our Armies together.&nbsp; True we had a</p>
<p>flutter in Gallipoli, Mesopotamia and Salonica, but for the first 18</p>
<p>months of the war we held no more than 50 miles on the Western Front.</p>
<p>We must take over more of it next year, and we must set out house in</p>
<p>order at home.&nbsp; A year ago we scoffed at Germany with her bread tickets</p>
<p>and meatless days and now we admit the wisdom of the scheme and adopt</p>
<p>them ourselves.&nbsp; Germany foresaw it and acted, we in our pride waited</p>
<p>until we felt the pinch.&nbsp; Two years ago we had the chance to blockade</p>
<p>Germany and starve her out but we did it in a half hearted sort of</p>
<p>fashion and then when the blockade was tightened up it was too late,</p>
<p>Germany had made other arrangements and was securing the bulk of her</p>
<p>supplies locally and from occupied territories.&nbsp; Now we find her</p>
<p>blockading US by means of super submarines operating on the trade routes</p>
<p>It is idle to deny the Germans&#39; cleverness and thoroughness:&nbsp; they are</p>
<p>out to win this war and they have shown us that they will descend to</p>
<p>any depths to do it.&nbsp; To beat them we (and the war is principally</p>
