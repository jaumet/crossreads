<p>moment then in a loud voice calls out "Suffragettes" and runs for his life.<br/>We reach Dublin at midnight so tired- and I rise early to take the 1st train for Belfast &amp; discover there is not one until evening &ndash; perforce have to wait. It's the custom in Dublin that the first thing a visitor should do is to drive through Dublin and [indecipherable] pack in a jaunting car. So to be in the fashion we do it. Our driver as usual points out the places of interest on the way. The Rotunda Hospital &ndash; Cathedrals etc. Then some distance ahead towering in white is the memorial to Daniel O'Connell &amp; presently stopping at a gate almost opposite we are asked to get out. I ask what place it is &amp; why. "Oh" says the driver "This is the cemetery and I have orders to leave you here for &frac14; of and hour." I wasn't sorry for it's the most beautiful cemetery I have seen and with truth it can well be the people's pride &ndash; One could spend a day there &ndash; the magnificent statuary &ndash; the lovely lawn &amp; walks and cypress trees. However Daniel O'Connell M is the chief attraction &ndash; a man standing near asks if we would like to go down and see the Coffin. To the left of the entrance is buried D G'C's faithful friend and fellow prisoner 'Thomas Steele" &amp; the words inscribed 'Love is stronger than death'. We go down some steps  into the vault &ndash; are asked to touch the Coffin &amp; shown the Coffin of DO'C family. On the Wall is written 'My heart to Rome My body to Ireland, My soul to Heaven. The liberator of his country.<br/>Phoenix Park is beautiful (7 miles) the bud trees &amp; herds of red deer. We see the Lord Lieutenant's Lodge. Guinesses Brewery- the Royal Chapel &ndash; and are soon in Sackville St. 'Once Dublin's pride' but now in a deplorable state owing to the rebellion. I asked our driver what had become of the Sinn Feiners. He said of course some were in prison</p>
