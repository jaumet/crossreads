usual there was more cheering. Altogether we were 3 nights & two days in the train & finally we were landed at our destination at about 5 am in the morning at a place called "Eklingham" & marched to a place called "Renescure"
In HospitalAfter we had stayed in "Renescure" for 3 weeks we made a move up towards the line & went into the line at a place called Paten -Hall. the following day I became very sick & was sent to No.7 General Hospital. with mumps. I was very Crook for a few days.  I came down here on the 21 April.
On the 12th May I was discharged from Hospital & set out to join up my unit which I did not reach until 4 days afterwards & finally found them at a place call "Fleuabere" I can tell you I was very pleased to see all the boys again they were out of the line & in supports.
30.5.16 on the evening of the 18.5.16 I got a terrible shock when they came & told me to get ready to go on 7 day leave to London.
