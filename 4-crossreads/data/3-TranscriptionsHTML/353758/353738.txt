<p>Have got poisoned hands &ndash; very sore &ndash; our Battallion got some re-enforcements.</p>
<p>8/5/15<br/>Came back to our old trenches very cold at night without overcoats</p>
<p>9/5/15<br/>Sunday &ndash; Comparatively quiet but snipers got several men in our part of the Trenches and the Turkd dropped in some shells which killed or wounded a few &ndash; in Trenches</p>
