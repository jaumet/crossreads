<p>Wednesday, 25th November, 1914<br/>Arrived in Aden about 4 p.m. only to learn we would leave again next morning, without going right inside.  All our other boats were there &amp; the N.Z. also a lot of empty Indian transports returning home.  The outside view of Aden is anything but picturesque just bare rugged islands of rock.  We received a budget of war news to-day that was not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Thursday, 26th November, 1914<br/>Left Aden about 6 a.m. all complete with our full fleet but only the Hampshire as our escort.  All day land was visible, we were in the Red Sea now &amp; Arabia on one side Africa on the other.  A lot more Indian Transports passed one numbered 125 showing what a lot of boats were in the fleet.  Returning home men are being discharged from hospital daily.  There is a strange sickness on board that no one knows the origin.  It leaves the men with a head ache &amp; loss of appetite.</p>
