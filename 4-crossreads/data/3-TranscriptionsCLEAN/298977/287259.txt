 at all delivered lately, our shifting about so much has upset all arrangements I suppose, but hope to get it shortly, together with several from Home, which are getting behind.  The papers you are sending are coming along pretty regularly. - So you still have the Mitchell on hand? - the sale couldn't have come off. 
 You say the Military are commandeering all the Rabbit-skins to make hats for us.  Don't know what they do with the hats when they are made.  Can't get one anyhow here and I've worn an ordinary Tommies Cap for the last 6 months, so I'm afraid I'll lose all my glory when I do get to England. 
 What do you think of our latest Trench Comfort?  They've issued each Gun team with a Primus Stove!  This is of course no good for warming the place up, but as we have to do our own cooking, and are not allowed to light fires for fear the smoke would give our position away, it comes in jolly handy.  It will take a lot of things like this to enable us to see the Winter through, if we have to put it in here.  It's cold enough now, and it hasn't even thought of starting yet. 
 So our photos were in the Pastoralists Review? - I'll bet that issue was sold out in a hurry.  Think I mentioned before that I had had a yarn to the Colonel. 
 Hope Mr. Cizzio has lost the "itis" whatever it was, ere this, and that you are keeping well and free from colds. 
 Kindest regards to all in the Office and love to All at "Broughlea", and any of my stray girls you might come across. 
 Yours loving Son, Roy.
