 TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1919. 
 Fine in morning but came on 
 to rain after midday & rained 
 pretty steadily all night. Had 
 43 points. Drove down to Walhallow 
 in morning & saw Wyburn at 
 the saw mill & then over to 
 Spring Ridge to see Laurence 
 but he was away. Down in 
 the Boundary in afternoon. 
 It was Linda's birthday.
