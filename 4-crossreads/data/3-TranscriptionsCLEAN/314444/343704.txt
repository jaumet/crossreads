 Dearest Mother & Father, A few lines to let you know I am well and feeling tip top. I recieved your letter dated 15th May & glad to hear you were all well. My word you done well at your stall. I am enclosing some cards etc I got from the prisoner I took. I brought him back myself. It took us over an hour to get back. The shell fire & machine guns were so hot Gee whiz it was hot The joker I brought back was winged in the hand. I sent you a cutting giving an account of the raid The distance was about 450 yds so you see we had some distance to go. Keep the enclosed as I want them for souvineers. I can't tell you what we did while in their trenches but there was no mercy shown to them. I have not seen any of the boys yet that is ones I know. Don't worry, I will see it through. I was quite close to Miss Williams friend when he was hit The Latest report is that he is doing well. Hoping you are all well best wishes & love 
 Your loving Son
