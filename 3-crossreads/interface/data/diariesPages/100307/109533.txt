Paris
3/3/17
Garb consists of a small black felt hat lined in white. This imparts a virginal air and looks awfully neat ? usual crepe streamers are attached. Pulled into Paris running in quickly among factories and alighted on a crowded platform of a big station. A picturesque crowd Matelots, dirty soldiers from the trenches, smart ones who had never been there, Belgian soldiers, gold laced officers, zouaves, turcos, civilians. Slowly pushed on towards a barrier where an MP handed out a little paper of instructions.
Then took a taxi (after some fruitless arguments with one of those filthy greasy beings, the bulbous nosed, vinous Paris "cocher" with his dirty cab. A good distance up to the Hotel Continental but the fare charged was only 2/3 ? different to London.
Some British officers about. Entered the hotel and an officious elderly English speaking porter showed me to my room. Having closed the door he said that he was available as a guide ? he knew all the good places and wished me to put my programme in his hands.
