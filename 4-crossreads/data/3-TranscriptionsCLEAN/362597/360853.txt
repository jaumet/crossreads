that we have. Several of the Doctors came to our smoko & cut the dance out.
We were going to throw "Nikko Maru" - you know our captain that is no good - into the bath but he hid himself. We could not find Dave Williams for a long time. At last Horrie Norton found him in a dark corner downstairs & when Horrie spoke to him Dave said "Are you looking for me". They gave him a minute to get undressed & carried him right along the deck. I sneaked away & got my swimming costume on. So ended "a perfect day".
We are getting into warm weather now but we still get a cool breeze.
