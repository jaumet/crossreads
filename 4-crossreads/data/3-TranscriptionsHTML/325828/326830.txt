<p>My dearest Father,</p>
<p>I must thank you for your letter of 9th inst to hand by to-night's mail.</p>
<p>I am glad to be able to report that both of my legs are progressing very favorably.  As I said in my last letter, I was taking salts but they did not seem to be doing me much good so I got some blood tonic viz "Hot Springs Blood Remedy" which I had recommended to me &amp; which is doing me good, for all my sores are healing up quickly.  I am really unable to bathe it 3 times a day for we have our dinner over at the paddock, &amp; don't come home at all once we leave of a morning.  Even so, even though I'm up at &frac12; past 4 I haven't time to bathe it of a morning but I attend to it at night.  The sore on the old place was the size of a half-crown when I last wrote,   <strike>&amp;</strike>   but has been getting smaller &amp; smaller until now it is about a 3d. piece size.  The other night when I put bluestone on the other leg it gave me such a bad time of it when I was in bed that I had to get up &amp; wash it off, &amp; then put a bate's salve on it before I could get any relief.  Really, Father, that Bate's Salve is marvellous stuff.  It acts much the same way as antiflo:- put it on a piece of rag hot, (it looks like treacle) &amp; it draws any foreign matter out &amp; heals at the same</p>
