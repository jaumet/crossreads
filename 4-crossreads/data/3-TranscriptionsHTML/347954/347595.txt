<p>Today I have been wondering at the silence shown by the enemy, notwithstanding most stinging fire from our various guns &amp; I think I remarked a few pages back at the various guessing by our corp as to the ultimate result.  It came tonight &amp; rather briskly.  A note was thrust into one of the trenches presumedly by their aeroplane &amp; it called us some unwholesome names &amp; said we were going to be pushed over into the sea.<br/>It transpires that their reserves (2 divisions) were rushed across &amp; thrown at our trenches "en masse".  Their artillery had been silent throughout the whole day &amp; for a good cause.  Everyone of their guns had been changed &amp; planted afresh.  Whilst awaiting orders for our usual night round we received a most awful surprise &ndash; a concussion shell broke through our excellent shelter &amp; took a dive, as we all did, into the earth.  From then, a little before 7 p.m. until 8 p.m. they went at it like hell let loose, &amp; it must not be supposed our guns were idle;  they were doing their part only we couldn't see the result of their fire.  All throughout the night (19/5/15) the Turks kept coming up &amp; were mown down, again &amp; again, &amp; considering all, we lost comparatively few men from their rifle fire.  At times it was necessary to leave the trenches &amp; rush them back otherwise they would have been too close to be healthy but our men worked without orders with the bayonet &amp; it soon told on these mass rushes.
