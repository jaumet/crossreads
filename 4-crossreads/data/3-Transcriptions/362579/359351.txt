<p>Dorothy   &amp;  Annie Bell had to put in for their Leave, so they cannot wait for me. Hard-luck we did want to have it together.</p>
<p>Hope we are not separated for long. It was great us being together   &amp;  now feel so lonely away from Dorothy.</p>
<p>It was very close   &amp;  hot all  day   &amp;  now it is raining heavily. Suppose we shall soon get the rain   &amp;  mud again. I hate the thought of it. Hope to get to London for footwear before Winter.</p>
