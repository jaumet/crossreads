<p>June 16<br/>Mass was being celebrated by a tall green and gold caped Priest at the High Altar &ndash; a great all golden altar, with golden candles and golden flames.  It is a beautiful Altar, and a beautiful church.</p>
<p>But St. Omer is a wondering city:  her people are silent and they hear always the noise of night planes, and the compacted crashes of hellish bombs, a great many of the houses and shops are blind dead places, and Lorries and ambulance cars make nearly all the traffic.</p>
<p>Back at Cassel at 6, and a tea at the tea shop where they sell all the food control prohibits &ndash; pastry, preserved fruits, chocolate and tea.</p>
<p>A slow slow lazying from Cassel to H.Q., reading in a field "Exiles" and lying watching the clouds and the sun sinking behind Cassel.  Back at H.Q. the two black windows flanking the hut door, were the black eyes of a vicious gloating monster.</p>
<p>Now a half moon, whiter than silver, dazzling in a deep luminous night blue sky, over by Strazeele sudden gold star flashes and silence all about us.  Ends a day enjoyed and lived through, of sudden impulses and fresh impressions following one upon the other.</p>
<p>"Day that I loved, day that I loved, the night is here."</p>
<p>June 17<br/>213.<br/>From T.B.C. notification of Waugh's "Resentment" being available, so wrote for it, also from them six Venus Pencils.</p>
<p>Tonight the first of "The Elizabethan Playhouse" essays read, interesting and full of facination, must read it well and fully.</p>
<p>With Andy C. to farmhouse, and a supper of <strike>Eggs</strike> Chips.</p>
<p>Early this morning heavy shrapnelling about Sylvestre Cappel.</p>
