<p>APRIL 1917</p>
<p>19 THURSDAY</p>
<p>Fine, but dull &amp; cloudy all</p>
<p>day. Cleaning harness ect in</p>
<p>morning &amp; at dinner time</p>
<p>we were told we were moving</p>
<p>again. We packed up &amp; moved</p>
<p>off from Quesques about 3 pm</p>
<p>&amp; went about six kilometers</p>
<p>on through Selles to a place</p>
<p>called Brunembert where we</p>
<p>picketed our horses under</p>
<p>cover in an old brick kiln</p>
<p>Its not a bad joint but not</p>
<p>as good as some I have been</p>
<p>in. I was on picket at</p>
<p>night.</p>
