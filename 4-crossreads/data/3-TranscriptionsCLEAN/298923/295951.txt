  
 12 October 1918 Saturday Move on to  Es Salt  Ain Hennar today feeling better but weak- Moved on by Motor Ambulance- the driver on arriving here whispered in my ear "Any chance of giving" "me your Revolver" ?  It shows what chance an insensible patient would have to keep his Kit- I am not condeming all- Muscular injection by Hyperdermic syringe of Quinine well pushed in is the thing-
