<p>much obliged.  I love your yarns also the Boss', I fairly yelled at his letter.</p>
<p>Of course I think you should hang on to him &amp; keep him out there, really this business would drive him dilly, I mean the military methods &amp;c.  As things are its much better for him to be running Tog &amp; Telleraga &amp; growing wool &amp;c. than getting his soul case worried out here.  And the climate is awful.  I shall be that glad to get back to Australia.  I just shrieked over your account of the Blind Man's Buff &amp; Miss Royds.  I'd love to have been there although I really think I'm getting too ancient for such pranks.</p>
<p>You would love our Colonel, he's all right, quite young &amp; very smart.  Well I must flee.  I saw Flossie Heller the other day, oh he's a fast young dog.  I saw Duncan in the distance too, he looks so well &amp; the men adore him.  Tell Mac &amp; The Boss I'll write soon.</p>
<p>Much love to all,<br/>Wilkie</p>
