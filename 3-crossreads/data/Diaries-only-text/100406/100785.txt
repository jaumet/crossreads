Crane for today at any rate giving us a lot of unnecessary work overtime. They have notes here of all values from one Halfpenny upwards. Some are issued by village Syndicates, these latter look like Bus tickets but are about 1" x 1" in size.

Had another afternoon as Crane Driver. Our Tucker here is somewhat scanty even now. It seems that Fritz blew up bridges, Railways Roads to such an extent that it is very difficult to get the food up. The people here on the French side of the Frontier haven't a darn thing. But if one walks up the street about a K.M. or 2 (on the Belgian side of the Frontier) one finds Estaminets open, Fair Beer at  the French price for Bad Beer. Plenty of Lollies, mechanical Pianos Dancing in the Estaminets (Mdmlles too). The French tell me they can't get even Bad Beer. A Kgrmme. of coffee costs 38 Francs, no sugar, no anything. But the Belgians seem to have plenty. I?d like to know why I weighed 11 stone today.

Among the gear salvaged are a number of small Generators direct connected to what looks like a small mech. motor with an interrupting device in the Generator circuit. I believe these are Dynamos for small wireless sets. They are wound up by a crank then let go like a clockwork toy. I will probably have more to say about them later on. One fair sized Dynamo here has Graphite Brushes.
