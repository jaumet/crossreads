 January 1917 Monday 1 Went down to beach. Bombed by Taubes 3 shells fell close to me into the sea. Others went into a palmgrove. 13 casualties among British troops. Terrific wind blowing. Had the coldest swim I ever had. Drew rations at the dump and loaded up the pack camels Pinched some fowls so had poultry for dinner. 
 Tuesday 2 Nothing doing. very squally and showery. Another visit from Taubes but they did not drop any bombs
