 a good night 's work told me to turn in for the rest of the night , it was not much use turn in for my dugout was sop wet I was even in a wors state for I was cover from head to foot with mud wet to the skin , but the boy had some nice hot cocoa wait for me this help to thaw me , there is one thing we get now in the trench that is the littl " Tommi cooker " , they are made of paffarin wax are put up in littl tin , they light instant produc no smoke , the " Australian Comfort Fund " send them to us . This morn when I went round for the boy rum I drew a blank for the Q.M. sent a bottl of whale oil instead how they roar when I told them did n't they perform , reckon the head had drunk it etc
