The lower span measures over 100 ft while the topmast is 60 ft. When finished this should give good results. So far we have been unfortunate in our wireless. The operators occasionally pick up faint messages but their own waves apparently lose themselves in space.Thurs & Fri 22nd & 23rd : Details of ordinary routine are irksome, hence I will pass them over. On Thursday we towed the "Penguin" out to Gragat Island and established the Examination Anchorage.Saturday 1.45 am : I have lain awake half the night. Although the new wireless mast is not yet completed the aerials were hoisted up as far as possible & at last we have good results. I have just been over to the operator's room & read an ethergram received from Port Moresby. Of course the news could not be bottled up & the whole of the Officer's Mess crowded round in their pyjamas to peruse our first message from the outside world. We are looking forward to something even better.9.30 pm : No further messages were received last night, but we are still very sanguine.This afternoon a sports meeting was held by the garrison troops and was a great success. The events which excited the greatest interest were the High Jump (won by Private Spanks), Relay Race (won by E C) & 1/2 mile running championship (won by A.B. King, Naval Reserve). The whole of the Garrison turned out and many of the Natives & German Residents attended.Sunday 25 : Usual Sunday Routine; church parade
