<p>arrived to relieve us that night the mud &amp; slush was knee deep everywhere &amp; all the dugouts &amp; shelters had fallen in with the rain. After we were relieved we had a very strenuous walk back to an old factory at Ypres where we put in the night with a big fire &amp; drying our cloths etc &amp; next morning the 11th we marched tired &amp; worn out to Halifax camp some three miles away where we were able to get a necessary rest sleep etc. Two days later we set off on the march having our packs carried &amp; went as far as Barthen to billets. Next morning the 14th I was detailed off with a train party &amp; marched to Godesvelde Stn where after waiting for a while we entrained &amp; went as far as Eblingham where we disentrained &amp; marched to Le Nieppe &amp; stayed the night in tents. Next day we were again on the track &amp; marched as far as Heuringham &amp; had a good rest. Next morning the 16th we marched to Assingham where we stayed two days billeted in an old paper mill which was driven by a stream. Our next moved was on the 18th when we marched to Senlis &amp; next day we again set out &amp; completed the march &amp; put up at billets at Halingham about 10 mils out of Boulougne. Next day we were paid &amp; I was given six hours leave to Boulougne where I had a very decent time &amp; arrived</p>
