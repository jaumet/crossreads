Our turn at trench sappingWork the four platoons in 4 reliefs during the day.This blooming navvy work was something we never bargained for but it is as necessary as eating   &  nobody ever complains

We are awakened early in the morning   &  told to get our breakfast as we would be burying the dead all day.A successful Armistice having been arranged from 8 am to 4 pm.The job is absolutely awful. The corpses having been exposed to sun   &  rain for nearly a month   &  when we attempted to move them they fell to piecesIt was simply gastly searching them for papers.   &  Identification discsWe get an issue of rum when the job is done.R.I.P.
