results of the furious bombardment  attack last Saturday  Sunday it is very gratifying seeing that the Allies have advanced about 2 to 3 miles on a 30 mile front, recapturing several villages  towns taking (8500 prisoners) British 3500, French 5000.This is the start of the finish  every man here seems to think that before long the Germans will be on the backward grade.The French people are very good to Australians  it is stated in leading Parisian papers that they take it as an honour that we are here. It has also bucked the Francais Soldats up quite a lot.Heavy Thunderstorm raging also Artillery bombardment we cannot hear one another speaking.
