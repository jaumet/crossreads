 E Hut St Thomas' Hospital Westminster London 23.9.1915 Dear Mother, As you will see I am in London in one of the best hospitals in England.  I can walk a little with a stick instead of crutches now   &amp; expect to go to the convalescent home in about a week.  Had a very nice letter from Aunt Bell a day or two ago  &amp; expect to go   &amp; stay with them for a few days later on .  I have not had any letters since I left Malta &ndash; it is rather awkward when I keep moving from place to place to get them as they keep following me about. I went for a trip in a motor boat about 10 miles down the Thames   &amp; found it very interesting from here down to Woolwich.  I suppose you have heard Norman was wounded in the hand   &amp; has had sunstroke but is leaving Egypt again for the front.  I heard it from Aunt Bell so I suppose she means Norman Sherwin.  This Hospital is right opposite Parliament House (across the river)
