Thurs 11thStill on light duties although I feel well enough for anything;  another windy, dusty day; No parade for the troops, some of the men from the troops were told off this morning to learn signalling but I think they are starting too late to do much good at it;  Went to Luna Park after tea to witness some boxing contest, the principal event being between an Irish ex-champion welter weight of Ireland & a lad from the South Australian Light Horse;  It was a good fight & the Irishman won in the third round;  Plush was with me & we had a feed at the New Zealand Cafe
