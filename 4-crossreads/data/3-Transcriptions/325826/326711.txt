<p>New York Pension&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. 8.2.16<br/>The Square<br/>Alexandria.<br/>1.1.16<br/>My own dear Home Folks,<br/>Your Arabic daughter finds herself settled comfortably in her new home but is nearly starving for her dinner.  So far that meal has always been served in this heathen country at 8 o'clock &amp; I had been watching for that hour here also, but alas, it is twenty past eight now &amp; I suppose the designed hour must be 8.30 for assuredly I haven't missed it as the cook was very busy in the kitchen just now when I sauntered past &amp; also the tables in the dejeuner room are all ready set.  Don't be alarmed I shall not starve for I had afternoon tea at the Y.W.C.A. it is of necessity a regular meal here.  When I come home I shall be expecting dinner when you are thinking of going to bed, or else if you insist on my dining at your respectable hour I shall be waking up in the night &amp; coming down to cook fish &amp; a joint &amp; some vegetables at the very least.<br/>I think I told you that the proprietress here is a little French lady who only seems to know about 6 English words.  I have a skimpy sort of dictionary- French-English but Rid &amp; I were out looking for a better one this afternoon only most of the shops were shut being New Year's Day.  The one I have is one that was prepared for the soldiers &amp; is mostly a military affair but will help.</p>
