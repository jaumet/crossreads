Monday 20 August 1917
HospitalBathed again but very rough. I have just applied for leave to England but do not think for one moment that I will get it still if reprised it will be no harm in applying and it will be a start, as the constant applying is the only method. I did not open PARCELS but sent by Post to the Regiment to save KIT space & they will be there on my arrival & cost nothing to send.
