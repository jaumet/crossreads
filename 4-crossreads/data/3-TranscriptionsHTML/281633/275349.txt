<p>us, thinking they are making their meaning clearer that way.</p>
<p>Saturday 18-1-19<br/>I took a walk over to the fort just outside Marpent yesterday.  It was rather badly knocked about in 1914.  There was nothing striking about it, everything underground of course.  Received our Xmas Parcels from the Comforts funds last night.  Mine came from Thebarton Infants School, Soustralia (Miss Hamence School mistress) it contained notes from James Colin, 4 Huntriss St., Torrensville, S.A., Billy McAloney, 14 East Street, Torrensville, Eileen Watson, no address.  The School is located on the Henley Beach Car line 1&frac12; miles from Adelaide.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 22-1-19<br/>G. Hodge brought home one of his gang of Fritzs and installed him here as Batman.  He is a rather well educated young fellow and speaks English fairly well.  These prisoners don't get enough to eat, they only get &frac14; of a loaf per diem and &frac12; a Dixie of meat.  No midday meal, every 2 or 3 days they get a couple of Biscuits.  They eat all sorts of Garbage if they get the chance.  I gave this chap a box of soup tablets and a lump of Cheese, he almost slopped over.  I went visiting last night to practice French and as usual after a few words, they put the acid on me for Petrol, Jam, &amp; Carbide</p>
