<p>I slept well in my cabin last night all from rank of Sergeants up had cabin bunks. It was arranged to have a New Years Eve Concert in the evening &amp; a little liquor was procured for the occasion. The affair went of middling well but I retired early &amp; had a read while in my bunk. It was not a bad journey so far &ndash; very smooth &amp; the food air etc.</p>
<p>Saturday 1st Janbuary 1916<br/>Another smooth day. We had an escort of Torpedo Boats etc &amp; we were credited with having 7 Generals on board including 2 Lords. A submarine was sighted &amp; it created a good deal of excitement but no Torpedo was fired at us &amp; she got away. It was wonderfully calm. Had good dinner &amp; returned early.</p>
<p>Sunday 2nd Jan 1916<br/>we arrived in</p>
