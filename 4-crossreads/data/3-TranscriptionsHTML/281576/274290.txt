<p>Bed 23.    Bristol Ward<br/>Tues. Oct. 9  Sausages for Break. this morning,  very nice too.  My Doctor came round yesterday.  He says they must wait till the incision in my Leg is healed &amp; then have another go with the X Ray.  The old Gent brought us some Acid drops today &amp; a Lady brought us some small bags of Lavender, which makes the place smell very sweet.</p>
<p>Wed. 10.  Received Letter from Ruth.  She informs me that Mary is down here, &amp; will come to see me, which is certainly good news.  It is a beautiful day outside, but jolly cold indoors.  Today we had Fish for Dinner, which was a pleasant change.  They feed us up well at this place.  Breakfast is the worst meal of the day.  That is decidedly "young".  Commenced Letter 37 to M.S.</p>
<p>Thurs. Oct. 11.  The nurses at this Hospital are the biggest lot of women I ever saw.  They have arms on 'em like the "Village Blacksmith".  Got a Letter from Mary B. saying she is coming to see me, so I must spruce myself up.  Yesterday 2 very nice Ladies came to see me.  They were from the Red X, &amp; brought me a heap of good things.  A Tin of Tobacco &amp; a Hair Brush among them.  Just the 2 things I most needed.  Mary arrived  about 2.30.  She brought me a bunch of beautiful Flowers.  What a fine Girl she has grown into.  I got quite a shock when I saw her.  She stayed with me for about an hour, &amp; we had a good old yarn about old times.  Of course she wanted to know all about B.E. &amp; I had to produce my Photos.  Continued Epistle to M.S. No. 37.</p>
