  
 21st  Left rest camp to go back to Leddingham, there to  reorganise.  It is a small scattered village 40 miles from Ypres.  We went out in motor buses and were shelled going out.  We  passed through Poperinghe, Steenworde, Caselle (army h'q'rs)  and got to Leddingham 10 p.m. 
 23rd  billeted in barns of French peasants, and play a  programme every afternoon.  Mac cooks for us so are living  well.
