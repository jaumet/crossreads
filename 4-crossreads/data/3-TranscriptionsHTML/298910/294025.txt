<p>9/7/16  Sunday</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Moved out from billet back thro Esraires, picked up rest of Brigade in the square &ndash; Marched some 6 miles thro the Village of Sailly &ndash; got into a billet &ndash; a big Farm Barn on the outskirts &ndash; On the way we witnessed many air duels at times right over our heads &ndash; our guns were firing at them all around us &ndash; Some of the Boys started a very appropriate song &ndash; I want to go back &ndash; We are now 4 miles from our first line &amp; well in the range. Heavy firing going on all night, the star shells looked very pretty, but terrifying. It is marvellous how one can adapt themselves, our billet may be next to be shelled &amp; yet we are quite indifferent &ndash; Very cold during night.</p>
<p>10/7/16  Monday</p>
<p>The German aircraft yesterday must have observed us march in &ndash; because at daylight they started dropping shells at about a minutes interval</p>
