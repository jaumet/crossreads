<p>have just come out into bloom . I have been down into Northampton twice, it is a fairly large place, but there is nothing of interest to see there. I went down on Friday evening to a garden party, a lady came up from the town and took four of us down to spend the afternoon at her party and we were treated very well. We had the usual games, singing , piano etc. and finished up with a fine supper. Yesterday I went down to the park to hear the Life Guards band play, they were very good and next Sunday the Grenadiers' are coming down here to play. It is astonishing to see the number of girls and young women in town. There are several big factories about here and they seem to all employ young women as munition makers. I got word to say that my money was deposited in the Commonwealth</p>
