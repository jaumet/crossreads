Battalion was today run over by a train. Both legs were cut off so he soon died. It was a terrible sight.
24th January (Monday) Carrying heavy stretchers all day. Trains arriving throughout the whole day with troops of the 5th, 6th & 7th Battalions from the Dardanelles. All seem to agree that the evacuation of Gallipoli was the only thing possible because neither side could move on account of the numerous machine guns. Beachy Bill the mystery gun appears to have been troublesome.
25th Jan (Tuesday) Actually
