to think that we marched 80 miles for these why you could find better billets without leaving the "forward area" at any rate this march finished the long long trek all are heartily glad, we were very fortunate right through for we had almost ideal weather for marching
20th Breakfast 9 oclock this morning so we had quite a long sleep in, after breakfast I made a fire set to washed every bit of clothing I had, tunic, trousers, shirt, underpants socks towel etc I went through the whole lot, when I finished I felt quite proud of myself, I always do after a washing day which needless to say is very seldom.
At 2 oclock the much needed dough came to light, the first for nearly 5 weeks, I might mention there were no absentees for this parade, also sent 5 men on leave to Bologne we are quite close for you can hear the steamers blowing their foghorns quite plainly, almost any time.
