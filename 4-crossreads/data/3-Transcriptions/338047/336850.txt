<p>1918<br/>Oct 1<br/>have come in behind us. &ndash; only he was too busy elsewhere. The village was on the railway line, and just where it entered the village there was a small "pill box" with machine gun emplacements commanding the valley and hills. There was no machine gun in it, though why, I don't know: One gun there could have stopped the whole of our little advance. We would have had to wait till a tank came up. We did not go into the village but came round by the side of it, and stopped on the slope overlooking the next village &ndash; Wiancourt. Huns were running into the place and then making off for  Beaurevoir, a fair sized place on a hill on our left. Their lorries could be seen on the road to the same place.<br/>[Photograph inserted title "No 66. 45th Btn. Sniping at Retreating Enemy, Villeret. 18.9.18]<br/>I spotted one Hun walking along by a trench near Wiancourt. He was in no hurry so I fired at him at 1000 yards. Missed. Had a couple more with the same</p>
