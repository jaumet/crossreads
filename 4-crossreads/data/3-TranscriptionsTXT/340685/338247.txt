 in he afternoon. Very foggy and cold ice formed on the branches. Saw Birdwood who had a good chat with me. Came home early and chopped wood for the evening. Big bombardment going on a little to our left. 2.12.16 To-day was to have been our day off but we were about 3 minutes late on parade and had to go to work. Very foggy and frosty all day. After dinner our job was pushed &ndash; we had done little in the morning as no rail came up and had to work on in the dark until 5.15. Went to bed with a fire for about 2 hours. 4 parcels came for me one containing the clothing. Yesterday saw an 8" howitzer Fritz left behind. 3.12.16 had to work for the cooks this morning and carried heavy logs across here and strained my back a bit.

Our job to-morrow is to assist in surveying the line we have put down. Weather cloudy and gloomy with a strong  west  cold east wind which has been going since yesterday afternoon. 7.12.16 Dull and foggy at times. Did nothing in the morning and in the afternoon made some tally rods and carried home more wood. breakfast at 6 to-morrow probably because some sections can't get a parade in time owing to late calling of cooks by the picquet. 8.12.16 Mild but drizzling rain all day. breakfast at 6 and the section went out at 7 to put in a crossing. Quite dark then so we waited comfortably in our dugout until 8 when it grew light and after making our chain set out. (of telephone wire) Worked under difficulties all day as sights were difficult to make and it was very muddy. After dinner chained on to 3000 feet and came home at about 2.30. Issue of boots and a jack knife. Almost incredible news of capture of Bucharest, Ploesti. Vague reports of the Greece crisis and the formation of new English Cabinet. My front tooth came adrift this evening and I wish I could secure good attention. 9.12.16 Miserably raining all day and has set in heavier to-night. Carried on with the surveying until dinner time when it became too wet and our prism in the compass became clouded with moisture. Sat in the dugout for the remainder of the day.

Snowed in the morning and intermittently all day and was windy making it fairly cold. I decided to go on Sick parade with my teeth and went down with Rice's Sick parade at 9 to 3rd Field Ambulance. Found there was no dentist there so they sent me on to the 14th Field nearer us. Rice went home so I followed but found I should have waited and got an order at the 3rd so I returned and then on to the 14th where I saw a sergeant dentist.
