  
 Saturday 20 May 1916 A summer day, quite hot about midday. On the go as orderly officer but managed to get up to the dentist in the morning. Handed over the balance of the company in the afternoon to the other 2nd Battn. (12/2nd) company. Col. Foote visited the camp & talked at considerable length to the officers about what to do at the front. At 6'oclock as we were about to go to dinner a new batch of abt. 1100 men came along from Marseilles. A further batch of Aust. letters arrived.
