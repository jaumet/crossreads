  
 on account of rain. Set out about 11am with full packs and blankets (in drizzling cold rain) for Winnezeele & arrived there about 5pm - distance 11 miles. Met all the other chaps back from the line. Considering everything they had very few casualties. Ewing & MacKay were blown to pieces with shells. After tea went into Winnezeele with Andy & Burrell & met some of the old 62nd chaps who have joined 13 Btn 7/10/17 Sunday - Very cold all night but slept well. Plenty of mud about the camp. Issued with woollen undershirt. After dinner walked to Le Rivelt with Andy & K Fourell & had meal of eggs, also bought bread. Rained heavily all afternoon.
