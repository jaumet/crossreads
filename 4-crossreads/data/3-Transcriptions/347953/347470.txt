<p>On the 12th Feb. 1917, 1,500 men embarked at Devonport, England for Australia on H.M.A.T. Ulysses after spending three months at Westham camp, Weymouth.  We were glad to leave Blighty on account of the winter season and the regular monotony of camp life.</p>
<p>The submarine scare greatly hindered our progress, and caused us to often deviate our course to a great distance beyond the land, &amp; to steer in a zig-zag direction, which caused us to loose nearly 100 miles per day.</p>
