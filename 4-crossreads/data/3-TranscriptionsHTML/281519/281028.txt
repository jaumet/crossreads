<p>11/1/17  "B" Camp<br/>wet dugout and muddy trench. At 2 pm held a conference of all those officers who were not on fatigue and discussed our next tour in the line and some tactical matters. Followed the doctor with a few remarks on trench feet and then we yarned round a glowing brazier for a while, the powdery snow still falling outside. Colonel Fitzgerald on a FSCM and spent some time in fierce argument with him on the duration of the war &amp; kindred subjects. His usual argumentative powers were augmented by a couple of whiskies. Having eventually despatched them homewards we settled down to a frugal dinner of soup mutton with vegetables and sauce, and stewed fruit with Ideal milk, hot toast and honey topped off by liquers. Our doctor very funny with his arguments about barrages and Bosches &amp;c &amp;c. The guns roaring heavily again tonight. Rumours of a German attack at Thiepval but it lacks conformation. We are only 5 miles away but the first reliable news we shall have will be that gleaned from the London papers</p>
