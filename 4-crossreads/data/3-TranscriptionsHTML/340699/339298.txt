<p>that not only the light was wrong (<u>that</u> I'd expected) hut the sun had drawn up such a haze that all my subject was mist silhouetted! I groaned and came back and did a little study of a field telephonist's post - the dug-out in which I lodge. This afternoon the men are out reaping - with sickles-and the sky is dull as ditchwater.
