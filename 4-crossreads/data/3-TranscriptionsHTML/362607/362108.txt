<p>Mr H Nicholls<br/>Iceton Street<br/>Burwood<br/>Sydney</p>
<p>Dear Harry<br/>I was so sorry that I was out when you came to say good bye to me. You are a bosker why didn't you come to the train to see me off. Too busy with the girl I suppose. Hope you have not been nursing any more girls home from Manly. It is dreadfully slow up here. Wish you would come up  &amp;  liven things up a bit. Don't forget to write soon. Love from Mother "Roslyn"<br/>I am learning to ride a bike  &amp;  it is great fun. What do you think of this building for a hole of a place like Inverell. A week tonight since I left Sydney &amp;  it seems like years.</p>
