brought down.
Good new to hand from the French Front, the Yanks & French troops joined hands across an old salient & captured 10,000 prisoners.
To day the 20th September the news is good also, another big advance has been made in our vicinity, the Australians doing well, capturing 2000 odd prisoners, and much War gear.  The majority of the prisoners passed close by our camp.
To day I received a great surprise, Willie Paul called to see me, he is only camped about 50 yds away, and has been there for the last 5 days, & neither of us knew we were so close to each other. Of course we had a grand old yarn, & we strolled along to a certain Engineers Camp, to see one of the dummy tanks, that were used in this latest stunt. The one I saw went the furthest in the Advance, & was brought back as a souvenir.
This brings the news right up to date, when I start the next Edition it will probably begin on the 13th August, omitting the Blighty Trip, and continue on.  These few notes are only to bring the news up to date, and in case the next report goes astray, it will come in handy.  The latest rumour is that very shortly our Division will be going right away from the straffing for a dinkum rest.
