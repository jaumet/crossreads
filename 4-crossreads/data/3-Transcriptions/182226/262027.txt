<p>Wednesday 5 January, 1916</p>
<p>Sailed at 6.30.</p>
<p>The &quot;Bornu&quot; is a bad sea ship &amp; had made a lot of the boys sick. I am all right so far.</p>
<p>Was on Night Guard, on guard from 8 to 10.30 p.m. &amp; from 2.30 a.m. to 4.30. So I did not get much sleep.</p>
<p>The weather is very calm.</p>
