<p>Friday 15 March<br/>A wounded case this morning.  Fritz attempted a raid on our left this morning &amp; we heard his barrage.  No idea as to results. Glorious day. Fritz shelled our vicinity heavily for the greater part of the day but fruitlessly. Glorious day &amp; Ypres stands out very distinctly. The <strike>German</strike> bombardment last night signified also a raid by Tommies on our left at 9.30 p.m. but no idea as to results.</p>
<p>Saturday 16 March<br/>A beautiful Spring day. Fritz shelled about our dugout this morning &amp; to-night he is continuing it with heavy stuff &amp; fifty yards away are the [indecipherable] distance.  No carries.</p>
