<p>but now frozen hard enough to make an ointment with.</p>
<p>Friday 26th Jan<br/>Still busy arranging dispensary making stuff &amp; issuing drugs to battalions etc. Whale oil ointment turning out well &amp; have to make more as supplies have not yet come to hand. Still very cold, snow everywhere several accidents from fellows playing on the ice. Bombardment very heavy &amp; has lasted for some days.</p>
<p>Saturday 27th Jan.<br/>Saw Morris today with one star up. He was on his way to 'Amiens' but I could not manage to go with him. Guess he will do well as an officer. Work a little easier today but supplies still not to hand. Cold as ever, 20 &percent; of frost being registered. The cold snap also covers England from what the papers say. Aerial activity today &amp; a taube came down nearby.</p>
