Mess orderly for the day &amp; in addition general fatigue which kept me going in the morning. During the afternoon I went for a stroll taking a few photographs. I also explored a windmill &amp; watched it working. After that I strolled through two villages &amp; poked round in general watching women winding cotton, breadmaking etc. etc. One thing I cannot help but notice &amp; the same thing strikes others. I have never seen a W.C. attached to any Greeks residence &amp; what convenience they have in this respect I do not know. No doubt I could unravel  the mystery if I took the trouble but it seems a remarkable thing that after all these months I have never found out the riddle. Ymca tent at night.</p>
