<p>all the officers and a large percentage of the men are enthusiasts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Very special precautions are being taken against surprise by submarine, boat station drill is carried out daily, at night we run without lights, armed guards of expert marksmen are placed along the ship, of course rifles would be of no avail against a &quot;Sub&quot; but a spray of rifle bullets whipping up the water will make such a splash as to blind the periscope, a lucky shot may put the periscope out of action.&nbsp; Did I tell you that we made a call &quot;some-where&quot; <sup>&quot;St Vincents.&quot;</sup> for our Orders since leavingCapetown, but I won&#39;t tell where, because I am not allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m waiting up, for we intend to &quot;duck&quot; an officer tonight for doing an unsportsmanlike trick today at the tug of war, we all are going to do it with a vengeance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is all this time, mail closing.</p>
