 Darling Mither, 
 The week-end is round agin, and during the week censorship regulations have been relaxed to the above extent. 
 I received two parcels a few nights ago, one with a bosker cake and t&#39;other with Bess&#39; Balaclava&nbsp;and sweets for which I am very thankful. &nbsp;The cake was in excellent condition and not mildewed at all. 
 Frosty mornings are still favourite, although the sun manages to break through during the day. &nbsp;It is of course pretty fresh, but I am keeping well.

 Funny thing how Dad managed to tip in his last letter that I would have been well past the Hindenburg Line. &nbsp;Yes, we were right up as far as Bohain that time we were sent forward. &nbsp;We had an opportunity of seeing some of his defence works which were taken by our great lads. &nbsp;It was a regular eye-opener. &nbsp;We are not very far from it as I write.

 Foggy but mild. &nbsp;May be on the move in a day or two. &nbsp;Wild rumours are everywhere as to our destination - perhaps Coblenz, perhaps demobilisation for Australia. 
 Will write in a day or two, 
 Fondest love to all 
 Your loving son, 
 James xxxxxx
