 1st A.G.H. Heliopolis. Egypt. Nov. 16th 1915. 
 My dearest Alice, 
 I have this afternoon off duty so shall try to write a few letters.  We do not know when the Aust. mail closes but always get such short notice that it is best to have one's letters ready. 
 I am very well indeed now and we have been rather busy these two last weeks.  Had a few trains in, not very many cases but all very septic wounds, so poor fellows need a lot of nursing. 
 Yesterday afternoon we were informed our ward was to be a medical one, so all our cases had to be removed to other wards, busy transfering them yesterday afternoon &amp; this morning.  Expected a lot of medical cases on the train last night but none came to us, were all sent to one of the Auxiliary Hospitals.  To-morrow our ward may be full of medical cases.  When I came off duty this p.m. we only had two new cases but more to follow.
