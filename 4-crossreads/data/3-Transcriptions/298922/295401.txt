<p>Final Exam. I have done well.</p>
<p>Last night we had all the Instructors &amp; Imperial Cavalry Officers to dinner, it was one of the rowdiest RAGS I've been in &ndash; quite up to a Picnic Race Club night. I am very bruised &amp; sore today, but have not laughed so much for a long time.</p>
<p>I go to Continental Hotel tonight &amp; stay Cairo till Monday then return to Desert. Our Brigade has gone to the front line again but not much fighting here now.</p>
