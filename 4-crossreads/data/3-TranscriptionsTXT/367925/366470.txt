One droops, then another, I think the first one is dead, he does not move, but the line never wavers, on they go to death &amp; glory, The pinnace now cast off her line, so we put the oars &amp; start pulling for the shore which we ground on, a few moments later. It is quite evident that the fight on the beach was short, sharp, &amp; decisive. One of our boys is lying dead on the beach the water is lapping over his legs &amp; up to his waist, his features have a very pleasant expression, another boy is lying quite close to him, both of the evidently have been pulled out of the water.Now, I have never done grevious bodily harm to anyone, but when I see my mates lying dead, I make up my mind to kill the Turk who killed them, and if I cannot get him, I shall shot dead the first of the enemy I get sight of. I consider the first few moment spent on the beach the worst during my lifetime, because in that short space of time I transformed from an ordinary human being into a murderer.
