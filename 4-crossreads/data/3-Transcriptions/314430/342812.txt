<p>and packs of rifles and, at the end of another two kilos, reached the <strike>staging</strike> rest Camp. Stew and tea were issued at dusk, <strike>and</strike> I was disturbed several times at my humble meal by Chinese coolies, who came prowling about <strike>and</strike> begging us to sell them bully beef for one francs per tin. At 8 O'clock I rolled myself in my blanket, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>May 11th:- On the march again early this morning. Experiences similar to yesterday, Tramped through the village of Botangles at noon, and noticed about this <strike>place</strike> neighbourhood, principally on the roadside, huge dumps of "live" shells. A kilo from this place, I entered, "Forward area"; this, I ascertained, from a notice board on the wayside stating:- "Gas masks must be worn forward of this area." At midday there was another halt for dinner. My friend Private Stiff withdrew a tin of "Maconachie"* from his haversack, <strike>and</strike> this we warmed over a fire, <strike>and</strike> thus had a good midday meal. At 4.30, weary and footsore, we found ourselves giving through the towns of Querreau<strike>x</strike> and Pont Noyelles. These places were involved in <strike>a</strike> clouds of dust, those being raised by long lines of motor lorries, wagons, ambulance cars, motor cars, limbers, horses, and mules. Crowds of Australian and Imperial soldiers</p>
<p>* "Maconachie" was a preserved stew of cooked meat, <strike>gravy</strike> gravy, potatoes, and carrots. Extensively used at the Front; usually one tin to four men.</p>
