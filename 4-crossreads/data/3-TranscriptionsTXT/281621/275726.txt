 Tuesday 27 Early this morning we were on loudery fatigue in the mud &amp; rain &amp; pulling down tents, but for the move it kept fine. Marched along R.N. No 1 through Samer &amp; about 9 kilos from Boulogne we turned to the  left  right for a mile or so. We are now billeted in the farm building of a rather big house, in fact the best billets we have been in in France. R.N. No 1 Montrierch &ndash; Boulogne &ndash; Calais. 
 Wednesday 28 Work mostly fixing up new camp. These billets are very comfortable &amp; the farm building etc are much better than any we have been in previously. The view from the hilltop is fine commanding undulating valleys including that of La Laine River. We have seen practically all that river. 
 Thursday 29 A rest camp is to be opened by the ambulance &amp; tents have been erected this afternoon. An aleyed dinner tonight resulted in the potatoes not being cooled. Our cooks are up to putty.
