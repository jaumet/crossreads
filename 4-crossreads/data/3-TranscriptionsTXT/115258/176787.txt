I seem to have a fearful lot of letters to answer this mail and I believe there is another one coming in a day or two, so I will have to work hard for the next few days and try and catch up a bit. Have you read Daddy-Long-Legs Mother? Stella sent it to me for Christmas and I did enjoy it and a lot of chaps in the regt. have also been sent it and are all talking about it. It is a simple little story andbut  a really good lesson in letter writing I think. In my last letter to Father I told him that I might be sending a cable home for money as there was a chance of us getting leave long enough to go to Luxor - However leave has been cut down to three days so Luxor is finish; but I'm still thinking of sending the cable soon and then just taking the leave to Cairo when my turn comes.
People have been very good to me this Xmas, and have sent me a tremendous lot of parcels; nearly every body I know has sent me one I think and I have sox galore! about eight pairs. It is an awful pity; because if we do any big moves they have all got to go over board and in two months time I'd be giving anything to get a pair. A person cant carry on big stunts, more than one
