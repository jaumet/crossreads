<p>1917 Sunday 28 Jan.</p>
<p>Last night passed without a call  We did not get up till 9a.m.  Nothing doing, but to get breakfast &amp; sit in dugout all day. <br/>Got 2 carrys today one for each squad. Ours came on after dark just before tea.  Exhaustion case.  Machine gun fire makes us duck once or twice. Get back safely.  Several shells lob on top of dugout but no damage. Ridg &amp; I go for water.  Write home letter No. 28 &amp; one to Mrs. Grant.</p>
