December 2856.This morning bombs dropped and the raiders away without harm.  If they were as near as they sounded they'd have been much nearer.
All night long heavy and heavier intervals of fire, and till mid morning they've continued. Tonight the 1st Brigade are stunting - either a raid on a large scale or a minor stunt.  This is a quiet front - the quietest we've been on this year. It has been well accepted that the Boche will sooner or later make some attack - an effort to break through.  The idea is that this will be his attacking front, and today big preparations have been made for the clearing of wounded.  'Tonight's the night'.
Afternoon:  stunt postponed, an 11th Batt. runner captured with all plans and arrangements of the attack.
