<p>Received 2 fine big parcels to night one from N.S.W. and the other from home.<br/>12th Heavy rain fell last night, when we got up this morning it was snowing heavily but there was a lot of rain falling at the same time so it did not lay long. <br/>Had the usual digging fatigue this morning and we done some good work though it was cold and wet. 2 more of my men are going to hospital shortly I think and neither of them have seen a firing line as yet.<br/>A funny little incident happened this evening we were all sitting round a nice hot coal fire cracking jokes and chaffing one another for we had just finished our tea when the door opened and Charlie Harrison stepped in and I said jokingly "hands in your pockets"</p>
