<p>15 Saturday</p>
<p>Waked at six.  Very frail so lay in till 9 a.m. &amp; then ran till 8 p.m. with but 1 hour's interruption exclusive of meals.<br/>Feeling so exhausted that I crept to <strike>Matron</strike> bed to escape Matron but she came to know what I had done with her lamp &amp; I did not have it at all.</p>
