The rest of the night fatigue had a spell today; but as the 2nd Brigade in the sector we have just left; shot down the Hun's ration parties; as they approached singing "Die Wast am Rein" and generally making the night hideous; Fritz declared war on them, and I had to go and bury six of that brigade this morning. The Brigadier of the 2nd is very zealous and has no time for neutral warfare. The Bosche is every ready to accommodate these violent people. Because of the frozen ground I had to bring these poor fellows out about six miles to a cemetery.
