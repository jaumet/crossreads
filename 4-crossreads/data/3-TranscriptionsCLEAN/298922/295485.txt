 BEACH 
 I've had a swim & built a Bivy facing the Mediteranean just 60 yards from the waves - it is a treat to be clean again & the horses should improve here. They have been falling away for the last month. No grazing & too many Flies DUST & not enough water. My two are still fit & well & not a blemish on them altho' they have some weight to carry.  Old  Colonel Granville left today sick - we have only 1/4 of the evacuations the Tommies have among the men. Our men spend all their money on TUCKER.
