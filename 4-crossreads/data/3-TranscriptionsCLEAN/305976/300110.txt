  
 outside Soldiers one met very few who spoke the English language. The time has arrived for us to saddle up so my further impressions must for the present be discontinued. Jan 31 We left for Rafa last night in a crowded Troop train. The usual trucks, very uncomfortable & not much room. However this we did not mind seeing that a few days we expect to be on board. We arrived at Kantara just on daybreak & caught the Motor Lorrys to the other side of the Canal where we had breakfast & resumed our journey
