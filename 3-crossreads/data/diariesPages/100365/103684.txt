maze of guns now in use on the Somme front would astound one, it is a sight that will live in everyones memory as long as life lasts.The air of a night is just one scream of bursting shells all lit up as if by a gigantic fire.It is like watching forked lightning in a black cloud only on a much bigger scale. later I have had a very exciting evening having to gallop through Rubempre Talmas the surrounding country in search of some Canadians who were attached to us for whom a special order came telling us to despatch them to Aucheuse Station thence to Ypres Poperinghe in Belgium. One of them being a French Canadian necessitated a house to house search. I eventually found them all got them off. When leaving they held a brief for a Lieut myself totally ignored someone who came out specially for an ovation. I tell you it hurt him some.
