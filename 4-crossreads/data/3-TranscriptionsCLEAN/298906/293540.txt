conscience, if they have any they reckon there is nearly 7000 men in A.W.L. in England.11th. Beautiful & sunny morning after last nights showers.Have just come back from being medically examined, every one who goes out of this Camp if only for a couple of days has to be examined by the Dr. before going & after, though it is only a farce to say the best of it, the object of it is to control that terrible scourge "venereal disease".England is full of it & especially London, & unless you have a strong will, you are a "goner." Received a few letters this morning but judging by the dates of these & the last lot I got, there must have been some sunk.
