to smarten the men up after their cramped life in the trenches.
This is really a very smart Battalion and after they have been
out of the trenches about two days and have had a chance to
smarten up they drill better than any Australian soldiers I have
seen drilling in Australia.&nbsp; This from men who have been at
trench warefare for about 12 months - Gallipoli and here - is very

They had not been up a quarter of an hour before our planes were
