<p>5/4/17<br/>We expect to move on to Beaumetz tonight about five kilos from here. Arrived at a sunken road close to Beaumetz. The country here looks much better than any we have seen in the shelled area of the Somme. Very little damage being done by shell fire</p>
<p>6/4/17<br/>Two of our planes</p>
