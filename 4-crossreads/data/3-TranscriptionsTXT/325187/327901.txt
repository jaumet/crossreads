 [Wednesday 7 June 1916] 
  All quiet &amp; letters from England one-Laura  - one Mardi Ritchie- 16/5/16  Good news the Naval fight. Our Camel men were very funny this morning.  In the dark at 3.30 AM, passing the QM Store they heard a Primus Stove burning which sounds exactly like a Bomb falling thro' the air, our Wireless Oil engine was also working so the Combination made the Natives leave their Camels &amp; run in all directions- Our hours are long 16 a day so as of old SLEEP is the greatest pleasure- Last night a poor devil was dreaming of Bombs etc &amp; he yelled so loud he woke the whole Camp-
