  
 10 December Friday 1915 I remember thinking a man was living a hum drum existence on the station but Riverina except in the middle of February perhaps is a Paradise to Egypt & what a clean living country Australia is compared to these parts!! Certainly this cannot be called Humdrum, but it is a bit monotonous being so cramped up. Digging is the chief occupation by Day & watching by night. I have just been ironed a pair of Pants (Slacks) like all soldiers clothes a rotten fit why is it that Pyjamas in the Hospitals & so on are  cut  in such Comic fashion - However the Pants are clean & as we sleep & live in clothes a change is good.
