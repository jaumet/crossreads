<p>on Sunday &amp; this is Friday. [Diarist has written <u>Sunday 15 Aug</u> in the left hand margin.] We are all extremely glad to get away as it is really too hot to do any good here, in the way of training our men.</p>
<p>After another break we have arrived I cannot say where, but we are here, &amp; I probably won't be able to write again, for some time. Goodbye for the present, give my love to all</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Arthur.</p>
