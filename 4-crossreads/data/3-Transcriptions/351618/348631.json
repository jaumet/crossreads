<p>Saturday 9th Oct<br/>It was a delightful morning after the rain. Of course there was plenty of mud about &amp; you could see traces of the storm which had just abated. In the afternoon I went to Ordnance &amp; on the beach there was a fearful muddle. The various jetties &amp; landing stages were carried away. Barges &amp; small vessels were high &amp; dry on the sand. Biscuit boxes &amp; others were strewn all over the place. The debacle could not have been better completed by the heaviest of bombardments.</p>
<p>The sea was still a little angry as it lashed into spray against the rocks &amp; barges on the sandy beach. One could hardly call the storm a very big one yet the damage was enormous &amp; if the weather did get very bad</p>
