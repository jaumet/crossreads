1915Mar. 29 Mon.We had a meeting of the A.S.A. to-night & as there was a concert on in the Y.M.C.A. - the meeting was adjourned to the open out on the sand.Beautiful  moonlight night & everything so silent & still!  Went for a walk after meeting over to Sphinx with Fred. King of Field Artillery - What a decent chap he is.The Nurses are having a good time, rather - especially with the officers. Two & two.
