<p>Frid. 26th Oct. 1917:-</p>
<p>There have been plenty of taubes over latterly including last night which was fine &amp; clear. Taking advantage of the moonlight went for a stroll down the road, over the frontier, and on to French territory. Have started to learn Flemish in earnest &ndash; it looks easier than French.</p>
<p>Tuesd. 30th Oct 1917:-</p>
<p>Fritz has been bombing our area like billyho the last few nights &ndash; London raids aren't in it (mere fleabites). So far our place has escaped scot free. The bombs are of a deadly nature &ndash; bursting all directions without penetrating downwards.</p>
<p>We have just had some very interesting news &ndash; leave to England has been increased from ten to fourteen days from 1st Nov. And about time too. There are crowds of chaps who haven't had leave for 18 months &amp; some for two years. The heads are only just waking up and sending more on leave. The papers have been kicking up a fuss lately &amp; this no doubt the result.</p>
