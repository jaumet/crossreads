 My dearest Mother   &  Sisters, 
 Perhaps my next letter will be from London. We are expecting to get our leave next Friday. 
 Belle, this letter should reach you about the time of your birthday. I hope you will have a very happy day   &  lots of presents. Trust I shall be home for your next. 
 We are having beautiful weather   &  if it continues so, it will be            very good
