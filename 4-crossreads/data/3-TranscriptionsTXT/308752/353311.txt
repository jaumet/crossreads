 Sunday 26th December Another easy day for us, did a lot of washing, made a much better job of it than the previous one, the clothes turned out a dirty yellow instead of black. My first big mail arrived 13 letters in all, including a letter from home, with which I was extremely delighted. We are having perfect weather. 
 Monday 27th December Shifting camp to a more suitable position, every-one working hard, kept at it till a late hour at night 
 Tuesday 28th December to Friday 31st December. Monotonous camp life Stretcher drill &amp; route marches etc. every one is sick of it. They are singing out in Sydney for men &amp; still more men, &amp; here we are wasting our time &amp; still likely to, for a long time to come.
