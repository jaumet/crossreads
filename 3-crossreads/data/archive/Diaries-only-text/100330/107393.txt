fiercely, I went down to No 134 clearing Casualty Hospital in the Morning for supplies for the Medicine chest, they have made great preparation there for cases Marques put up everywhere now there is accomadation for over 2000 casualties, I noticed two Marque's filled with Boys who had been gassed, the sides of the Marques are let down to give the boys plenty of Fresh Air, also another Tent with full of Boys with their Eyes bandaged up also gassed. I was told that their Eyes swell up and they cannot see out of them. A Balloon which had been stationed by the Hospital has now been removed nearer the Line which means that they have taken some more ground from Fritz. There is no mistake there is something doing shortly as we are practically surrounded by Amunition Wagons everywhere also on going over to the Load in the Evening I saw several families of Belgium people with their goods chattels coming from near the Fireing line going towards Poperinghe for Safety. There must be a large number of Troops Etc now
