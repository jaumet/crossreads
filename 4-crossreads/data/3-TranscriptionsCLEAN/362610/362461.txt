Saturday 2 Sept. 1916Up in good time & walked over to Oxelaire for breakfast at a very fine class billet where 3 RAMC men were staying. It was close to the school where at 10 o'clock we had a lecture followed by practical work with gas in the field. Free in the afternoon & spent the time with Capt. Minty going round Cassel looking for several things we wanted : several good shops in the place. A lecture just before dinner & then a tramp home. There was very little light rain but it was a dull hazy day.
