<p>8 Friday</p>
<p>Glorious day. Cooked &amp; waited at Caf&eacute;. Called on Kath at Endell St. Hospital on my way there. Got home very tired. Miss Bland had me up to have a cup of tea in her studio. I was trying to have a sleep but youngsters squatted outside my window awakened me. Set to work to gain acquaintance with the typewriter which came from A.A. Smith.</p>
