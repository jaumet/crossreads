 Stayed up nearly all last night writing the operation orders for our raid tomorrow. First thing this morning the General arrived and we discussed odds and ends. Decided on 9.45 p.m. as zero hour. Busy again interviewing people and writing. Hughes and Smith reported back from England. Had a hurried lunch and walked up to D Co H.Q. to hold a conference of company commanders and to arrange plans for tonight. The 7th Bde. Attack on our right on a front of 2000 yards to a depth of 1/2 a mile. 23rd raid on our left later on. The afternoon gave promise of rain and some feel. As we returned we walked all round the old German positions in the two Caterpillars and coming back it was interesting to see all his old posts now well
