<p>Monday 14 August 1916<br/>There was a fair fall of rain during the night &amp; the day turned out dull with intermittent showers. Lectured to reinforcements in the morning &amp; after coming in got word that we were to move up to Albert in the afternoon. Got things packed, &amp; just as we were on the point of setting out at 2.30, word came that we were to stop at Vadencourt, not quite half-way out. Waited for a heavy shower to pass over &amp; then had it fine for our 4 or 5 mile walk. Very poor billets, but much better than open air at Albert as we thought we should be experiencing.</p>
