 Cape Helles 
 Simultaneously with the landing at Anzac a landing was conducted on much the same lines at the most southerly part of the Peninsular at Cape Helles. And deeds of unprecedented valour and heroism were accomplished there just the same as at Gaba Tebe.

The warships assisted greatly with great fire at the various landings committing fearful casualties amongst the terror stricken Turks.
