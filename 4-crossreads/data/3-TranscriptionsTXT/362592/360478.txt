 Up'ards! A perky night was a comin down As a young chap past through a country town; In his fist he clutched a tattered flag, An' this 'ere motter was on the rag &ndash; "Up'ards!" 
 From under his old tile's battered rim His dark eyes flashed like a tallier glim; He lookt not to left, he lookt not to right, But continnerly hollered with all his might &ndash; "Up'ards!" 
 Three times thro' winders did he see Three sevril families takin' tea; He smelt the cakes, yet never swerved; But as he dropt a tear observed &ndash; "Up'ards!" 
 Says a cute old feller &ndash; "young cove take care, "There's a rotten old pine tree fixt up there, "Sure's eggs is eggs, it'll fall on yer head." The young man only winkt and sed &ndash; "Up'ards"
