Taking a walk all around the main streets until 10 pm & a cup of tea at the hotel & bed.
6th August:- SundayAwake at 8 am, still tired & this is a change into some luxury. A wash    & hurried breakfast, &agrave; la Francais, of rolls & butter & coffee. It is even difficult to obtain an egg. The French are satisfied with this snack    & never breakfast. Am afraid this won't suit us too well  However we'll just carry on . Arrive &agrave; notre bureau &agrave; 9.10 am. Tres tard mais je m'en fiche. Plenty of work as I soon find out & as I get straight to it on casualties of the 2nd Division. It's just go at it & not time to look round. At any rate, there's not the slightest doubt in the world that one has to earn his crust here. At 12-30 pm work is finished for the day & with Legge we waste no time but set about looking for some lodgings. Have lunch at the Salvation Army
