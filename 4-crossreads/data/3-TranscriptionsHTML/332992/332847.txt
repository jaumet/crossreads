<p>I am 4 months in France to day, having arrived at Le Havre on the morning of November 23rd. 1916, and have been most of the time in Houplines, Armentieres and the vicinity.<br/>It is persistently reported here to night that the Germans are evacuating Lille.  That the French were driven back 6 miles, received reinforcements, counter attacked and drove the Germans back 12 miles.</p>
<p>Saturday March 24.1917<br/>The sun is shining out brightly this morning, but there is a bitterly cold wind from the East.  It is doing some good however, for it is a very drying wind.  There was a heavy bombardment last night, and very early this morning, on our front, possibly with the object of preventing the Huns sending reinforcements from this front to the Somme.<br/>There has been occasional bombardments during the day, and some brisk firing at enemy aeroplanes.  The arrest of the Ex-czarina is reported from Petrograd.  Fighting from St. Quentin to South of Arras continues during snowstorms.  A hostile party entered our trenches N.E. of Arras but were driven out.</p>
