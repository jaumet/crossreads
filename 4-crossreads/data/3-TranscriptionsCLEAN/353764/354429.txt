I was amazed to see the extent of the rioting that has occurred in Sydney, especially the battle they seem to have had on Sydney Railway Station.  To say that all the decent minded troops are disgusted at their behaviour would be to express it mildly & by rights they ought to pack them all over here instead of discharging them & I'll guarantee they would get it taken out of them in the Desert. I am afraid it will have a bad effect over some of the men on this side but fortunately the greater number are down the Canal & consequently cannot do much harm.  Of course we have regular riots her, but it is generally against the Arabs, some of whom always get killed. Thousands of troops are embarking for France daily & you will soon see how our Australians can compare with the Germans.  I for one have no doubt of the ultimate issue. Everyone here is talking
