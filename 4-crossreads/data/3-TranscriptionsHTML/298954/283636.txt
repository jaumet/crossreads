<p>Mon. 15th Apl (cont.)<br/>The old colonel wound up the evening with a speech of thanks to our hosts (quite a touching thing of the "far-from-home" species, that speech) and forecasted undying friendship with our entertainers of the evening.   Poor old bird;  it turned out that prophecy was not his metier.   He was mad on "reform".</p>
<p>Tue. 16th.<br/>The camp actually improves on closer acquaintance &ndash; but it seems that food is not so plentiful as it appeared yesterday.</p>
<p>The two "spreads" were the result of a special effort made by the fellows from their parcels from England in order to give us a good welcome, bless 'em.</p>
<p>We have now to economise rigidly till our own parcels begin to arrive, although the chaps here are doing all they can for us.</p>
<p>It is impossible to obtain food from the village other than a few spuds &amp; salads.</p>
