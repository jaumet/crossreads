Big Mail today not yet sorted.Still marking time & as usual did not get away as soon as expected.  Lectured tonight on Cosack Cossack posts & Outposts as we have many Reinforcements (to p replace the old men) who have had little practical training but they are all triersfour letters 2/1/16- I did send letter with Paper but no Diary   Yes I got Sheepskin from Roger & had him to dinner at Aerodrome.Just got Australasian of November 20, you see how erratic mails are.Love to all -Frank
