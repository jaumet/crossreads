3rd Field true to their reputation of being great workers have us up at 6.30! Parade 7 a.m. breakfast to duties at 8 a.m. our usual breakfast time in our own unit. Erect more tents during day.
A very heavy snowfall again this evening inches deep. The past winter has been declared the severest for many years past even now in April we have had more cold with rain snow as to make it almost a record. We should be well seasoned before it is all over. God forbid that we have to go through another winter campaign, but I hardly think either side is able to stand that much less so Fritz.
14,000 prisoners taken at Arras we're told with much ammunition guns.
