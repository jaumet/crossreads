<p>expecting Rid to come through that afternoon on his way to a Rest Camp, &amp; Wal &amp; I waited as long as ever we could for him but we didn't see him.  I saw Wal off to the train &amp; had just come back when Rid turned up- just 5 minutes too late to see each other.  It was jolly hard luck especially as Rid was waiting for over &frac12; an hour for us at another place that he had heard we had gone to<br/>Walter &amp; I had some afternoon tea together &amp; he seemed pretty right but his foot was paining him a good deal.<br/>We are enjoying another spell of fine weather now which after 3 or 4 days of steady rain that we had last week is very acceptable.<br/>Things are much the same here as when I last wrote.  I am keeping well now, having quite got over the stomach trouble I had recently.<br/>The parcel that you spoke about in your last letter has not yet arrived, but I expect it will turn up in due course of time.  Thank you all so much, Father dear, for your loving thoughts &amp; kindness.<br/>While I think of it I think you had better alter</p>
