 Looping is ridiculously easy, &amp; it is a peculiar sensation to sit back, look up, &amp; see old Mother Earth go sailing past overhead.  This of course is at the top of the loop.  I found spinning was inclined to make me dizzy, so I cut it out.  I can quite understand how a pilot on getting his machine accidently into a spin, gets rattled and loses his head, with the result that he crashes. My total time this last week is only about 3 &frac12; hours really awful but unavoidable considering the weather Capt Hobbs, who Wal will remember, has rejoined his Unit in France.  Rather stiff putting a man with a crook hand on active service again. I believe all our 1914 &amp; up to June 1915 men are being returned to Australia next month for 6 months recruiting campaign.  Lucky beggars:- wish I was among them, so that I could see you all once again I suppose I would be back here again before very long, though, as my Chief Interest lies over in these parts now.
