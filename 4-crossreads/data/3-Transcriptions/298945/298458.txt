<p>little dig was the first intimation I had received as to the owner of the dugout.</p>
<p>When I got up for tea the rush had only slightly abated. The balloon which had been in the camp next to ours had moved forward &amp; the whole district was quiet, for the immediate communications had moved forward &amp; we were well behind the front.</p>
<p>During the night we were kept very busy up about 2.30 a.m. when everything became quiet. Taking advantage of the lull we had a dose for a couple of hours &amp; nothing much happened before breakfast.</p>
<p>After that we were told that we would have to continue on duty during the morning</p>
