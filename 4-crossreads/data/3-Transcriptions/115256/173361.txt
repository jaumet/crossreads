<p>Monday 12 April 1915</p>
<p>Considering the uncomfortable conditions, we arrived at Alexandria harbour at 5.30 a.m., all fairly fresh.  As it happened, we were dumped on a coaling wharf, and as may be imagined, soldiers equipment, rifles were all covered with dirt and cold dust, in a very short time.</p>
<p>Our own transport had not yet arrived at the wharf so we spent the time in looking over several vessels at the neighbouring docks including two fine French transports, "La Provence" and La Savoie" previously trans-Atlantic liners but now armed auxiliary cruisers.  Then, the majority of the troops indulged in a bathe and the result was the disappearance of a considerable portion of the coal dust.  At about 11 a.m., our feeble looking transport put in its belated appearance.  Our look at her was enough &ndash; we knew we were in for Hell on the "Ascot".</p>
<p>After our transport section and stores were loaded, we finally embarked at 6.30 p.m. and were shown our quarters in the hold.  Something terrible was that filthy, foul-smelling place.  "The Black Hole of Calcutta" wasn't in it!  "A33" did not leave that evening and how we last the night in that stuffy hole nobody quite knows.</p>
