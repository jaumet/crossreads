<p>Everyone was craning his neck looking for Fritz from his usual direction with the consequence that he got right overhead before he got clear of the line He flew away South and finally disappeared in the blue. Our planes came charging out from their base but Fritz had got a good start. Luckily he did not drop any bombs on us. Some of our men went out and we could plainly hear loud explosions in the Turkish lines. Several miles East of here. If Mr Fritz drops one bomb we drop 10 on him. But he must continue dropping them on us as often as he can its all in the grim game of war. We usually get a good deal of amusement out of these scares.<br/>Its funny to watch the antics of some of the fellows in getting their horse clear of the lines. The horse sometimes will not open his mouth to get the bit in then, as usually happens &ndash; the chain gets stuck, around the rope where he is fastened to &ndash; which wastes much valuable time or probably the man cant find his head stall, then a desperate search ensues. The nosebag is nearly always on (He nearly always comes along at feeding time) and there are two small leather tabs on either side of the Headstall to keep the bag in position. The bag must be removed first</p>
