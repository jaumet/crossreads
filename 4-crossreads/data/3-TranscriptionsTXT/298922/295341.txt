 Turned out last night to chase some enemy Cavalry but did not do any good. 
 Padre previous night roused me saying enemy were coming over the hill he was very excited &amp; made me run out. I saw only  BUSHES !!! he had been saying his Rosary away by himself &amp; fancied he saw things. 
 We now have Tents &amp; I share one with R.C. Padre. You will have my letters acknowledging PARCELS long ere this &amp; I am writing with your pen. 
 I was amused to see among some gifts from the Victorian Racing Club some bottles of Blue Ointment.  All my love.
