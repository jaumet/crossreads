<p>most pleasant. We were due on Monday morning. Arriving here at 10 a.m. today, we are about 24 hours late. We left 12 hours behind time, &amp; were delayed about 12 hours by the gale, &amp; the handicap of a full cargo of 1000 tons of coal. On Saturday, some of the passengers appeared. On Sunday Morning, the weather was quiet enough for us to have a good service in the Social Hall; and yesterday everybody was on deck. We had good fun yesterday. The Ship's company was excellent, but we knew each other for a very short time.</p>
<p>Mr Sinclair &amp; I were not ill. But the first day was so rough that we had our meals in the deck Cabin preferring that to risking our placidity in a heaving Saloon. Only 8 mustered at the first breakfast. Over</p>
