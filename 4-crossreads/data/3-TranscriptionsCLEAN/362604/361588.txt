Shaw, son of Mr. Shaw the Cutter.  He used to work for Mr. Lidier with me.  You might remember us both to Reg. Gamble who is one of the Cutters with Walter Watson.  We would like you to give Walter our Best Wishes also, i.e., Ellis' & mine.  Don't give any money to the Y.M.C.A.  Give that you have to the Repatriation of Soldiers or to the Salvation Army.  The Y.M.C.A. charge 3d. for a rotten cup of cocoa in some places & charge exorbitant prices for everything.  Ask any of the Returned Soldiers.  The Salvation Army in this Country anyway are the Soldiers Friend but not the other Blighters.
Well, Dad, I've no more news now & as I have to go all round the Hospital with the Orderly Officer now I must wish you all good health & happiness & Lots of Love to Mum & George & Yourself.
From Ellis & Harry
Dave wishes to be remembered to you all, likewise Billy Allison.
