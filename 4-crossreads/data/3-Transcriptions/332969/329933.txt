<p>A lot of the boys are suffering from bad colds the night of the 3.11.14 was pretty rough about 2 Am. there was a bit of excitement took place one of the Electric wires fuzed which caused a big blue flame one of the men shouted fire men were tumbling over one another trying to get to the deck I myself stuck to my bed &amp; never moved. However the fire was not serious &amp; did no damage.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4.11.14 our Company peraded as usual at 10 am. after we had gone through a little semefore signalling we were taken up to the nose of the boat on the top deck where a big canvas bath had been erected. So we all had a bath it was good sport only it was not hardly deep enough.</p>
<p>Tuesday 5.11.14. It was very warm last night we are now getting towards the tropics about 11.Am we were having our usual perade when the H.M.A.S. Sydney passed quite close after the perade was dis-missed the bugal sounded for Beer which most of the men on board longed for, most of them pass away the time by gambling, as soon as they draw their pay away it goes.</p>
