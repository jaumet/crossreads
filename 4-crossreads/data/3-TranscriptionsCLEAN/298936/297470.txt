  
 November,1915 
 Friday 12 
 Artillery Rd. station. 
 Bomb came over & burst on top of 6th Field Amb. dressing station up the road towards Lone Pine & killed  & injured a half dozen. 
 One case of sickness for us in the night. 
 Mail in but so far no letters for me. 
 This jaundice has a most depressing effect on one. 
 Wonder how I'll ever stick it till the war finishes, but  that  feeling will pass with the sickness.
