  
 1918 Mon 1st Apl I am leaving Kiel tomorrow for the Officer's Receiving Depot at Karlsruhe, Baden. 
 Cramer, poor old chap, leaves for Kommando, where he shall slave 12 hours a day for 30 phennigs (3d) 
 Tue. 2nd. With the benediction of Kate, Doris, & Nummer 25, I left the lazarelt at 11.30 am, escorted by a Landsturm unter offizier of about 35 or so. 
 The streets of Kiel-Wik were crowded with uniforms, & the shops! - in one pastry-cooks the window exhibit was two loaves of that awful black-bread! 
 Boarded the "electrischer" at Hildegarde Strasse. and we whisked into Kiel past acres of awful flats and hundreds of kiddies playing in the streets.   Flats are apparently the only residences.
