<p>Jingling donkeys. Howling noisy dirty slums. Rotten old Egyptian bazaars. Lanes where all sorts of muck &amp;  filth congregate. Old men    <strike>indecipherable</strike>  sit outside taverns smoking big pipes which they hire. In the better class portions you sit in the street drinking soft drinks    &amp;  eating whilst music is played.  <strike>Indecipherable</strike>  We had trouble in dodging boot boys who will not leave us until we hit them with sticks. After wandering all around the city, first in side streets &amp;  lanes &ndash; where the poor classes eat all sorts of concoctions of rice foods, meat cooked while you wait etc, sold by vendors &ndash; to the well-lighted, tram run streets through gardens &amp;  squares, we caught the 9-30 pm train back to camp.</p>
