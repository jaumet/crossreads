Evans left my section &amp; Joe Woods came in his place &ndash; old Joe is a thundering good sort. Got eight letters this evening so am well in the [indecipherable] according to Vic &ndash; the troops are playing up in Australia, they want to send the beggars right into it, that would quieten them.</p>
