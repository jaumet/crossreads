<p>Wednesday 9 August 1916<br/>Same weather continued. Up early getting things packed, &amp; immediately after breakfast was ready for the move. Left Pernois at 9.30 &amp; had a hot &amp; very dusty march out to La Vicogne, one very steep hill at which some of the transport animals baulked having to be climbed. En route we passed the 5th Bde. Inf. &amp; a bde. of artillery on their way to occupy our old billets. Arrived at La Vicogne abt. 12.30 &amp; in the afternoon went round to 2nd Bn. Very limited accommodation &amp; we had to sleep outside under a trellised arch.</p>
