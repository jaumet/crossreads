  
 Mail closes tonight, just received a bunch of papers from you & girls but no letters guess they are floating around Egypt.   Am glad we are out of that ancient land, it certainly reeks with all kinds of rotten smells & iniquity & where we are now is certainly one grand country, just like one immense garden & farms & orchards & vineyards all kept scrupulously clean.   In the wine country it is hard to realise there is such a war going on except for the fact that you notice at once that all the work is done on the farms by women, old men & children.   Still address your letters the same Sgt. G.F Alley 11th Battalion 3 Infantry Brigade, Abroad.   Hope you are still improving in health and that the girls are all fit and well & finding lots
