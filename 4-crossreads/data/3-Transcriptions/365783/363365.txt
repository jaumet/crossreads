During the afternoon some Territorial R.A.M.C. men belonging to an ambulance attached to the East Lancashire territorials, stationed at Alexandria, came aboard, their accent was a source of considerable amusement to some of our men.   Late in the afternoon we received news from Col. Martin that we would be in Alexandria for at least two days waiting for instructions from London as to our disposal, 48 hours leave was granted right away to senior officers &amp; a lot of them started off for Cairo.  I was down for duty on the following day so could not get away.   After dinner some of us went ashore, arriving at the landing stage a dragoman attached himself to us &amp; walked us along at a pretty brisk rate to the Windsor Hotel.   The night was very cold but by the time we reached the hotel we all wanted to get rid of our great coats.

This was a great contrast to the squalor of the native quarter.</p>
