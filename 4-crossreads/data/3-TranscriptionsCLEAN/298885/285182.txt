  
 Dec 26th - 17 Well re this Xmas dinner which I mention a few days ago. 
 It was a splendid success and one not to be forgotten by all who were partakers.  The fact which added 75% to our success was our great luck to be situated in such a position which is not only quiet but afforded every convenience such as to help the committee to leave no stone unturned in their arrangements 
 Well on Xmas Day our mess hut soon showed signs of festivity as by the aid of willing hands
