<p>Sunday 12th. A beautiful day, In the afternoon went across by boat to No.3 in order to see a friend. I left some letters with him for the post &amp; then had a walk around to see what alterations had gone on. The work going on is wonderful, thousands of men are engaged in all kinds of work imaginable tents, marques wooden, brick, stone, &amp; canvas erections are everywhere while motors &amp; wagons of all descriptions are flying everywhere. Even the modern railway is here although but a narrow gauge. A huge water still is in  full working order after having taken several months to build the work being done by staff of special mechanics from England. Carpenters from England are mostly engaged in erecting canvas &amp; other huts for the housing of nurses &amp; patients whilst Egyptians are employed in making seats forms &amp; other such things used in the hospitals. Arab Gippy &amp; Soudanese labourers are employed on refuse work as well as pier building &amp; road making. They move about singing their river song, as if life was dead within them only showing life when anything is available to steal, or else their foreman whips them into some action. These foremen or overseers use enough abuse to their men to fill a book with no affect.</p>
