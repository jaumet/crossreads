<p>April 25<br/>pinned high above a tawdry mirror and alongside poor photogravure of the Philistine, and contrasting so well with the good green of the walls, the phonograph circling out 90&percnt; pure noise, and visions of a room of self-expression pass by the mind.  Books of course will be the keynote and the colour riot:  Black walls, gold ceiling, brown floor and green book shelving, but the black and gold is old, and its original beauty has been tawdried by brothel use, then the green shelvings would add the richer riot, and green hangings and rugs.  Two pictures &ndash; in gold framings &ndash; the two grouted engravings from Pradelles.</p>
<p>Green walls and faint yellowed, ivory dull shelvings and room fittings.  Curtains of dyed Chinese blue and a Persian rug of multi-colourings.</p>
<p>Brown-gold-fawn walls &ndash; from Winsor &amp; Newton's wash colours, and deep Court blues and Chinese blues.  Walls of [indecipherable] paper and an eye-chosen colour.  And only beautiful books and favourite books visible &ndash; all others in cupboards of fine panelling.  Candles, brass or silver serviced, and deep friendly chairs, and an Irish Terrier, and a grey cat or a black one, and quiet.</p>
<p>A room of no violent originality or futurism:  but a room of beauty and quiet and comeliness.  Now I only owe allegiance to beauty, to Pan of the lovely brown boy-body and the shaggy goat legs: to the beauty my senses dictate:  full nakedness, form and colour.  This morning only, I realised fully for the first time, the beauty of the simplicity of the steel helmet &ndash; one of the 21st M.G. boys wounded this morning:  and his helmet, and black mat-hair across his forehead and his brown-gold face, made him more beautiful than a Greek bronze.</p>
<p>From now I take as my hero, Savage whom I never knew well enough, who I worshipped from my first seeing him at the University Junior of 1910:  I only persuaded Father to send me to the Grammar so that I could meet him:  and he left as I joined, and I met him in Liverpool in the Y.M. Tent in 1915, he in the Infantry and I in the Army Med.  He died of wounds in 1916.</p>
