<p>Thursday 5th<br/>On Guard again. An absolute calm</p>
<p>Friday 6<br/>Had a good night. No lights made very little difference as the Moon is full not being able to read made the watches a bit long. The Guard was not retiered untill afternoon because they did a lot of messing about to pick 75 men for a perminent Submarine Guard<br/>Boart Drill this evening. A big Whale showed up just beside us as we fell in first excitement for some time</p>
