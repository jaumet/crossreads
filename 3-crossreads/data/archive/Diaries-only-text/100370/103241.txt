28th We have been camped here now much longer than we at first expected, and at last after several false alarms, we are to move on this afternoon. Just the precise spot we are going to is unknown, I fancy. The orders are "as far up as we can get". Our horses have been having some excellent grazing while here. Down on the banks of the Jordan there is prairie grass, fox tail, wild barley and oats up to one's knees and more, and haven't the poor half starved nags revelled in it? Besides we have been pulling bagfuls of it for night feeds. It is exceedingly pretty down by the banks. Graceful willows and tamarisk trees line the banks, luxuriant undergrowth is everywhere, and the air is filled with the twittering of innumerable birds. Every now and then partridges emerge from cover with a whirr. Two mornings ago I walked down to see the river in daylight and performed the time honoured custom of washing in the Jordan. The waters are very muddy at present, but good drinking.
Just now the river is rising rapidly. Wadis where we walked dry-shod on our first visit, are now immense sheets of water, backwaters to the river. This is the water coming down from great Hermon and the mountains thereabouts. We can take no patients across at present. They have been extending the pontoon for a couple of days now, but the spread of the river is quicker.
We had a surprise early this morning. Just after sunrise a fleet of planes appeared, coming from the direction of the Turkish lines. "Hullo", said someone "our planes have been out early this morning". Next moment the "Archies" opened up and "our planes" which were really eleven Taubes, commenced dropping bombs.
Their aim was exceedingly bad, and they only dropped about a dozen bombs all told. Hundreds of horses and camels were grouped on the flats under them, but they evidently had "the wind up" to too great an
