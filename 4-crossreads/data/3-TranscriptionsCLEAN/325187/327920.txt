From England I got the Morning Post of June 6th giving full a/c  of Naval Battle [Following paragraphs crossed out] down in the right hand bottom corner of same page is an a/c of the strike of Melbourne Bakers & refusal of others to cart flour etc:- !!!!  Reads rather Small at such a time. At last we hear that some of the Managing Staff of the big Hotel in Cairo have been arrested we always felt that they were d---- Germans.
