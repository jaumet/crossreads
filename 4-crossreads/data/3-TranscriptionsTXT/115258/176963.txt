 was going in the week or so&nbsp;I was up there before the drawing man came, and I reported it to the  Adgt  Adjutant at the time and a guard was put on it afterwards. I am also posting one each to Aunt Katie and Mardie. In a letter to Father a week or so ago I mentioned posting him a Kai Ora Coo-ee news which gives us the war news - very warm here now. Unfortunately the copy I had was pinched, but there was not much in it that you would not see at home. I&#39;ll try and post another one along later.

Best love Mother dear 
 Your loving son
