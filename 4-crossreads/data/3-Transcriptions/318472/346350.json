<p>5 May 1918<br/>Rogation Sunday<br/>Nothing special doing today. In the afternoon I went for a walk out onto the Dinton Rd &ndash; then to Barford and from there back to camp. There is a very beautiful avenue on the Dinton Rd called I believe Dinton Avenue</p>
<p>1918 May 6<br/>Monday<br/>Just the same old Camp routine. I am still looking after No 8 Canteen. Have not heard anything about my Discharge</p>
