  
 laid out so enraptured am I that I have taken plans & intend to copy it if I can when I get home. 
 The back with its formal garden & rectangular paths, square plots of grass & ornamental yew flanked by hedges & yew gateways is very pretty whilst in the centre a huge hornbeam gives a lovely shade where afternoon tea is enjoyable below is a terrace & then lower still the tennis court flanked by 6 scotch firs 300 yrs old & then the river or rather back water & in the distance the far stretching field though not too far for Surrey is always hedged in 
 On left is a wilderness full of Rhodendron & azaeleas in full bloom which has completely caught my fancy for in a small space it has very long walk & 4 rustic bridges over a lake full of water lilies. The very fact that it has gone wild adds to its beauty in my eyes. 
 In the afternoon Miss Heaton Ellis & Miss [Pinches] come over & we start off with tennis for which I am very much handicapped having no slacks. Then follows afternoon tea in the shade of the thick hornbeam in the formal garden & the cool breeze that comes across while we recline in easy cane chairs reminds me of our cool breezes 
 The weather is delightful here. Bright sunshine & cool breezes, hot if you are working but pleasant if you are loafing around. 
 Tonight there is a dance & although I do not intend to dance I go & meet
