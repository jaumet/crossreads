  
 had a sort of pudding but it was that sweet that we could hardly eat it so our Xmas was not to flash was it. We had a very nice run coming across we passed some islands here & there & very pretty some of them look in the setting sun the water round this part of the world is a very pretty blue as we sailed south we could notice the weather getting warmer & warmer,  our only danger now was the submarines & we kept a pretty strict look out for them, we had to carry our lifebelts wherever we went & that is an infernal nuisance hanging round you.
