Today we are going over a little more of Cairo, but at present it is a little warm for walking and this is a good place to write. The Y.M.C.A. here is for Soldiers only they have a Skating Rink on which there is a game of Hockey proceeding at the Present moment. Now about myself there is little to tell except that I am in good health, and Received your letter written on the 17 Dec for which many thanks I received it after I came into camp on Tuesday I daresay it Reached Egypt before I did. Where we are going I cannot say, but I fancy we will be here Training for some time, there are of course plenty of rumours afloat. Regarding our destination when we leave, but I will know when we get there that is the most I can tell you. I found out that Alf Phillipss? Regiment is camped not far away so Tomorrow I may be able to look him up I will try anyway I will also try and see, May Bowman now I must close with heaps of love to all. Heaps for yourself Bett from your loving son CGP.
