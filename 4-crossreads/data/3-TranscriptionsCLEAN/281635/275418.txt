  
 amongst shell holes & along smashed up rail embankments & under shell fire for about 2 miles but there were no casualties. 12/10/17 Just a year today since went into camp at Dubbo. Marched all night with very few spells so all hands were very fatigued. Arrived front line 5.15am & 5.25 barrage started & we hopped over. Ground was very muddy & shell holes everywhere so that walking with our load was extremely difficult. Eventually arrived at 1st objective with very few casualties & were there held up
