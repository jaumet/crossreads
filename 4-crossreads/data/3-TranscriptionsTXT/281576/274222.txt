 Sat. May 19  After Break. we put all our things ready for the move off.  Brian Aspinall gave us our warrants &amp; about 12 we buzzed off to Bapaume station in a motor Amb.  It was a glorious day &amp; we were all in high spirits.  Arrived Bapaume station about 12.30 went to R.T.O's office to get our warrants examined.

On the way over we had some meat pies &amp; Tea down at the Canteen.  Arrived in Folkestone a bit after 6.  It was just glorious being in England again after having been away so many years.  People evidently knew ours was the Leave Train, as all along the route to London they waved their hand Kefs.  Arrived in London about 9.
