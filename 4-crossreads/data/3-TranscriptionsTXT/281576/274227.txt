Saturday May 26  Got up about 8 & went out quite early.  Had a shave.  Then I put my things together & prepared to go to Stone.  Bunny & Snowy came down to Euston with me & saw me on to the Train.  Arrived Stafford 4 p.m.  Caught Train to Stone at 4.50.  Arrived Stone about 5.30.  Saw Jem. Starkey & Topper Wooley on Station.  Didn't seem altered a bit.  Went to Crown & Anchor.  It was great to be under the old Thatch one more.  Looked into Unicorn Hotel.  Saw Ernest Jackson & had a great old yarn.  He's got awfully fat.  Just as left his shop met Mr Blakeman.  He would have me return then & there with him, so I went back to Shirleywich with him.  Frank met us with the Float. He has grown into a big chap.  Ruth & Mrs B. very pleased to see me.
Mrs B looks quite an old Lady.  The Shock of John's death must have affected her very much.  Mr B. looks quite well.  Much better than I expected.  Ruth has grown into quite a woman.  Jolly fine woman, too.  John's wife looks very well.  His son Alec is a bright bonnie kid.  His Grandma & Grandma think the world of him.  They made quite fuss of me.  Put me in such a lovely big room to sleep.  There were all kinds of Girls nick nacks hanging around & it made me feel quite Homesick.  Felt lost without pyjamas.  Slept soundly & peacefully.  Made me think quite a lot of M.S.  Bless Her.  Actually said my Prayers.  First time for years.
