  
 So I'll have to leave it till next time. 
 I'm feeling very gay today, we've just been relieved & came back for a spell after being 80 days (quite a record for the winter)  without a spell  & I've had a bath & clean change & find myself billeted in an old Chateau, much the worse for wear but with a few sound rooms left & here we have beds to sleep in & a fine fire to sit round & we've had a fine dinner & everything in the garden is lovely - only one thing lacking to make our happiness complete, the feminine, the sauce that savours our entire existence.  But I wish you could see this spot, "avant la guerre" it must have been indeed beautiful, & though in its ruin its grandens [grandness] still stands out it is of a sort to make one's
