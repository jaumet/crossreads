<p>whistling past and cutting the ground up all round. it was an experience The regiment is badly cut to pieces but we have the satisfaction of knowing that we did all we were asked to do. Numbers of the outposts were simply overwhelmed. Our Machine Gun Section up to the present has not reported. It will take days before we know how we stand. Dead men Dead horses Saddles lay strewn in our path We managed to get most of the wounded away Major Shannahan of B Squadron is badly wounded in the leg Lieut Woodyatt killed outright Major Markwell slightly wounded, Sergeant Rafter missing (so far) McAuley one of my men missing (so far) The remainder of them are safe with the exception of Duffy who is wounded.</p>
<p>5.p.m.<br/>Collected most of the regiment and we are at present taking cover in a palm grove lined a long a ridge. We have had a hard struggle all day to turn the tide of the battle but by now we have the situation well in hand. The Turks tried their hardest to get in around the back of us.</p>
<p>6pm.<br/>The situation now is that the Turks around our flank have "imsheed" and are apparantly in retreat.</p>
<p>From 6 pm till 4.30 AM. 6.8.16  [not sure why this date is here in the diary.  It is out of sequence]</p>
