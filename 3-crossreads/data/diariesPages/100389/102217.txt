11th Sunday. The battalion arrived today on board HMT "Scotia".
At 9 pm all horses were fed & watered and at 10 pm sharp we started off for the railway siding. By 2.30 am 12th inst all horses and vehicles were entraine, and we moved off at 2.35 am, when all hands turned in for a hard earned sleep. About 7.30 am I was awakened to find that we were stopped at Orange. Here we watered and fed our horses and had our breakfast and after an hours stop left at 8.30 am. The surrounding country was beautiful and well under cultivation every inch even the mountain sides being utilised. After about 5 minutes we stopped for about 40 minutes at Mornas to pick up water, leaving at 9.20 am. Then we cut along at the rate of about 40 miles an hour, flashing through the most beautiful scenery I have ever yet seen and I would not have missed seeing it for the world. 12 noon found
