<p>&amp; we had a very nasty "barrage" to go through for old Fritz must have got a lot more guns up for he was giving the ridge we had to cross a taste of heavy shell fire, however we managed to get through without any casualities is a mystery to me for it seemed impossible once we had to scatter &amp; take cover in shell holes for the shelling was severe he hit building after building &amp; set them alight &amp; soon the whole countryside was lit up as by a gigantic bonfire &amp; you could see people moving everywhere, she gave every promise of a very lively night &amp; perhaps an attack by the way he was "barraging", so I said to Mr Beckett lets get across this strip as soon as we can &amp; take a chance for it looks as if we will be wanted tonight, I was thinking the same he said, so he gave the signal</p>
