<p>Novembre 16<br/>Had quiet morning in the afternoon went up to town &amp; Mr &amp; Mrs Smith &amp; Danny went to see "Bubbly" at the Comedy Theatre. Had a real good old laugh &amp; the show was very good.</p>
<p>Novembre 17<br/>Had intended going to see Theodore &amp; Co but had a wire from Jack saying that he was coming to see me so waited for him. He got here about 6 p.m. &amp; after tea he &amp; I went up to town &amp; had a knock round. Went to the Savoy Hotel - another one I cannot think of the name just now &amp; Murray's Night Club where Jack is a member. Got back about 12.30 am.</p>
