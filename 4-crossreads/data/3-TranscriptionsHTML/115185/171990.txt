<p>Same salvation for them as for men and one realizes that bearing babes and tending husbands is the best way of enobling women en mass &ndash; and one bows in acknowledgement of the simple but enduring wisdom of the teller of the story of Adam &amp; Eve.<br/>I have just made a little cap for Baby Clapin who is expected in June. Basil Greatrex is in Salonika I think. I have not heard from Clapin since Christmas &ndash; in fact I have not had any English letters since Gibson left and I am rather worried. I expect it is just that the time slips by so quickly that one forgets to write. The cap I bought at Mount Lavinia on my way to England and I have had it all the way at Lemnos too Clapin's wish. just one of those little lace things &ndash; and I lined it with a bit of silk and made a ruche &amp; some rosettes and must let it take its chance in the post. I forget when I wrote you last but I think I haven't written since Major Mon's friend Captain Mortimer came to Cairo last Sunday, all of a sudden and called for me and Patsy in a glorious car and motored us to the Pyramids and then to the Barrage and thanked us profusely</p>
