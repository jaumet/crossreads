 and yet in every case from Admirals to ships' boys there was this 
 wonderful quality of extreme gentleness bred no doubt of a life 
 long service in that wonderful institution - the Royal Navy.  I

 early days of the Gallipoli land campaign. 
      A very keen interest is maintained by the Navy in 
 the doings of the armies and I did not see a Ward Room or Gun Room
