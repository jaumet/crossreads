 Saturday 3 March 1917 
 I am writing this at Shepherds Hotel where I met my wife nearly 2 years ago now. Did an examination this morning &amp; a Staff Ride. In addition to a Cavalry School, other ranks all at different courses. 
 One of our boys was being cursed for not saluting &amp; the Instructor said "You are more Trouble than any other Unit operating in Egypt". Reply was "That is what the Turkssay". 
 TOM Austin is here one of Bertie's sons I think he is, he got wounded at MAGDAHASA, but is alright now.
