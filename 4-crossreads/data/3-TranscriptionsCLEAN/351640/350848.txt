  
 the discomfort.   28.5.15. Hot!  Jolly hot!!!  Yesterday, the day before, & during the night.   From noon till 5 p.m. the heat is greater than any to which my face has been subjected before.  It may be that the turning back of the suns rays by the sand gives greater effect to them, than the same hot air would possess were it first to touch a green surface.   However with brief experience and only on the edge of the dessert with all agree that the title "Burning sands of Egypt" is well deserved. 
 At the moment of writing 8 am the promise of a scorching day is great, and most likely the promise will be kept.  However ours is the task and it must be carried through without growling.   A letter is partly finished to M. M.Thomas, it will go forward by the same mail as does this. 
 We are not feeling quite secure in this country.  It is somewhat apparent that the would be turbulent element has an idea that our troops are being beaten in Turkey, and that the armies of the Allies are not making headway at other points in the theatre of war.  The local change is much in evidence in the altered demeanour of the aggressive Native.  He who is a sympathiser with the Turk, as a Mohamedan, and with the deposed Kehdive lately driven from the country.   Insolence in behaviour in the street is now not uncommon towards a white man.   Such would not be dreamed of a few months back. 
 This Ember Friday at 9.40 a.m. is developing into a real scorcher.   What it will be at 4 p.m. one can but imagine, however if I be not grease by then you may expect report.
