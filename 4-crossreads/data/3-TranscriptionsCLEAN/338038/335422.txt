  
 VIII manage to scrape through with what I have.  I was reckoning on the Edinburgh trip being more expensive. Am enclosing a few more snaps taken on the day we left here for our Board.  They are not the best but will give you a rough idea of the place - Must say goodbye now With fondest love to you both I am your affectionate Son Terence
