<p>Dear Judge</p>
<p>Please excuse this very hurried but I wrote you about a week ago. Since then I have 2 letters of yours just arrived of 16.XI.15 &amp; 10.1.16. The Post is most irregular &ndash; Re your Amelioration Committee, I send list of 4th men. Also rough plans of Anzac. All maps were destroyed by order.</p>
<p>Excuse more &ndash; most awfully busy &ndash;</p>
