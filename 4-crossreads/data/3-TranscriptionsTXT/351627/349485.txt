 Heliopolis 7th July 1915 
 My dear Aunty I have received several very welcome letters both from you &amp; Aunt Evie since I landed in Egypt; 
 I suppose you are wondering why I have not written before; we did not get very much time for writing in Egypt. I have written very few letters &amp; I am sorry I did not write to you before; we left for the Dardanelles on Sunday 16th May at 5. p.m. &amp; arr. there at 9 p.m. on the 18 landed on the 20th
