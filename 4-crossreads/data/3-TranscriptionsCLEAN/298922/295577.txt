Sunday 23rd September
[This page crossed through.] Cancelled.I bought this book some time ago thinking I would not want it but I hope to keep going to the finish now.
Went Y.M.C.A. to Church. The usual ranting Yankee type of preacher these places go in for. I get on well with the native servants here as I address them all as "MOHAMMED". Am reading "The way of an Eagle", E. Dell & trying to forget - but its desperate this waiting. Now I'm told Thursday next - others say Oct. 2. I've had to cable again to the little wife explaining delay. No Australian mails for weeks & weeks now.
