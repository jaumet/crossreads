sound of shell explosions ? big ? in advance of this town place. Early this morning was a terrific bombardment and a heavier and louder crackle of machine guns going mad than ever heard before. About 5 pm the Colonel was warned to stand by ready to move and that we would hop over in the morning at 5 am. Great excitement and bustle.
