<p>Thursday 26 July 1917</p>
<p>PARCEL. Mother's parcel arrived safely, but the extreme heat had melted the sweets &amp; the TIN was broken. Shortbread &amp; pudding very good also buttons, many thanks for same.</p>
<p>We go into the Trenches for a week after tomorrow to give our Horses a spell &ndash; it is too hot for large operations, the Infantry couldn't stand it, but they make raids at night, just to keep Johnny Turk jumping.</p>
<p>On outpost tonight. <strike>The [indecipherable] appear in the Tommy Sections [indecipherable]</strike></p>
