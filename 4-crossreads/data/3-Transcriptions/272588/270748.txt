<p>Saturday 3 August<br/>At Racquinghem, into which village I went for a walk this morning.  This afternoon I went into St. Omer &amp; walked round but the town is fairly dead. The gardens are very pretty.  Very wet at intervals.  News of a brilliantly successful attack from Rheims, the French retaking Soissons &amp; I think that that front is our destination.</p>
<p>Sunday 4 August<br/>Fine to-day.<br/>A walk round the country this afternoon &amp; the country is beautiful, cropped heavily &amp; nicely timbered in the valleys.  The view from the hill to the south includes Cyere Lillers &amp; the slag heaps of Bethune.</p>
