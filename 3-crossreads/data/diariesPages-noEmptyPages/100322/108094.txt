Edinburgh
legend says, was killed by the jealous master. We had a most interesting drive back through pleasant country ? a Scotch severity sameness being visible in all the buildings. As regards Edinburgh I was regretfully compelled to admit that German streets are much cleaner. Midshipman Jock Hughes Hallett of HMS Lion was in to afternoon tea and is a fine lad much grown since last we met. What a down a lot of these people in these old countries have on the poor unfortunate worker! We dined and afterwards went into the gardens immediately opposite and there sat and talked until late. Came back and listened to a deal of music and drank several w's and s's with the Colonel before going to bed. Today Miss Thompson ? under sentence of death from the doctor in 3 mos. brave unconcerned but taking little drug tabloids.
