<p>Gallipoli 7-9-15<br/>Dear Keith, I was delighted to receive a letter from you today. All the more delighted because my luck with mails has been absolutely rotten. There was a big mail in today &amp; I got letters from you &amp; from Stennett of the 25th. I think you have heard of him. It seems ages since I got a word from home. I received 3 newspapers addressed in the Judge's writing and bearing the SCONE postmark from which I conclude that he is at last on the long promised trip to see Wingen Abbotts prickly pears. The papers are dated 25 July. Papers are always very welcome &amp; I have had a good number from the Judge. I am sorry you are felling so sick about things but of course can quite realise what it feels like but I shall not preach. We have had a fair amount of excitement from time to time but we are all fairly well used to it by now. The first real scrap we got up against about half the company were ordered into the attack. I was detailed O.C. supports &amp; just had to sit behind a hill &amp; listen while hell was let loose. You can have not the faintest idea what the noise is like anywhere within a quarter of a mile of the firing line you have to yell to make the man next to you hear.</p>
