We are being paid tonight and it will come in handy as I am stony again in fact I never seem to be anything else lately. It has been an awful day Tons of dust seems to be flying round. I have been doing practically nothing all day. Took a few observations with one of our Subalterns this morning. He doesn’t know anything at all about Artillery work.

Half holiday today. Wrote long letter to Adelaide Smith in reply to one from her.
Also wrote Liz Williams yesterday. The pay has been deferred until tonight I understand I could easily get home as unfit with my deformed toes. Lieut Cullen was out with us this morning. He doesn’t know much about Directors work. I got very wild with him telling me I didn’t know much about it and, considering it is very like a theodolite and I was instructing him I didn’t like it

Nothing much has happened today. A new man named Stevens is our the Duirector with us now making 5 of us. Gunners, Burting, Bourke, Hilder, Stevens and myself. Went round and saw Russ and Edric tonight and we had a supper at the Canteen consisting of tin peaches and biscuits. We will probably be having a bit of a go at the Turks again in a few days as they are only 2 days march away – I understand summer parade hours are coming in soon.

A lot of troops have been going out to the trenches this morning so evidently something is brewing. Lt Cullen has gone out with a couple of guns. It will keep us here a little longer worse luck. We should have been away by now to keep to the schedule. A few boat loads of Chinese have gone through lately to France to work as labourers in the field. Russian troops have also gone through towards Suez.
