<p>At present we are running an advanced dressing station close up behind the line in a valley torn up by shells. So far the position has been a safe one, the enemy paying attention to adjacent positions. The wounded we have through are in a shocking state as a rule, soaked through with water &amp; caked with mud, 'tis a wonder they can exist without contracting pneumonia much less suffer their wounds. Am in charge of the station at night coming on at 8.30 P.M. till 8.30 A.M. which suits me very well indeed. I sleep well during the day &amp; am comfortable at night as I work alongside a good fire. It has one drawback, it prevents me from exploring the neighbourhood</p>
