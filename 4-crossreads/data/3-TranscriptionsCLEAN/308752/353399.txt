"Welcome to Bearers".   Christmas Dinner was a huge success, 5 courses, Soup, Rissoles, Vegetables, Plum Pudding & Custard, Fruit & nuts.  We all made beasts of ourselves. The Colonel made a fine speech & welcomes the Bearers home again. The tea was also good, jelly, custard & preserved fruits. In the evening a splendid concert was given in the mess tent. All our Officers were present.  Some of the skits, mentioning different fellows & Officers in the Unit, wee very clever & funny. A very pleasant day.
Tuesday 26th December 1916.Boxing Day. No parades or fatigues today. All enjoying a rest. Attended a Vaudiville Concert at the village in the evening. A splendid show, our silvery tenor Bob Roberts is one of the artists. He has been transferred to the Company for a few days. I think he will find it a better job than Stretcher Bearing.
29th December 1916. Had leave to one of the biggest towns in France. The car leaves every morning & returns to the Chateau
