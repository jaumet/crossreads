 [Monday 17 April 1916] 
 Palm Sunday was really kept up here &amp; the Copts decorated their Church.  I watched a Native putting the Pollen from one tree to another, first sprinkling the flowers of the female tree with Sugar cane juice, which he chewed &amp; spat out, so that the other pollen will stick on. On enquiry I hear that it is 7 years before the Female flowers, &amp; 2 years before the Male does, only the former bears dates, but the sex may change in a few rare occassions. Male tree has smaller thorns &amp; harder &amp; blossoms before the Female as a rule. The dates are sown in the fibre of another tree 6" in the ground about 100 stones to the square foot &amp; when they come up the male seedlings are straight &amp; strong the females weaker &amp; bent- the proportion about 2 of the later to 1 of former as the Males do not bear only a few trees are transplanted (I feel a bit sick from Virus)
