 of four days. 
 The institutions, such as the Y.M.CA, War Chest Club and other hostels are much appreciated by the soldiers on leave in London. I had the good fortune to meet many kind people, who were only too  happ  pleased to show one places of interest. I had the good fortune to visit other places in London on another occasion, in June of this year 1917. 
 On Jan 11th 1917 we entrained again for Codford from Paddington, reaching our camp about 10 o'clock after having spent a fine time in "dear old Blighty". 
 Training again commenced in earnest, we had some particularly fine falls of snow in January and February; they were novel sights to most of us; they were particularly fine too. 
 About a couple of miles from Codford, one could visit quaint old fashioned little villages Wyle and Stockton by name, each village had an historical tale to be told by its villagers. 
 The pretty winding streams and the old fashioned watermills were very pleasing to the eye. Likewise the ever winding roads and the hedges in place of fences, as we were accustomed to see in Australia. I can still picture in mind the quaint old fashioned churches, with the (in Pencil) War Crest Club was opposite AIF HQ's in Horseferry Rd. Set up by Brig Gen Sir Robert Anderson.
