<p>1915<br/>Dec. 8 Wed.<br/>Got a garry &amp; drove into Alex &amp; then right out to Mex where we had afternoon tea &ndash; splendid drive. Came back to Gabbary &amp; drove along Mahmoudieh Canal to the Catacombs &ndash; over 2000 years old &amp; very interesting &ndash; then to Pompey's Pillar with its 2 Sphinxes &amp; excavations. Then back into Alex, where we dismissed the arbagi at 6 p.m. &amp; had dinner. Attended early performance at Casino Bellevue which finished at 8.30. Back to Ras-el-Tin by garry.<br/>Whole day cost me 22&frac12; piastres. Very cheap.</p>
