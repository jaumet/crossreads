<p>[Transcriber's notes:<br/>Many parts of this diary, sent home as letter pages, have been censored at a later date by person unknown.  Some of the over-written words do not appear to be correct and have been written as originally intended by the author where discernable. In many cases personal information has been crossed out with the word "omit" and later, due to Army censorship, other sections are also crossed out.</p>
