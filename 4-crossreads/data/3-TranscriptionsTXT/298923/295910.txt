1 September 1918 SundayAIN- DUK   Everything very quiet "Jericho Jane" fires a 100 lb shell now & again into Jericho & a few 77s come along but nothing to worry us.Went & explored a wild Wadi not far from here, impossible for Horses, saw some wild goats & a species of MONGOOSE.  These wadis are rushing streams in Winter draining the higher land into the Valley   Am afraid my Notes have little of interest these days we are so fed up with everything down here & only look for the end-I do hope Joe is alright & gets back inside his 6 mos.
