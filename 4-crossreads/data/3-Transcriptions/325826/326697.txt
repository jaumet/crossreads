<p>7.   15.12.15.  Here we are almost at Colombo, on a beautifully roasty day and fairly choked with information as to what to see from the "Book of Ceylon" which Mr Leckie managed somehow or other to procure only this morning.  So far we have only just seen coastline &amp; are excited even at that.<br/>Am hoping to send a little later news from Colombo to-morrow as we stay here to-night.  We are due in about 2 to-day at the latest &amp; do not leave till 6.p.m to-morrow night.  I am so glad it is fine even though it is hot to roasting.<br/>Now just while I think of it Father dear when you are fixing my debts to you don't forget all those items in Adelaide such as 2/- train fare and a couple of such like things will you.<br/>My money is still lasting out but I expect a fair bit to go to-day specially as I want to get a Ceylon panama hat.  Gwen is getting one too!</p>
