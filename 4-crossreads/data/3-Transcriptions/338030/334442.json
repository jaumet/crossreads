<p>On Friday, 8/6/17, I rejoined the B.A.C.<br/>Each night, while at the dump, it was impossible to hear one another speak as the artillery resembles continuous thunder of intense variety, lasting from sunset to sunrise.<br/>On Sunday, 10/6/17, took a walk to Steenwerck after tea and went to pictures.<br/>On Tuesday, 12/6/17, Fritz shelled the village. People left their homes to seek safer quarters, carrying their belongings with them. One shell blew up a house, but no one was in it at the time. I afterwards saw the poor chap hunting among the ruins for his belongings, some of which he was collecting in a bucket. Another shell killed two girls, while another landed in a back yard but, luckily, it was a dud.<br/>On Wednesday I joined the 7th Battery.<br/>On Sunday, 17/6/17, we shifted camp to the other side of Neuve Eglise.<br/>On Monday rejoined B.A.C.<br/>Wednesday, 20/6/17, three taubes came over and brought down two observation balloons. The same day my wheel driver got wounded in the neck, also another chap and a couple of horses. In the night took a trip to guns with ammunition on pack horses, as the road was nothing else but shell-holes. We left at 9 p.m. and rode to dump, packed our horses and led them about 3 miles to guns. Got back at 12.30 a.m.</p>
