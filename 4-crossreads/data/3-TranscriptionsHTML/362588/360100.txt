<p>No. 50925</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In continuation of my letter of 20th August, relative to a communication from Mr. Justice Ferguson, regarding troops sent from Australia to Gallipoli, I am desired to inform you that complete arrangements are made to ensure reinforcements receiving adequate training, either in Australia or Egypt, before being drafted to their units at the front.</p>
<p>2.  In order to ensure a high standard of efficiency, recent instructions have been issued that, before any soldier leaves Australia, he must complete the musketry course prescribed for the British Army.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br/>T. Trumble<br/>Acting Secretary.</p>
<p>The Hon. W.M. Hughes, M.P.,<br/>Attorney-General,<br/>Melbourne.</p>
