9-7-16Sun 9thWe filed on to the parade ground up to time last night, & at 11 oclock the Bde (minus 3rd Regt) started for Oghratina  had a good trip as the night was cool, & arrived at Oghratina at daylight this morning & soon after heard 3 aeroplane bombs go off a long way out. (apparently the 2nd had got somewhere near the enemy)
We fed & watered our horses, had breakfast, & commenced our return journey at 10.30 this morning & arrived back in camp at 3.30 this afternoon, a cool breeze was blowing from the sea & the ride was not uncomfortable;I asked Mills what he thought of the trip when he got back & he said he will be much more contented as Sig Sergeant in the detail camp after & is not a anxious to get back to the Regt as he was.
