  
 17.4.15 Sat. 17th.  Had to make bag-rugs to keep the flies off the horses this morning (more army rot) & put the rest of the morning in cleaning gear.  I received a pass out from 1 p.m. till 10 p.m. & put in this afternoon in the Y.M.C.A. writing, had a game of billiards before tea, more boxing etc. after tea.  There was a concert at the Y.M.C.A. tonight, put in some time there, but it was too monotonous, as I have heard all the singers & songs scores of times retired to bed early.
