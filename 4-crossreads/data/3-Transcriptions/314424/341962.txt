<p>I built a cook house by digging a hole into the bank two posts in front, a few sticks for rafters &amp; a tarpolian for a roof. I will sleep in it tonight pending making a dugout. Last night Cliff Thomson &amp; I slept between two bales of [Indecipherable] hay &amp; some sheets of iron on top.</p>
<p>It is very cloudy this afternoon &amp; warm. There are numerous planes about including some of the enemies.</p>
<p>Major Storey has been reappointed Second in Command and reinstated.</p>
