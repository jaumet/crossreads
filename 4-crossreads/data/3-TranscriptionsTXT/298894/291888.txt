We reached the post office &amp; wrote several post cards home being attended to by a very civil attendant who procured pens &amp; bought our stamps etc  We then took Rickshaws to the Galle Face Hotel a palatial establishment on the ocean Beach when I got outside a large bottle of English Beer  Then were taken through the Malay quarter back to the town centre.  Entering a shop with the idea of buying something small I finished up by buying 2 dressing jackets &amp; a silk scarf for my mother sister and sister-in-law respectively.

From here we took a Rickshaw to the native quarter &amp; passed through the markets, getting a man to describe the different fruits &amp; vegetables &amp; showing  us how to chew Betel nut.  We bought Plantains &amp; Pineapples to value of 3/- having beaten them down in price somewhat.  Returning we had dinner at the Bristol Hotel
