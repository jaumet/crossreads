 Sept. 16 . On account of the battalion 's weak , " A" and " D" Compani amalgam , form four platoon and " B" " C" each form three platoon . This made in all 10 platoon instead of 16 which we had alway had , previous to this . We were at this time well under full half full battalion strength which is consider weak for a battalion to be . Howev the grit was still in it and that was the main thing . In this way the battalion was reorganis . Sept 17 . On the afternoon of the next day , 17th Sept. , rather unexpect news was given to us . That night we were to move up and anoth attack was to be made the next morn . These attack were rather frequent but we were advanc and win , which was someth to know . Map and airial photo of the ground , over which we were to advanc , were distribut among the N.C.Os . and show to the men . An account and instruct of the procedur of the attack were given . After that we all had a good look at the map photo and we then knew as much of the countri as it was possibl for us to know . This idea of absolut convid in the troop , which was adopt toward the latter end of the War , prove to be a veri good thing becaus everi individu soldier knew approxim what to do and where to go without have to alway depend on offic or N.C.Os . After have tea that afternoon we st set too and got thing readi . Ammunit , bomb , sandbag , etc . were issu out and we put our equip togeth .
