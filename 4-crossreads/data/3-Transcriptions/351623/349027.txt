<p>I went to London for leave. There were two air raids over London while I was there. Things were pretty lively while the German planes were over. The underground tube stations were pretty full of women &amp; children taking cover. I was standing not far from Covent Gardens when a bomb dropped on it. The anti airguns kept up a continuous barrage. I caught a glimpse of the German planes like white spots when they passed close to the moon. I had a good time while on leave so good in fact that I did not come back to the ship on the 8th Feb. as supposed to but got back to the ship 6 days adrift.</p>
