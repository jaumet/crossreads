I spent most of the morning in the fighting top watching the effect of this fire, but as the shells mostly fell in the valleyes or on the reverse slopes it was difficult to see how much damage we were really inflicting.Nevertheless it was gratifying to receive signals from the shore such as "Your shooting is splendid, you assisted us most materially". Meanwhile fresh troops stores, ammuntion and guns were being disembarked without cessation, and every hour thus gained materially improved our position.
