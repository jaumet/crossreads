<p>There we had an hour to spare &amp; roamed around the place &amp; made various purchases of nuts figs etc.  It was good to get ashore again.  A mail was distributed in the evening &amp; I received one from Fan.</p>
<p>Thursday 15th Acted as mess orderly today &amp; came in contact with a corporal.  He sat down at my table to write thereby causing much inconvenience to me cleaning up.  Being asked to shift he declined saying that he was privileged   I told him that I had no wish to quarrel but was met with insolence so called up a sergeant who promptly removed him telling him he ought to have more sense.  During the day some of the chaps thanked me for taking a stand against a non-com.  16th Nothing to chronicle except the receipt of two letters one from Fan &amp; one from Mum, very welcome indeed.</p>
<p>17th My birthday.  27 years old.  Time is passing quickly &amp; I seem to be getting very old  My last birthday was spent in London, where will I have the next?.  This morning we rowed ashore &amp; had a short march to the top of a hill.  From here I counted 50 transports the warships being too much mixed up with colliers etc to get their number.  Saw the submarine cruising around again today as well as a couple of mine sweepers   Ian Hamilton was on shore so expect something to be doing shortly.  The land shews an almost entire absence of trees.  Fig trees being the only ones in sight, poppies &amp; other flowers amongst the corn reminded me of English fields</p>
<p>Sunday 18th  Have just been informed that I am to return with a party to look after sick returning to Alexandria.  Although I managed to get someone</p>
