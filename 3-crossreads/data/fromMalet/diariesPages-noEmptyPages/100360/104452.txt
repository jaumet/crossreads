Mon. Oct. 22. Another glorious day. Smithy & I went out on the verandah. Hooray, 4 Zepps brought down in France. That’s jolly good news. They did a lot of damage in London though beforehand. Mary Blakeman came to see me during the afternoon & stayed about 2 hours. Wrote Letter 40 to M.S. We are having a Bun Fight tomorrow & everyone is quite excited.

Tues. 23. Nurses & sisters & maids are all flying around preparing for tonight’s Feed. Boxes & Parcels of Good things are arriving in Big Quantities. At 3.30 Nurse Jarrett came round & started to get us ready. Packed us up in wheeled chairs & wrapped us well up in rugs. Then we were placed in position at the Tables. It was a great spread & we did full justice to the good things provided. A Lady paid for it all, & after one of our Sergts had made a little speech, thanking her, we were allowed to attack.

There were Tomatoes, Brown Bread & Butter (2/11 a lb) Cakes of all kinds, Lollies & Chocolates & a Pkt of Cigarettes & Box Matches per man, & plenty of Sugar in the Tea & Meat Pies. Gee! what a Great Feed it was. The Food Controller would have had a Fit had he seen the Spread. After Tea we had a jolly good Concert. I sang the evergreen "Spanish Onion" which always seems to take. Sister Wicker gave us a number of songs in her usual charming style & Nurse Jarrett gave us quite a lot of twiddley stuff on her violin accomp’d by Nurse Wilson on the Piano. A Miss Grimshaw caused a lot of amusement by rendering a number of quaint songs
