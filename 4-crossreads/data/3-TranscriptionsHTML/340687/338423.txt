<p>April, 1917. 3rd after Easter. Sunday 29<br/>Perfect day. Up at 8 and went down to A.M.C. for teeth. No good, come again to-morrow. They were voting so I voted too &amp; then went down for rations which only came at 11.30. Only fair. Tried to pump but ran hot again. Went down to company and got some more asbestos and also got leave to Amiens 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. to-morrow. Home about 5. Tried to pump but still hot. Saw Savage in evening &amp; got some [indecipherable] told troubles. Bonza mail to-day &amp; two from Melv.</p>
