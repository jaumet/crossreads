<p>sleeping quarters last week, but it became so dreadfully hot down stairs that we determined to find a cooler sleeping-place and so last night we took our hammocks right up on to the top of the forecastle and slung them side by side from the railing to a pair of bosses just about 20 feet from the prow of the ship &amp; with nothing overhead but the star-spangled canopy of heaven.<br/>By 9 o'clock we were hidden between the sides of our hammocks &amp; were soon asleep on the deep' The air was delightfully fresh, even cold, &amp; we rose at 5.30, feeling quite renewed in vigor. Needless to say, we intend sleeping there every night until we meet wet weather.</p>
<p>I have been made orderly for out table for this week &amp; on that account am freed from all other duties &amp; so J.D.M is to be seen all day long,</p>
