  
 I am enclosing a couple of postcards one for Mother. This show was on while I was in London, I saw the last two performances & it was excellent, we used a deserted French concert hall & had the assistance of the Y.M.C.A. for lighting & piano. By the bye I met my old Manager Carl Cameron the other day he is a private in 18th Bn. I     had a great yam with him over old times etc. Ken
