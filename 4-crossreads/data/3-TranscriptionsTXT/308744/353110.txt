 Details of the above combats are as follows:- A Bristol Fighter engaged on Hostile Aircraft patrol on the 2nd, dived on an enemy two-seater which immediately dived and attempted to avoid combat by flying very low over his own troops. The pilot of the Bristol fighter was able to fire several good bursts into it at close range. The enemy machine did not return the fire, but just put his nose down and, owing to his great speed escaped in the direction of HUJ. The second, a two-seater biplane was engaged later in the day, by two Bristol Fighters. 400 rounds were fired at him, and he was driven down to within a few hundred feet of the ground over his own lines. A Bristol Fighter met an enemy single-seater Scout over BEERSHEBA on the morning of the 5th. The enemy aircraft attempted to escape after the first few bursts had been fired at him, but did not succeed in shaking off the Bristol until he was over his own lines at less than 4,000 feet. 
 On the same day, a two-seater attacked an R.E.8, engaged on reconnaissance. The enemy aircraft dived on the tail of the R.E. 8, but turned out of his dive on receiving several short bursts from the observer's gun. The pilot of the R.E.8 then fired a burst with his front gun. The enemy aircraft put his nose down and flew off to the North. 
 A B.E. 12.A. met and engaged a formation of three enemy machines also on the 3rd., breaking it up, and driving the machines off in the direction of RAMLEH. 
 On the morning of the 6th, a Bristol Fighter engaged an enemy formation of 2 two-seaters and a scout. Early in the fight the observer of the Bristol fired a good burst into one of the two-seaters which turned on its side and then dived, but as both pilot and observer of the Bristol were engaged in fighting the second two-seater the fate of the first was not observed. The second machine was finally chased down to a low height over his own lines, the Scout made no attempt to attack the Bristol. 
 On the afternoon of the 6th a Bristol Fighter engaged two enemy machines (two-seater) near DABKAL. After firing a long burst at one, the front gun of the Bristol jammed. The enemy aircraft went down in a spin and the second was engaged by the Observer and chased far behind his lines. The Bristol then returned to its patrol area. Half and hour later two more enemy two-seaters were seen and engaged in spite of the fact that the Bristol's front gun was out of action. After 15 minutes fighting the enemy aircraft broke off the engagement and were pursued to their aerodrome. The Bristol had just resumed it's patrol when four enemy aircraft were sighted (2 two-seaters and 2 single seaters). They were attacked and one was driven down in a spin but was seen to pull out when near the ground, and fly off apparently under control. The Bristol had then to break off the fight as the observer had exhausted his ammunition and the pilots gun was useless. /On the 6th
