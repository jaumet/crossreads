Got quit a thrill when two submarin rose to the surfac about half a mile away , till I saw that they were fli the French Flag . A veri busi port this ; the dock space is veri conjest . Saw and enorm four funnel Hospit ship . the " La Franc " . Four , ridicul small tug swung our ship into dock ; on the end of the dock sat a french soldier catch small fish like sardin . Land at 1 P.M. and march through the street to the railway side . The French peopl seem elat to see us . Entrain immedi and I got into a first class compart , it seem luxuri after travel in truck . Left for Northern Franc at 2 P.M.
