<p>Wareham<br/>Dorsetshire<br/>26 January 1917<br/>Dear Beatrice/.</p>
<p>Say we are still in Ypres:-</p>
<p>The irregular shape of the shadow dragon is moving past us still.<br/>To our question 'are you going in" it has answered "yes"<br/>the tail of it comes at last</p>
<p>We step off the kerb and melt into it.<br/>We feel men with our shouldering</p>
<p>"Well lads", we ask "where have you come from"<br/>"From the huts down there by the Engineers saw mill" someone replies.<br/>"About five miles back" another voice chips in<br/>"But we've come from the Somme before that", grumbles a third voice.<br/>"Was there a chap named Snowy Backthorn with you"</p>
