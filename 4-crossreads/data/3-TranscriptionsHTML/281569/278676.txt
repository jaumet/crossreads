<p>94 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Reveille as usual</p>
<p>Signal Stns were out all the morning &amp; good work was effected, went out for a ride in the afternoon &amp; later on went down to the Sig Sqd.</p>
<p>Reports are just as usual our troops met with every success on the last stunt although on one occasion when three sqds were deploying one mistook the direction &amp; in so doing allowed a patrol of the enemy to slip away, one only being captured, he being mounted on a slow camel.</p>
<p>More facts have come to hand concerning the doings of the yeomantry officers who were out at Duidae &amp; when surprised by the Turks surrendered without a fight well nigh on two sqds were cut up the 5th went out &amp; got em out of a scrape.</p>
