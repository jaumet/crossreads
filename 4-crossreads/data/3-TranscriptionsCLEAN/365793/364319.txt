  
 Aug 9 cigars, sox etc. Pretty good breakfast, so will only mention complaints in future. "Destroyer left us & returned home about 10 30", so we're pretty safe now- Deck chairs galore have been handed out, the Canteen is open, & this afternoon we get our red cross gift. "Head feels pretty crook". The Red + kit consisted of shirts, sox, towels, soap, pyjamas, choc, shoes etc etc. Hanged if I know how we're going to carry all our kit. Issued with 4 pkts of cigs (or 1/4 pound of tob'y) Capstan too. The Latrines are tip top.
