To my surprise Fritz didn't pour over his usual supply of shells tonight, in fact sent none, wonder what his game is. Saty. 4 May It rained for about 10 minutes in the night, &amp; oh Lor', mud, it's something awful. Such a small fall would make no difference in our country, but here it's vile. It was heartbreaking to see the state my rifle was in this morning. Goodness only knows how the chaps live &amp; get their tucker, &amp; are able to move the bolt of their rifles when it's winter time &amp; properly wet &amp; muddy. It turned out a glorious sunny day with blue sky. Those lovely little singing birds, the skylarks, we whistling sweeter than canaries before day broke. They keep singing as they rise up &amp; up out of sight, &amp; come back to earth in one straight swift dive. I was only thinking what a cursed thing this war is, no one wants to go to war on either side, but yet it goes on month after month, year after year &amp; thousands of good men are mutilated daily. Those fighting have no say in the matter, &amp; the women at home don't know what happens, or public opinion would demand the end. Not that I'm not here voluntarily, &amp; anxious &amp; proud to do my bit ( I wouldn't be a shirker for anything) but I'm speaking of the hellish thing called war. Our guns are shelling Fritz occasionally this morning, but he's uncannily quiet again.
