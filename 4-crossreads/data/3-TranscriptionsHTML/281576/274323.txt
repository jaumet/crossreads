<p>On the Day on which Peace is declared &ndash; Last verse</p>
<p>Now we'll all join together &amp; sing the last verse,<br/>The first part of our Programme is ended<br/>If we've given you a prod we didn't mean worse<br/>And we hope there  is no one offended<br/>So cheer up, be merry, for tomorrow we die<br/>All the Anzacs are leaving the Somme bye &amp; bye</p>
<p>On the day on which Peace is declared<br/>We might have been worse had we dared<br/>Farewell to our dugouts, the whizzbang &amp; dud<br/>Farewell to rum Issues, shell holes &amp; the mud<br/>We'd like to come back to the Somme if we could<br/>On the day on which Peace is declared.</p>
<p>Well I had some words of a different kind<br/>O! isn't that singular<br/>And it's strange that I haven't gone out of my mind.<br/>O isn't that singular.<br/>Nancy pushed Lille down Estaires it appears<br/>And Albert called in to lesson her fears<br/>But the poor Girl Laon his Armentieres.<br/>O! isn't that singular?<br/>Yes very peculiar</p>
<p>Well theres one good may come of America's action<br/>O isn't that etc<br/>Apart from driving old Fritz to distraction<br/>O wont that be singular.<br/>Privates in the Army will be so very rare<br/>There'll be nothing but stars &amp; stripes in the Air<br/>If they ask for a star, why they'll chuck you a pair.</p>
