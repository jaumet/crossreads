<p>Saturday 26th<br/>Five weeks out from Sydney to-day &ndash;It is 1.30 pm and for the past ten minutes<br/>we've seen smoke away down the harbor  -  The harbor curves to the SE  -  Round the corner swept the Destroyers 3 in number then the Flag ship &ndash; then the Montcalm &amp; the troop ship Berrima and bringing up the rear the Encounter &ndash; They were a fine spectacle steaming slowly up in the bright sunshine &ndash; The Berrime has gone up to the pier &amp; the destroyers are anchored close in  -  The Flagship is opposite us &amp; the Montcalm &amp; Encounter anchored in line behind her  -  We shall get some news we trust  -  They are all back from New Guinea from Wilhelms Haven we take it  -</p>
