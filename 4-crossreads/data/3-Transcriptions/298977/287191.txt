<p>GALLIPOLI,<br/>22nd September 1915</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>Your letter of the 8th August came to hand here to-day and I was very pleased to hear from you as it is only the second time I have heard from home since I left.  Ruby's came at the same time.  The news was therefore a little stale, but nevertheless was very much appreciated.  I am pretty certain some of my letters from home have gone astray and no doubt I will get a lot of old ones in a bunch, as I feel sure you are writing every week.  Have received no parcels or papers yet.  Also have not heard from Rita except Aus Day Post Card.</p>
<p>Glad that Father has gone away for his trip, I hope it will do him good, though I suppose by the time you receive this he will be home again.</p>
<p>I am not at all surprised to hear that Os is coming over and I am very pleased indeed he is.  He is only doing his duty and it is an experience I would not have missed for anything, and I feel sure it is doing me a lot of good in many ways.  Things were all right with me in Egypt.  My head grew a little too level for that.</p>
<p>Things here are practically as usual, though we have our little excitements and adventures.  All the little details I will have to leave over till I get back.</p>
<p>Keep the news and parcels coming.  Make a spec of chocolates and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Love from<br/>Pte 1280 Roy Richards.</p>
<p><u>P.S.</u> I know this is very short, but paper supply is shorter.</p>
