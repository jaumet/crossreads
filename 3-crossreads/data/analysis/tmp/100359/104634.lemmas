 Sunday 29th It was about the most uncomfort night I ever spent , and was veri glad when daylight came . Then I got up and lit a fire and with the assist of Roy Knowl made some tea , which put a bit of life into us . It rain veri heavili and a bitter cold wind was blow . Fritz put over plenti of shrapnel , but our parti were veri lucki as usual . Everi day a number of our chap have to return to H.Q . with shell shock or other sick . The strain on a man 's nerv is aw , and how the deuc our squad is stick it I do n't know . It was veri nice to sit by a bit of fire . Ration were veri scanti and to improv matter the " Big game " is give us a lot of troubl . We made a stew with Bulli Beef Biscuit , which with cocoa made a veri good dinner . The fire took a lot of coas to make it burn , as the wood was veri wet . We knock a number of Amm . Case to piec for firewood . A No. of Infantri call in on their way from the front line and grat enjoy the cocoa we had . The 14th reliev us about 4 p.m. which gave us time to get back to Green Dump in daylight . My heel were veri sore and I drop behind the crowd and after walk for about 2 hour I got "bush " and struck some mud up to my hip . Luckili Frank Corrigan and a No. of other came along , and we assist each other along . Fritz put a coupl of Whizz-bang " over veri close to us and splash us with mud . When we reach Camp we were issu with dri sock and a lot of rum , both of which were bad need . Then I got a copi of tea and some stew and we to our dug-out where Jack Keen had a good fire burn . It seem like Heaven to take off our sop wet cloth and turn into our blanket 48 hour is a long time to be out without sleep especi when ration are short . On our way Home we pass 2 hors that had got bog in the mud and been shot . It is far beyond me to attempt to describ thing , but it almost seem like a ghast nightmar .
