<p>But my job does not take me to the front line often, we have to clear the wounded from the Regimental 1st Aid post back to the Ambulance H.Q. which is generally about 2 or 3 miles behind.  I generally live half way between the two &amp; work up &amp; back superintending &amp; all that, its quite lively at times too, at present I'm in clover living in a dugout about 60 feet underground in a wonderful tunnel where we have an aid post, operating theatre, hospital for 40 patients &amp; which will hold up to 600 other troops of various branches, in it we feel happy during the heaviest bombardments, its the first time I've had quarters in a safe spot when in the line &amp; I appreciate it I can tell you.</p>
<p>Its still very cold but thank God the winter is about done &amp; we'll soon have some warm days now.</p>
<p>Do send me your book &ndash; if its at all like you it will be most interresting.</p>
<p>Sorry I didn't send you a photograph, will do so some day when I have one.</p>
