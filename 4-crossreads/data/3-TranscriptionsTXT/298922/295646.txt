Did practice shooting with our 6" gun astern & also Howitzers at floating branches it is a novelty for P. & O. passengers. Start to pack up tomorrow, I'm rather tired of this wandering & living in "bags", expect I'll turn up at home some day.
About 12 passengers get off at Port Said some for Soudan & other parts.
