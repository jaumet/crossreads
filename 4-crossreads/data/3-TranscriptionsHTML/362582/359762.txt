<p>not properly sorted, so got it Sunday &ndash; The sabbeth makes  very little difference here &ndash; how we have two C of Eng. chaplains &amp; two R.C. chaplains that we will have  more services here &ndash; be able to arrange times to suite the sisters etc. Somehow today I cannot write, so much noise &amp; a convalescent sister walking around &amp;   talking nonsense, that she is making me quite nervy. Essie &amp;   I cannot read nor write through here. She has been discharged but disappointed at not getting a few days at Alexandria &ndash; so is laying around waiting for the old Col Maudsley to worry him. Really some people make you quite disgusted &ndash; I had such a lot I wanted to write but my brain will not work. If my photo is any good &amp;   you think it worth it, get a dozen &amp;   send them to my special friends for a Xmas Present. Mrs &amp;   Mr Osburne are so good, every mail I get heaps or weely papers from them &amp; such lovely long joint letters. If anyone should get it, send it to Mrs Osburne of Terang with my fond love.</p>
