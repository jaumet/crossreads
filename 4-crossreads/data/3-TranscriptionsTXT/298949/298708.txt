He wher leading several Internees, wich had been  arested the day previously for a walk  I often heard the guards to us bad &amp; offencive language towards the Internees.  We recieved very little Vegetables.  Goods we ordered from Adelaide seldom arived &amp; money never returned for same. I know pour Bergmann. He was not quite sane. He was ordered to unload the Woodboat while the Soldiers guard gave the order, he was hit several times by them.  He also wher bayoneted while being handcuffed, while in the little special Compound.To the Court  I saw everything I have stated with my own eyes and nothing wich has been told to me by other people.  Cheer up Socity Ladys while on a Visit to the Isl to cheer the Soldiers up, seen in Internees in Latrines &amp; Water Closets on several ocassiones on account their being no covering around of any sort, to hide us from the outside gaze.  I certainly think it most disgracefull.  I think Wattkins statement for the Deffence false.  I have not seen any Internees with axces or billets of wood at the time of the shooting.  Cross examined by Captain Hawkes Capt Hawkes Mr Penny.  I know the vegetables &amp; parcels wich we had send to us wher delivered at the Ferry style, but do not know if they have been lost overboard during transit.
