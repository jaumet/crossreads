<p>24.3.15<br/>Winter Palace Hotel, we had a hot bath &amp; put the rest of the evening in playing billiards &amp; it was the cheapest nights amusement I have had in Egypt as both billiards &amp; bath were free.  Helouan is famous for its sulphur baths, but they are not open at present on account of the war, as there is no tourists this season.  The Winter Palace Hotel is run by English people.  It was about ten o'clock when we arrived back in Camp &amp; were soon asleep, with the large flags tied together for a shelter for our heads.</p>
