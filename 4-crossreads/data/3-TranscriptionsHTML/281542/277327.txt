<p>Monday 19th July 1915</p>
<p>Daybreak saw the storm spent of its previous day's fury &amp; we were able to walk about the deck with some degree of ease &amp; pleasure.  Mess orderly.</p>
<p>A pleasant afternoon with Southern Arabia on our right.  Calm seas with cool breeze tempering suns rays.  Due north Cape Gardifue noon, NW comes island "Socotra".</p>
<p>Tuesday 20th July 1915.</p>
<p>Approaching Aden.  Steamers becoming frequently &ndash; passed Harrison Liner &ndash; Aden to India &ndash; at about noon.  Others sighted.</p>
<p>Hot close evening &ndash; ships in the night spoke 3 cruisers &ndash; Japs it was said, flashlights signalling &amp; shore fires.  Passed through Hell's Gate at about 3 am</p>
<p>Received first wireless concerning war to the effect that Gen. French had reported that Germans were active on the French Frontier &amp; had gained trenches but had been repulsed.  Message posted on saloon deck at about 8 p.m.  Dated "London official 20th July 1915".</p>
<p>Wednesday 21st July 1915</p>
<p>In the Red Sea &ndash; calm sea &ndash; muggy &amp; sticky atmosphere &ndash; at 7 o'clock 3 ships in sight to the north &ndash; a large passenger, small packed &amp; cargo in light trim &ndash; we soon passed them &amp; they quickly faded away in the haze.</p>
<p>No Parades a/c excessive heat.</p>
<p>Passed the 4 Brothers &amp; 12 Apostles during day, the former on African side, the latter Arabian side.  How awesome &amp; grand are these lone sentinels of the Red Sea.  Barren huge rocks rising in pyramidical shape for the most part &amp; towering into the sky.  As we passed each group of the Apostles with their white lighthouse perched on their highest point, I could not reconcile</p>
