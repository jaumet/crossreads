that they can appreciate worth when they see it.  I then set off home arriving in time for tea having done about 30 miles but on a very heavy bike.  Spent a good evening with the villagers yarning cards etc quite homelike.
Monday 16th OctAm troubled with a cold in the head but nothing serious.  Took some patients into "Estairs" but failed to see Carr he being away.  Wrote a few letters in the afternoon singsong etc at night, our last in the village I fear.  Have been troubled with presentiments of trouble lately, in fact ever since the middle of last month.  I honestly do not feel fear for myself 'tis for the suffering my loss would cause at home.  I have been able to go anywhere with pleasurable feeling rather than fear or apprehension tho' will admit when in danger as from being shelled direct to feeling fear then.  No one living can do otherwise with death flying all round him.  Bravery consists of a person by will power conquering that fear & carrying on.  One can become callous to a certain extent perhaps but no one can stand still in cold blood & be shot at without a feeling of fear.  Voting for conscription has been postponed for some reason or other.
