 Here it appears that Brit rule teaches the nig that his crimes are not  1 / 8   th  as bad as the same acts of a white. A white man gets no shout at all in a judgement. This encourages the nigs to be independent &amp; keeps all but the worst stamp of whites out of the country. Only the French &amp; Portugese are not under the shadow of the English administration &amp; as a consequence these two countries do all the trade &amp; have the goodwill of the tribes, while the Briton merely keeps the lid on from the forts &amp; sends long reports to London every so often.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Aureal barracks are a credit to the black troops. Each hut has its rockery garden (&amp; its family of snakes) Lurid jungle plants mingle with black-red french roses
