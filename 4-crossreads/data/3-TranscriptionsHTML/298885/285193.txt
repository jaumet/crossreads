<p>a message was left for me saying Stan is coming tomorrow afternoon</p>
<p>Feb 10th &ndash; 18<br/>Whilst reclining peacefully on my floorified bed just after my mid-day "tuck-in" I was informed my presence was required without the portals of our shanty and knowing who it was Im up "toute-suite" (very quick) and soon was shaking Stan's paw.</p>
<p>Well we yarned for a while and then proceeded down to find Rube and needless to say it did not take us long</p>
<p>I can tell Rube wore a gigantic look of surprise</p>
