10/7/19 Chemnitz Bay of Biscay
Inspected the ship with Capt. Young and found things fairly good the meals better and all fairly satisfied. The Bay of Biscay was calm enough today and I don't think that thus far anyone has been ill. Our R.C. padre (Padre Fox) is a good chap and a fine versatile conversationalist. Sports material was distributed today and much used. The Band played in the evening and then a dance was held in the dark to piano tune. A white horsed sea making boat toss a bit tonight. We are miles out from land as far as the eye can see is a tossing waste of waters. Some men stand watching it for hours ? it is like watching the leaping flames of a fire. The waves are everchanging as they dash on.
