 Monday 9 October 1916 Fine, but not many patches of sunshine : again windy. After breakfast walked down the steep hillside to the gas school to keep a general supervision over some practical work being done by a Gas N.C.O.s school. This was over by 12.30 &amp; I then rode home on the horse sent down by Capt. Barley. After lunch went up to H.Q. to read up some matter on late attacks, &amp; abt 4.30 rode down to the school &amp; lectured for an hour on the precautionary orders laid down. Rode home in the dusk &amp; much enjoyed it. Went down the town before dinner to get one or two necessaries, &amp; when it was over stayed up completing preparations for the next morning's lecture.
