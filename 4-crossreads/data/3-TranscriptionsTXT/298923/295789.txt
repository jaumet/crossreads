3 May 1918 FridayTook up an advanced line from C squadron & as usual got shelled.  Sole coming off boot, minor troubles worry a man, such as former & never washing for days etc.  I carried the Mutual Store Plum Pudding & Salmon till today & then 3 Officers enjoyed it, as no rations have reached us for several days.On Outpost all night while other Brigades marched in single file down a Bridle track.
