<p>Go for a bit of a stroll round the building in the sunshine   &amp;  find out I am very weak still<br/>But it feels good to be able to walk about again</p>

<p>A crowd of sisters  &amp;  patients leave for England to day on No 1 Hosp Ship<br/>Feel a bit stronger on my pins today  &amp;  wont be long now before I am right again</p>
