<p>10th February (Thursday)<br/>Beautiful morning. Long route march to the Bitter Lakes. The scenery just where the Canal runs into the Lake is very pretty. We were in the Lake for a swim but the strange part about it is that the water is only knee deep except where the channel passes through so therefore we could go out close on a mile and not strike deep water. In some places it is impossible to see the other side of the Lake. On the shores for some distance back there is a thickness of salt resembling snow. Lecture on the Geneva</p>
