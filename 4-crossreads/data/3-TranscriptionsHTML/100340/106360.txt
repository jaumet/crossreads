<p>everybody was well oiled well you can imagine the scenes. Everyone trying to rag on the grass  &amp; falling all over each other. It was indeed a very merry evening.<br/>Do not know what to think about the past parcel it may have been yours. At any rate there were two books two bottles of home made jam tin of salmon &amp; two tins of sugar &amp; a pair of sox. It was most welcome but I do wish they would put a slip of paper in it so as I will know who it is from. Do not be at all surprised if you don't hear from me for a month as we are going up the line tonight &amp; I have no envelopes left &amp; cannot buy any for love nor money</p>
