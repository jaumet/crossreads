Rumors lead us to place tin fish second on the list of things to be considered unhealthy
12 Two more arrivals. A big auxiliary & store ship. Put in afternoon as usual, playing five hundred – Got two slams in succession for the first time since I’ve played the game.
4pm. Big Frenchman, Montcalm class, arrived. Big flag – could roof house with it!. Japs just visible outside, lying to. We have hopes of departure. Rumours that we run tomorrow
11th 
Nothing doing. Pay 9/-. One shilling held against loss of cutlery when disembarking. Big French Auxiliary just in. Short of stores – other ships in port all depend on us for food – particularly vegetables. Water run short & ship unable to take on sufficient fresh to keep up supplies. Condensed water here awful.
12th 
Officially informed of the whys & wherefores of our stay here. We’re here because we cant get out! We wont get out for days possibly weeks. We’re going on short rations. We not going to wash in fresh water any more, any more.
