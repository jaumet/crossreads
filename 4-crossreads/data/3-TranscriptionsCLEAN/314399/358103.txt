Saw the Avelings taking Mrs to the boat. Went to the dance after & had about 8. Enjoyed 'em too. An Aussie mail came yesterday. 
 Thursday 17 April 1919 Little sun today. Very little too. Went into town & visited the museum & a couple of churches. They were all worth seeing specially one of the churches which had glorious windows.  Was on the No 2 train. Jock Kennedy offered me a job to play football in Melbourne. Did not accept tho. Will see later.
