Hobson & Garner then threw an 18 ft stay overboard & we swam with it to shore, brought it home split it & got 4 lovely ridge poles out of it  Col Merrington is away today & Chaplain Green held the religious service here. I was too interested in reading letters to attend, I have no time for Green at anyrate & gives me the pip to listen to his sermons while poor old Merrington generally gives us a bit of war news in addition & is aways fairly interesting to listen to; Sunday seems to be a pet day in the Army for any work & the warboats have been rattling in enough shots to-day to blow hill 971 off the Peninsula altogether: We have been having a particularly easy time of it lately; The sand bags arrived today.
