<p>Col Featherstone the P.M.O. for Australia, is in Cairo, on his way back to Australia from England. I want a few minutes chat with him. The reports coming to hand from No 3 Hospital at Lemnos are not good to listen to. One can belive but little here, but the persistant rumours as to disagreements and disorganisation when filtered leave some particle of correctness. Mayhap Harris has kept you informed upon the doings in that part of the world. It has been told to me several times that Col. Fiaschi has gone to England. Lt. Col. Dick is at No. 2 A.G.H. at present. I have not seen him for some time.</p>
<p>A further train load of sick and wounded came along yesterday afternoon. A big batch of invalides left here for Australia this morning I did not learn the name of the transport by which they are to travel. The knowing invalides go to Luxor for a change, then if they can to England, and finally to Australia. A veritable chance perhaps you think.</p>
<p>The panoramic views by means of raised maps, as given in the illustrated journals appear to me to be the most satisfactory of all the representations of the various sites of the fighting areas. What think you? One can from them get an idea of the natural features of the country, the courses of the rivers, the relationship of the railways to the surrounding hills, the valleys along which they pass, the size of the rivers, the positions of the towns, and heaps else which cannot be grasped from the ordinary flat presentation</p>
<p>Recently several times idea has come into my mind that my writing, instead of being less, has become more, legible. What think you upon this subject?</p>
