  
 beast didn't realise that the best thing for him to do was to put his head under & leave it there. With the exception of the above, we have had no serious misfortune, & any slight accident that has occurred has not resulted in  any permanent injury. Shortly after leaving a certain port, which I am forbidden to name, one of my sergeants developed a slight attack of pneumonia. For four days he had a temperature of 1041/2  but he pulled through, & except for a slight cough a little weakness he is alright again & will probably resume duty shortly after landing. I was inoculated again just a day or two before crossing the line, & as my arm was too sore when the day came round I did not undergo the usual treatment, but instead took photographs of those who were treated. In the case of officers, the shaving & ducking was of course voluntary, but there was not on that account any lack of patients. The sports were opened by the adjutant undergoing the operation & he was followed by a  the  major & several junior officers. After about twenty or thirty had been done, the humour began to wear off. The process was the same in every case. The patient was seated on the edge of a large canvas bath. After he had been lathered, shampooed, shaved with a large wooden razor etc, he was doctored with a soup pill & some sea water, then sentenced by the  judge  judge to a certain number of duckings which usually varied between two & six, but occasionally reached the    dozen  dozen.
