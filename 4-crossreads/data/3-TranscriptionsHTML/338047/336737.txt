<p>1918 July<br/>dart suddenly from the nearest cloud, and dive at the balloon firing tracer bullets at it. Tracer bullets contain some substance in them that enables them to be seen in flight and also lights the gas in the balloon. The two balloonatics (or whatever they call them) hop out toute de suite, and soon after, (if their parachutes are OK) are floating down to earth. The balloon is soon ablaze and comes down after them with black smoke coming from it. When it reaches the ground a long column of smoke goes up (like in the picture >) [Page contains sketches of a tethered balloon, a person parachuting to earth, and a smoke trail and balloon falling to the ground]. In the meantime every machine gun in the place is spitting at the intruder and he is off again as quick as he can to his own lines. The Archies (Anti Aircraft Guns) also open up and now and then when he has not been quick enough, he is brought down. Of course the Hun has not got the monopoly of this game, our airmen going</p>
