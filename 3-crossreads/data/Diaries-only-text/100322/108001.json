Attended a lecture by one sharp Victorian Immigration Expert in London and then went and saw General Martin about some odd matters. The afternoon read wrote and went up the street after mess taking a Berlitz lesson. The wooden sabots are in universal use here and are clumsy ? the average price appears about 4 francs. Dancing is a hobby whe with the troops now.
