<p>Wednesday January 10th<br/>The weather seems to be getting much clearer now. It was a sunny day nearly all day today. A couple of German airoplanes came over this afternoon but were soon sent back by our anti-aircraft guns. A few shells are still lobbing fairly close (close enough for me). Worked half a day in the cook house &amp; have to go in all tonight. I am doing the night job permanently.</p>
<p>Thursday January 11th<br/>Fritz kept firing shells over this way nearly all night, most of them are bursting a good way away. Slept all day, I don't know how things went on, very quiet though I think. Received a parcel from Doris, it was sent on October 10th &amp; contained very useful articles. Snowing, during the afternoon &amp; a good part of the night, but rain set in, &amp; it thawed very quick. One thing a fellow can have very good food in the cook house, just for the cooking of it for yourself.</p>
<p>Friday January 12th<br/>Very foggy morning. Everything is very quiet. I am sleeping in a dug out by myself now, as there would be too much row in the hut for me to sleep during the day, it is very crampy though. There were not many shells over this way during the night.</p>
<p>Saturday January 13th<br/>Snowing rather heavy very early this morning, but rain set in again &amp; it thawed about 4 am. It was very cold after it had thawed. There is a Corporal on the night shift with me. We have to break up the bread for milk sop for breakfast, cook the bacon &amp; cut it up, &amp; make the breakfast. We can always have about two hours sleep during the night. There was a mail in today but never got any letters. It was also pay day as there is no place about here to spend any money, I never got mine.</p>
