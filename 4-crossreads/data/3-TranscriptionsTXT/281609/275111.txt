Here we renovated the old dug-outs and prepared for a long stay. Bombardment continues all night.30th Very hot all day. Made two trips to the trenches. Shrapnel falling fairly heavily. The convoy was halted in a maze of trenches dug in the town of La Boisele. What was once a charming village is a heap of debris. Fricourt &amp; Poizieres are also battered beyond repair, in fact all houses within a ten mile radius of the trenches are smashed up.31st Very warm. Three trips to trenches. "Fritz" very busy. Several killed &amp; wounded. Shells burst very close to convoy blowing up roads. About 3 pm shells commenced falling in the billets of the Companies. A whole terrace of houses was razed to the ground. 1 man killed &amp; several wounded. Practically everyone was out at work at the time. At 5 pm I was detailed to take a wagon to remove the body to the cemetery. It was pitiful. Capt Tauvelle &amp; myself carried the body to the grave where the Burial Service was read. It was all over in about 15 minute, the only mourners being myself, team mate Capt Tauvelle &amp; several Tommies. Someone's heart will break to-night &amp; tomorrow.
