<p>13.7.15<br/>Tue. 13th.  A demonstration was given last night, our rifles, machine guns &amp; artillery made the pace a welter for half an hour.  We did no work to-day but put the day in reading, at 5 oclock this afternoon the Turkish 11 ins. gun opened fire on Steels &amp; Courtenays, it was the worst day they have had 6 killed &amp; 60 odd wounded on Courtenays, while Steels did not suffer nearly as bad.  We are right opposite them here &amp; could see men coming out of the trenches black as charcoal from the powder from the shells, one was carried out with one foot blown clean off, men were constantly waiting with shovels, &amp; after nearly every shell they would have to run in &amp; dig someone out who was buried in the dirt, one lad was blown to pieces &amp; we could see his mates pieces of him at the time.  Our own guns have been trying to silence her but without success (went for dip).</p>
