<p>the leave Train pass through afterwards I went out &amp; into the Church Army Hut in the little enclosure to have a rest until the Train arrived from Calais.    As I was sitting inside I heard Tommies laughing &amp; I went out side &amp; saw a number throwing Snowballs at the W.A.A.C. Girls as they passed &amp; when some returned they had some Snowballs ready &amp; they retalaited on the boys, both enjoying the fun, several of the Girls came in side &amp; bought Tea &amp; Biscuits &amp; sat down at the Tables &amp; enjoyed a few minutes rest.  At  2.30 Pm I left the Hut &amp; again went into the Station &amp; in a few minutes the Passenger Train arrived &amp; after taking my seat the Train left at 2.50 Pm for Hazebruick arriving there at 3.45 Pm where I had to change into the Poperinghe Train which left at 4.30 Pm &amp; after a good run we arrived in Poperinghe at 5.45 Pm.   I then went out &amp; along to my Belgian friends &amp; had a cup of Coffee &amp; some biscuits, as there were a light Engine leaving for Regersberg at 7.30 Pm I said Good bye to my friends &amp; left again for the Station arriving there at 7.20 &amp; found that the Eng had left only a few minutes, so there was nothing left for me but to go along the road in the hope of getting a lift.   I only proceeded a short distance when along came a Motor Cyclist with a Carette attached</p>
