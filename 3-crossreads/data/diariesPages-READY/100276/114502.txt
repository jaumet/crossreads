miss him for he was a splendid fellow talk about popular, well to know Freddie was to like him you couldn't help it, all I hope is that he soon comes back, he was hit with a piece of the real "Minnewerfer" in the backside a rather awkward place to get it
There was a fair bit of sniping going on all last night from both sides put me in mind of Gallopoli for rifle fire is a rarity here compared to there
The portion of trench we are holding is mined the Germans have one under her ready to go off they reckon so we have only a few scattered posts along it hope it don't go up while we are in here, good bye if it does.
