 Sunday 19 August 1917 
 HOSPITAL No Church nearer than Alexandria so did not go. 
 Still very hot, damp but I am better. 
 Posted notes yesterday as you might think I have been really ill. I should have loved to get leave to England or AUSTRALIA but no hope at present. 
 Am not rejoicing at going back on Wednesday still it has to be did. Just received your Cable &ndash; "Hope Convalescent", thank you so much but really there has been nothing much wrong with me. It was dated 18th very quick. I wonder how you knew I was sick, from a Cable I suppose.
