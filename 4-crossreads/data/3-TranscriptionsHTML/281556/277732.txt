<p>19th. Friday.<br />Caught midday train reaching London where I was kept very busy at bank etc. By 6pm train went to Bolton and reached &quot;North Leigh&quot; about midnight finding them waiting up for me. Never felt so at home anywhere in my life before as here, they were both so loving and homely &amp; nice. Beautifull room and surroundings.</p>
