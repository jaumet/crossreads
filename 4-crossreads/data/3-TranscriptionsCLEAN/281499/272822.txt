  
 It was funny down in the town tonight to see all the boys ducking in & out of the butcher shops buying meat for a good feed, for we were all more or less meat hungry & practically the whole Battalion was in, & against "orders" too. 15th  Sunday is round once more & when we rose this morning at 5.30 it was raining heavily, but it turned out to be a shower only, I went over & drew our rations for we were camped some little distance from the rest of the Coy. & by the time we had breakfast the rain had stopped & things looked lovely & green.  A lot of the boys got drunk here & I had a terrible job to get them ready to move off in time, even then the Machine gunners left a roll of blankets
