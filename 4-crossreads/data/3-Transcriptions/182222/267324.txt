<p>A motor waggon bursting apart in a cloud of smoke is a clear cut memory -- Then a fire and men lying in the road&nbsp; then a scotty with one arm in pulp begging me to have &#39;a cig an&#39; tak nae note o&#39; the shrapnel&nbsp; --- this in hot sunshine &amp; near some trees half hidden in black smoke ---then a New Zealander with a knife ripping at my tunic --- Then some guy with a string of questions. Then no 35 B. H.&nbsp; Apparently this took near 8 days yet itseems like one day</p>
