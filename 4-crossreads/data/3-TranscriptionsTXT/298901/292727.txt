 Jeudi 23rd Mai A steady day of hard work  Had my 8 G.S. panniers checked &amp; all contents cleaned up, also my medical &amp; surgical panniers.  All are now ready to load on the wagon to move off at a moments notice.  The day started hot but changed to a little rain with cold wind.  Fritz was over bombing last night again but left us alone.  He dropped bombs near the place we evacuated &amp; also set fire to a large dump of some kind &amp; it made a splendid sight, blazing up fiercely &amp; dying down every few seconds, lighting up the country for miles.  Report says that one of the raiders was brought down near Corbie. Very few wounded coming through.
