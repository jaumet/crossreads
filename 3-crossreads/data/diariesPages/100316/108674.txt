22/5/18 Franvillers 
Left at 9.30 per horse for Bde H.Q. when I had a hot ride. All the countryside is now covered with crops that are fast ripening. Today has been quite as warm a day as one could wish to have. On reaching Frenchencourt I met Colonel Cohen CMGDS and Major Clowes Mc Serg. WhiteEagle and we proceeded to sit as a Court of Inquiry and took the evidence of many people regarding the question of our artillery firing short during the recent attacks. We had a table covered with maps and really made a great ceremony of it ? thus trying to find out how so many brave men were killed and wounded. Our total losses were 23 killed 180 wounded and we took over 300 prisoners and counted a good many dead Huns. Rode down in motorcar to St Grahen and dined with General Phillips and Staff at 2nd D HQ. Later in the afternoon heard that General Monash goes to Corps. Generals White Birdwood to 5 Army and General Gellibrand to 3 Divn. Saw General Rosenthal our new Div. Commander and had a long talk with him. Truly a day of Jews and Generals!! Found C.G.W. Bean the War corres. at Mess when I returned so took him in hand and gave him a lot of war news. A decent chap is C.G.W.B.
