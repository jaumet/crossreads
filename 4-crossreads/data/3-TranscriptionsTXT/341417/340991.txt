Dear Miss King
Just a short note letting you know that I am leaving England for home on Sunday the 24th of this month (August) in the Hospital [ship] Kanowna.
While I have been in camp in England waiting for a Boat I took ill and it turned out to me Malaria fever, so they are sending me home on a hospital ship.
I hope you did not think I had forgotten you for I was so uncertain of my departure for home that I did not know whether to write or not. However I will soon be amongst you all and I think it time dont you?
