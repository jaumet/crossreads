etc. I saw the officer in charge he got the cooks to boil us a dixie of tea for dinner.
15th. It appears this job we are on lasts while the Brigade is in reserve we have to sleep tucker over here, we did not bring our blankets or packs with us so when the work was finished I asked the officer in charge for the loan of one of the motor lorries to run us round to our Camp to get our things so he lent us one we slipped round had our tea got paid packed up back we come it was raining pretty heavily too but we were right for once under cover, so we will be here for a day or two doing fatigues
