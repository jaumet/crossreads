dogs they are going home so they thought too, but they were sadly mistaken for he told their Instructors to march them away give them some physical jerks, so they took them away started the mob racing one against the other, of course they were enthusiastic you could see that from the way they were carrying on, after a while the officer gets sick of watching them he takes a walk, down to try and liven them up but he got very poor results, we were all expecting to see him counted out it's a wonder he was not, for the lads naturally were in a very bad humour, I don't blame them it's a poor policy punishing the mob for the sake of one or two, if ever an officer was called pretty names well this chap was.
