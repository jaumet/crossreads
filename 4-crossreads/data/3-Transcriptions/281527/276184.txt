<p>8/3/18  La Basse Ville</p>
<p>houses, railway lines, and all the debris of a populous country side. Many times I tripped and fell over things cursing hard. A beastly waste of ruin, the country just like a deep ploughed field and material lying about everywhere. The average man keeps remarkably cheerful. Called in at the Support Company and at the R.A.P and then sat up feeling very sleepy at Battallion H.Q. Signed and checked the Intelligence Reports and then descended into the lower storey of the dugout and tried to sleep in a bunk. The foul air and fetid smells kept me awake and at 4 pm I rose feeling worse and nearly doped with it all</p>
