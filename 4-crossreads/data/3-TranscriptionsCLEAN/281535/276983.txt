  
 30/5/19 Edinburgh Usual morning promenade around the streets evoked nothing of more than passing interest. After lunch went out in the car to Hawthornden. Unfortuanately a hazelike smoke hung over the whole countryside and restricted view. The many little glens we passed had small rocky brooks trickling through them. The roads all lined with stone walls and the fields (rather larger holdings than in England) marked out with hedges. Noticed a monument where the Covenanters were dispersed and also on a wall (this latter near to Edinburgh) the stone of Flodden Field - a tablet showing where a rally had been made round some standard or other. Dined with the Colonel & Audrey and thereafter wined and had music.
