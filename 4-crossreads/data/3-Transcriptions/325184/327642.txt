<p>Wednesday 1st October<br/>In morning called at Shipping office and Fish market. Chris much interested in fishing boats etc. In early afternoon in an Australian Car visited the old town. Boulogne &ndash; Napoleons monument etc.   Ascended the latter with Chris. Went to ship at 4pm.  Rather a nuisance in obtaining a visa to Nell's passport. Left Boulogne at 6pm arriving in rain at Folkstone about 7.15.   Secured rooms at Metropole Hotel, and found there very comfortable.   Hotel magnificently situated.   Baker met us with car at pier. Railway strike not yet settled and transport very much upset. Many volunteers at work.</p>
