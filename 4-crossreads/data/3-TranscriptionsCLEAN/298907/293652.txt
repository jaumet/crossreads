& we ring in some pretty tall yarns
All the Irish patients are being transferred to Iceland today wouldn't mind if I were going.
Was out snapshotting this afternoon down Hagley Road way, & standing on the corner at the terminus I saw a small party of W.A.A.C.'s standing so for a lark I went across & said to them, have you any objection to my taking a snap of your little party.  of course they giggled & said they would only be too pleased & etc. so I took them 8 in all, after this we started talking and it appears they were going out for a picnic & they had all their cakes & things with them in a couple of boxes, & they invited my mate & I to join them, after a bit of word sparring we consented and away we went up in to the woods
