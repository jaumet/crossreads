<p>given to me by the Prioress.  Before visiting the Convent; I had taken Dr. Maguire, from the Auckland hospital for a drive to Matareiah, there we visited the church, the well, and the tree, it was during the inspection that I got the leaves.   He with other N. Z. medicoes is installed at the Egyptian Hospital, not far from me;  Dr Park of Auckland is the chief.  You Tabbie dear know the two doctors named.   Maguire stayed to tea with me.</p>
<p>Very busy now cannot keep at this letter longer.</p>
<p>Please make of your prayers sweet sacrifices to raise my soul to heaven.    To my friends please give heaps of good wishes.   To each of you, may the grace of heaven, before behind thee and on every hand enwheel thee round.  Heaps of love and loads of kisses<br/>from your loving and affectionate father<br/>John B Nash</p>
