  
 25-12-16 the afternoon yarning at Brigade & while riding down to the wells to water Roger on my way back, he took a fit into his head to give an exhibition of rooting & very nearly succeeded in getting rid of me. I was hoping he had given the habit best as it was his first go for a week but I fancy he is liable to buck any time when he is being ridden on his own: It has come up very cloudy & cold this afternoon & it look like a storm approaching from the North: built a shelter this afternoon in anticipation of rain. 
 26-12-16 Tues 26th This morning Col. Granville called me up & advised me to alter the dates
