<p>Still at <strike>Gib</strike> am trying to go over a French submarine today   We are remaining still another few days here repairing-<br/>REUTER cables are published daily at the Club so we get the worlds news-<br/>Almost time to be wishing you all at home Xmas greetings it seems absurd to think of peace on earth, just now-<br/>The Spanish women had lovely soft velvet brown eyes not hidden by a YASHMAK like they are in Egypt so we are able to see their features-  We sail tomorrow but do not know <strike>Whether via Malta or even if we go to Salonika first or to Alexandria</strike> where we go.</p>
