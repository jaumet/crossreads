Left Serapeum. February 25th
Poor old Osman nearly cried when he knew we were leaving, Payney gave him a sheepskin vest. We fell in about 2.30 and marched up to Rail head. The train was not in so we played cards while waiting for it. Left Serapeum about 4, and arrived Teb-el-Kebir about 6.30, after a bumpy train ride across the desert. At Nefiche we pulledup for a while. "Bricky" took a picture of a charming Arab girl who was selling oranges. One old chap amused the crowd by dancing the can-can. On arrival at T-Kebir we had to turn to and unload all our gear. I was one of a party of 6 told off to carry a big table, and we were all jolly glad to arrive at our camp site. When the main body arrived we all had to pitch tents, and were very glad to get to bed, as we were tired out. It was quite the hardest day I've had for some time.
