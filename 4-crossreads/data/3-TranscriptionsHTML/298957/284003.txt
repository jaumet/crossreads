<p>Fine. On Cooks Fatigue. I was in a party called to a private consultation by Capt. Mollison in his tent, where he informed us that a Turkish Attack is expected in a day or so, most likely at 4 a.m. in the morning. We were told that the information came from the Secret Service Dept. The Turks are reported to be coming on camels and in strong forces. Though the officers seem to be serious about it and medical stores are being rapidly overhauled I personally look upon the whole thing as a joke just for a test.</p>
