 fever that consum them . The interior of the Hospit is aw . Everywher men were huddl togeth on the filthi floor , most the bed were mattress thrown down , all foul and insanitari with the sign of previous occup . Pile of similar evil-smel bed were stack in heap . Tack right on to the ward and open to it are the latrin . I do not think disinfect have ever been use here , and the smell is overpow , and left me feel sick for hour . Yet here unwash , unkempt , and burn with fever , suffer endur stoical the pain of wound , and oper conduct without anaesthet , suffer the Good God alon know what , these poor wretch lie , and are carri out to their burial .
