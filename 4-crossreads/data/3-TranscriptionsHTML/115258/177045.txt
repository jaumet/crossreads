<p>Australian smile and feel at home at once. They dont put on a bit of side and once you get to know them a little you feel you have real friends here. There are two fine men in this camp; which I think accounts for it being so good - one is the YM sec. and the other Cannon Garland. It seems to me that the Aust. branch of the YM have practically made the camp. The military have supplied a few bell tents; but the YM have erected all the necessary sheds and shower bath also some fine mess huts and store houses as well as a fine YM itself and picture show. The pictures are free and the YM contains a big writing room and liberary; a games room and a canteen where you can get tea and cakes all day long. Also they have a nice two story place just across the road, called the Rest House, and its about the only place in town where you can get nice afternoon tea. Most base YM&#39;s seem to sling the tucker at you as roughty as they can- tin mugs etc - but here you have thin bread &amp; butter, little tables and a nice tea service. Sort of place you could ask a lady friend to. Canon Garland is the C of E Padre - he runs a good tea joint too, but its just a soldier&#39;s one rough but honest.</p>
