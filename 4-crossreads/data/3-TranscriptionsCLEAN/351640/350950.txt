  
 constitutes "the mud of Egypt", famous for its fertility adown all the ages that the world has known, the envy of every conqueror who has been of the world, and to day as ever charged with every virtue that can bring life and pleasure to the soul and body of man.   Whence does it come?    From far away Abyssinia, and the lake region of central Africa, mostly from the mountainous areas of the former, being washed downwards by the heavy rains which annually fall upon the soil there.  It is wonder that it has not all deposited long before the stream gets this far, something like 4000 miles.  Yet it was this afternoon fully charged with the discolouring particles of soil, which mean so much to the population who live upon the borders of the river and in the delta.  To my eye the cotton crops, the maize crops, and the other growths appeared to be in first class order.   The Nile this year is said not to be as full of water as in some former years, but it will suffice, especially when it is stored at Assouan. 
 The month of Ramadan is just ending, that of Bairan is commencing, the period being one of great importance in the Mahomedan year.   My acquaintance with the Khoran is too limited to tell you aught about it.  The canal, which, before the construction of the barrage, was a very important factor in the irrigating of the delta lands is to be cut with the usual ceremony, religious festivals being held during several days.  Notices have been issued that the holidays will extend over four days.  All troups are forbidden to go into the city.   The land is not all floode[d] as of yore, the barrage is to obviate the evil effects of the flooding of the land, now the precious fluid is poured on the land through the year, giving just enough at any one time, this allows of the land being under cultivation during each of the twelve months, where as under natural conditions three or four months were lost while the waters were at their flooding and falling.  Hence it is that the barrage is so great worth to the people living on and cultivating the land.  I must to bed.

 12.8.15  11 p.m.  Wondering how you are managing, I sent you a wire this evening; it should reach you in time to allow of your sending a week end reply if you so desire.   Three kinds of telegrams can be sent from here to Australia;  ordinary, deferred, and week end, the second from this end, about one shilling and tenpence per word, the first about three shillings, and the last tenpence.  If you send reply it will reach me on Tuesday morning, when coming week end.
