The Italian "bar" is a little place with no tipping where drinks of all kinds including coffee sometimes chocolate are sold at the counter.  The "caffe" may be large or small and has the usual little tables where you sit down & order what you want, not forgetting to tip the waiter before leaving.  Tipping, by the way, is a continental curse. Australians visiting Italy are assured of a cordial reception - in fact the majority of the people did not know what nationality I was.  Very likely an Americano they surmised until a glimpse of the metal shoulder badges put them on the right track or I was able to enlighten them.  Australia is the same word in Italian but to say Australian one must add an -o.
