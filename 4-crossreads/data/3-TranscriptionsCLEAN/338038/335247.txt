  
 in one big show, the battle of Fromelles, just south of Armentieres. It was about the hottest thing I have seen while it lasted. (About 2 days). They say one lives & learns. I am quite sure I never knew what Artillery was till I came here. The Bosche has splendid artillery & handles it like a tradesman, but the British, they are superb! We have been in many different parts of the line and everywhere the R.F.A. is a "household" word. 
 I have been rather careful about making statements about war prospects etc. but from what one can see here, I am convinced the Bosche has just about "lost his punch". He may attack us again but I think he must be getting pinched for men, and will be mainly on the defensive henceforth, though the pushing of him will not be "beer & skittles" as his system
