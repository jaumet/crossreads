<p>memory of those who have not returned from the war but whose memory this city places above all else on this day of rejoicing. The statue is only of wood &amp; plaster but the entire city files past it in a silence that is heartrending.</p>
<p>The amount of black in the crowd &amp; the homage paid to it no matter what the condition in life of the person is a tribute of never dying gratitudes to one who has lost some dear one for their liberty The spirit of [indecipherable] is entirely absent in this vast crowd which has come to pay its homage to the immortal &amp; nameless dead.</p>
<p>This spirit of sadness seems to tinge all the festivities. Whether the losses are in every family or whether the cenotaph looming at top of Av.[Champs Elysee is an ever silent reminder I know not but there is a sadness here which later in England I failed to detect.</p>
<p>The tubes are packed &amp; it took us nearly &frac12; hour to get on to the station &amp; in the train &ndash; well ordinary trains are packed but to night sardines are not more tightly packed &amp; the hot smell of the tube &amp; the body smell of the crowd some of whom are country people is not the incense breath of Morn.</p>
