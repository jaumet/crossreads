<p>intervals were twenty six Australian Troopships &ndash; The two warships quickly gathered speed as they entered open sea, and majestically they cut their way thru the ripless water, throwing up a bow wave on either side, and churning the water at their stern. One could not abstain from possessing that feeling of security as these vessels passed out of harbour</p>
<p>The leading ship was the most powerful, by far, she carried much larger guns 9.2 inch and also thicker armour plating adorned her sides; her speed being about equal to our own, which averaged approximately 24 Knots, - her radius of action was also much greater than that of ours &ndash; she was cleared ready for action, and her upper deck gave her a good freeboard; - she was a much larger vessel altogether, and posessed four funnels the same as our class of ship but did not rake as much as ours did (that is on the slope)</p>
<p>Our class of Light Cruiser were designed mostly for scouting purposes and for duties on trade routes and were in consequence excellent sea boats.</p>
