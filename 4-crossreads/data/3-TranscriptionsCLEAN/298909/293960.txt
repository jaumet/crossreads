At 9.30 am after a severe medical examination, we boarded a Hospital-train which runs along the Canal daily - Our destination was Ishmailia - here we got out & had to carry our home or anything we wanted with us, that is blankets - etc, - 48 hours rations, water, etc, it was beastly hot & talk about dust. We marched from Ismailia to Ferry Post - crossing the Suez Canal by hand Ferry, we arrived at our destination
