<p>Sunday 3rd Dec.<br/>Very cold weather, the ground being frozen hard. Had a very busy night our chaps being caught in a barrage while charging over &ndash; majority of cases were fairly severe. Had two cases of exceptional interest. In one man a nose cap of a shell was embedded in the flesh making a large cavity. The second was most gruesome. Whilst probing a wound the M.O. drew out some hair &amp; on persevering he found a piece of a man's skull which had been blown into the mans leg, being wounded in fact by this fragment of <strike>schoo</strike> skull. Plenty of shells coming over but so far none seriously close</p>
<p>Monday 4th Dec<br/>Had a fairly busy night with wounded with a few bad cases. Sick &amp; "trench feet" have dropped in number the last couple of days &amp; orders have come out which hold the officers directly responsible for undue cases. In one case they quoted the 5th Division lost 100 through "trench feet" in one day while the adjoining division only had 6.</p>
