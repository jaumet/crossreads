  
 The news continues to be good. Fritz is retreating all over the front from Rheims to the north, & the Hindenburg has been reached in parts & broken in one place. We are, in fact, threatening Douai, Cambrai & St Quentin. Lens has fallen & so has La Bassee. The only doubt that exists in my mind is whether he will be able to hold out on the remainder of the Hindenburg line: (that is whether we shall fail to outflank it); or whether he has some retreating line up his sleeve. 
 One is inclined to look a gift horse in the mouth after so many weary months of bad news. As a matter of fact, we have, without reserve, done excellently on this front, & so have the French & Americans in the south. The strategy appears sound, & there is an excellent chance of his evacuating the Hindenburg
