 8.4.15 Thurs. 8th.  This morning we were signalling with Head Quarters &amp; got into communication with some signallers on the hill behind the Citadel.  The Squadron was mounted, but there was no parade this afternoon, but we were paid instead, a party from here went to Luxor last Tuesday, &amp; arrived back this morning, they say they had a good trip, shortage of funds stopped me from going.  A "two-up" school is going strong here in the mess room tonight, trying to get rid of their pay;  had to fall in at 8 oclock as on line picquet till 10 o'clock.
