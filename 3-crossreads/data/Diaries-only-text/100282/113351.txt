As we were spelling before going through Samer, the 3rd Battalion came along passed us, we then followed them through the town with our Band playing their best, our rifles all slung on the right shoulder, trying to make as good an impression as possible for to these people we were almost the first Australian soldiers that they had ever seen, they were all lined along both sides of the street as we passed through, the kids were singing out "Welcome to Samer" or something to that effect, the old familiar "fish chips" smell was very noticeable we one all wished we had a plate of them in front of us for we were very hungry. We pulled up just outside Samer had dinner after this we pulled the old No.9 platoon out, made the 4 again. Saddled up again off to our new home what a beauty she is, the Coy is scattered over a good mile No.11 are billeted quite close to an old church in Verlingthun from there to Coy Hqrs it is a good mile what billets they are
