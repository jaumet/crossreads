<p>6-12-16<br/>Wed 6th<br/>Could not get a limber today &amp; put the time in knocking around the Camp. Sergt Partridge is under open arrest &amp; has to report to Bde H.Q. this morning for refusing innoculation.The troop from the 2nd Regt with Engineers who went out to tap for water returned this afternoon &amp; reported good going for horses a little out &amp; found the ground too hard to take the drill &amp; considers the outlook for water is very bad along the flank;  a good number of Bedouins followed them several miles coming back, they sighted a Turkish patrol but did not clash;  A patrol goes to Aabash from here daily, they go in 10 miles &amp; only 8 from El Arish &amp; can see it plainly through glasses. Turkish troops</p>
