Salisbury ? Sutton Veny
countryside is and notices the oaks as especially beautiful. I have not remarked these trees on the Continent to the same extent. A march of 2  miles from Sutton Warminster brought us to Sutton Veny Camp where all we soon installed. Met General Robertson after lunch and again at 3 p.m. when he arrived with General Rosenthal who gave an address to the quota. Spent the remainder of the afternoon in the Camp. Dined. Early to bed.

Batman Scotty Watson is not satisfactory and was late this morning. Afternoon went up to No. 1 A.G.H and passed the afternoon with the sisters finishing with a stroll in the woods of the Marquis of Bath. Very lovely shades of green as usual. Being Sunday the camp was more quiet than ever.
