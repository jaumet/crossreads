A bonza day quite a contrast to yesterday.  We had a muster parade at 2 p.m. but got no news on it of our movements but I fancy Monday or Tuesday should see something doing, & won't we be glad for one gets sick of hanging about waiting for our time to come.
20th.  Went into Plymouth last night & after a walk round the town went to the Theatre Royal an opera was on & one that I had seen while in Paris "Rigoletto" I liked it in English much better than Italian, the 3rd & 4th Acts I think are splendid.  I had a bonza seat & I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was 10 oclock when it came out & I missed the last tram & had to walk all the way home.Sunday & a most miserable day, a cold wind has been blowing all the time & it looks like rain.  I wish to goodness they would get us across & on to our boat, influenza is raging round here & a lot of the boys are down with it one chap
