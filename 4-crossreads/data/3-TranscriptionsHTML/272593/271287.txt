Fritz was watching the performance closely then he collars his rifle &amp; goes through the same movements.<br/>It seems ridiculous you can watch one another walking about &amp; changing reliefs &amp; etc &amp; when flares go up there is no need to crouch down for no one will interfere with you in fact if you happened to be out among the snow &amp; shellholes you will be looking for one to go up &amp; show the way across &amp; as</p>
