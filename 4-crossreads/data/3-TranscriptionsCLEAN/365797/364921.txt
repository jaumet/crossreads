  
  Saturday March 25th.  Well, we went to the Bazaar, (Billie & me), it was all wright, we went for a "Bonzer" drive all round Killara for 3 we must have been away for nearly 15 minutes. I have not heard how much they got yet over 100-0-0 I should think. 
 Bill is enclosing a letter to you, I don't think there is much reading about it so you wont have to put your glasses on. 
  Wednesday 29th 1916.  I am going to a swimming carnival to morrow afternoon.
