March, 1915Monday 15Reveille at 2 A.m. Marched at 3 A.m. Morning star very bright & like all tropical countries the stars shine brightly - it was cold but the sham fight kept us warm, we got home at Sundown, good training, but rough on horses. Raining tonight the 2nd time since we've been in Egypt. Only 3 inches per annum fall here, & 15 points at a time hence you can guess what vegetation grows, on the desert. [indecipherable] I have not mentioned if you wish to draw the attention of a waiter in any Hotel or Restaurant, you clap hands mostly French is spoken I can understand it & make myself understood, but I am not au fait.
