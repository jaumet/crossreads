with the railway running at the foot, the great military camps Hospitals of Etaps, also the town of the same name, it is principally a fishing place many curious sights are to be seen when walking through it, on the flats below me a lot of our chaps some "Scotties" are playing football, about 100 yards from where I am sitting an elderly Y.M.C.A. man is giving they boys his weekly lecture on the French language.
It has been a lovely day today something like an Australian day in early spring just cold enough for us to keep our coats on plenty of sunshine.
