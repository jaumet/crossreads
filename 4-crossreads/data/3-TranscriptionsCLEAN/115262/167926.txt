Friday 8 June 1917.
Weather moderate & a decent day at sea in a few ways. Duties on Isolation do not allow of parade etc. with rest of the unit.
Still unescorted. Attended N.C.O's lecture parade at 4 pm on boat deck. Had a look at negatives of one of the Ship's engineers, - negs of snaps taken on last trip to Engd & air raid on Engsh. coast.
