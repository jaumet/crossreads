<p>Notice</p>
<p>After 30th December, 1917, no retailer may sell sugar except to a duly authorized customer;  and these Permits are issued under arrangements made by the Army Council with the Food Controller to enable serving officers or men to purchase sugar during leave or when billeted or otherwise unable to draw Army rations of sugar, and to enable sugar to be bought for Officers' Messes in respect of members who elect not to draw rations in kind.</p>
<p>Permits must only be issued to serving officers or men who are in receipt of pay from Army Funds.</p>
<p>The Permit must be given up to the retailer when the purchase is made, and is only valid within the period to which it applies.  It is a Permit to buy sugar, and does not carry with it any guarantee that the sugar will be supplied by any particular retailer to whom it may be presented.</p>
<p>In the case of officers or men on leave the period inserted will be the period of leave.  In other cases the period must not exceed 14 days.</p>
