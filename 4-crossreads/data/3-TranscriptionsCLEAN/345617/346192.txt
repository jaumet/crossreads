  
 Septembre 27 Our attack yesterday was very successful - inflicting heavy enemy casualties & taking a lot of prisoners. Our Coy have suffered about 20 casualties & 2 almost certain to succumb. Had to turn out again this afternoon & go with a large party carrying material to the Front & wiring. Heavy shelling during the day but quiet tonight. 
 Septembre 28 Arrived back in camp about 6.30 a.m. after being out all night carrying material & wiring. Tommies failed to get their objective on our Right & in consequence our 15th Bde was cut up badly & had to be relieved by our 8th. I think the Tommies were the 23rd Div. Had to turn out again this afternoon & go with some [indecipherable] to the "Butt" to do some foreward work. L. Fisher of my Sec. was killed tonight.
