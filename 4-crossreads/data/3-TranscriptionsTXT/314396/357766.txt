Thursday. 31st. Dec 1914.Got up at 7.30 &amp;  had breakfast  in pygamas. Then went back to bed. Got up at 11 for a lecture. Went to Geo Reid big parade at 2 o'clock. He spoke to us but we couldn't hear much. We marched past him. The parade was very good. Went down &amp;   found Major Bennetts tent but he was at Mess, so couldn't see him. Went to bed at 8 o'clock &amp; asked to be awakened at 10.30 but woke up myself at 12.5. And so started the new Year.Must start a new book now so good night or rather morning.
