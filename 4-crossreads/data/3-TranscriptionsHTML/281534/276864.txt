<p>6/3/19 Marcinelle<br/>Wet and showery. Battled round the billets in the morning talking to various people. Major Davis, E Thewlis and Jack were some of these. Was sitting in my billet when Pte Charlie De Boos walked in on his way over to England. During the afternoon walked up the town and had my French lesson at the Berlitz school &ndash; a place always to be associated with overheated rooms and the smell of stale human perspiration. Thence to an ornate coiffeur (the brass chafing dish is always the sign) for a haircut. At mess were Denny (A/BM) Hislop Hay (Red +) Miller, Fethers, Jackson and Loydhouse. At Brussels Opera House men and women use the same Herren &amp; Dammen. Spent the evening yarning to W Debois &ndash; a flu patient.</p>
