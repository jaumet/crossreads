3/7/16.
Crept about in No Mans? Land for an hour. We captured a Hun sniper, who has been troubling us for some time, he dropped from a willow tree almost on top of one of our chaps, who was armed to the teeth, but he forgot about all his lethal weapons, and punched the Hun in the eye, then gave him a shower of uppercuts that knocked him out. He was a Bavarian a rough looking joker too; dressed in tweed trousers and a blue butchers coat. As we were returning to our lines a machine gun caught us and one of our chaps was killed. This machine gun is operated by the crack German gunner on this front. He is known as "Parapet Joe" and I must say that if he could express his talent on a violin he would be called a genius. A very wild night, shells of every calibre rained down on our line.
