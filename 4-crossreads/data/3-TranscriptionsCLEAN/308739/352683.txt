  
 Thursday 30 March 1916 [The following sentence crossed through.]  Regiment cleaning up Camp.  Col. Fuller & Major Foster left today. 
 Regiment returned from Outpost duty on the Canal.  Major Bruxner took lunch with us.  Water carts which left here early this morning to supply the needs of the men who had no water during this march across the desert from Tel el Kebir returned to Camp.  They say the men were famished, & some  9 died of thirst. The man who ordered the march was counted out in the presence of the Prince of Wales & hooted.  An inquiry is to be held.

 Saturday 1 April 1916 Having completed Business I took train at 1 p.m. for the Barrage a distance of 18 miles from Cairo.  The spot is at the junction of the Blue & White Niles.  At this place large dams are erected across the River with Sluce Gates, wide enough to permit small boats to pass to & fro.  The gardens are Beautifully laid out, whilst light Lines are laid to different centres on which trolleys run fitted with seats & pushed along by niggers.  Donkeys also can be secured for 5 P.T. to convey the tourist around Tea gardens & refreshment sheds at different points, also museum showing the  [indecipherable] construction of the Dams & Canals that are watered From this spot vast areas of Land obtain their supply of water for Irrigation purposes.
