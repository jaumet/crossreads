Inspected by G.O.C. Horses very poor & eating SAND like in a drought & like the men. They are stale - (LILIES). Desert "Lilies" are in bloom a very pretty white bloom about 3 in. in diameter. A sweet scented bulb & I may be able to post you some.
Am anxiously waiting news re my application for leave & hardly dare expect it will be granted.
[The remainder of the page crossed through.]Will go via ITALY & FRANCE if it comes off. 6 weeks I applied for. When the next stunt takes place here, the Turkswould know all about it before hand - Their flying men come over & congratulate ours on any decoration the very next day. HOW DO THEY KNOW??
