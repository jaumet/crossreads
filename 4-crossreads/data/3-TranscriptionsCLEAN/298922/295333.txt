Sunday, 7 January 1917
Fine & warm again. Mule watching an enemy plane flying over - a big mob of PELICANS came along in their usual PHALANX formation & as one wag says said "the Orderly Sergeant behind to see they keep their "dressing & don't fall out". Very few game birds here except a few ducks & plover.
[This sentence crossed through.]  Parcel from Selfridges sent by Lance - I have been very lucky of late in receiving letters & parcels.
Brigadier inspected lines always know Sunday by his visits.
Church Parade - Padres could tell us a lot of interesting stuff about this Country if they knew. Am sorry to see by Papers "Carbinder" is dead - I rode GUNSHOT at Romani a good horse.
