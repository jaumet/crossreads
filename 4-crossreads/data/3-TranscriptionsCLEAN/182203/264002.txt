  
 the parcel I sent by Captain Richardson & hope he managed to get out to see you. He is such a quiet man but an awfully brave, good fellow. Hope you all liked him? I should love to receive a Photo of dear old mother & Eddy taken together in the garden. Suppose you are nearly frozen, while we are nearly  cooked      Fondest love & kisses to you all & trust you are all well. I am expecting a few letters this week, just got a few odd ones last week. I am,                                                                                                                                                                                                             yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                                                             Edith
