Tuesday 25th September
Telephone - affords a lot of amusement when used by the Foreigners in the Hotel - they must gesticulate all the time, & this is difficult with one hand engaged.
Today I'm told I'll get a boat on Thursday but I do not build on anything till I actually embark. Went to the sporting Club & had Tea etc. The Greek & Italian & French women all dress very daintily but one should not see them eat. No mail from Australia for 6 weeks now.
