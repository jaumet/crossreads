  
 12/3/17 Rather a long gap since I last wrote in here, & plenty to write too. The sisters arrived & turned out to be splendid. Work increased & the dispensary hut was cleaned out to be renovated in common with some dozen others; the others to form a new hospital here 
 A partitioned off dispensary was to form part of the improvement When work had just started Sgt Clay returned to the 3rd, & on leaving promised to see about what chances I would have of getting job of dispenser with them
