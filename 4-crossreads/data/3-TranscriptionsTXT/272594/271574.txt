o I decided to give one a fly.  We also bought a lot of little things such as boot & hair brushes etc. for we will have to keep our appearance up whilst down here.
At 4 oclock we caught our car again & soon we were home again. Saw 2 Australian Bands playing in Salisbury & they were very good.
13th Got up late this morning for it was Sunday after breakfast Jock & I went to our little den & wrote the rest of the morning
