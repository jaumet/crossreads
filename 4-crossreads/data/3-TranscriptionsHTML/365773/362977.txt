<p>love to Beres &amp; Ralph<br/>My dearest Sister,<br/>Your cake to hand two days ago &amp; believe me it was lovely - I have five officers with me in the company &amp; we scoffed it at afternoon tea - we all bow to you as a cook my dear, it was done beautifully &amp; so rich - you know one cannot buy cake nowadays, that isnt a request for more I dont want you working for a hulking loafer like me - Purdon is still with me he remembers you &amp; the 'fat girl1 quite well &amp; wishes to be remembered to you both.</p>
