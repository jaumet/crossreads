<p>snow and ice, and experienced all sorts of weather.  A soldiers life is not one to be envied, or to choose from among others.  It is a hard life and a risky one.  I will not forget my years experience of a soldiers life.  Nevertheless I have had many pleasant experiences, have travelled half way round the world, seen many beautiful places and cities, towns &amp; villages, which is a pleasant and profitable education.  I hope I will not have to put in another whole year in the army, and that I will be safely back in Victoria before the year is out.  I am not downhearted, far from it, and I don't regret coming, but if there is another war in my time, they will have to manage without my assistance.</p>
