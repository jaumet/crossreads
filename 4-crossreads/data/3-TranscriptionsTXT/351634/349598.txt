 (Sunday 2nd and 3rd May continued) Counter attacks but they were repulsed. Some reinforcements came up during the night for us They were some of Kitchener's army called the Nelson Brigade They got between our fire and the Turks and suffered severely At day light the Turks got the whereabouts of our posion and turned machine guns on us that's where we suffered heavily Men were falling down and getting shot all around me I got the sole of my boot taken off at the time. Further on the left the Nelsons took up position they charged the Turks machine gun but had to retire. They charged again but retired in panic running right across to our old position on Pope's hill They lost heavily and what got out in the retirement never came up to us again. There were about four of them stopped with us. They were such a Boyish looking lot not like the Australians who act on their own accord when they lose their Officer. The Tommies seem lost without officers. We have hung on here all day and have got orders to retire 7.30. Got all wounded down and got down into gully for a rest I heard that Rene was taken away wounded this morning. The 13th battalion were the last to leave dead Man's Ridge That's the name the give it Well am going to turn in a I feel very tired and worn out. (T uesday 4th) Feel a bit fresher this morning Mustered up battalion and we had 420 men left we lost about 400 casualities Are not doing any fatigue to day we are taking the advantage of a rest. Went to Anzac beach for a swim. And saw Jack Mitchell. Barry Hanna was killed. (Wednesday 5th) We are getting a lot of shrapnel this morning Got orders to get ready to relieve the 15 in trenches on Pope's Hill at 10 AM. There is a lot of firing to day It is quiter to night. Our section commander is a Clergyman Bill Frances a very nice fellow indeed he has been recommended for a D C M for carrying wounded across to our old firing line under heavy machine gun fire. I I often have a yarn with him He knows La Touche and he is a very learned man and a good speaker
