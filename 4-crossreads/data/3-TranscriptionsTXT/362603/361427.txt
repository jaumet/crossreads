One day we spent at Hull on the other side of the Humber.  We caught the train to a place called New Holland & then caught the ferry to Hull.  The Ferry was a bonzer boat with apholstered cushioned seats & was lovely & warm.  On reaching Hull we toured all round the Town noting a Statue erected to Wm Prince of Orange.  It is painted Gold & bears an Inscription which states that he was the Liberator of the People.
