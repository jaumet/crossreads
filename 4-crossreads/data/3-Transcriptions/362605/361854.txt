<p>in London but it would have meant a longer stay over here &amp; I have not pushed it.  I do not expect to be relieved from here for at least 4 months so I should get Home just in time for X'mas.</p>
<p>I am quite happy &amp; not a bit lonely that Ellis has gone.  Both of us could not go &amp; it is only by chance that my application was turned down &amp; that His was accepted.  My whole time is occupied &amp; I rarely have 10 minutes to loaf.  Even now at 10 pm I must go down &amp; shave, clean my boost etc, for the mornings are icy &amp; freezing &amp; it is much too cold to shave with any degree of comfort.</p>
<p>We are still very busy here &amp; it is rumoured that they are going to make me a warrant officer temporarily, the Irish Mans's rise again but rumours rarely come to anything in the army.  Just address letters Sgt. or S/Sgt. &amp; they will get me alright.</p>
<p>I must go now for I had a very busy day &amp; have been reading &amp; writing since 5 pm. I am stiff from Hockey &amp; must shave etc.</p>
<p>Kindest Regards to all my dear Friends.  I have written to most &amp; told them not to write to me as I expect to be Home shortly.  I expect nothing of the kind but I have not the time to write letters now &amp; I have no wish to break my vow to answer every letter that I have received.  I have written over 1600 letters since I came away &amp; it is a good performance for me.</p>
<p>Best Love to you all.  I hope to see you sooner than X'mas but the Fates will decide</p>
<p>Your own Boy &amp; Brother<br/>Harry</p>
