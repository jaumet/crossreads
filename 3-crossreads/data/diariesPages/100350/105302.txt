8th Battle still going strong, Warships shelling "Hill 971" and the W. Hills in our front all night, the Imperial Troops gain a footing on the "Chocolate Hills" after some stiff fighting, but unable to connect up with our line. At daybreak our Brigade was ordered to attack "Hill 60. The 14th 15th and 16th supported by the 13th went forward in grand style but soon came under heavy Machine gun and rifle fire which checked our progress, men took what little cover there was and held on for a little more than an hour. Several small parties of our boys were cut of and either killed or made prisoners. The Turks were being strongly reinforced and we retired to our old position, leaveing many of our gallant lads dead on the Field, our retirement was covered by our machine guns. We started right away to consolidate our position and prepare for any attack the enemy might deliver. The Turks must have brought up thousands of Troops on "Hill 971 as they fairly swarmed over the flat top when they attacked our troops, we could see the big naval shells bursting among them which must have killed hundreds. The dead were piled up in places, our loss,es were very heavy also, and the :Hill Top was lost, the Turks fought bravely as did the New Zealanders who hung to their position right through.
Troops badly in need of water.
