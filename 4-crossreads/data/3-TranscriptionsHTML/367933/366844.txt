<p>the parcel sent me through your depot, by Miss K. Mack came along safely today  &ndash; for which many thanks.<br/>Tucker is a long way scarce here in the Promised land than ever it was in the desert and personally I think the Jews have far too much sense to ever re-assemble in such a God forgotten place.</p>
<p>I feel sure we are here for the rest of our lives, so if you run across any of my friends who are War Contractors or have won a Tattersalls sweep lately please inform them of my parcel address<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>[ could be something "linock"]</p>
