I have only a faint recollection of hearing No 4 and 3 depart. About 3.30 in the morning we, who were left, automatically put our packs on our back and left the shelter and made for the beach. On our way we met the machine gunners carrying their machine guns along. They had lived the ridge above us and were our last line of defence. We crossed over the small trestle bridge on to the "Milo" and from the "Milo" we embarked on the barge. We waited on the barge for some time and during the time we were waiting a terrific crack, crack of rifles and the heavy sound of an explosion either of a mine or a big gun being blown up, was heard. At five minutes to four the barge left the "Milo" and we were speeding our way to the Hospital ship "Dongala", not a man from our unit missing. How this evacuation was worked is marvellous, for had the Turks known of our intention there must have been a very different story to tell. It seems strange that not one shell should drop on the beach during the whole of the night we were leaving. There had been a terrific bombardment of Gabe Tepe during yesterday forenoon and rumour had it that Beachy Bill had been silenced,
