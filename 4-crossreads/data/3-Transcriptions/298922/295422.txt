<p>Good Friday 6 April 1917</p>
<p>7 A.M. At 0700 we moved out of El Arish once more for GAZA, past our old Camp, remember where I dug up 2 bottles of Kerosine I had buried after Magdabah fight as I could not carry them at the time. Men &amp; Horses fit.</p>
<p>The 4 L.H. Brigade relieved us &amp; I had a few words with Cuth Fetherston Hough. We are leaving &ndash; he is fit &amp; well. We are marching light but the weather is warming up now altho' heavy dew at night. Great improvements have been made in the defences of this El Arish. Camped at SHEIK ZOWAID or as the men call it 6 x 8. I have no blotting paper but SAND did the ancients &amp; its good enough for me</p>
