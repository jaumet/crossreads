bombs out of it, which I intend to send home first chance I get.A fine batch of German prisoners passed through here this afternoon 400 of them, they were of all sorts and sizes some of them quite boys while others were oldish men, they looked very pale and yellowish on it, probably on account of living some so long in their dugouts well under the ground they were part of a bunch gathered in at Beaumont Hamel, there are also great numbers of Germans working on the roads about here, some of them can speak English quite well we often used to have a yarn with them while the guards were out of the way, they wont let you talk to them if they can help it, the Germans seem quite satisfied to remain prisoners
