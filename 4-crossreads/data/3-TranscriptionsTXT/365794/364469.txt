Friday 9 March 1917 [8 March 1918]No record kept of this day evidently it simply slipped away in the usual routine of this busy life.  When I wonder shall I waken in the morning to a sound other than the bugles or go to bed a night without the "come home" call of lights out?One grows so accustomed to these little episodes of daily life that they slip by unheeded.93 Sisters & V.A.D's or V.A.D. virgins & doubtfuls the men call them with reason in some instances, none in others.
