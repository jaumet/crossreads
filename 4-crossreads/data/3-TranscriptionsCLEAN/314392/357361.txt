It was the worst night I experienced for ages arrived back in camp at 4am and dog tired. Beautiful day. Heavy artillery action.13th Each day up to date has had its thrills- yesterday while out with a convoy I ran into a very heavy thunderstorm which strange to say took place only in the region of the trenches. Needless to say I became soaking wet. Today we break up and return to our units.17th out with convoy to Birthday Farm (Messives Ridge). Fritz was too busy so returned home very lucky to do so.
