<p>Feb. 26<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went out on the Chow job. One of our boys caused a riot wiht them at dinner time &amp; had to run for his life, they were making themselves too familiar &amp; would&#39;nt keep away from the lorry, so his nibs threatened them with a revolver &amp; that was enough they got hold of any - thing they could lay their hands on &amp; his nibs sought safety in flight (&amp; the surest way with those fanatics) I was&#39;nt there most of us went along &amp; parked in the Place Plichon (Bailleul) &amp; waited. I bought some new parts for my primus burner 8.francs 25c. we took the chows home early on account of the riot - we got home 2.30 P.M.</p>
