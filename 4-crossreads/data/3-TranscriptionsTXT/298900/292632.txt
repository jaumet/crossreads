plane came across & flew low down over our trenches.   I was trying to locate the Mortar which had been firing.   Machine guns & rifles blazed out from all sides but he seemed to lead a charmed life as he was still going strong when we left.   Back again through Ravine Wood we touched at another post & reached Camp shortly after 5 P.M. after a day of great interest.   The ground we covered was the scene of the great Messine battle & the trenches, notices & fill boxes of Fritz still stand & serve to show what a wonderful advance it was.   It was a grand day, bright & clear & we could see, Ypres & such places quite plainly & shewed what a death trap it was for us prior to this advance.
Sunday 17th Feb    Went to Communion at 9 A.M.    Padre Holliday.   3 of us present.    A beautiful day, bright sunshine but nippy.   A great day for the Aeroplanes
