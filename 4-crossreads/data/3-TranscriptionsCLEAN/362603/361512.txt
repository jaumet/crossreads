the Girls.  Hope You get some pleasure out of the use of the Pony which Mrs Bell was Kind enough to offer the loan of.  There are only about 8 left out of the original Unit but there were only 25 in the First Unit so that is not surprising is it?  It is all O.K. giving Hazel James our address.  We gave it Her but she has probably lost it.  She is only one of the Girls to Us so it does not matter what She Knows.  I can get plenty of sugar Mum & anything can be got in the Island.  I can get anything from Marie or Auntie Annie.  I have only to write & next mail everything is to hand even butter or pickled Kippers etc if I wish.  But Home made Jam & Ginger etc. will be lovely.  We will await that parcel with impatience.  Yes, be good to poor Alie's widow.  We must all help one another, cos the Government has enough to do to look after Itself.  I believe You are having an awful time with strikes out in Australia.  I think it is a good place to be out of by the way things are going.  Now Mum, I've lots of letters to write & I've given You all the news so I'll try & write to Bess & Nell & Ida Nelson before I go to bed.  It is getting late now & I'm pretty tired.  We are all well & although the weather is pretty rainy, still we are used to it now & I don't care if it rains every day as You know.  Give Regards to Mrs Bunting & Hobson & Stephens & All my good Friends roundabout.Heaps of Love to George Dad & Yourself.From Your own BoyHarry.
