<p>November 5<br/>106.<br/>This morning spent sketching &ndash; another trial for the Anzac Bulletin.  The old sketch of Toby:  writing in our billet at Henencourt the body of sketch, added to it some pictures from La Vie Parisienne&hellip;</p>
<p>Dear Liza &ndash; the pictures in the new billet make it quite like home! &hellip; In the dugout at Factory Corner, the first day in, Billy sacrificed for the general good a dozen Kirchner cards he'd carried with him.-  "We'll put them up in the dugout and make it look like home!"</p>
<p>Wrote to Bakers for "Chastelard" of Swinburne's.. I'll post tomorrow.  Mail from M.D.S. not yet up.</p>
<p>This morning I sketched about here for an hour &ndash; result [indecipherable] of wounded.</p>
