<p>a dastardly, cowardly, manner by the heartless merciless, destructive, fight evading Huns, was observed in dry dock, and a close scrutiny of the graceful yacht-like lines of the underwater portion of the hull is sufficient to indicate to even a layman, that the steamer is a "flyer" in the front rank of the highest class.</p>
<p>When looking upon the huge dimensions presented by a close view of the whole of hull &amp; deck fittings of a vessel of this size it almost appears to be a foul sin that such a vessel should be utterly destroyed and irretrievably sunk &amp; lost while engaged in the merciful work of the care of the wounded, as the Britannic &amp; others, or the conveyance of peaceful citizens from one port of the world to another without in the very least degree helping to improve the condition of affairs from a battle point of view.</p>
<p>The loss of the large Red Cross vessels in the Mediterranean &amp; in the English Channel &amp; the destruction of the "Lusitania" with the attendant loss of over 1000 innocent unoffending lives including a large percentage of women &amp; children together with quite a few "neutrals" so horrifies all rational &amp; reasonable people that acts like these can only be performed by hell fiends, double dyed degraded cowards never fit again to bear the honored name of men.</p>

However London soon commences to assert itself, as it were, on closer acquaintance.</p>
