  
 D. Coy to play with the 13th Bn. against the 4th Machine gunners. They elected me captain, they made 88 & we had 9 for 164, so won easily; I scored 8, had no luck, pulled a short ball off the wicket on to the stumps. After tea, at 6.30p.m., my platoon, 13th, played the rest of D Coy & we won by 117 to 73, I got 5 runs & 4 wickets. We finished at 9, & Crain & I had a feed of fried eggs at the estaminet before "bed". I was pleased to get a couple of photos from Elsie today, they are excellent ones of her. Thursday 30 May Had a bit of an exam at the school this morning, he said "very good" when I had done my little bit, but it was simple stuff I had often done before. In the afternoon, we dumped our packs & blankets, & are ready to start for the line again in the morning. I am not one of the lucky 331/3 % to be left out - the war news is very rotten again, the British being driven back once more. After tea, Cpl. Mann, Skipper, & I went to the "Smart Set", the 4th Division concert party - they were splendid, every item very good. One chap was very clever, dressed as a woman, wore some nice frocks
