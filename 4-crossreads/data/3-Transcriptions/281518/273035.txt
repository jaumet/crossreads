<p>chapels are very fine that of St. Andrew being lovely. The roof of tiny cubes of brass, colour resembled a brazen cloudy sky Constantinople was outlined on the wall and looked like a night view with twinkling lights. When finished this will be a great church. To the Elysee for afternoon tea much dancing and plenty of girls there all smoking and giving the glad eye. They took some dodging. By the tube to Waterloo and then to Charing Cross and home by 'bus.</p>
<p>Yesterday at Westminster Abbey we could not see the Coronation Chair as it had been put away in some safe place.</p>
<p>14/8/16<br/>Showery. With Hinchcliffe &amp; Bazeley to the Trocadero and then by 'bus to the Tower Bridge from which a splendid view is to be had. To the Tower and saw the whole place being shown round by Beefeaters clad in their quaint uniforms. A great deal of stair climbing to do which knocked us out. The Crown Jewels very fine. Afternoon tea in Piccadilly Circus. Women smoke everywhere here with no sense of shame</p>
