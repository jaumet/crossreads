<p>had to get back to quarters, have a bath &amp; put clean clothes on. Had dinner at 7.30 p.m. then did a little washing &amp; tidied up my boxes etc, went to bed early. Got up early this morning &amp; went to early Communion. We have a new Chaplain &amp; he is an extremely "Low Churchman" &ndash; the last was a very "High Churchman", so you see we get variety even in our padre's. I'm on duty all to-day and have some very sick "Chocolate Soldiers", some came by boat yesterday from Serapium. Hope my basket arrives home safely. It cost over &pound; 2. to send it but think it was worth it. Have not heard from Fred or any of my friends who left the same time. Their letters are detained for some reason. if my friends say that I have forgotten them, not writing, tell them it is really too hot to write much, but I love receiving letters.</p>
