<p>Bulford<br/>24/2/18<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>Just a P.C. to let you know that we are all well. There is a big mail in but we have not received our quota yet. I am going to Grimsby on Wednesday. Hope to stay with Jennie. Food is short so I have to take my Tea, sugar, butter &amp; jam with me. I'll have to be a vegetarian while I am away but that won't matter much. Ellis is writing away for dear life but I am too comfy to write &amp; post. I am on the mat in front of the fire. It is not cold weather that we are having but it is more homely with a fire &amp; one can take off his Tunic &amp; be free &amp; cosy. I still wear the Tunic that I had made at D.J.'s I am going to have a new one made later on. I rode the bike to Sarum on Tuesday for the first time for months. I left early &amp; arrived home in time for supper at 9 pm. Well, Dad, I have no exciting news &amp; I have 16 letters to answer before I go on leave. Regards to Otto &amp; to my old [indecipherable]  Love from Harry</p>
