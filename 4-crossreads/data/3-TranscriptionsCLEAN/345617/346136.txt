Aout 2Still raining heavily. No Coy parade. NCOs from the 56th Batt. have given us instruction in Lewis Automatic & Vickers Machine Gun work. A great many hospital trains carrying wounded have passed here today - coming from the big advance in Belgium. Things reported going well there.
Aout 3Weather still very wet & disagreeable. Very little being done by Coy - just a little drill in billets.
