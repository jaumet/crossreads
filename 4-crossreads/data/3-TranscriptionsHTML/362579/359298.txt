<p>Fred came to see my last Sunday-night   &amp;  looks very well.</p>
<p>We have had some more gaiety. On Monday night we had the Night-off. Went to another Batt. Dinner   &amp;  had a lovely time. Played Tennis for a short time   &amp;  won. So I had to play our opponants next morning. I absolutely played a rotten game, so lost. To my joy just as we were going to court</p>
