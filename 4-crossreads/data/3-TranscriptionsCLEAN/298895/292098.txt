On dispensing duties the bearers going out to attend the training nothing else being attempted.  Heavy rain at night. Thursday 9th.   Orderly Sgt.  Orders came out the night before, reveille at 6 Breakfast 6.30 so I was out at 5.30 firing things up.  Everything O.K. & men got away by 7.30   Had a singsong last night impromptu & successful.  More rain.  The training as carried out is rather thorough, crops & such obstacles not being troubled about if they come in the way of the men, the owners no doubt putting in a claim for the damage.
