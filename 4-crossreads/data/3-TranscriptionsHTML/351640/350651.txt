<p>Mollie dear:/</p>
<p>Did I write to you anything about the birth place of Moses?  I think not further than just mentioning the event.<br/>Exodus II &ndash; "2 . And when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months."</p>
<p>To understand this sentence it is necessary to set down an earlier one.<br/>Ex I. "22 And Pharoh charged all his people, saying, &ndash; Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive."</p>
<p>The object was to destroy the Israelites who were then living and thriving in the land of Egypt, ruled over by Pharoah.</p>
<p>II &ndash; "3.  And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink."<br/>"4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him"<br/>"5.  And the daughter of Pharoah came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it."<br/>"6. And when she had opened it, she saw the child; and, behold, the babe wept.  And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrew's children."<br/>"7 Then said his sister to Pharoah's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</p>
