  
 none of us stripped in the 1st Div. we all took it as a great joke, everyone officers included had to take their hats off some of them did not like this for they knew without their hats they could not fall out and go away to some little estaminet or village, the whole crowd started off together & soon they were strung out for miles, I had no idea that I would run any where near so I did not even take the trouble to take my coat nor putties off either, but at the end of 2 miles I found myself in the first dozen & going well, but my putties were giving me fits so I was forced to pull up & take them off I lost a good 300 yards by this but I set off & caught some of them by degrees it was a great race home & I finished up by running in 6th & first home for the 1st Div. there were over 120 starters all told
