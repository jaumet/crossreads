<p>we shall be better off than when I set out.  Should the Sparks boys pay the account, you will be all right for the year.  Clever girls!  Do not be short of the necessaries that you may require but on the other hand it is wise not to be extravagant.  Have the bank book made up once a month then you will see all the amounts that have been paid to credit and all that you have drawn by cheque, the dates for each entry is set down in front of it.<br/>Hope Ted with his family enjoyed the holiday trip.

A real hell this earth must then be.  Per contra [Latin: on the contrary] no greater pleasure can be in life than to look upon ones sons and daughters</p>
