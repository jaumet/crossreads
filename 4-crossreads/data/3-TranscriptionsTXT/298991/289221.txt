 Sunday Sept 30th Sea is fairly calm. The last of the escort left us about 6 am this morning, so we have only four boats &amp; an Auxilliary Cruiser now, the last mentioned picked us up during the night. Church parage was held on No 3 hatchway, of course all attended. (Church of England). We get fairly good food, &amp; the best of bread, well in fact it is absolutely the best I have had since I left Australia. The Red Cross have issued out games  to  etc to each table. Very cloudy. No feeling too bad today. 
 Monday Oct 1st The sea was like a mill pond, there was hardly a ripple, &amp; it was a beautiful day, altho tonight it looked very much like rain, it frightened us from sleeping on deck. Received Red Cross issue today, it included 2 suits pyjamas, 2 prs socks, 2 cakes soap, 2 towels, chocolate, writing paper, &amp; pencil, I shirt &amp; undershirt, 1 underpants, &amp; a pr of deck shoes, so we didn't do too bad. A concert was held on No 3 hatchway (for'ard) this evening. We have some fair artists on board. By all appearance we are going to have a decent journey.
