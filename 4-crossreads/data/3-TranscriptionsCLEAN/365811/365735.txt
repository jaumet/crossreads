  
 I am still feeling awfully fed up about Colonel Simpson going away. The incedent has at present taken away all my ambition to rise above my present rank. I did not think it possible that anyone could receive such shabby treatment as he received. However I suppose I shall feel better about it as time goes on. 
 I sent you a wire today saying that I should be in England until 30th. 
 Things don't seem to be going too smoothly in Australia. In France, however, they are going splendidly. There are no indications of the Bosche Pushing on our front. 
 Best Love Yours affectionately C R Lucas
