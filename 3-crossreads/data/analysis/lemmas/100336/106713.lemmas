 This can be ad to what I have alreadi said about Gelebek . Near everi morn a train load of Kurdish refuge came in , this was due to the Russian advanc in that part of the countri . These peopl came through in a terribl starv condit and it was a frequent sight to see dead drag from the train . One morn in particular I can rememb , myself and anoth Englishman were work with a German soldier put a small steam crane togeth close to the station we were stand watch these peopl get off the train , a man jump out of a truck drag a dead child about 12 yrs of age out after him he did not carri the bodi but just had hold of the arm drag it along the ground when he thought nobodi was look he threw the bodi in amongst a heap of iron rail , the German immedi ran after him catch him a blow on the back of the head and made him take the bodi away and buri it .
