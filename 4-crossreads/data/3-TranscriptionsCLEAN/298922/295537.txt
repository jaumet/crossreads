 Big fighting is going on in France, "How long Mighty Father, How long".  I feel ashamed of myself not wanting to return to the front still it has to be did & this time next week I expect to be back.  
 The expense of this place is borne entirely by the Red X & they treat us very well indeed equal to any first class Hotel, with a Bathing Box & Motor rides only not much liberty is granted & all officers must be in to dinner at night.
