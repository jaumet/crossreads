Inspect the Castle, climbing to it's highest towers overlooking the lake. It must, no doubt have been well chosen. Right at the foot of the Castle are boats for hire & an old man rows me out for an hour & a half. By Killarney's lakes & dells  Just beautiful & wonderfully fresh. Visit Library Island & turn into the middle lake, to Innisfallen Island &  have a turn at the oars, visiting many other small islands, the old chap detailing each history (for his own interest) & back to the castle, arriving at 4.30 pm.  A brisk walk back to "The Glebe" through many lanes gathering shamrocks, an old lady from one lodge, assisting, & meet the others returning. Have a fine dinner ("some" potatoes) &  talk with our little party, mainly listening
