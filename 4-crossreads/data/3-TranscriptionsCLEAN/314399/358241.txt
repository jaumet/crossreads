  
 Monday 1 September 1919 Some day today. Very rough all day. In the evening a gale came to light. Made myself sick in the morning & have been sick 3 times since. No good to me. Have read all day. Intend going to be early. Passed a schooner at lunch time. 
 Tuesday 2 September 1919 Big sea again all day. Very little sleep last night on account of ship rolling. Quite a lot skipped for meals again today. Came third in the sweep & collected 8/-. Makes 4/8/- now I've collected. Am not quite OK again yet but am nearly so. Didn't miss any meals & wasn't sick, but am still a little bit squamish. Am ships orderly officer tomorrow.
