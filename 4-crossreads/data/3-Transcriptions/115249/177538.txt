<p>From Brigadier to Flag</p>
<p>The Wireless Station having been captured our objective in that direction has been attained. &nbsp;Recommend Beresford reinforce troops now at Wireless and hold the station. &nbsp;Have instructed Col. Watson to send two companies infantry at once to Beresfords assistance. &nbsp;Suggest also that Garrison be left at Herbertshohe with one months supplies which have now been partially landed. &nbsp;<s>Withdraw</s>&nbsp;and that balance of force move direct as early as possible on Rabaul.</p>
<p>If approved please instruct&nbsp;Beresford accordingly I will advise Watson</p>
