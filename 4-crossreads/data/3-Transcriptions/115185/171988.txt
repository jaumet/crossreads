<p>2 &ndash; I bought two chains of worked silver beads that the hareem ladies wear for J &amp; R. They are really very frilly and quaint and I got the two Solid Silver and all hand made. I saw the process, for 10/- each. The one for J. I got silver gilted the yellow colour being more becoming I thought. I have not sent them yet. But am waiting an opportunity. I must save some money in case I have a chance of going to Luxor. The girls are doing it on &amp;pound 6.15.0 now it is not the season. Patsy Blundell went a month ago when it was cooler it cost her &amp;pound 10 &ndash; she had a glorious time. How I wish you were here to go with me. I have a day off today and I have been reading Egyptian history it is fascinating. I wish J &amp; R were here. It amazes me how little one nursing sisters have appreciated the old monuments of ancient civilization and thought. They call them tombs and say 'they hate tombs". I hear they had lots of trips and attention from our soldiers while they were here in training</p>
