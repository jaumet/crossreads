 Solomon arrived in camp.&nbsp; Norman Walker and self got straw and filled our paliases ready for the night&#39;s rest and comfort.&nbsp; The thought of sleeping on a straw bed filled us with something akin to excitement.&nbsp; Had tea.&nbsp; After tea, shaved in hut and went to Church of England Recreation room where we wrote letters home.&nbsp; Enclosed pieces of ivy and holly, collected from the roadside on this morning&#39;s march.&nbsp; Returned to hut and turned in for the night.

 Reveille 6.30.&nbsp; Parade 7.&nbsp; Ground covered with snow and just about as cold as it can be.&nbsp; Camp seems very miserable altogether.&nbsp; Had a talk in my sleep with Norman Walker, so he says, about the miniature Cale-donian forest on the other side of the lake and woke up laughing.&nbsp; Parade 8.&nbsp; Raining.&nbsp; Dismissed and order-ed to parade again at 11.&nbsp; Ordered on parade at 10.&nbsp; Marched to Parade ground and stood on the snow covered and frozen ground for about two hours waiting for some &quot;brass hat&quot; to come and inspect us.&nbsp; He came along in time to find us with our feet completely frozen.&nbsp; In fact, the whole of our bodies were in pretty much the same parlous plight.&nbsp; After inspection and a march past, we were dismissed and went to hut for dinner.&nbsp; Glad to get under cover from the ice and mucky ground.&nbsp; Helped Tim Woods all afternoon with medical histories of our company during the voyage across.&nbsp; Had Tea.&nbsp; Also cold bath which chilled me to the marrow.&nbsp; Spent rest of evening shaving and cleaning up generally.

 Rose as usual.&nbsp; Snow covers ground.&nbsp; Did not fancy much washing in the cold and dark latrines.&nbsp; Had to do it.&nbsp; Paraded at usual time.&nbsp; Intensely cold.&nbsp; (Oh, for some heat again!)&nbsp; Spent all morning on Vaccination and Inoculation parades.&nbsp; Had dinner.&nbsp; Parade again in sleet and snow.&nbsp; Went for inoculation and got it with a vengeance.&nbsp; After tea, shaved and, not feeling too clever went to bed at 7 and slept till morning.

 Sunday.&nbsp; Rose 6.30.&nbsp; Parade 8.30.&nbsp; Church till 10.&nbsp; Broke off.&nbsp; After dinner, went into Ludgershall.&nbsp; Saw old Castle ruins built in 1100 some time.&nbsp; Also church built in 1320 wherein someone was buried in 1326 odd.&nbsp; Did not see it.&nbsp; Going another day.&nbsp; Had delicious cup of cocoa instead.&nbsp; Returned to camp.&nbsp; Had tea and wrote letters.&nbsp; Norman Walker went over to old church in evening.&nbsp; I did not.&nbsp; Very cold day, but fine, thank goodness.
