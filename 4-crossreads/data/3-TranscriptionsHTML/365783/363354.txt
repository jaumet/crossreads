<p>&amp; returned to the ship at 3 P.M.   Spent the afternoon watching the natives selling fruit &amp; etc.   Left Colombo 8 P.M.<br/>On the morning of Xmas eve preparations were being made for the fancy dress ball to be held in the evening.   This duly came off after dinner &amp; was a great success &ndash; most of the nurses &amp; officers appeared in some sort of fancy dress &amp; considering the limited time at our disposal &amp; the scanty material available some very good make ups were seen.   I went as "sweet seventeen" &amp; wore one of the nurses night gowns with low neck &amp; short sleeves &ndash; the portion of the gown covering the front of the chest was handsomely embroidered in blue silk.   A very beautiful yellow silk sash with large bow surrounded the waist.   The bottom edge of the gown was decorated with green crinkled paper &amp; reached only as far as the knees.   A pair of pyjamas turned up to the knees &amp; edged with green paper formed the only under garment.   A pair of Sister Stolos white stockings clothed the nether limbs.   A fair wig was worn with two large plaits with which was intertwined some strands of red silk.   A large panama hat trimmed with ribbons &amp; a bunch of mistletoe &amp; secured to the head with a beautiful red silk veil completed the costume.   My lips &amp; cheeks were touched up with rouge &amp; tooth powder</p>
