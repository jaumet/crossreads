  
 23 January, 1916 Maadi We had a nice comfortable sleep inside the tent last night, most of the boys were on pickquet that was why I slept in the tent. I think I will sleep in side tonight also as it looks like rain.  The chaps came in & woke us up half an hour early this morning & the language in the tent was vile for a while.  Went on Church parade this morning & this afternoon went up to see a couple of [troubs?] at the Remount Depot - coming back I met 'perkie' he is in the 7th Reg.  I got yarning to him & as a result was late for stables & got a burst about it from Bill - I found that while I was away my mare had got caught in a chain & had hurt her leg - I am sorry about it & hope she soon gets right.  Weston was out to see us to day & Doug Kenyon arrived back from Malta - he looks well on it. Weston brought some things out with him so to night we had cake, chocolate, peaches & oysters, a fine mixture but its wonderful what a chap can stand.
