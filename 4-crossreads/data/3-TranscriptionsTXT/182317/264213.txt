 Unless you have actually experienced it, you cannot imagine what a lot of excitement is aroused by the sight of a ship, or a glimpse of land, when you have been as long as we have with nothing to feed your greedy eyes on but sea &amp; marine life. In consequence I've spent most of today with my camera out, &amp; my field glasses up to my eyes. What I saw is forbidden ground, but which I snapped, you will probably see later. I've got some good results with the camera so far &amp; and as soon as I get a few prints of each for myself I will send the films with a print of each home. Remember me to all at College, &amp; to any one else you see, who is worth being remembered to. I leave  this  it entirely in your hands to judge who is worth while, &amp; who is not. If I have time I'll drop a post card to Blue &amp;  several of the twenty fifth officers. If you hear any one swearing because I didn't write, just tell them to keep cool &amp; be patient, &amp; they will probably get something by a later mail. If you happen to see Young of the 26th Inf. give him my best regards, &amp; tell him to pull himself together. You will probably hear from me again subsequently, if not by letter when you come over here. Good bye for the present &amp; good luck. Your fraternal brother Arthur.
