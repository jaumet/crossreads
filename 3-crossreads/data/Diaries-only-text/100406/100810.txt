medical inspection for Scabies and other things right in the middle of the Parade Ground, the rawest thing I ever seen. We were afterwards issued with 5 Blankets and shown to our Huts.
Sunday, 6-4
Parading all the morning for Inoculation (Influenza I believe), leave destination G.O.C. inspection. They say that first impressions are most reliable, if so the Charleroi girls are miles ahead of the girls around here for smartness, carriage looks, the only good thing about the women here is their complexions in some cases only even there the Charleroi girls beat them pointless. The women here seem heavy, stolid, lacking in feminine charm. They are seem very nice to the Troops but their temperament is very heavy.

Visited Warminster last night. We have been getting very good tucker here, a pudding every day and as much Bread and Butter as we can eat. Again the Bread tastes like cake after the stuff we have been accustomed to get on the other side. We got paid this afternoon.

Met Mickey De Luce this morning, he goes back tomorrow. Paid 8/- for my ticket to London. We go on 14 Days leave on Friday.
11th-4, Friday
Arrived in London at midday. Not being too flush I shall make the War Chest my headquarters. A number of L.H. from Egypt are here on leave (30 Days). They look very picturesque, bronzed, with spanking new Uniforms and Emu plumes in their Hats. Attended
