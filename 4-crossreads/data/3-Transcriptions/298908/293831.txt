<p>have said before, the reasons I am keeping on the straight track is on account of a girl who lives many miles from this country.<br/>I think I am about the only financial member of our hut the rest are totally broke, but thanks to Mr. Duke I am well cashed up.</p>
<p>4th.  This morning turned out gloriously but at 12 oclock up came the rain it looked as if it had set in but luckily about 2 oclock it cleared up nicely &amp; I went down to the Tram terminus to meet Miss Nissen who was coming out.  We went for a stroll down towards Tamerton Foliote.  This is out in the country &amp; it is a very nice little walk.  I took my camera out &amp; got a few snaps.  We came back to town again about 6 oclock &amp; went into Genoles a high class restaurant for dinner.  We had olives, soup, fish, pheasant, tart &amp; custard, cheese bread &amp; butter port wine &amp; coffee, cost was just on &pound;1.  I suppose lots of people will say how extravagant</p>
