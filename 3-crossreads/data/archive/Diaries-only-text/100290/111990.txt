Over over they turned till lost to sight behind hill. Heavy rain again this eve. Trenches roads a quagmire awful work. Pozieres trench. Stayed there till [indecipherable] a.m. terrific bombard. Lehane, Cunningham Eliot Smith killed at 5th Batt. Poor Frank Cartwright bad shell shock. Also two others. The terrible slaughter goes on. Oh that it all was finished.
