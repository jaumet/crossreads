<p>in a Keystone band, with instruments made from any old things..<br/>Halinghen 15.1.8<br/>The other day I got a large parcel from Louie. Have been getting a lot of mail from home.<br/>We are getting variable weather, three days ago the snow thawed all away &amp; remained so a couple of days, then yesterday when we got up we found every thing covered<br/>with it again. Then again this morning we found the snow all gone &amp; it was raining, so we did not have to go on parade.<br/>Sat. 19th 18.- Brigade sports, fine programme of events, the bn. pulled off a good share. Our Keystone band competed against that of the 53rd, we expected others, it was declared a draw. A. Coy gave a consert in the evening &amp; we played again.<br/>22.1.18 &ndash; Yesterday I went to Boulogne again, had a very interesting time. We visited old Boulogne &amp; looked through the cathedral, it is very fine, the interior is in two parts &amp; has a very fine dome. Round old Boulogne is the old retaining wall, which is about fifty feet high &amp; thirty broad.</p>
