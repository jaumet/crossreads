<p>Hdqrs.<br/>[Des-Nrd] Corps<br/>17.1.18</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I have received two letters from you in the last 10 days &ndash; one dated Sept &amp; one late in Octr. Very many thanks for both &amp; for cable forms you send. The Alexandria office have advised me that they will despatch them when received &amp; I have already sent one.</p>
<p>With the letters I also received a parcel from you of cigars &amp; butter scotch. I am more than grateful for them. It was awfully good of you &amp; in both instances of the contents you got me on the strongest of my likes. Incidental to being attached to a Corp's Hdqrs, one enjoys at present the luxury of living in a house, sleeping on a bed &amp; eating at a table. To be able to smoke a good cigar after dinner is the acme of luxury &amp; makes the war fade into nothing.</p>
<p>We are having a particularly easy time just at present &amp; life is good &ndash; we're living like kings. The country is looking beautiful &ndash; green everywhere with poppies, narcissi, lilies &amp; other colours of various hue, just coming into flow. I have never seen any such opportunities for artistic talent as this country &amp; these villages present.</p>
<p>We have the official photographer up here just now (Hurley) &ndash; he should do great things</p>
