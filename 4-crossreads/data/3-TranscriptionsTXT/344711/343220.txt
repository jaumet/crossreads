 3rd Left Colombo at 8 a.m.  There was a heavy swell on, and the ship rolled and pitched a good deal.  I soon got very sea-sick. 
 4th Still sea-sick.  Crossed the line late at night.  A flying-fish flew right through one of the port-holes into a ward.  He was only a small fish. 
 6th Been sea-sick ever since leaving Colombo.  Felt a bit better to-day. 
 9th Passed the Cocos Islands last night.  We were to be taken in close to have a look at the Emden but it was dark before we got to the islands. 
 11th Burial at sea of a patient who died last night, after an operation for removal of a shrapnel bullet from the brain.  He belonged to the 13th Battalion.  A guard, with fixed bayonets, was drawn up, and the bugle sounded the "Last Post" as the body was committed to the sea.
