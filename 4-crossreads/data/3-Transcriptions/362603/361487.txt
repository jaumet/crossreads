<p>4.  buttons on, we are either washing togs or on Duty.  People think we have tons of time to write but we have no wives or mothers to do our washing ironing &amp; mending   We must go out to the Theatre one night a week &amp; we always have one night on Duty &amp; Ellis &amp; I have 2 nights out of Camp so we are only 3 nights left to write &amp; 2 letters a night is quite a Task after office work nearly all day.<br/>Well, I must get at some work now.  We are always kept going at Top speed.  Best Love to You all &amp; to the Neighbours &amp; all enquiring Friends, Our Greetings<br/>Love Harry XXX"</p>
