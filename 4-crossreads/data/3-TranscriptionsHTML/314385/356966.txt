<p>A few words apropos the British Hospital trains, they are very beautifully &amp; comfortably fitted up &amp; carry about seven hundred patients when fully loaded. They are of the "Bogy" pattern &amp; connected for communication from one end of the train to the other, each carriage takes thirty six stretcher cases on provided bunks in 3 tiers lengthways each side of the carriage, the train is fitted up with a Kitchen, despensary &amp; all other confeniences &amp; is fitted throughout with eletric heaters &amp; fans &amp; alltogether are much superior to the French trains.</p>
