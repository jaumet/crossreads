Fri. Mar. 16. Party of 20 Bearers went out to Bernafay. Heard today the our troops had entered Bapaume. Hooray!

Sat. Mar. 17. Feeling very crook Our Concert came off tonight but I was too sick to appear. Things went off well, but Ted Jane got tied up in a knot & failed to get out. It was very interesting to hear the opinions of the patients, as none of them were at all aware that I was interested in "the Nightbirds"

Sun. 18. Spent a day in Hospital A chap named Stevens is in this ward. He used to be in the Manly Band, & he & I had some great yarns about Manly.

Monday 19. Good news from Bapaume. Our troops have the Town & several villages beyond & Fritz is still on the move. It seems strange not to hear the Guns banging away. They are too far away now to hear them firing. Went to see the Anzac Coves with Ted Grey & MacKinlay Very good show.
