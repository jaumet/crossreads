the right place but the Sergeant had not turned up as yet, however he came along a few minutes after
The work was carrying, sheet iron, timber, duckboards up to the front line trenches, for they are in a most disgraceful state it was the same at Fromelles (where we first went in when coming to France) Fleurbaix, but I can assure you they were in a different state when we left, they can say what they like but during my 2 years active service the trenches we occupy are better then any I have seen the British or Canadians with when we finish with them, it was the same on Gallopoli as the British officers themselves admitted
