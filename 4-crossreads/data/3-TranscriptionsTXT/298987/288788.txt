through dirty back lanes brought us to the rest camp. It is on top of a hill which carrying a pack seemed to be 10,ooo ft highThe Dr looked us over & we were alloted to tents - 11 in each - issued with 1 blanket - but we have 2 each Pioneers are good at that sort of thing & seldom go short. It is years since I have seen so much dust, have sandy ground all in & around the camp & being right on top of the hill is quite exposed to strong wind that is blowing Reminds me of the Darling River country in a dry time  A few showers crossing the Channel  otherwise good weather for moveing. This is up to Wed night 24/7/18
