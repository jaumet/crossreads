<p>France again<br/>4 December</p>
<p>My dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Fancy I got about three letters from you at once &amp; one from the dear old Boss &amp; I was so jolly pleased &amp; yet so homesick.  I still try &amp; not think about things too much but sometimes you can't help it.  I love to hear you say in my mind, "Don't be such a fool Wilkie, you <u>are</u> an idiot" like you did sometimes when I made one of my elephantine efforts to be humourous.  I certainly think you are changing but I'm hanged if I could explain the why &amp; how on paper.</p>
<p>You simply must not get too much of that that predestined air, "it was to be so what's the use of worrying" sort of mood.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're back in Tog &amp; settling down on a new book and I like the title although it does sound sensational.  I'm all agog to read it now.</p>
<p>I wonder if Lerida has been with you, she is a dear soul but I'm like you, sometimes feel that I love her a little less strenuous or if she must have these strenuous fits on that she'd have them away out of it.  Say up at the tool shed.</p>
<p>I simply love your letters Mrs. John they are so you.  Yes it is dull to be good till you've <strike>old</strike> ceased to be young then its much more comfortable.  Then you cuss anyone who stirs you up &amp; makes you wish to be anything else.  I don't think its any easier for a man but perhaps I'm wrong there.  I loved the photos of Graham, he does look</p>
