<p>Sunday 31 March 1918<br/>Still at Louvencourt.  Am afraid my field boots are just about done for thro' the wet.  More 555's from Rup wch. saved the cigarette situation once more.</p>
<p>Monday 1 April 1918<br/>Finished reading "The Definite Object", a good beginning but a mushy sentimental ending.  Still marking time at Louvencourt.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2 April 1918<br/>Winning quite a few francs at Bridge.  The war news shows nothg. startling &amp; all seems well.</p>
<p>Wednesday 3 April 1918<br/>Major Lucas came back from leave.  Did a sig. scheme in wiring.  Both Reid &amp; Monty came to lunch &amp; Reed was kicked by his horse.</p>
<p>Thursday 4 April 1918<br/>From here onwards I was parted from this diary as we moved down to Corbie &amp; into the Line after.</p>
<p>Friday 5 April 1918<br/>One night in Aubigny.  Got at some of my kit &amp; so regained my diary.  Things seem quiet down here tho' showing signs of the 5th Army Retreat.</p>
<p>Saturday 6 April 1918<br/>We take over from the Hussars who have been holding a large front with about one man and a dog!!  Many dead horses lying about.</p>
