  
 caught the tram out through Le Touquet Forest to Paris Plage - a seaside place about 5 kiloms. from Etaples.  There appears to be no fear of enemy aircraft at Paris Plage.  In the evening the numerous shops of all kinds were brilliantly lighted;  quite different from Etaples, Boulogne, Calais, St. Omer, Bailleul or other northern towns where all is inky black after nightfall;  the lighting restrictions & precautions being very much in evidence.  Paris Plage was a very popular tourist resort before the war - now khaki is the prevailing colour in this attractive little place.  Numerous Belgian refugees have established themselves here.  We walked the 10 kiloms. back from Etaples to Corment along a road slippery as glass with frozen snow;  we all had several falls on the homeward journey.
