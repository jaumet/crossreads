21/1/19 Gourdinne
A fine frosty day with a mild sun and roads as hard as iron ? quite a spring day. With 40 of the men set off for Nalinnes and there heard a lecture by General McNicoll on demobilization and Repatriation. Afterwards walked briskly back with Davis in time for lunch. We are now going to get on to our Repatriation Precedence Rolls and mine is the thankless job of picking who goes home and when. The walk to and from Nalinnes was about 10 kilos and feeling need of a rest I put in the afternoon by a hot stove reading and writing. Pat Gorman and others went to Bouvree to some Races which are being held. Last night under influence of some point blank wine sundry gentlemen were going round looking for blood other ?b's.
