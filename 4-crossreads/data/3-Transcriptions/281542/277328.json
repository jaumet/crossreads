<p>myself to imagine how one could live in such strange solitude.  Yet the lighthouse keeper lives there &amp; what a hermit's life it must be.  No companionship nor life, nor sign of it except the passing of a steamer in the distance.</p>

<p>A beautiful day &ndash; cool breeze.  Expect all these to be posted on arrival at Suez.  None of previous letters dropped at Aden.  Will all go in one bunch at Suez.</p>

<p>Cooler weather.  Pleasant head wind.  Evening saw us in sight of African coast &amp; Sinai on the east.  How peculiarly awe-inspiring are these glimpses of historic landmarks.  The aspect of the country is volcanic &amp; its rugged bareness &amp; dull brown color vividly contrasts with the bright blue sea &amp; dashing foam.  Sinai, for instance, commencing low down rises in irregular slopes till its summit reaches to the very heavens &amp; then gradually fades away to the sea again in the same fashion as it rises.  What food for thought &amp; quiet muse for the dreamer.  As I gazed I recalled the incidents of this land of the Bible &amp; I could not realise that before me was that Sinai where the Ten Commandments were given to this world by the Maker of All.</p>

<p>Arrived at Port Suez 9 o'clock.  What a picturesque change &amp; what magnetic charm has this first glimpse of this new life to me.  The rippling impact of the port gleams with opalescent beauty &amp; the yellow sand dunes contrast vividly with the changing hues of the heated atmosphere.  A weird &amp; bizarre mountain lies</p>
