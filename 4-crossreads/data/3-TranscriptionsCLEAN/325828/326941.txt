 My dear Anna, Excuse this short scribble but I am just sending it along with a couple of nose-rags that I thought you might like. I wonder if you got my last letter that I sent you from Serapeum.  I have been kept pretty busy since then but I haven't forgotten you, & I often wonder how you are getting on.  I was very glad to hear from Father that you are getting on so well at School & I hope you will get through your Exams in November alright. Thank you so much dear for your letters to me.  I have received them all, at least I have had 4 altogether & I was so glad to get them.  You have no idea how welcome letters from Home or Australia, are out in these parts. Accept the enclosed, dear, with much love, Your loving brother, Leo.
