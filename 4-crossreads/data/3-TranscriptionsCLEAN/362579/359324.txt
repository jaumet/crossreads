  
 to see us so had afternoon tea   &  then a game of Tennis before dinner 7 p.m. They (two Officers) stayed for dinner so afterwards went to court again   &  played until nearly 9 p.m. (got too dark to play longer). The days are very long now. One of our Medical Officers went to Amiens   &  bought we a basket of strawberries, so I had to sneak away from the crowd   &  stawk them. We (three sisters   &  3 officers) went to my old ward (Officers)   &  had Supper in Pantry - Strawberries   &  cream   &  coffee. Got to bed
