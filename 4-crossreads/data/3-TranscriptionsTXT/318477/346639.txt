 As we arrived in at wharf there were a couple of Hundred people to greet us.  Whilst the west boys were going off we were presented with cigarettes, matches, cakes &amp; chocolate.  In the evening we had a fine concert down our troop deck given by ladies of Fremantle.  We moved out of port at 9.30 tonight, next stop Melbourne where we alight I think &amp; thence rail to Sydney.  My opinion of our west reception was verry quiet indeed, I hardly heard a cheer uttered.  I suppose that is due to so many troop ships being in before us that the people are getting tired of it.  Some of the lads got ashore although there was an armed guard patrolling the wharf.  Needless to say that there was some booze smuggled aboard, pretty well all night we were putting them to bed. 
 24-2-16 We are just about to enter the Great Australian Bight.  The wind has reached about sixty miles an hour.  In reference to our arrival at W.A., I think it was one of the sights of the world to see the beautiful long beaches pure white sand and the evening sun just setting, just like our own dear shores.  One soon knows when he is near the native Land.  I could not help but take notice of the pure white frocks of the Colonials as compared with the English mufferlers &amp; top Coats, it being winter in England.
