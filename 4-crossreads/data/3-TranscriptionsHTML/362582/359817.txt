<p>&amp; Matron were all invited. It was an awfully good show, they also gave us lemonade &amp; biscuits, at the Interval. The patients were invited too (the Conv. one). So Mr Wylde came with me. Sister Bell is on night-duty so missed the convert. We did not get back until nearly mid-night (11.45 p.m.) shocking, wasn't it? Matron gave me permission &amp; also stayed herself. We are giving an "Evening" to a Sister who has had the honor of The Royal Red Cross, conferred on her. She belongs to our Unit &ndash; only been one month with us. She came out with the first "Kyarra" &amp; has nursed a lot in Imperial Hospitals. Have got the loan of a piano, it came yesterday, so you can imagine the joy it cause amongst the musical ones. All the medical officers are invited too, so we hope to have a jolly night. Unfortunately I have not got a <u>man</u></p>
