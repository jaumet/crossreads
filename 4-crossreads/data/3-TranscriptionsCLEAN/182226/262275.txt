Friday 10 September, 1915
Named our dugout. It has the distinction of being the first place on "Courtneys" to have a name. It's monica is "Kangarooma"
Two men of the 8th collected last night. It was their last watch before going away for a rest, a case of "stiff knees".
Have been doing a bit of cooking today. I got hold of a tin of milk. Breakfast, bread & milk, Dinner, boiled rice & tea rissoles. Quite an elaborate diet for here.
A bomb burst just outside our gun pit last night & a piece came through the opening passing between myself & the chap who was on with me. You don't seem to be safe here anywhere lately.
