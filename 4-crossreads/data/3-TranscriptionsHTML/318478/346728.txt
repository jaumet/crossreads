<p>with the skull of a lady that I had loved.  I am writing Dorothy (Ussher) on the grave subject when I have the sketch prepared or ready and I think I can trust her to use her discretion as to whether she sends on my letter &amp; sketch or not.  <u>The point is that my official duties took me past the cemetery and I managed to take half an hour off to visit</u> <strike>the cemetry</strike> the grave of a friend.  Just that and nothing more.</p>
<p>We embark on a French boat for Constant. tomorrow at 10.30 and I cannot tell you how pleased I am at getting clear of this graveyard beautiful as it is nor can I explain how satisfied I am to have done what work I have done.</p>
<p>My side is alright at present and the question is how are you and the boys?  I shall hear soon.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert<br/>Capt. A.I.F., War Records Section<br/>C/o A.I.F. H.Q. Cairo</p>
