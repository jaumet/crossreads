From Sir [indecipherable]
My dear Ferguson,We have been enquiring amongst the family more than once as to the health and prospects of Keith. I have not heard anything of him since the news reached us of his safe arrival in Sydney, and I trust by now he has completely recovered and that you found some substantial reason for retaining him at home for the future.
I am specially prompted to write to you since meeting a young fellow Goodsall at War Aims Meeting some time ago, who desired to be remembered to you. He told me that he was under your boy Arthur, and you will be glad to hear that he spoke in the most appreciative and affectionate terms of him. He himself has now been discharged and is acting as caretaker at one of the local Institutions in Gravesend.
We fraternised in a somewhat strange manner. I had gone done by train to address a Meeting urging general economy and contributions to the War Loan; but on the way down the alarm of an air raid was given and I reached the Station with everything in darkness and was received by a barrage of anti aircraft guns letting off at some Hun planes that were travelling overhead to London. Needless to say, there was no Meeting, and whilst waiting at the Hall under cover this young fellow made himself known.
This night was the last occasion when a raid reached London itself. During the moon last month a number of attempts were made, but the outer defences turned them back. I expect, however, there will be a lively time when the Spring comes, when the air gets clearer.
On the other hand our defences are very much improved and it is remarkable how these anti aircraft guns seem to keep these machines away from the heart of London. After all, although the defences have very much improved, the guns are not very close together and they fire more or less at a venture, and one would think
Mr. Justice Ferguson,Judges Chambers, Supreme Court,Sydney.
