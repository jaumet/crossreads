<p>1st June (Thursday)<br/>Route march with packs up through Nefische. Kit bags emptied. In the universal bag we are only to carry the Australian cloth uniform. This will be put on in place of the Egyptian uniform just before we reach France. "Tommies" who have recently arrived in Egypt paid our tent a visit tonight and we got them 4 bags of socks. They gave us the full strength of the Zep. raids over London. Various</p>
