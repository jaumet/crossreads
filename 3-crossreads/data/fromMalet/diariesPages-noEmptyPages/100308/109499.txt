3/5/17  L?Homme Mort
Round to the 186th several times for news but beyond finding out that plane had seen some of our men in the Factory and some burning flares to the left of it.
1 pm There is no doubt as to the result of this morning's attack on a front of 14 Divisions. The Boche has bloodily repulsed it and our troops are as they were back in their old lines. The losses are extremely heavy 80% in some regts. The Division on the left of this 62nd has failed too and only the Anzacs have done their allotted task. Poor lads they must die in scores for they cannot hold on where they are as the Tommies have left their flank right up in the air. The failure would appear to lie in underestimating the strength required to take the place and sending over battns. about 300 strong. ? all due to not striking detached men right off fighting strength. Red tape? ? blood red!!. The 22nd Brigade relieves this one tonight and will have another go at Bullecourt
