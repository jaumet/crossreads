<p>3 4 5th Dec  We are in the trenches.  The march down we passed rows of houses with <br/>the contents turned upside down evidently the work of Germans, who according to all <br/>accounts did a lot of pillaging.<br/>Some of the houses look as if the rats had been at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>We are supplied with Gumboots and whale oil to rub our feet with to prevent trench feet.    <br/>We, the stretcher bearers are told off 4 to each company and are allotted 2 dugouts in <br/>which we can stay until the call for SB's comes.  We are right up in the front line <br/>immediately</p>
