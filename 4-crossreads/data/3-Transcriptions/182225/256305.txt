<p>Fine &amp; warm. I went on mess orderly again today &amp; then I am finished for the trip. We sighted a derelict this morning and the Swiftsure went over and sank it. It was a little sailing ketch. Had the semi finals of the boxing in the afternoons. Wrote a few letters afternoon. Billy Hunter feeling a lot better.</p>
