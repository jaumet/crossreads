<p>11th to 18th [Oct]<br/>The week at the rest camp stands out as the best I have had since coming to Egypt.  Breakfast was usually the only meal we had in the camp  My favourite place of dining was the Hotel Bonnard  It was very quiet only a few civilians &amp; officers being there &amp; they were very friendly.  There was a nice drawing room &amp; we had some good music as Geo Berrie was very good on the piano &amp; could play almost anything.  We went to see "Pops" also some selections from Italian opera which were very good.  We had a box on each occasion.  Also visited the "Kersaal" &amp; the Casino but both these shows were common &amp; vulgar, some after the cheap music Hall style.  On the Sunday we drove out to the Youzah gardens &amp; they are very</p>
