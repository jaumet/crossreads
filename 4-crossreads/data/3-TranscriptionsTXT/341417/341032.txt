Dear MotherJust the usual to let you know that I am quite well hoping all at home are the same. There is nothing here to write about only that it is hotter than Australia & the flies are a lot worse. We had a bit of a thunderstorm here last night but I didnt get very wet. I have had 2 or 3 letters from England lately and all are O.K over there. Things are very quite here now I hear that things are at a standstill over in the old town our hundreds are enlisting well it will do some of them good to come and live here in the ground like a mole for a while. Tell me when you write what Eddie Kearns & the "Bagnalls" are leaving for the Front with. Well I will close with love to all at homeFrom your loving SonWill.
