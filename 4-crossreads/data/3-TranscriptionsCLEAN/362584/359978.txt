we are camped together.
We had snow here last week, & up on the hills it was as much as two feet deep. I have never seen anything prettier than snow in a thick wood, when all the branches are bowed down with the weight of it. I can quite see now, that these are some compensations for living in a blighted land.
I think I told you in a previous letter that I called on the Sly's & Miss Sly took me round to Mrs Edwards. Since then, Mrs Edwards has asked me round to see her. She was a great friend of Evan Richards, & thought the world of him.
This letter ought just to reach you in time to miss New Year, but for all that I will wish you a tardy bright & happy one, & a merry Christmas.
I am writing to father & Dorothy so will give all the love in this letter to you.
Your loving son
Keith
