L?Homme Mort 
2 am Awakened, and had some breakfast with the staff here. Everything very quiet and reports came back that the troops had commenced going out on the tapes. This was evidently carried out without
3 am much trouble as no m.g. fire could be heard at all and both our guns theirs were nearly quite silent. Few flares
3.40 All still quiet. Another tank passed on its way up. Everyone outside waiting
3.45 am ZERO Like one the guns lashed out and two Armies hopped over. Within a couple of minutes the guns had reached a high pitch of violence and their bursting shells showed up like big stars only a few yards apart. The noise was great but no more intense than some trench raids ? a large operation like this sounds louder the further you are back from it
3.50 The Hun's barrage seemed to shut down on front line ? no shells back here. The flashes became less distinct as the fumes and smoke filled the air. This calls for artillery his usual flares did
