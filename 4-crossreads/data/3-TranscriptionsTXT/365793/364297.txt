Jly 16 A fellow cant work & then listen to a Parson. Between the hours of 8 & 11 pm this hut is the funniest I know. - an endless stream of wit & humour, & roars of laughter.  Somewhere about midnight a lonely cat curled up on my bed & I got the shock of my life. Gave a devil of a heave; that cat hit the floor rather suddenly & the old Doc' next door nearly fell out of bed with fright, and then a 'Lost-horseman' heaved puss out the back door & all was peace and quietness again (JC. JB.
