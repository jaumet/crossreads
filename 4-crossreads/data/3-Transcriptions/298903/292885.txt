<p>went over the hot houses making acquaintance with Australian gums again by rubbing the leaves on our hands.  Walked by way of the tow path along the Thames to Richmond where we had tea and returned to Earls Court.  Returned straight to hotel &amp; turned in early as was feeling bad with my cold. Influenza is raging everywhere so may be in for it.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th Feb.  Made arrangements to have some dancing lessons as I wanted to learn the latest one step, foxtrot, 3 step etc. before returning to Australia.  Had my first lesson at 12 midday returning at 5 p.m. to watch another class which however did not eventuate. Turned down an invitation to an evening as did not feel up to it.  On way home decided to see "Twelfth Night" or What You Will at the Royal Covent Garden theatre so got out at Sloane Square &amp; had dinner.  Enjoyed the comedy very much indeed &amp; would like to see it again.</p>
