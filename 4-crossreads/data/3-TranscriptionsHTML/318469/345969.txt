<p>14-11-15<br/>Been working on revetting steps in Communication trench.  Q.5. Our Batteries shelled enemy's position on extreme right this afternoon.  Feeble reply from Turks.  Nothing else of importance</p>
<p>15th<br/>Very violent wind with a little rain in the late evening which made things a little uncomfortable.  Very rough sea running which will greatly hamper the unloading of goods from boats.  [indecipherable] lively Artillery fire chiefly by our Batteries. Very heavy bombardment by boats on slopes Achi Baba.</p>
<p>16th<br/>Wind vey violent last night but quite calm today almost all trace of yesterdays boisterous weather disappeared.  A fair amount of firing by our guns.  Turks replying but not too energetically.  Working today on timbering tunnel.  Q7.  Nothing of importance reported.</p>
<p>17th<br/>Working today timber underground cover for Infantry behind firing line.  The day opened nice &amp; fine but toward evening the wind rose rapidly &amp; by dusk was raging a gale. A very rough sea running lashing high up on the Beach.  All the boats have cleared away on account of the rough weather.  Nothing out of ordinary reported.

<p>19th<br/>Beautiful fine day, boats able to unload comfortably.  Enemy's guns very active shelling all along beaches.  Also sent a lot of heavy Howitzers across.  One shell fell into an A.M.C.
