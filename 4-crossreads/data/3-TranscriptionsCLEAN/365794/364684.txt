  
 Monday 8 October 1917 Lovely breeze and quiet uneventful day.  All prizes distributed 8 p.m. in saloon.  Capt. gave 1-0-0, sisters 2/- each.  Amt. 3-14-0 devided into prizes, 1st 7/6, 2nd 4/6, 3rd 2/6. Padre won Noah's Ark competition. Sleeping on deck very beautiful.  Capt. presented me with crib board inscribed "Johnnie Walker 1820", very good of him. Sister Henry gave last verse of Absent (opp. page). Sang "For he's a jolly good fellow" & Capt. made very nice little speech wishing every good luck for the Padre in his future.  Padre's response poor.  Goodbye Mesopotamia.
