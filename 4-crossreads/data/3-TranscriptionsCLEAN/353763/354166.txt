Oct 4 - 1914All is well  -  I'm sending 3 serial letters by a friend who goes on the Berrima to Sydney  -  I trust you'll get them all right  -  They are fairly accurate of course they are for you - not for general circulation  -  Weather - fine & dry  -  We are not going to be Stationary & you may not hear again for a bit  -  Its Sunday & we've had no leave this week at all  -
