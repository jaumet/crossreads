 Examinations this morning - This School would cost me a lot of money in Peace time & I appreciate my luck in attending. If I could afford it I would keep up soldering after the War in Australia but am afraid I will have my daily bread to earn as usual. 
 Went Cairo Dinner & to CASINO etc. 
 Laura tells me Nowell Forth is on his way here again. 
 Am giving Pearse of PASTORALISTS REVIEW some photos to take to Australia, he will send you the Paper when printed.
