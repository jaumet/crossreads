<p>1917<br/>Dec 16<br/>day. Sunday, the next day, we had morning service, which was most uncomfortable as we were standing up to our ankles in cold mud. The padre luckily was about as uncomfortable as we were and cut out his sermon. After Tom McCann Bill Collins and I got a lot of the Port Napier boys together and went for a walk. Kemmel had been knocked about a good deal by shellfire with the exception of the chateau. This place I heard, was owned by a person with German sympathies. On leaving Kemmel we walked to Locre and got something to eat there. as it was getting dark we then returned to camp.<br/>Monday morning 17th December we put our packs again and marched to a railway siding near Daylight Corner, where, after having a meal provided by our cookers we entrained for Desvres. We had a ten hours journey in front of us and as we weer in cattle trucks, it was fairly cold. This, however, did not make us at all unhappy, as every minute took us further away</p>
