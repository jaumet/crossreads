<p>Well, Mum Dear, I wrote to you on Wednesday &amp; except for receiving 8 letters from Australia (3 from Home) nothing has happened at all.  Oh! I played Cricket against a Tommy team yesterday.  We won by 26 runs of which total, mine quota was 9.</p>
<p>Best Love to you all at Home.  Kindest Regards to Mrs. Stephen, Bunting, Doyle, Parkes &amp; Mrs. Keirle also to my other Manly Friends.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>From Harry</p>
