<p>When Millard &amp; I were coming along the shore this afternoon, between 4-30 &amp; 5 O'Clock, Beachy Bill fired from the Olive Grove, the shell exploded alongside of us &amp; dropped into the water.

<p>Good bye my dears. This letter maybe is too long. If so take it in pieces. God bless each of you.</p>

<p>To each of you heaps of love &amp; loads of kisses from<br/>Your loving &amp; affectionate Father<br/>John B Nash</p>
