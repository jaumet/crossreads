 Dear Mother and Father I am now going to try and answer a few things in your letters which I have noted down. I always like to get the little cuttings in your letters. I particularly like the ones about the medical students; the firemen rescuing Tibbles and the man whose bandages had slipped. 
 I received the copies of Col. And Mrs Cuncliffe's letters. They are charming people and those were the sort of letters I would expect from them. I have received two tins of Watson B lately. It is strange but that seems to be the one thing which does not reach me. I got a letter from Doone and wrote to him in reply. I received a letter from Bowman about the spring cart and the pigs. It was lovely and typical of dear Kenneth. I again wrote to Savigny describing my trip to Oxford. No letter from him yet. I received Balaclava from Gertrude's daughter, Have not yet written to her. Am glad Verlie is fixed up and that Mr Ohleson  is looking fit. Phyllis is in excellent health and getting a furry coat again. She always noses round my pockets for sugar now and is rather a nuisance. Glad to hear Twinnie has been doing her duty to her king and country again. She also seems to be a source of revenue to her boss. I received kneecaps and mittens from Clarke. Shall write to him later. Am sending a couple of stars along &ndash; to-morrow. thats about all the notes 
 .m in a delightfully comfy little hut in a good camp for a few days. Am very busy with Court Martials. Am quite fit. Best love Your affec. Son C.R.Lucas
