<p>12th Feb Monday<br/>In morning had to go past Doctor, get very poor examination here. If you say are not feeling well they do not examine you just mark you. Dating in evening, shifted over to No 4 camp, not bad tucker over here, better than nothing, gave pay book in, giving out new pay books.</p>
<p>13th Feb Tuesday<br/>My birthday, fine day but cold, went and see another doctor, marked me fit would not give you any say in the matter, had a very light morning of it, poor dinner, went over to YM after dinner.</p>
<p>14th February Wed<br/>In morning went out on drill, this is one of the worst camps that I have been in, absolutely no management. I went and had guard drill from 3 &ndash; 4 pm and then went back to huts for a starvation tea. This camp is supposed to be a training camp like the Bull Ring at Etaples but its nearly all guards and piquets.</p>
