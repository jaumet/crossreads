May 23 the boundary wall so I perched on top of one & got a good view of the Street opposite. Nothing much doing though - a couple of veterans levelling the grass, a milk cart or two, & sundry John Hops & civvys. Dinky weather though.Women carriage cleaners get 2/8 a day the same as those in Hosp, Gangers 4/8, Telegraph Messengers 7/- a week with 1/- rise every year, the latter have pretty good uniforms & black caps.Accidentally burnt Auntys address so had to wire to Uncle Jim for it in order to post a couple of Hospital passes. Just yarned to a couple of girls over the wall & made an appt' for tomorrow afternoon. Oh wretched soldiers! Am afraid though I'm out of it as Uncle will no doubt be coming tm'w.Good Concert tonight - in the Rec Room. The specialist (a Qld'er) said I could have a glass eye so expect I wont be here long.
