<p>Selborne Chambers, 174 Phillip Street, Sydney. 4th June 1965<br/>The Honourable Mr Justice K.A. Ferguson, 4 Drumalbyn Road, Bellevue Hill.<br/>Dear Judge, Although I am very junior at the Bar and have only appeared before you on two occasions &ndash; both Chamber matters &ndash; I should like to let you know how much the Bar appreciated and liked you as a Judge. In common with the rest of the Bar, I am very sorry to see you relinquish office and wish you every good luck in retirement. Your sincerely, Roderick Meagher</p>
