My dear Mother
New Years day! So here goes for another letter home. I wrote a short note on Xmas day from Luxor, and now that I am back again at the Club in Cairo I'll write you an account of our trip, which was such a great success, and quite the most enjoyable sigh seeing stunt I have ever been on. We left Cairo at 8 o'clock on Christmas Eve and arrived at Luxor about 9 o'clock next morning. The train was fairly crowded for a start; a lot of well dressed Egyptians seemed to be traveling home for Xmas, and they nearly all carried childrens toys with them, so I think they must have been Omdahs of Coptic villages, along the line - anyhow they nearly all got out before midnight so we had the carriage to ourselves for the rest of the journey.
