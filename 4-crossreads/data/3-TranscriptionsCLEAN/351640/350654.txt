  
 Nous verrons! [We shall see] 
 The luncheon hour has come.  For the present good bye.  [Diagrams of Xs and Os.]  Good bye.  Good bye.  Good bye. May good digestion wait upon my appetite.  No desire for food is mine, probably because I have been consuming Tobler chocolate at intervals while writing to you.  Away. 
 8.45 p.m.  Not having been outside during the day I took a ramble after dinner, and have just returned.  Visited the tram terminus, the billiard room, looked at the sky noted some of the constellations and thought of you.  Years agone your Mother told me of the evenings she spent in the grounds at Maitland, mostly in the summer time, being taught by M. M. Theresa, of happy Memory, the forms and names of the constellations to be seen in the sky above the Southern Hemisphere.  Orion.  Taurus.  Alpha [dotted outline of an A] in the head of the Taurus.  The pleiades.  The pointers.  The Southern Cross.  Scorpio.  Triangulus.  The dog star. Musca.  And others.  Not to mention the planets which in brilliant guise twinkled not.  Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, & 10 are tonight shining brilliantly in the sky to the South of Egypt, the sight of them brought before me the remembering tablets of my mind whereon is imprint of the school grounds at Maitland, of the girls who were there in those days, of you, of Sydney, of Macquarie Street, and of how if you were to look out of your bedroom window & the sky were clear you could see in the sky close to the horizon nearly all of these constellations.  It is with you about 5 a.m. on 20.3-15.  When my eyes were turned to the North.  The moon is early in its first quarter, therefore not diffusing much light midst the Stars.  They saw brilliant constellations which it has never been yours to view.  Chiefest amongst them the great bear (ursa major) in shape like a cooking utensil with a long handle sic [diagram of part of the constellation Ursa Major], and its lesser brother ursa minor of like shape but turned in other direction.
