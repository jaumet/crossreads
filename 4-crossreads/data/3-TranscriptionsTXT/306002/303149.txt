We get our water supply from shallow wells dug in the bottom of the valley &amp; as we can get only enough for drinking purposes we have to put up with a drovers wash once a day &amp; a good many don't even get that.  We went on duty at 12 oclock &amp; were no sooner settled than shrapnel fell on our trenches here, three shells burst over us &amp; we were covered with leaves &amp; boughs from the bush overhead.  Langford was hit through the neck &amp; wounded pretty bad &amp; Chivers had his face cut, both have gone to hospital.  A sniper killed an Engineer officer at 4 oclock, Gen. Bridges was hit in the hip a day or so ago &amp; is pretty bad on it.
