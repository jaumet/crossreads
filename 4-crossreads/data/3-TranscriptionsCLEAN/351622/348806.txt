  
 Finished the day with [indecipherable] the half back for S. Sydney League & a bottle of champagne. 
 4 April 1916 Tues Very late on arising just having time for a mouthful of tea & off with 5th Brig H.Q. to Thiennes to draw rations. There I met Cecil Alwarth who acted as good samaritan by giving me nine packets of smokes. Saw Jim on my way out who was bound for a gas demonstration. 
 [Note in margin] Visited the brewery 
 5 April 1916 Wed Did the cooking again to-day. Jim & Dick have orders to go & join up with their H.Q. & at 4 pm we opened a couple of bottles of vin bidding them farewell. A big sing song in the White Horse estaminet to night. All merry when the doors close at 8 oclock. Such times as these I did not think were in store.
