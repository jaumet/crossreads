started for the camp which we reached soon after midnight; our horses had not had a drink from when we started out in the early morning till we got back to the wadi below Zerka that night and they had not had a feed all day either. it was rather funny next day: we were all rather short of fire wood, but we soon got over the dificulty by borrowing a pick and going to the nearest damaged motor lorrie and knocking a side off it. During the breakfast there we quite big arguments as to which make of car supplied the best fire wood, I forget which brand won. Jee whiz this letter is getting quite a book, so I think I'll stop and start another one about my trip down here. As I write big train loads of turkish prisoners are going past. It has been a wonderful success, has it not. Love to Father and the boys & yourself Mother. I am
