<p>December  1918.<br/>Monday 9</p>
<p>Wembley and Birmingham<br/>Weather wet. Ran up to Brum early morning train. Came back and received a pair of wires, one granting extension the other from Roy, another example of silly sarcasm.<br/>Had a letter from P.G. written from B-  I'm very sorry to receive the news . Spent a few happy hours with O. during the evening. Ran down to Harrow for an hour or so bought some presents for Roy's wife.</p>
