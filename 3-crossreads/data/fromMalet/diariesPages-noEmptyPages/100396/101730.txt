the limerock was brought from hills overlooking Cairo. the pyramids are built on a natural limestone foundation. there are also innumerable tombs around them some of which have been excavated. looking from the top they look like a city of the dead. from the top is a lovely view, of the greenest land you could ever wish to see and to the west starting right alongside clove a foot high the great desert. which run as you know right to the Atlantic. 
When you come out of the pyramid you are met by a man with a water bottle, whose great aim in life is that of all the others to make you happy. he wants to wash away the dirt from your hands, if you let him he also wants a piastre. which of course you don't pay. then you come to your boots, they are safe enough, but you are kindly requested to pay another piastre. these natives must pick up a bit of coin here in the winter
