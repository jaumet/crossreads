<p>Residents, Silver Bream &amp; Eels are the Fish. I intend next week taking a line &amp; trying my luck. Traffic along the line here is very busy Every Day Sundays &amp; all the Trains are passing as fast as they can some going up to the Fireing line &amp; some the other way. As soon as one clears the Section (short distant one at that) another Train is ready to leave this goes on day &amp; night. The Engines are all of a splendid Type. Belgian French &amp; English.  As this Depot is the distributing Centre we are only here temporary until our Depot is ready to receive us. No body knows where it is. There is no Horse Traction done here all Powerful Motor Waggons. Only the Residents' have horses &amp; some have Donkeys very small, it is fun to see a big French Women driving a small Donkey in a cart, we tell them to get out &amp; push. The other evening a little Donkey in a Cart was tied up to an Iron Gate across the Footpath (3 ft wide) &amp; some Tommies coming</p>
