<p>31st January 1918. The Rest Station which our Unit has taken over is very comfortable,  contains a dining hall, concert hall &amp; hot baths, so this place will certainly do me for duration. We are billetted in a convent, so naturally our quarters are fairly comfortable. Heard that in Australian Pierrott Troops was showing not far away so of course paid a visit in the evening. The concert was a splendid one,  I enjoyed it so much that I attended four shows this last week. George Castles (amy Castles brother) is one of the Artists,  he possesses a rich tenor voice,  his rendering of such songs as ----Absent, Mary &amp; "I hear you calling me" were perfect. Julius Knight's under-study is also a member of the troupe.</p>
<p>Lately I have been for quite a number of long walks &amp; its not a bad time to pass the time away either.</p>
<p>On the 5th February I attended a concert given by New Zealanders, &amp; a jolly fine show it was too. On the way to the concert I came across Toby Young &amp; McVeigh, both old school mates of mine. We had a good old yarn &amp; we were very much surprised a t meeting each other.   On the 6th inst. 7 of us, had a little dinner prepared in one of the rooms of the convent to celebrate the occasion of Bilgie May's distinction. As you know, he has been awarded the Belgium Croix de Guerre.</p>
