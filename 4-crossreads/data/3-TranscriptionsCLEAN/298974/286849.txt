But we guessed the wily dog was up to some of his tricks, & so when one morning, there were no huns to be seen in the trenches which the eve before held many, we knew something of importance had occurred. The advance then began, & for a while Fritz gave no trouble, being concerned only in his retreat. The rest you have heard in the papers. 
 We are, as I have said, out for a rest. I think our Div. can safely say we have carried it. We are in billets & very nice it is to have walls & roof around us again.
