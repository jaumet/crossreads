<p>enough for us. Afternoon tea, cigars, cigarettes, ices &amp;  soft drinks were provided. After some games &amp; music by the ladies a very enjoyable    &amp;  interesting day closed with a motor drive back to hospital  The party were mostly of wounded but we were all treated alike</p>
<p>25th Nov:-<br/>Cold day &amp; very windy. Becoming rather monotonous in hospital &amp; I shall be glad to get out.</p>
<p>26th Nov:-<br/>Expect to leave hospital to-day as nothing can be done for shoulder. Capt Knight is to speak to the O.C. &amp;  I am to go on light duty</p>
