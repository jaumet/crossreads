<p>A Barge comes in from the Canal &amp; is put into one Basin &amp; the Doors are shut &amp; up the Basin &amp; Barge goes until it reaches the top where the gates are open &amp; the barge enters one of the Bridge portions &amp; proceeds along a canal passing through a Lock Gate &amp; then continues on, when another Barge arrives it is put into the other basin &amp; up it goes &amp; the first one comes down &amp; so on.   These basins are for Large Barges &amp; the Lower Locks are for the small ones which pass under the Railway Line &amp; up against the first lock, when the water then is released by the Gates opening &amp; when the water is level with the canal the Gates behind the Barge is closed &amp; the water coming over the other locks fills up the space &amp; the barge rises to the hight of the next Lock when the Gates are opened &amp; in goes the barge into No 2 Lock.   This is done repeatedly until eventually the Barge reaches to the Hight of the Higher Canal &amp; then continues on its journey, passing through about 6 locks.   After satisfying our curiousty, &amp; the stop signal was pulled off I went into the station yard at Arques &amp; was kept there until 10.30 am when a French Shunter came on the engine &amp; off we went to Wardresque, returning on the other line to about half way when I was put into the Observation Balloon Repair Siding &amp; there met a R.E. Corporal who took charge of the engine, &amp; after shunting some trucks out, I went along the the 277th Coy who were building a line, with a Track</p>
