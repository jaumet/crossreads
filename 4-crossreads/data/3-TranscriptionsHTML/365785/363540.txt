<p>Dear Mrs. Read,<br/>Many thanks for your Xmas wishes which I recd. this week.  I have just returned from a 23 days trip to Anzac with Surgeon Genl. House spending 12 days there &amp; leaving on the last evening of the evacuation.  It was a terrible sad sight seeing the evacuation after one has seen the work the troops have put in, the excessive casualties there and the millions of pounds sunk in that campaign, it made one feel that one would sooner be killed &amp; stay behind with the other "Boys" buried there than go off alive &amp; partake in the disgrace of the British Bull Dog, sneaking off beaten by the Turk.  I used to believe in that old British Bull Dog business but after my visit to Anzac I have lost all respect for our Political &amp; military leaders with the exception of Lord Kitchener.  Asquith seems to be as big a muddler as Chamberlain was.  One thing I learnt while I was away &amp; that was only for the old "British Navy" there would be no such thing as a British Empire left, have seen it in action &amp; can realize what we owe to it, our complete distance [?].<br/>The "Old Man" is still having just as rough a time as ever.<br/>Kindest regards to you &amp; the Major and to the two girls,<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>Charles.</p>
