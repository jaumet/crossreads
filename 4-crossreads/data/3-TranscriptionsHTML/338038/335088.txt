<p>V<br/>for ourselves. One must have some covering at night here on account of the heavy dews.<br/>I am going to do the Sakkara trip again tomorrow. Am taking all the NCOs out to have a look round.<br/>There is no more news just at present. If I should think of anything before mail closes on Monday night, I will add a line.<br/>Meantime with fondest love to yourselves &amp; Pat<br/>I remain,<br/>Your affectate Son<br/>Terence</p>
