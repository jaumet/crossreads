<p>Testament  Mother gave me before I sailed the first time in 1914 &amp; which I've carried ever since. I always read a bit on Sundays. A 10.30 p.m. we set off again on the eternal digging fatigue, halted for a while for orders, &amp; he sent over some more gas, &amp; we had to put on our respirators. It didn't last long fortunately; it is very awkward with your mouth over the mouthpiece breathing that way, &amp; to make things worse mine was clogged somehow temporarily, &amp; I nearly choked, no air seemed to be coming through for a while, &amp; I was glad when the officer said "All clear", &amp; we could take them off. We dug at a new trench till 2 a.m., I had a devil of a head ache &amp; was glad to get back to our good old dugout. Once an aeroplane overhead dropped a magnificent flare, one mass of red spangles, we stood stock still, &amp; Fritz sent out a salvo near it but no one was hit. Monday 3 June I went to sleep at 2.30 a.m. when we got in; was awakened when breakfast came up at 3.15. Fritz was shelling a bit, &amp; the driver hurried away with the limber. Had our tea, &amp; once again, the brute sent over the gas shells, the driver came back just as the shells were falling round; poor beggar has a rough spin the last few mornings, as he can't dive into a dugout &amp; leave the limber &amp; mules. He yelled out "Are the empty dixies ready?" &amp; a chap said "That's gas, boy". He dug his spurs into the mule he was riding, wheeled them round, &amp; away</p>
