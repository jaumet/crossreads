Sunday 15 [14] April 1917 [1918]No trace of Sunday breaks this prison time save that during the long lonely afternoon I indulge in old hymns, some not sung since childhood's days of long ago.  Evidently the Padre (C of E) has no time for a sick sister within his gates.  Matron does not visit me either & I miss her sweet quiet talk.A menu for the day -Breakfast 7.15 a.m.  Porridge, tea, 2 hard poached eggs of doubtful age, 1 strip rancid bacon, 3 slices brown B & B.Lunch 12.15 p.m.  Mince, boiled onions, mashed potatoes.Rice with curdled milk & no sugar.Dinner, 6 p.m., rather greasy soup, piece fried fish, mince & veg. same as lunch with addition of crowds of pepper making my throat burn.Boiled pudding hard & cold!!
