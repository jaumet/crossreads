<p>Aug 23rd.<br/>Have been very ill with fever thought the end had come many times.  Two Drs have been sent up from Hamadan to look after the people.  Two hospitals established for them &amp;  one for us.  All but Wilson out to it.  I am afraid Smithson &amp; Brophy N Z are done for.</p>
<p>Aug 24<br/>Feeling a bit better recommended for 2 weeks leave to Hamadan.  Seddon blocked it.  I am to take over a camp of 700 refugees tomorrow &amp; hurry them on to Hamadan in batches as there is practically no food for them here.</p>
<p>Aug 25th.<br/>Took over the camp from Fisher.  Had some trouble with the loafers &amp; sponges who are waiting for mules to journey to Hamadan, but put the fear of God into their hearts.</p>
