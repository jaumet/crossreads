 [Thursday 9 March 1916] 
 Went to lunch with another Mahmoud Hossive Pasha usual 9 courses. He had just returned from Cairo &amp; Tel El Kebir  Sir John Maxwell  asked are the Notable Pashas there to visit the Suez Canal &amp; see what measure had been taken by the British to protect Egypt. This Pasha having seen, said he was now quite satisfied that no enemy could get into Egypt.  rather a good move as many of these colored gentry sit on the fence &amp; jump over to safest side. Have applied for leave to get summer clothing from Cairo but doubt if successful.
