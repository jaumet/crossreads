My dearest Mother   &  Sisters,
Received two home letters this week. July 9th came on Tuesday   &  July 1st came Friday. It is strange how the later mail get here first, anthow I was very delighted to get them.
Eddy has soon learnt to write   &  I daresay he will get on quqickly because he is such a good little kiddie so pleased he likes his school   &  the playmates are what the little chap needed.
