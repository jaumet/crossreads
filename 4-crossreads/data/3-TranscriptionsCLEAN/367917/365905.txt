 To - Hon. Secretary 20th Battalion Comforts Fund, 63 Pitt Street, Sydney. 
 Dear Madam, I am in receipt of yours of 11th June last, and in reply have to express my regret that our communication notifying change of Command of this Unit, first to Colonel Bennett, and then to myself in May last had not reached you at the time of your writing. 
 Just prior to assuming command advice was received from Messrs. Anthony Hordern & Sons, London, that a sum of 250 had been placed to the credit of this Unit with the above firm, for which on behalf of every member of the Battalion I take this opportunity of expressing our sincere thanks and gratitude for your extreme liberality. 
 This sum has now practically been all expended on comforts and extra food for the men of the Unit, and in this we have been helped by Messrs. Hordern and Son, in every way possible, and I can assure you that every penny has been expended to the best advantage. 
 It is mainly due to the good friends of the Battalion in Australia that our men have had a constant supply of those little things which mean so much to the individual in the field, and have helped so materially to cheer our men in the line, and I have no hesitation in saying that some of the brilliant successes which have been achieved by this Unit are due in no small degree to the comforts which have been supplied so liberally, through your Depot. 
 Since May last the Battalion has been actively engaged against the enemy and on every occasion have made their presence felt, and upheld the name so gallantly earned on the Peninsula. Their most recent success was on the 31st of last month when, with other Units of the Brigade, a most brilliant attack was successfully launched and carried out against Mt. St. Quentin. This, I must tell you, was one of the most successful operations ever undertaken by the A.I.F., and high praise has been received from both British and French Staffs for the daring and complete manner in which it was carried to a successful issue. This operation enabled other Australian troops to enter Peronne, and has gained for our Army, positions of the greatest tactical value. 
 I am pleased to be able to report that throughout all these operations we have not suffered undue casualties, and that we have taken full toll of the enemy in killed and wounded, besides hundreds of prisoners, 800 of whom were taken in operation referred to above. 
 I am proud to be able to report that No. 1689 Corporal W.E. Brown has been awarded the Victoria Cross, and numerous other distinctions have been conferred on members of this Unit. 
 All ranks are taking the keenest interest in our War Museum, and I am confident in saying that when the full Museum is landed in Australia, the 20th Battalion Section will be second to none in variety as well as quantity. 
 Will you allow me to express to the ladies of your Committee on behalf of every member of this Unit, our heartfelt thanks for your kindness in every direction in the past, and trusting that we warrant a continuance of the same in the future, 
 I am, Yours very sincerely, F. Forbes Lieut-Colonel.
