number of tommies. We now made straight for home, not waiting to unload our wagon. On the way back, a shell lobbed just behind our wagon, killing two mules and  wounding the rest of the wagon in rear of us. The chaps in our wagon got covered with the debris. We arrived back at 11.30 p.m. after an exciting night.On Monday morning, one of the mules that was left for dead returned home, but died soon after.On Monday night, we left for dump at 10 p.m., but had to turm back as Fritz was shelling the road and it was impossible to pass.On Tuesday night left at 10 p.m., but had to go a roundabout way, as the road was being shelled again. We worked all night with our gas masks on, as gas shells were falling fast, and arrived back at 4 a.m.On Wednesday afternoon went to dump that had been blown up to fetch back a couple of wagons that had to be abandoned on the previous night. Both wagons had a couple of wheels blown off by shell-fire, and knocked about generally. On the way the road was being shelled. While waiting to pass, a dud, i.e., a defective shell that fails to burst, landed just at our feet. If it had exploded all of us would have been blown up. We cleared back round a different road and succeeded in repairing the wagons and bringing them back.On Thursday went to dump, but had to leave as the Germans commenced shelling it. One man was wounded in the back.
