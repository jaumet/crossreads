Had a dip this afternoon: The war-boats still keep up a heavy fire at intervals during both day & night; Last night about 70 Turks were sighted in front of the 3rd L.H.R. a special patrol was sent out to try & find out what their game was. it was supposed they were out after our patrol as they were seen & fired on  the night before, no casualties
