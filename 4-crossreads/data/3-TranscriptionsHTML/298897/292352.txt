<p>a bus.  Several of the old London busses are being used on this sector for moving men quickly.</p>
<p>Monday 21st August<br/>Went to the reinforcement camp in the morning to fix up the sick parade.  In the afternoon went in the car to Bo i with a patient for the detention hospital.  All self inflicted wounds, whether accidental or otherwise are sent here &amp; a court martial is held on them. 'Twas a splendid run of about 24 miles through lovely country &amp; over good roads being very close to Belgium.  Coming back I stopped in "Balleul" a fine big place &amp; had a run round the shops &amp; the Canteen buying various things.  Not being sure of the way I asked a soldier &amp; was surprised to see that he was a German prisoner.  He was dressed very like our fellows &amp; my mistake was very easily made.  I marvelled that they were being made use of so close to the line.  Altogether I had a splendid outing driving the car most of the way myself.  After returning, orders came to pickup some patients from the Bomb School so round</p>
