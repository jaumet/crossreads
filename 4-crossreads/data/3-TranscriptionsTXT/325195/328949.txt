 24.9.15 morning Hobson, his mate , &amp; I went out &amp; set to work &amp; did good work till dinner time: Hobson &amp; his mate were to go on again at 2 oclock till 5; Hobson's mate went off duty at dinner time with a poisoned foot &amp; as the dirt had been falling in off the parapet all the morning Hobby &amp; I decided not to go out till after tea, so as we could get up on the parapet &amp; shovel all the loose dirt away from our front, as there should be an hours darkness before the moon rose &amp; not much danger of being hit by our friends the Turk, who is entrenched 500 or 600 yds away; We worked at high pressure during that hour &amp; before the moon rose we had finished all that could be done for the present on the parapet &amp; returned to our bunks; This afternoon Stan &amp; I received a sheep-skin waist-coat from Aunt Bessie, &amp; they are very acceptable as the nights now are getting very cold. "No phone work tonight"
