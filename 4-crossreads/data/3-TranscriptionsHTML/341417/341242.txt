<p>So that rifle fire could be kept up till after we had got to the boats, some ingenuous devices were used.</p>
<p>The principal one was managed by charging a rifle. A string was then tied to the trigger &amp; after running through a loop a can was tied to the end hanging down.<br/>Above this tin can was another one with a hole in the bottom, so that after a certain amount of water had run from the upper can the weight in the bottom one pulled the trigger of the rifle. By different sized-tins and holes, difference in the time of discharging the rifle was brought about.</p>
<p>We destroyed a number of bombs but those kind which are set going by a friction tube were used a good deal by the men for making "booby traps".<br/>The bomb would be made fast to a blanket etc. &amp; buried in the ground a few inches. The idea was when Johnny Turk picked up the object, he sort of pulled a Xmas cracker. I suppose they pulled mostly prizes.<br/>Understand, was not done by military orders &amp; not for vindictiveness by the men. It was done as a sort of joke, I should imagine, as they would play at home only there it was intended to cause loss of life made lawful, by "civilized" people.</p>
