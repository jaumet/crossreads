Anyway I'm allright myself so far. I hope this letter will get you at "Orvieto" Mum. I suppose Claude is training now for a commission I hope, - we are wondering wether he will marry before he comes away. I must write & congratulate old Nance - I saw the announcement in the "Tas. Mail" 
 Mum darling I hope you are taking things quietly & not giving that leg a chance to get bad again. 
 Well dear I'll say cheer-oh & write a few lines to Nance & Joan 
 Very best love from your boy John

 P.S. The weather is lovely here at present, rather hot sometimes though. We're not far from the beach & of course get plenty of swimming (often under shell fire from old man Turk) which is a Godsend to the troops (not the shell fire) most chaps are as brown as niggers now.
