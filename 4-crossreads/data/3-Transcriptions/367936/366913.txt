<p>Wednesday 5 January 1916<br/>Went to the Barracks with Aunt Katie.  Fell in at 12 o'clock, was given tea and pies and sent out to Liverpool by train and put in L.H. lines.  Met the Land board clerk from Mudgee.  Everything here seems nice.  Light Horse men seem very decent crowd.  Hope I pass riding test tomorrow.  <strike>Are</strike> Sleep in Y.M.C.A. tent tonight.</p>
