  
 of going on to-morrow, I did not think I was so tired, until I stopped   &  now know, feel as if I could sleep for a week. Rested all yesterday   &  today went  for a lovely walk this afternoon   &  our luck was in, it poured raining just after we returned   &  has done so ever since. We are tucked in bed feeling very safe   &  comfortable. 
 Still address my letters C/O Aust. Base Post Office, Horseferry Road. London. If any change shall let you know as soon as possible. 
 Hope you are all well   &  happy   &  that things are going smoothly with you. I'm longing for letters from home. Tell my friends I am too down-hearted to write just yet but may be able to settle down   &  write y letters. Fondest love   &  kisses to you all, 
 From your loving daughter Edith
