 Mon Sept 2 Fritz was over again last night and kept us awak with his Bomb . Bridl , one of the chap who came with me from Weymouth is camp near here . He doe the cook for his crowd . I went over to the A.D.S. [Advanc Dress Station ] this morn . There seem to be a good crowd of wound come thro? , and quit a good sprinkl of Hun . Sever batch of prison have gone by , but they do n't look up to much . We move again after Tea , up to the 25 A.S.C. Line . We are camp in a Paddock , near a Batteri of 9.2 . We had to dig a hole and roof it over with Trench Cover . We pass over a Bridg on our way here , which Fritz has blown up with Bomb 5 time , but it doe n't take the Engineer long to fix it up again . Tue 3 We move near the Villag of Hem . Had to dig a Hole and cover it with Tarp for a Camp . Rather cramp for space . There is a Batteri of 8" Gun close by , but thank the Lord they are onli for use in case of S.O.S. Wed 4 The Hun continu to fall back and we are kept continu on the move . The whole bloomin ? armi seem to be look for itself . We are attach to the 25 A.S.C. [Armi Servic Corp ] now . The Tucker is veri rough . We thought it was good to be attach to A.S.C. , but so far it 's a dud . I?d sooner go back with the 8th than fool around like this . Thur Aug 5 Last night thing were veri excit . First of all Fritz 's plane came over and bomb all around us . Then one of his High Veloc shell went into the Ground about 10 yds away from our dugout . We were just settl down again , when the picket sung out " Gas " . Then there was a wild struggl to find our Gas mask , and we had to wear them for about an hour till we got the " All clear " . We had to move up again nearer the A.S.C. I rode the Bike , but it was a veri dusti ride . We are camp on the side of a Hill , near a big stack of Fritz 's shell of various size . There is a big swamp just across the Road , which is simpli teem with water hen . I had a good Bath and did some wash . The water was veri cold . At night we had to move back to our old Camp again . Just as we were move off a terrif thunderstorm broke loos . And it rain like furi . It was quit dark when we reach Camp , so we just had to crawl in under a Tarp , and sleep there . Fri Sept 6 Slept fair comfort last night , altho ? it was on the Ground . Fritz was quiet for onc . We found quit a good "humpy" , and move the Postal Gear into it . My kit bag arriv from Base . There are plenti of good dugout about . We are move again tomorrow . They did give us time to settl down . I realli ought to write some Letter , but with this continu move about one doe n't get the chanc . " Sleep" and I slept in a dinki littl dugout on our own .
