Revielle as usual
Horses went out again but didn't leave to come home until late at night so as to dodge the heat of the day. I had another ride out paid a visit to the Nile, there it is very wide when I was there several felucca's came down under full sail looked real well the niggers are not too friendly in these parts for you often get a shower of anything they have to give away, Saw the natives treating the palms, they are divided into two sexes, male from female the flower of the male is treated with some substance then placed in the flower of the female this is why our palms at home never bear fruit.

Pard the C.O. are leaving by the express tonight for Cairo, where they intend to stay several days, the Sig Squadron is the attraction or rather the unravelling of same but I don't give him a chance.
The Secret service reports that everything is clear for 200 miles so I can't see any fun here, a squadron flew out to over the Sennussi camp at Sodum where they heavily bombed it causing intense panic amongst the enemy.
Wrote letters home Neil, Hal Chas went on leave Norm I went for a ride after tea on the bikes leaving them at the station for they are going with the boys.
