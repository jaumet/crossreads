 6.9.18 The Ch. Engineer of the H.M.T. Vigilant came on board to dinner. This tug is used to tow a 500 tug hulk full of general cargo from Alexandria to Taranto. The hulk is manned by Egyptians. The tug has a colored crew with a European Captain &amp; Ch. Engineer &amp; two gunners &amp; armed only with a 12 pounder. On the way over without a escort a distance of 1000 mls she ran short of coal &amp; had to make for the Greek Island under reduced speed burning all her wood work fittings. The Captain being up practically all the way on arrival here was sent to the hospital &amp; sent to England. As the Chief Engineer stated it was a very risky undertaking under the conditions. The Captain &amp; himself complained bitterly &amp; reported the matter to the H.M.S. Queen, she being the battleship guard at Taranto. A simple prey to the enemy submarines. News received this day of the death of the Captain of the H.M.T. Caladonia he died of heart desease. She was one of our troop convoy ships &amp; one of the P &amp; O Company.
