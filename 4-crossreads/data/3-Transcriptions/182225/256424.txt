<p>Fairly fine. Mother came in in the morning to see me &amp; we went over the old Castle &amp; St Giles Church &amp; Holyrod Palace we also saw the heart of Midlothian. We got some more Xmas presents &amp; then after dinner Mother went back to rest &amp; I went out &amp; saw Alan &amp; spent the afternoon at the aerodrome. I came in in the side car with him &amp; we all went out to the Jim&nbsp;Robertson&#39;s &amp; had tea. I got the 10.20 pm train to London. Mother Alan Uncle &amp; Auntie Jane were there to see me off. Edinburgh is not a bad place but did not have time to see it properly. Had a yarn to Admiral Beatty &nbsp;in the Callie &amp; came down with King Manuel of Portugal.</p>
