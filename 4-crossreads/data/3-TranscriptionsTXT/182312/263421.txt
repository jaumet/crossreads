  5th July 1916. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Billets I last wrote from now consist of one 
 chimney and&nbsp;  ^  a  heap of charred bricks.&nbsp; It was a big homestead and 
 accom ^  m odated the whole Company.&nbsp; The Hun apparently thought it 
 concealed a gun for he poured shells in there in salvos until he 
 was sure there was nothing left standing.&nbsp; Fortunately everybody 
 was able to get out in time.&nbsp; Since then I have done another turn

 and quite a frequent one possibly growing more frequent as the 
 size and effect of the shells increase.&nbsp; I had always imagined 
 that shell shock was a sort of climax to a gradual wearing of the 
 nerves through constnt exposure to shell fire.&nbsp; Such is not the
