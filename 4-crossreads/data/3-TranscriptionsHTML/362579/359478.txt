<p>A card from Mrs Newton also the Osbournes.</p>
<p>My friends are awfully good thinking of me. Mrs Baynes said she had sent a cake but it has not turned up. Perhaps the fish are enjoying it.</p>
<p>I do wish I had been awarded the R.R.C. only to please my friends &ndash; they will think I did not do my work as well as the others but really every on of the nurses at our C.C.S. worked as hard as they could   &amp;  only four out of the crowd got it. Dorothy is very lucky   &amp;  she deserved it much more than some who have been decorated</p>
