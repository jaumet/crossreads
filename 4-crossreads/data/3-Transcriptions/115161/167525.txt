<p><u>A BIT ABOUT MYSELF</u></p>
<p>My name I need not mention, let it suffice that my friends call me Gill, while I am known as Gillie by some of my friends of the sweeter sex. I am not related to the makers of the famous razor-blades, bearing a name similar to my own.</p>
<p>I enlisted in March 1916. Left Australia for the front in September of the same year. Returned to Australia in July 1920.</p>
<p>I went as a private, returned as a sergeant.</p>
<p>I went there thin, returned fat, very fat.</p>
<p>I went there short of stature, returned no taller.</p>
<p>My chief attainment is complaining (or growling), and I place myself second to none in this respect. I claim to have brought growling to a fine art.</p>
<p>The only privilege granted to us in the A.I.F. was to growl, and I didn&#39;t let&nbsp;an opportunity escape me. I growled when in camp, to get on the transport. I growled on the transport, to get to England. I growled in England to get to France. I growled in France because I was there. I growled while on leave, because I had to go back to France. &nbsp;I growl now that I&nbsp;am home again, because (I suppose) I have&nbsp;not to go back. I shall growl I expect to my dying day. Such a habit has growling become that I fear I&nbsp;should growl if I had everything I&nbsp;wanted. Growling has fairly got into my blood. I remember on one occassion being referred to by a big fellow&nbsp;as &quot;that little pup&quot;, so I suppose that epithet was used on account of my continuous growling, (or perhaps his lady-love had made a good &quot;lot&quot; of me.) Ah, well!</p>
<p>I am only just a dark very undersized, insignificant, sober-minded being, of a most selfish disposition, and as the case with small men, conceited and quarrelsome, and mean to a degree,</p>
