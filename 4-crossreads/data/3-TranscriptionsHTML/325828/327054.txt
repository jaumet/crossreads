<p>are two English Squadrons, the 67th &amp; 10th.  They are a fine lot of Officers in the Squadron; the O.C. Captain Andrew Lang, coming from Sydney,  One of the Instructors Lieut. Badgery, is also from Sydney &amp; is well known as the son of Mr. Badgery Senr, of Pitt, Son &amp; Badgery.  He is only a young fellow of 26 or 7 but is a thoroughly competent pilot.  He was the first man in Australia to build &amp; fly his own machine   What he doesn't know about 'planes isn't worth knowing.  The other 4 officers, (Adjutant, 2 Instructors, &amp; Equipment Officer,) of the Squadron are English Officers attached to us.<br/>In addition last week we had 33 2/ Lieutenants (Tommy) attached for Instruction.  So far I have been up 7 times and my word it is fine.  It was with Lieut: Badgery that I went up first.  Then 3 flights with Lieut Turner (an Officer from the Indian Army attached to us) &amp; then 3 flights with Lieut Badgery again.  We have 8 machines serviceable at present, &amp; 10 others building.  At present we only have one type of machine the M.F.S.H. (Maurice Farman Short Horn).  These are biplanes with the propellor  <u>behind</u> the planes; <strike>fitted</strike> two of them are fitted with 70 H.P. Renault engines, the others with 80 H.P. R.  They are very slow busses but very safe.  The top speed of the 70 H.P. is about 56-60 mph, the others developing 65 m. p. h.  My first trip about 10 days ago was in a 70 H.P. machine.  After stepping over numerous wires stays, &amp; struts, I climbed up after the<br/>Pilot into the nacelle (the box-like arrangement in the centre of the plane.).</p>
