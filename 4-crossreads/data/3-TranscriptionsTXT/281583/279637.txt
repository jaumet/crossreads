nothing much to report. The weather is very cold here & totally different to France where I have just come from. The front is comparatively quiet compared to the Somme, but Gas attacks are very frequent & consequently one has to be always on the hop. I have not yet been under a severe gas attack but it is a moral certainty that it will come our way as soon as the wind changes owing to the British giving them a fairly liberal dose.
I went to a very pretty Belgium City this afternoon called Waerslade near the French Border. It is hidden away beneath tall trees in a valley with a big Convent overlooking it from the crest of a big hill. One cannot help comparing the attitude of the Belgian people to those of the French. The populace as a whole, especially the winsome lassies (who by the way are strikingly handsome) cannot do enough for one.
I am extremely puzzled over a letter received from Nina in which she states that I am in England. I have never been near there as a matter of fact, having come straight to France from Egypt last June
