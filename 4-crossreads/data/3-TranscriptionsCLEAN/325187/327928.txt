This morning I had an APPLE a real Australian Apple-   Our Doctor got hold of a c/- from Victoria somehow, & out here on the Desert, they were much appreciated-  We get very close to Native on this game, & to dodge about, get a feed, & a sleep come before most things, but all men will come back better for it- tho' I remember being told often after the SA war-"All the nice men were killed" however I'll waive my claim & come back to the old home again.Good news re the different Fronts & hope it may continue, our Chaps are getting a lively time in France from all we hear.
