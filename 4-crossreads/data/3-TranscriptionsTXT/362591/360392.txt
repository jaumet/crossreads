censorship regulations are things to be ignored.  Cecil came to Alexandria to see me after my first return from Gallipoli & he then had heard from you but I've not seen him since altho I heard of him from Genl. Holmes in whose command he was & who told me that he had recommended him for some distinction.  I was hardly as unlucky as from your letter you think I had been as I was at both the landing and the evacuation having left the unit I came with & taken a Battery at Anzac.  My experiences so far have taught me a lot, first that one wants to be either a General or very young to stand any length of time on active service, secondly there are Generals who are those (many) who are not.
