Easter Sunday The cemetery is a very interesting place. Fritz went to some trouble in planting flowers & making the graves look nice. They also had some very nice stones to some of the Graves; especially the officers. They had one of our airmen buried with some of their men & his name was painted on the stone in English. There is a very fine statue that Fritz erected in memory of their men who fell in the taking & holding of Bapaume. After a stroll through the Town we got aboard a Motor Lorry & returned to Bellevue Farm.
