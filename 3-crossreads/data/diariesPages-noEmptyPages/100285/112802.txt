The country round here is very pretty the crops look real well, especially the wheat oats.
20th. Have been doing nothing all the day, but this afternoon Graham I walked down to Warminster, on the way down we met Lieut Brownlee we had a yarn with him, then went on to the town, she is built in a long rambling old fashioned way full of old houses all stone ivy covered, I never saw so many "Jacks" (M.P.s) before not even in London, this place is full of the wasters, they pulled me up twice once for wearing my hat down again for having no chin straps needless to say they got very little satisfaction in either cases. I had the luck of the world here actually got 2 films for my Kodak, a thing I could not get for love nor money anywhere else
