  
 -5- 24th September 1916. 
 I had in my book and which I drew at Horseferry Road, should see me through a week - what?  You will see that I didn't have time to make arrangements to meet Billy this week-end for the long arm of coincidence stretched out (that's in a book I've just been reading and sounds well) and I fortunately met an old "better-day Pal" of mine in the Bank who is camped right alongside him, and I gave him a note to meet me next Saturday. 
 Coming out of the Bank we thought we would walk round a little, but somehow we found ourselves down the East End, somewhere, so we jumped into the nearest taxi and got out.  It's a big place this London, but while you've got money and there are taxi's and policemen about, you'll never get lost.  The traffic arrangements are of course splendid and I guess it takes some arranging.  Tubes, underground Tramways, overhead Tramways overhead and underground roads for different kinds of traffic.  Motor omnibuses and double-decked tram cars etc., etc., and taxis by the million all get rid of it somehow.  Most of the work over here is of course done by women.  They are the policewomen, post-women, taxi drivers, tram drivers, ticket collectors, carriage cleaners and all sorts of other jobs they tackle, but beyond this and the fact that no lights are allowed in the Street at night, you would hardly think there was a war on.  The Streets are always crowded and standing room only is the rule in most Theatres at about 7.30.  Of course we haven't seen anything of London yet, though have seen most of the interesting sights, such as Picadilly, The Strand, The Museum, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Parliament House etc., all from the outside.  As we left London about twelve that morning, (only had the one night there) I did not have time to call on Kreglinger & Fernan, but if I don't get the opportunity next week-end, will drop them a line. 
 Well, as I said we left at twelve and came up to Birmingham to relations of Harry's.  Here we are having a great time.  They are very nice people, especially the two girls ahem! and being Australians am afraid we are being spoilt.  Anyhow I'm not complaining.  This is of course a great manufacturing centre, engaged now principally on war work.  To-morrow, we are going up to Leeds to see a wounded pal, but I think I will post this off here, or you might think I'm writing a book.  Will also divide it up into three envelopes, or somebody might think it is too. 
 Kind regards to all, Roy.
