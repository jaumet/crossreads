<p>Sunday Sept 16th<br/>Misty nearly all day. Was put on Quartermasters fatigue so I never went to church. Went out picking blackberries this afternoon, there are a good few bushes about here, but many berries. They are not in comparison with the blackberries in Australia, rather small, with hardly any taste ot juice.</p>
<p>Monday Sept 17th<br/>Still misty windy &amp; cold. All clocks were put back an hour this morning at 2 am, on account of the "daylight saving system". It is the end of the summer, but from what I can see of it we haven't had any summer yet. Pay day today, but has my pay book hasn't come back yet I couldn't draw any. Went to see Dr Lynn a conjurer in the Gym this evening he was very good.</p>
<p>Tuesday Sept 18th<br/>The wet &amp; cold weather has apparently set in, as there seems no hope of it breaking. This camp is just about full now. There are a good few "big heads" today, after yesterday.</p>
