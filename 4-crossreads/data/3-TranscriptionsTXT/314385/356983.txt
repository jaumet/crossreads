Thur Sep 21stStill on same duties, we have about 150 patients sick. French flu & boils etc also influenza.
I & another went into Popge in after noon & had a good look round. The people look rough & coarse. Went to a picture show in the evening.
Fri Sep 22ndGot a half day off and again went into town & found a shop run by Crosse & Blackwell where tinned goods of every description could be obtained from a rump steak to partridge. I invested in a tin of Pork sausages & took it to a resturent & had it warmed. Found them a great relish.
Sat Sep 23rdNothing unusual in morning life seems rather flat.
I have many games of chess & Solo whist with the boys. A football match took place in the afternoon between two ambulances which resulted in a conquest by our team.
Flying machines are plentiful.
We had gas helmet drill by our new O.C. he is very keen on this & it seems probable he is preparing us for action
