<p>9.000 Stokes bombs, 10,000 MILLS No. 5, 5,000 Rifle Grenades &amp; the same number of cartridges for them  24 boxes of Very lights &amp; flares &amp; numerous other small items, I am responsible for all this so you can imagine it kept me busy as the pushing parties kept on butting in &amp; loading the wrong stuff. I told a few of them off for this, the pushing party was drawn mostly from the 3rd Batt  we had somewhere round about 150 of them &amp; a few of the 2nd Bde. also. It kept Starkey &amp; I pretty busy checking &amp; counting truckloads.<br/>Saw a horse killed waggon smashed &amp; the driver wounded this evening. A shell lobbed fair</p>
