<p>Last Tuesday afternoon did a little shopping   &amp;  then went to Southwell Gardens to say good bye or Bon Voyage to Pilkie. Stayed for dinner   &amp;  saw my other patients, they are all very disgusted at me not being awarded to R.R.C. but all cannot get it   &amp;  some are more fortunate than others. Of course I shall never get in now because I won t do C.C.8. work again. I don't suppose.</p>
<p>Had a nice letter from Dorothy   &amp;  she is sorry my name was not amongst the list.</p>
<p>Wednesday worked all day. Thursday had the Day off. Met Sister O'Dwyer in London   &amp;  had lunch with her, then we met Myra   &amp;  went to Matinee "Cheep", it is good but we were all disappointed because we expected to go to Drury Lane Pantomime "Alladin" but could not get seats.</p>
