My luck was certainly good, to return from such a good holiday in Paris, &amp; come direct on a six months trip to England.  I don't think I told you about the Paris trip.  It was one of the best holidays I have had.  Arrived on Xmas Eve, and was given a free dinner to start with.  It was a real Xmas spread, Turkey, nuts, wine etc., and was the first of its kind since leaving home, therefore greatly appreciated.
