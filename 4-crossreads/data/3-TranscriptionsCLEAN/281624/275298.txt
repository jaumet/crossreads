Monday Dec 6th  Wrote home, I got up to-day for the first time surprised at my own weakness as I could hardly walk.  I am now on tonics.  Two boats have lately been torpedoed in the Med.  Greece has not yet decided and as the Serbs are still retreating the situation is very grave.
Tuesday Dec 7th  Managed to walk up & down the verandah a few times this morning but am terribly weak.  Germany is trying in ridiculous terms to negotiate the peace, she must be on her last legs.

Friday Dec 10th  Three men went to Eng from this ward, they are clearing Malta right out.  a Tommy can get home with a toothache.  There are only Australians left here now.

Sunday Dec 12th  Leg became very sore last night after I had been to pictures so I had a good rest to-day.  A big bundle of Aust papers came to hand to-day and were very welcome to the ward we only just learned what one the Caulfield Cup run two months ago.
Monday Dec 13th  There has been a big reverse in Salonika to the Allies and it is expected that 3000 wounded will shortly arrive.  Up all day feeling better but
