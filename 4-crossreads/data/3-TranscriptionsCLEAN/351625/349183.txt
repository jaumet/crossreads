we rode over to Herdcote [Hurdcott] 20 miles from here where Bob is at present stationed & saw him for a while but could not stay long as we had a 20 miles ride home.  He expects to join up with his Batt. again in a couple of months or so then it will be A1 being with him in his own platoon & everything.  We may not move off tomorrow but will be sure to a day or two after.  You can send plenty of socks & mittens but wait till you get our correct address which I will let you have directly we form up.  Last mail I got two letters from you, one from father & one from Aunt Eva & no parcels at all but there must be a lot on the way.  At present I have as many warm clothes as I can carry, you should just see me with my pack on, it makes one a regular camel the articles I have packed in mine are a great coat, shirt, underpants,
