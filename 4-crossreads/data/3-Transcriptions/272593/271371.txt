<p>his place &amp; had a cut at S.M.  Great excitement last night straightening our platoon rolls up, for from now on, every morning the platoon Sergts have to hand in 2 parade states one to the S.M. &amp; the other to his platoon officer so we have to keep our hands out of our pockets from now on.<br/>The Dr inspected the Coy today to see if they had any "Scabies" I think he got 2 out of my platoon that showed signs of them and had an inspection of iron rations  I don't think they got any at all in our Coy, they got quite a lot in A Coy &amp; they all got 10 days C.B.<br/>14th  Marched out on the Bn parade ground this morning</p>
