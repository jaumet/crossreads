Spent a rather busy morning at the office dealing with a lot of matters and received orders to go to Hull tomorrow evening.

Put up at the Great Western at Paddington and dined there. Went into Piccadilly and afterwards had a trip out of Warwick beyond Paddington. Met a friend from Whitechapel. Bed 1.30 am.
