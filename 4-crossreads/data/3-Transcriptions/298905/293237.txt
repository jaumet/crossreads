<p>last night with the same old tale of good treatment.<br/>A fair sized Australian mail has come in to-day, she is a welcome visitor<br/>The weather today is frightfully hot &amp; muggy it must rain shortly. I had a good bath this evening &amp; washed some of the sweat off myself, to make matters worse out Capt. has issued orders to the effect that anyone caught without their tunics on would be crimed, the reason of this is of course the heads are frightened of gas.<br/>By Jove we have just had a most terrific thunderstorm, the heaviest I have seen since leaving Australia, the trenches are like small rivers, &amp; the clayey mud is nearly to your knee's, we shall develop fins I can see that if we are here for the winter which I dont think</p>
