Various Verses
Night is gone and day is breakingSunbeams gently kiss the dewMingling the green with diamondsShining in their verdant hueIn the midst there stands a lilyProudly in its purityAh, its virtue, sweet as heavenJust like you dear, seem to me.
Here comes Carmichael's bandHere comes Carmichael's bandOh just listen to their merry tuneThey've got a ripping leadAnd now they only needA girl or two to appreciate their viewWith Sergeant Flynn in frontIm sure you'd have to huntFor any band that springs to it as wellAnd if some Friday nightYou see a lovely sightOf 30 couples sitting far away from the lightBet that it's Carmichael's Band
