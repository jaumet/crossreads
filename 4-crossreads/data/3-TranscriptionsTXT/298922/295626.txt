 Friday 23rd November 1917 
 Still anchored at PLYMOUTH, cold but safe, we got some papers &amp; heard of the success of BYNG's push  near St. QUENTIN  &amp; our men at Jerusalem. Passengers thawing a little, beginning to speak to each other. At my table is an American Engineer with a terrific drawl &amp; a Mining Engineer &amp; I spoke of the POLAR man before so we talk on all subjects. But no REUTER news.  The P. &amp; O. are too mean to subscribe &amp; altho' we have wireless no news is posted on SALOON.
