In the afternoon for exercise walked into town through Kasr-el-Nil  & past Abdin [Abdeen] Palace - bought to-days "Bourse" (French Daily) & had afternoon tea at Groppis - then walked back again. A lot of English people must be coming to Cairo now - I passed quite a number in the streets. After tea went round to 1st Cairo Scouts' clubroom where there was a flag dedication ceremony.
