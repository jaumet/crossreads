We propose to dine in state on Thursday & Saty - On those days we drink the 'King' & 'before the King' you mustn't tell a yarn or mention the name of a woman or eat the fruit before desert or not excuse yourself to the President - if late - The fine is - doubles all round the mess - Sat night - if at sea - we drink in addition sweethearts & wives - No press news came thro on Friday so we're in the dark as to the naval scrap off the Falklands - Still we know the pleasure that will be felt in Sydney & right thro the Pacific & we well know the drinking & rejoicing in the wardrooms of the Fleet - We are pessimistic here as to Russia - Russia has so far beaten Austria but not the Germans & if reports are true Germany has inflicted some very nasty beatings on the Russian Army - The Allies may have a very bad time in France if the Russians are defeated & German troops released from the East & sent W by rail - Our weather is fine - We are in the Coral Sea - well within the tropics & steaming direct to Rabaul. The work on the ship is dominated by 2 ideas (1st) that we are in action (2nd) that we are on fire -
