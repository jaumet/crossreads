<p>queue at the R.T.O's office for nearly an hour in the stinging cold. How I did bless the R.T.O. &amp; then when my pass was initialled I had the greatest difficulty in getting a board as the boat was crowded I pleaded that my stuff was on board &amp; was let pass (the last one.). We drew out at 11-15, a convoy of 3 boats, escorted by destroyers. Except for being rather cold the passage across the Channel was uneventful &amp; the sea was calm It took nearly 2 hours to cross &amp; the trains were crowded I waited for the second train but could not get a seat in the Pullman car so had to fast from 8 till 5 oclock<br/>I stayed at the YMCA off hut at Victoria station</p>
