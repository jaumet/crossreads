  
 59 much has occurred that it is almost impossible to remember what happened on the different days so much so that I cannot recall what I did on some dates. 
 This day I took Madelon to Sacre Coeur - Place [indecipherable] - Madame Nini & Spanish Bar, & then walked home in the early hours of the morning 
 11-7-19 Impossible to say what happened 
 12-7-19 Madelon has asked me to an afternoon tea that is given by herself & friends Besides myself there are 3 other men all Grecian but either naturlised or students one of them has been in French Air Service & carries a bracelet of thin gold chain which he says is distinguishing mark of Air Force. The refreshments are on luxurious scale for two students Conversation is ordinary. 
 Madelon I think intended this to be a celebration of her exam which ended this morning but unfortunately she failed on the last day. 
 12-7-19 Slept nearly all day in order to get some sleep in hand as this is the commencement of the festivaties
