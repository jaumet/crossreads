<p>a walk  down to the native city at the back of the camp. The sights here are not much. First of all, on our approach, as with other strangers, all the native women bunk for their lives. Immediately they see us they skin out &amp; hide. Those who cannot get away, cover up their faces so that we cannot see them. It is the custom of the native women to hide their faces to all unbelievers in their faith, therefore the majority wear a shawl over their heads ready to drop it. They will answer "backsheesh" however.</p>
<p>The "houses" are simply stone &amp; sand walls with reeds &amp; bamboo's thrown over the top. The whole conditions are awful &amp; cramped beyond description. The dirt &amp; filth in and around the native city is amazing &amp; how the inhabitants do not die of disease is a problem. Nine out of ten of the natives suffer with some affliction to their eyes &amp; are generally blind in one. The youngsters gather all the rubbish they can collect &amp; wear all the worn out clothes &amp; other things are thrown away. The youngest youngsters all cry for the usual "backsheesh". After return we feed up &amp;  then we have a siesta for the rest of the day.</p>
