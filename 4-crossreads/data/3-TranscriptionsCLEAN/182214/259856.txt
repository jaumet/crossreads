dance before my eyes at times but like everything else it got cooler & we were going to France where we would be away from this infernal country in a few weeks now, so we stuck it out after several visits to the wet canteen, well we left Ferry Post for Moascar May 28th early in the morning with our own brigade it was lovely & cool & we we were all happy full packs up we whistled & sang. & when we passed our Divisional General McCay we all swung into step & went by him like one man, has the General seen such marching? such a fine body of men? such a unit as his Eighth field ambulance?
