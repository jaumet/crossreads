2 ThursdayWe left Vauchelles-les-Domart about 9.30 am & marched to Picquigny arriving there about 2 pm.  It was very muddy & raining all the way, owing to having very bad boots my feet were soaken wet.  It was very hilly country we passed through & altogether the scenery was very pretty.  Picquigny is a fairly large place & now is full of Australians & Tommies.  Had a look round the town during the evening.  Paid 40 Francs in the evening.
3 FridayThere appears to be a very large factory near here as the whistle is continually blowing.  We are billeted in what used to be a fairly large place & A. section Bearers are in a large room on the third floor, we are very comfortably quartered.  7 bearers & 3 tent division are allowed leave to Amiens daily, I am putting in for leave tomorrow, but as only  small percentage is allowed off I may not get it.  The weather is very good now but very cold of a morning.
4 SaturdayWe had gas helmet drill with the box respirators & a route march in the morning, owing to having bad boots & sore feet I didn't go on the route march.  There was a football match on this afternoon between this Amb & the 16th Battalion, the 16th Battalion won.  About thirty of us had to go down to the Somme river & wash waggon in the afternoon.
5 SundayGot leave for Amiens & after waiting 3 hrs for a train we eventually arrived there.  It is about 8 miles from here & is a large City.  I had a splendid time.
