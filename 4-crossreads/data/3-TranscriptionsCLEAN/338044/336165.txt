 We have been hearing all sorts of rumours lately of removal to France. Most of the troops have gone & the 1st & 2nd Divisions are already in action in France. Not until a few days back did I give any credit to our boys' rumours, until the advance party was hurriedly equipped, paraded & inspected  & they embark for overseas to-morrow.
