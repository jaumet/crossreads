<p>office hours!  There is an electric tramway system throughout the city &amp; suburbs which seems to have reached a height of efficiency. The cars are double-deckers, American &amp; London style, very fast &amp; fitted with cowcatchers, basket or scoop shaped that completely minimise risk of run-overs. At meal times in office hours, specials start out from given places &amp; run to the suburbs. The  go like fury, bells ringing all the time, &amp; don't stop. This allows office workers to get right home for meals in shortest time. I don't know about the fares &ndash; the service was free to all uniforms during our stay. As to other traffic, it is all a matter of native traction. One sees a few horse drawn vehicles &amp; plenty motors, but generally carts, lorries &amp; rickshas &ndash; also perambulators are drawn, or pushed, by natives. Poor devils, their labor is cheap &amp; their lives cheaper. Slavery was a damnably rotten thing, but some forms of freedom look a mighty sight more putrid. We cleared the ship of all spare bread, condensed milk etc &amp; even the scraps from  stew dixies were scrambled for &amp; fought for by the poor kaffirs. They're always smiling- but- one cant help noticing the sordid misery under the smile. Even the flash &amp; highly decorative ricksha boys are strugglers in ordinary times. They are limited by statute to a charge that works out at about 3d per mile per passenger. A Ricksha carries two.</p>
