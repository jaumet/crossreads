There is little more to write about, so I guess I?d best ring off for awhile and see what I can collect for next letter. had a message from Jim E. a couple of weeks ago. he had just rejoined his Bn. I have not been able to see him so far, and will have no opportunity now for at least three weeks, Eric also is over here I believe .. I heard that he had transferred to a machine gun Coy. now I must go.

Tell Harry that sometime soon I hope to answer his letters. Shall also write J. soon as possible. C
