  
 first couple of days.  We have to learn the semaphore signalling also.  I can tell you between the two I am having a very large time.  They are both very interesting so that makes it all the better.  I shall have a good deal to tell you all when I return.  I wont be able to say much in my letters from now on.  I haven't seen any thing of Reg. Gibson so far.  Aub. Smither's & Garvin are both here.  Smither's has been drafted into the 2nd Batt. & Garvin into what used to be the 4th Batt.  I dare say you have all heard they are making new Batts. here.  Split the first Division in halves each Batt. then built on them we have the 56th Batt. now.  I am still in the 1st as you will see.  It is causing a bit of bitterness among those that were left back to form the new Batts.  They say it is putting a slur on them.  One can understand their feeling.  They have fought alongside a good few that are here & are now parted.  They call us of the 1st Battt. the Dinkums & from the 53rd on the War Babies.  Bert is having a good stay in camp.  I hope he gets into this Batt. when he comes across.
