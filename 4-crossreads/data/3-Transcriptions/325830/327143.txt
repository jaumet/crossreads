<p>the way we were three before we reached our destination. Fortunately I had my compass with me otherwise I feel sure the driver would have wandered into the German lines. However I was under cover &amp; comfortable by 12 a.m. Little incidents like this are the [indecipherable] of campaigning.</p>
<p>Next morning I pushed on to Headquarters per horse &amp; here I am. I started duty here on 13th April with the chief of the General Staff. The work is highly interesting as the general staff is the fighting branch of the staff. Of course we are a little distance from the firing line but we have a few moments of excitement occasionally. On Sunday last 16.4.16 a Zeppelin came cross here &amp; dropped some bombs. No damage done, one fell in a field, one in a village near by but failed to explode.</p>
<p>The weather here is wretched since I landed it has been bitterly cold &amp; wet. I am not permitted to lapse into details but when I return you shall have the story in full.</p>
<p>As I said in opening this note I am as fit as a fiddle. I cannot say how long I shall be on the staff but I fancy for some time. We are very busy at present so I shall close with fondest love to yourself Mama &amp; all at Home. My kind regards for all who enquire for me.</p>
<p>Love to you all<br/>Frank</p>
