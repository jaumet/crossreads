 24/9/15 1955. We fired a rocket and waited. Presently our artillery broke loose and started to play hell. The warships made chessboard one sea of fire. Our F.A. got on to Turks in front of us and we rattled away too. Not many there. With Major Smith up above parapet level in parados &ndash; very exposed as still incomplete. Bombs coming too near to be pleasant and set sandbags on fire alround. Enemy's artillery not idle and noise awful. 75's tearing round and nearly buried us in dirt. Bullets raining hot about a foot above head. Too much moon for rifle flashes to be picked up through periscopes but trench mortar easily located. Weight of firing on our left. Returned HQ all quiet. Bed 2257 o'clock. Everything smothered in powder and verma jelly &ndash; hope no lice tonight 
 25/9/15  Slept well. Bright moonlight when got up, nothing doing. Artillery got going early and plastered Chessboard. DeBoos &amp; Crowley to Alexandria &ndash; Peart to come here. Mountainous islands look delightful over the blue sea. Last night could see distinctly from Regtl. Dugout the outline of Bulgaria. More fresh meat lately. Lovely day. Saw piece of wet equipment sticking of parapet, pulled it, brought some ribs with it. Owner buried now
