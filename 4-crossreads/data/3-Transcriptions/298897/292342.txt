<p>14 days No. 2.  Things have been too easy &amp; the wild spirits are taking advantage.  Luckily I've had no trouble but several of the other N.C.O.'s have some of the men being wheeled.  For two day they tried me out when I first took on a general duties  some of the bolder spirits clearing off from duty but am pleased to be able to say I won without having to wheel anyone  If I tell a man to do a job now I can expect to see it done which is more than can be said always &amp; I don't think I've got the men against me, at least I've never heard of any calling me a B.F. illegitimate ? which is the usual form of endearment used by Australians when annoyed.</p>
<p>Wednesday 16th August<br/>Orderly Serg. after a spell of 3 days.  Things very quiet during the day.  At the roll call at night the officer concerned in last night's business spoke to the men &amp; cautioned them telling them that he wished them to "play the game" as he did, whereupon one chap said out loud that he (the officer) had never done so</p>
