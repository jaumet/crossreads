  
 24/11/17 Mt Kemmell Most men on fatigue during the morning and a great deal of loafing going on - some of the young officers are very pussy to the old type. Lewis gunners doing live firing into the base of the hill. This pretty little ridge has been a picnic place and on top is a lookout from which you can look for miles over country that is a dead level. After lunch went down to Kemmel village and played the 58 Batt. football. A good crowd. Went down to Col Denehy's mess and found them comfortable. They treated us at the Canteen - very hospitable and kind. A dull day with bleak cold wind as we came back along the pretty winding road through the hill. Colonel Miles General Staff was round during morning & the D.A.D.M.S during the afternoon. A good battalion concert in the evening with plenty of talent in the Cinema Hall. Pte Larry Herz late Blane Holt as stage manager.
