  
 of Australian troops being conveyed to the front in motor busses. All forces, reserves & transports are converging on the Ypres sector, & as the Artillery is already in position, it would seem as if the battle will come off in a few days. 
 19 September  Headquarters acquainted me late last night that the Battle will take place tomorrow, so Bean, Wilkins & self set off at 1 pm to take up suitable positions for the great event tomorrow. Bean who learns all information at Headquarters informed me that we are undertaking a new system of attack. At 5 am the Artillery will all simultaneously open a barrage on the front Boche lines for a period of an hour or so. This is intended to engage his artillery & demoralise them: the machine guns will play on his infantry.  At a specified time the barrage will be lifted & our troops will dash over into the enemy's lines.
