<p>We are wondering when our next orders will come to move.  I have never known so many orders to be issued and cancelled as has been the case during the last few days.</p>
<p>A little gas shelling this evening.</p>
<p>1st Sept.</p>
<p>The 14th Brigade attacked and captured Peronne this morning about 4.30 A.M.  Prisoners surrendered freely and all seem to be "fed up".</p>
<p>1 p.m.  We moved again about 1000 yards nearer the Somme.  We are to expect orders to cross the River this afternoon.  We anticipate a "sticky" time.</p>
<p>2nd</p>
<p>3.30 A.M.  We moved from our position and crossed the Somme about 4.30 A.M.</p>
