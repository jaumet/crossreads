Got to Port Adelaide at 6 A.M. A splendid wharf here. We were allowed ashore to play cricket and football. I walked a couple miles to the city and had a look around. Managed to get a ride back to the ship at Port Adelaide on a goods train. Adelaide strikes me as a pretty little city, must get a better look at it some day. The ship sailed at 5 P.M.

Good weather and a smooth sea; so we had fire drill today. Everyman was allotted his position in the boats and detailed to his fire station. Then a blast on the steam siren and a furious ringing of the ship's bell was the signal to get a life belt and get into position.
