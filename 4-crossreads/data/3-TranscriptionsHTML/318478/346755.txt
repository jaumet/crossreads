<p>Cairo<br/>June 3rd 1919</p>
<p>My dear wife &amp; twice Mother by the gifts of God and humble co-operation.</p>
<p>We are again to become Heroes &ndash; I use the plural advisedly, but not in the same sense as used by Royalty nor by the little boy with a worm but in the sense that I am with you or rather what is left of me is with you and the boys included.  The sense <strike>of duty w</strike> of duty is a personality in itself and I am really going up with it to see that it does its best.</p>
<p>Two hefty henchmen, tried &amp; hardbitten scouts, go with me so I am alright &amp; possibly will regain my health &amp; optimism.</p>
<p>I would like to rub my beard against your very soft cheek by way of benediction but bully &amp; biscuit will have to do.</p>
<p>I leave Cairo within two hours returning from the blue within two weeks.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
