March 1918Had a sleep after dinner and about 3.30 Long & myself went out to Heliopolis & had afternoon tea with Mrs & Miss Curtis.  They are very nice people being friends of Mr & Mrs Gunn of Alexandria.  It was them that wanted us to call.  We went on to Briggs where we had a nice dinner & lefty for home at about 10.30.  There was a terrible crowd in Cairo.  Sunday night is the night most people seem to go to the pictures & other places of amusement.  It was hard making headway through the crowd when we left the tram.
Monday 4thWas quiet busy all the morning.  The warm weather makes one lazy & inclined to sleep.  It is quite a custom here to sleep after lunch.  All the shops close till 3 & 3.30.  We dont start work till 5 pm, so manage to get in a decent sleep if we want to.  During the hot weather people shutter up their houses during the day
