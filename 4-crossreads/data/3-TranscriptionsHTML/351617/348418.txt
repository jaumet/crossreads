Leave &ndash; It did not seem possible, as I had long ago forgotten what freedom felt like, but never-the-less on the 27th at 6 pm I left Scottish Lines and walked to Popringe to catch the leave train at 1 am for Boulogne.</p>
<p>It was an awful cold trip going down and when we did reach Boulogne at 12 noon the same day it was only to find the boat did not go till next day.
