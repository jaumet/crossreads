Wednesday 21st November 1917
Anchored off Portland or Weymouth since early morning - the same spot the HOS: ship S.S. "LETITIA: anchored 1 year ago - she is now down in Halifax - [indecipherable]. We have passengers for Mesopotamia, Bombay, China, Colombo & Port Said - 7 women all told mostly nurses.
Got a Paper today & I see our men are close to Jerusalem.
Well I'm out of it for the present anyway.
