<p>Out in the Dust<br/>Oct 23rd 1917</p>
<p>Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines to let you know that I am quite well &amp; trust that you are both the same. Well I received the parcel you sent yourself &amp; was very pleased with every thing that I found in it, especially those thick cakes of chocolate &amp; the dryed fruit, thank very much for sending it. I have not received Nell's parcel or the one that Rodgers sent for you yet but expect that they will come along later.</p>
<p>The nights are getting cold now, &amp; we have had no rain yet I am pleased to say. There is really nothing in the line of news that I can tell you this time, but I am sure that I will be able to write you some very interesting letters, when I am next writing, which I suppose will not be for a little while yet, as we will have no chance of writing, owing to being very buissy. I do not know when I will get my leave now, as all leave is stoped for the present time.</p>
<p>Well I am pleased to hear you say that your eyes are getting better. I recieved one letter from Mrs. Birt Bilney but it was a fairly old one. I had just written a few lines to her. My word hasn't Charlie got on well, its to be hoped that he has the luck to get through safely &amp; Jim also. I expect you must have recieved a good many Photos that I have sent you by this time. I do not know when we will have the luck to get any mail from home again.</p>
<p>Ray Norrish has gone into the Hospital with Tonsilitus, but there is nothing seriously wrong with him.</p>
