 Tuesday 21 
 Spent the morning in fiddling  about which means doing nothing.  Apparently the authorities are going to depart their usual custom & get us off as arranged. 
 Oh dear no. No such thing. "A.M.C. go to Anzac  eventually"  tomorrow possibly but no earlier. Did my washing tonight after putting it off & off. 
 Had some fun with the boys in the afternoon [indecipherable] the present moment my Birkenhead friend is waiting for a yarn.
