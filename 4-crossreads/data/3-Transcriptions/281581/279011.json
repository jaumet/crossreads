<p>24th Jany  1918</p>
<p>Spent day in darkroom and developed 50 plates all of which were successful. Musical evening with much life in Mess. Glorious Calm weather.</p>
<p>25th Jany /18<br/>Up at 6 am and off to Ramleh, where at the present time a huge dump  of materials is accumlated and distributed. The materials are brought in by camels from the rail-head near Dieren and from the coastal landing at Sukerier. Great strings of camels miles long, heavily laden, discharge their cargos daily, and present such a scene of life and bustle, winding in and out among the Cactus hedges and across the dusty plain as I have never seen before. Over 8,000 animals</p>
