Oct 30th :-Awoke about 5 am. Land very close on both sides & very pretty view. Reach Suez about 7 - am & anchor in bay. We now have a good chance of seeing the town & country &  through binoculars the Port appears to be of good size &  the buildings decidedly oriental, with here &  there one of more western type. A transport with Queensland troops aboard is here before us &  cheering is given from both   An auxiliary  cruiser    &  a Battleship are anchored close to the entrance of the canal  Cheating traders in their bum-boats are continually alongside trying to sell & are as often hosed with fire hoses by our fellows. Most amusing to see them annoyed. Country here is rugged, sandy &  dry. Not a sign of vegetation, though delicately tinted. Most interesting day closes with the assurance of landing to-morrow & train to Cairo.
