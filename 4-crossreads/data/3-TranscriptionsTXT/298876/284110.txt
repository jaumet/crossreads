 L.H.F.A. 
 Twas on a bright January day The Good ship Wandilla sailed away From Pinkenba that place that smells Away they went to the Dardanelles The last of the 14th L.H.F.A. 
 A little band of 8 were they With a motto of P.O. each day And a happy day it will be When they reach the shore of Gallipoli 
 The last of the 14th 2nd L.H.F.A. A soft spot they had for their officers fine As well as for comrades left behind in the line And respect they are held by each of the 8 Will be stronger than even when they reach Berlin 'Gates" By the last of the 14th L.H.F.A. 
 Left home for Alarayt
