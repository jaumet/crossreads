<p>When the bombardment subsided we found ourselves without food and consequently we had to find headquarters and obtain some. To another man and myself, it fell our lot to go for the rations, and what we did get was the leavings of the biscuit tin, which was of course better than having nothing.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Australian and British Artillery had come to a position where they could effectively bombard the Germans, who had settled in Loupart Wood with the intention of resisting our attack and stemming our advance. Loupart Wood was on the crest of a high rise some 2,000 yards in front of us and we could plainly see each shell which our guns sent over, burst and send up a cloud of earth and other debris.<br/> By evening our guns drove the Germans over the crest of the Hill, and we &ndash; in the Infantry followed up closely on the enemy's retreating out- posts with the gratifying result the we consolidated our position just before we reached the crest of the Hill.

<p>Once on the duckboard track we made good progress, and were back at camp having a hot breakfast at 10.30 a.m. This camp was Scotts Redoubt of which I have already made mention, and while there we saw several air- fights. I saw four or five British planes brought to the ground on one afternoon by the Germans, and the Germans suffered no loss whatever. This was at the particular time when it was admitted by the British, that their airforce was inadequate to cope with the Germans'. On another occasion I saw a German plane drop an incendiary bomb on to a balloon which was up in the air for observation purposes and  bring it to the ground in flames.</p>
<p>Another interesting occurrence that took place was an air fight between a British and a German plane, when the gunner in the</p>
