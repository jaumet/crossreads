  
 I was even too tired to read them. Of course our underclothes are one mass of chats. 27th October, Friday.  A new idea to day, we will work 48 hours stretcher bearing & have 24 hours off, rather to long for me. Fortunately our party did not proceed far, but stopped at the first post for 24 hours, plenty of work, we were nearly frozen during the night.

Slept in an old German dug-out nearly all day, it contained straw bunks & of course they were alive with vermin. At 5 p.m. we were relieved & we started on that dreadful walk back again, luckily we arrived at
