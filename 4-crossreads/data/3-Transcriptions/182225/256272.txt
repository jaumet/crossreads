<p>JUNE &nbsp; SATURDAY 3 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>A beautiful fine warm day and land at last. We sighted it about 11 AM and we steamed into Durban and moored on South side of the river (Berea) about 1 pm. We got shore leave from about 3 pm till 10.30 pm &nbsp;Warren Hunters &amp; Self had tea at the Royal Hotel and then we met Harry Truman in a car and went all over the place with him. Went round the beach (Marine Parade) &amp; had tea again there, then went round the Berea and out to Umgeni about 5 miles out and had some soft drinks &nbsp;The bars are not allowed to serve anybody in uniform with any intoxicating liquors at all, and its about the best thing that could be done, pity they would not do it in Australia</p>
