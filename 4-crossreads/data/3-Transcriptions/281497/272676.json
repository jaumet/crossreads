<p>Tommy clothing come in, but the boys practically refused to wear it, we all prefer our own Australian clothing even though it may be all dirty torn, &amp; ragged</p>
<p>A couple of new officers knocking about tonight.</p>
<p>Went for a walk as far as Canaples tonight it is a very pretty little place &amp; well worth the trouble, you can also buy daily papers there.</p>
<p>We will be sleeping without our blankets tonight, so it will be very cold, they have taken them away to the transports, so that means that we will be shortly moving to somewhere, Thiepal I guess, at any rate she is</p>
