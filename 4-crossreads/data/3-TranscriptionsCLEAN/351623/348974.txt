  
 4 April 16 Got under weigh at 6 a.m. & proceeded down the coast of St Lucia, a few miles, to the assistance of a small steamer the Taff that had run up on the beach, near a small fishing village. She has run well up on the beach & all our our attempts to shift her have failed so far. Are going to try again to night at high tide. 
 5 April 16 Still standing by endeavouring to get the Taff off the beach. Received a mail aboard the ship today, did not receive any myself. Received word today, aboard the ship, that one of our shipmates, that we left in Bermuda, had been killed on the HMAS Sydney. He run amok & a sentry stabbed him with a bayonet. Also received word that a Ldg Signalman that had left the ship, & with the men returning to Australia, had died in London.
