"Boy" at the Adelphi tonight.
Went early to Laura's Hospital & took her some Carnations - 6 Pink, 6 White - cost 5/-!!!, give you an idea of value here.
Laura could talk but her throat was sore. Met Brace & young Charlie at Liverpool Railway Station & went theatre tonight with Dolly - as you must think am not saving much L.S.D.
