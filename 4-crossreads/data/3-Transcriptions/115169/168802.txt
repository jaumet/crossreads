<p>April 27th [1915]  a report was intercepted by wireless from Washington to the effect that "Kronprinz Wilhelm" owing to 60 of her crew being on sick list, and so causing shortage in her crew, it was not considered by her captain as advisable to attempt to break thru British cordon of warships  awaiting outside, he therefore decided to intern.</p>
<p>April 28th  Official notification of the foregoing was received by us per wireless, in consequence of which we were ordered to proceed to Bermuda to coal and so we departed from Hampton Road at 6 A.M.  We were all keenly disappointed over this incident but it was only to be expected</p>
<p>April 30th  at 6 A.M. we arrived at Bermuda and dropped anchor outside, - our flagship "Leviathan" was also laying at anchor, whilst the "Suffolk" was then out of dock, completing her refit &ndash; The S.S. "Ampleforth" collier, came up alongside of us, also the oiltank steamer "Unio" and provision boats, consequently we were all kept  very busy this day.  At 12.30 PM S.S. "Unio" left us, and at 6 PM our collier departed, we then washed down the ship</p>
