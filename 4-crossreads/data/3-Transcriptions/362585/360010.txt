<p>[Transcriber's note:  This is page 2 of letter]<br/>he is looking splendidly well.  We were so surprised to see him looking like that having heard that he was so badly hurt.  He has a slight scar on the side of his head which the hair is quickly covering &amp; has still very little feeling down his right side but he says that it is getting better each day.  He could give us a very <u>hearty</u> hand shake.  The only thing is that every now &amp; then he forgets a word.  This does not seem to worry him at all, he makes quite a joke of it.</p>
