<p>As the sick parade is coming down (one line blacked out by censor)... present abode) I must draw this to a close. There were (one word blacked out by censor).. on the parade yesterday and this ( one line blacked out by censor)...<br/>With the best of wishes for the new year and love to all at home and next door<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene.</p>
<p>P.S. I received the parcel with the knee pads, soap and tinned Pat&eacute; and it was very welcome. The soap was particularly useful and the paste was delicious and a welcome change from bread and jam. The photo of Kit was a very good one. She no longer looks like a flapper and has developed into quite a handsome young lady. I also received Aunt Kate's note and was glad to hear that they are all well. I submitted it to our interpreter but he said he didn't think it was French although it might be the patois of some of the country centres.<br/>Tell her it as much as I can do to get off</p>
