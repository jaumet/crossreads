 31 Monday I don't think I mentioned before that pennies &amp; half-pennies are in great circulation here 3d pieces being practically extinct.  We do an hours physical drill before breakfast now, which at first  seems  was very fatiguing.  Stretcher drill indulged in in the morning, &amp; we were informed to prepare ourselves for a big route march in the afternoon, but we didn't go very far  when we had over an hours spell &amp; then returned. 
 1 August  Tuesday The weather now is beginning to get very hot a bath during the evening is a refreshing luxury indulged in by a great number.  We have a very boozy mob in the hut now.  very seldom  it is a rare occasion for some to come home sober.  Today was the first time I have attended a lecture since leaving Aust  Went on sick parade for dental reason in the morning 
 2 Wednesday Doing stretcher drill all the morning &amp; went on a route match during the afternoon.  Stretcher drill being given so frequently is getting intolerable to all, but the route marches are liked much better, we only go about half a mile &amp; lay down in the shade of a large hedge until it is time to come back.
