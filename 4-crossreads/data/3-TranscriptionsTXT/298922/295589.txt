 Friday 5th October 1917 
 Still on board, a week today &ndash; but we hope to disembark at noon &ndash; travelling is not easy in War time  &amp; the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YELLOW JACK makes it more difficult.  
 5 miles by Tug to a Rest Camp then we carried our own luggage to the train with rations &amp; water. Got off at 8 p.m. 5 Officers in a compartment. I slept on the floor. All along Adriatic Coast the same foliage as Peninsular viz., Olives, etc. Women on duty at Cross roads &amp; in the fields.
