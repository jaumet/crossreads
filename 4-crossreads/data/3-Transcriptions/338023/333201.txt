<p>The thing however you will be glad to know is that the quarantine yarn was a bit late. That was lifted some time back.</p>
<p>Very busy getting fixed up. For goodness sake send me the address of some people in Melbourne. I don't care even if its only a chow or a policeman &ndash; so long as its somewhere  <strike>that</strike> I can stop when on week-end leave. Melb. hotels charge 2/6 bed &amp; 1/6 meals &amp; we're only getting 2/- per day. Rail fare 4/2 is another item.</p>
