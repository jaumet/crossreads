<p>September 10th Monday<br/>Not a bad day. Feeling very sick, I have rather a heavy cold, &amp; a terrible head-ache. Rumor of a boat-roll coming out on Friday. Supposed to be fourteen hundred on it. Went to a place called Weston, it is right on the end of this Island, &amp; is about four miles away. We were very tired when we came back.</p>
<p>Tuesday Sept 11th<br/>We were all called out for our pay books again today, &amp; still mine has not yet come back. My word I was wild too. The Sergeant promised to try &amp; get it for me. Went to a concert in the Gym. The party was from Bournemouth &amp; wasn't too bad either.</p>
<p>Wednesday Sept 12th<br/>We have a route march every morning now &amp; sometimes of an afternoon. We generally go on the same route every day, a distance I suppose of about 3 miles.<br/>320 came into camp this afternoon, there are now about 2500 in camp here. It is just about full now. Went and had a look at the Easton gaol this evening, but there was nothing to see bar a very high stone wall.</p>
