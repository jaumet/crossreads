1916   FRIDAY 30   JUNE
A cool day, owing to a nice breeze. We went into the harbour again about 10 oclock and took on a couple of hundred tons of coal. Was on duty - troop deck picket - all day. It was washing day so we had no parades. The HMS Kent made off about 6.30 pm and then the HMS Swiftsure got moving and we all filed out after them, the A8 leaving Dakar harbour about 7 pm just at dusk. It is very fresh at sea, but everybody glad to get moving again & nobody anxious to see Dakar again.
