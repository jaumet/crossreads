 Monday 24 December 
 Off Duty today.  Today and the next two days are general holidays for the troops.  The snow &amp; ice are beginning to thaw.  Preparations for tomorrows spread are on a large scale.  Turkeys, Geese &amp; Fowls, Vegetables etc. from Boulogne are being bought out of Canteen profits &amp; Reg. Funds.  About &pound;80 is being spent Christmas Eve tonight. We strolled up to see our friends near Cremarest.  Very pleasant evening and a beautifully clear night.
