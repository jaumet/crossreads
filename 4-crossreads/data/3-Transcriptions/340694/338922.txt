<p>37<br/>here at Senlis as a billet couldnt be found for us in Albert. I went in with the Colonel the other day in the car to have a look round. The beautiful town is a wreck, they continue to shell it periodically. I saw the lovely Church with its' steeple all damaged. The statue of the Virgin Mary at the top was hanging over pointing to the ground. We went through the town and called at the Tramway which conveys rations etc to the lads in the trenches manned by our horses &amp; men. They have a very risky job &amp; already one chap has been wounded, while several horses have gone under.</p>
