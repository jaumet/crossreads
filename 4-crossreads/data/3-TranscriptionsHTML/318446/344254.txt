<p>there cannot be much doing out there, even though it is in the front line.  Read a delightful book the other day of Ireland &amp; hunting by Dorothy Congers called "The Arrival of Antony", made me quite homesick for the East Devon &amp; Woodbury Castle.

<p>Kilo 139, March 18th<br/>Had three very good days for the journey &amp; arrive at El Arish tomorrow.  Bernard has improved wonderfully in fact it must have been exercise he lacked.<br/>Yesterday a Taube went over us &amp; we knew nothing about it until we reached here today (fortunately or I should have had the palps).<br/>The desert is very pretty now in one or two little odd corners, as all the sheltered slopes are a mass of dandelions white &amp; yellow daisies &amp; stunted poppies making a very pretty scene.</p>
