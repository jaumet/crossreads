the Germans front line about 3.30 on the morning of the 23rd & was here in bed at 6.30 on 24th & had an operation performed at a Hospital on the way down. The distance is over 120 miles, excellent hospital train service.On account of strict censorship I will not give you any details of our attack, no doubt the papers will have full detail. Our boys did excellently & I am afraid lost heavily the shell fire was terrific although ours predominated, by gum dear things are moving here now, old England is all out to win & looks all out a winner, the boys are all cheerful & talk about the "Big Push" as if it was nothing, all knowing it is sure death to the most of them. As usual I wasnt in the scrap long so didnt see much. It is funny how I get knocked every time quickly, & in the thighs too no doubt I am lucky. I am not writing to Mother today so let her know the news & my loveKen
