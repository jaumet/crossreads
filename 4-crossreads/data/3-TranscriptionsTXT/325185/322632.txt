be abel to get anything until we are paid at the end of month. Yesterday was pay day in camp but not for our crowd. We have to wait until the 30th.There is another thing I want badly Father that is a small tin box I can lock. one about fifteen inches long would do just to put a few shirts & things in.You see the shops are closed Saturday evening so wont be abel to get myself.Have applied for the week end leave from 12 oclock saturday until sunday night dont know how I will get on yet.Well hope to see you on Friday or before drop a line & let me know for certain.Love to all. Your sincere sonClyde
