  
 August, 1917. Monday 13 Fine day. Marching order at 8.30 and helped drivers to clean up & inspected there by General Lavinia. C.R.E. & staff captain Waited some time while inspection was on and a parley afterwards In afternoon some squad drill and lecture on German fortifications. In evening went on leave to Vieux Berquin & home at 8. Not very interesting.
