 Belah April 2nd 17 
 Dear old Mater, 
 Must send you a few lines now that opportunity offers.  We have not had much time for writing of late, in fact have had a very strenuous, &amp; dirty, tho' exciting time. 
 They managed to get a mail through to us last night.  I got a letter from you, one from Phyllis, a photo of Wilma from Syd. also the parcel which was sent back to Aust. &amp; one from Tasmania.  Sorry to hear of your bad knee &amp; hope it is well again now. 
 No doubt you have read something of our doings here during last week.  But I will tell you what I  rember  can of it from memory. 
 We left Abu Shunnai on Sunday 25/4/17 at 2 a.m. &amp; marched towards Gaza.  Reached Belah at about noon  on Monday  &amp; camped.  Thousands of infantry, Light Horse, Cavalry, camel corps, artillery, transports, red cross carts etc. all on the march presented a wonderful spectacle. (when one could see through the dust)
