<p>1919<br/>June 2<br/>my train at 5.5 pm, but discovered that it did not go until 7 pm.  Met Don McKinnon &amp; had tea with him.  We arrived at Weymouth at about 11 pm &amp; were put into huts.</p>
<p>June 3/28<br/>The next day 3 June &ndash; education classes started.  I saw that the classes held possibilities of dodging "fatigue", so pulled on Motor Engineering.  To my regret however, we still had to do fatigue until our Sgt instructor made a fuss &amp; got us exempt.  The classes were very interesting &amp; I picked up a fair amount of theoretical information regarding motor engines &amp; magnetos.  The troops generally were becoming very fed up.  Different stories were started every day about our sailing date.  Nearly everyone was short of cash, &amp; our only amusement was to walk along the promenade, &amp; go to our "buckshee" picture show.  The latest "furphy" was that we were to go on the Port Melbourne on July 2nd.</p>
<p>June 28<br/>Peace was signed at 3 pm.  Don McKinnon, Fred Cawsey, &amp; I went out in</p>
