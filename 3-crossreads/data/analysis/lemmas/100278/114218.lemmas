 Spent the greater part of my time today help the Tommi out with their bog team , they are absolut no class for the Australian as far as hors go , as soon as ever a Tommi get stuck the first thing he doe is to lay into his hors for all he is worth and in 9 case out of 10 it is over the hors head that he bring his whip . I do n't like skite but I think I open a few of their eye today as far as handl hors and bog team go . I saw a fine piec of horsemanship this afternoon on the part of a few Australian , they had a coupl of G.S. waggon heavili laden with corn and chaff for some of the hors just here and they had to come through some of the awfullest ground imagin , up to the mule
