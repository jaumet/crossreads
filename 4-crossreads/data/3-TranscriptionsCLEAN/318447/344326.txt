  
 Nov 16th Outside Jaffa. 
 The last two days have been very quiet, we did not get woken up by shells after all, as the Turks departed in the night. 
 We stayed most of the next day at Deiran eating up big on the wheaten loaves of bread which we bought there, & then came on to Ramleh which is a large but very dirty town with only one or two large buildings in it. We passed through that
