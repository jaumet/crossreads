FEB.   SATURDAY 26   1916
Fine & cooler. I was on Cook's fatigue all morning and got leave till 6 pm but did not go back till late. Had dinner with Spes Wharton at Petty's and Came on over to Lisheen. Had a yarn with Linda on tennis court. She said "that anything she asked me to do was not worth doing". Altho' in a few things that may appear to be the case on the surface, I think that she knows it is not really the case. I often could have done things in town but I came over here instead, so in a way I am in the wrong. Anyway it hurt, whether I am right or wrong.
