<p>Fine &amp; warm. Shore leave was</p>
<p>granted. We got into the wharf</p>

<p>right away. Got off at 10.30 AM</p>
<p>and went up town with L<sup>t</sup>&nbsp;Morcombe</p>
<p>met L<sup>ts</sup>&nbsp;Jeffries &amp; Smith &amp; went out</p>
<p>to Haupt Bay &amp; back round</p>
<p>Table Mountain &amp; Groote Shuur.</p>
<p>Called in to get a feed of grapes</p>
<p>on the way home and struck</p>
<p>some jolly fine prople - the Betrams</p>
<p>&amp; spent the afternoon with them.</p>
<p>Had dinner at the Grand Hotel</p>
<p>&amp; went to &quot;The French Maid&quot; after</p>
<p>but could only sit out the first</p>
<p>act &amp; then came home to bed.</p>
