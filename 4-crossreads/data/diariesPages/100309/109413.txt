21/6/17 Beulencourt
Our outposts last night got soaked to the skin but were very cheerful and held up all traffic in their practice sector bottling Col. Annan of the Pioneers for a time. Some of parties were "stalking" one another until late hours. Great interest being taken in this tactical work by everyone. The Battalion moved out at noon to carry out battle practice in musketry but orders were issued prohibiting ball firing which many thought would make a farce of the show. However by preparing surprise targets to encourage rapid sight setting, judging distance and trying fire control and orders, tackling strong posts etc. the time was spent with profit. At 2.30 adjourned to 23rd officer's mess for discussion conducted by General on yesterday's operation and from there over the fields to a lecture by signals on the amplifier and power buzzer. General Smythe and many gilded staff folk turned up to this. Thwaites lectured on the Lewis gun in battle after mess.
