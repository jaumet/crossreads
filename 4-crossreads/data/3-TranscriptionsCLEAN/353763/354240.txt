  
 Friday Oct 16th We arrived at Suva about 1 pm yesterday  15th   -  From quite early in the morning heavy tropical rain fell & with interruptions it has continued to the present  -  It looks like an early rainy season  -  We followed our leader --The Encounter   -  & anchored by our old friend the Sydney  -  The fleet lay all around us & the big Frenchman   -  the Montcalm - with his guns stuck out was there too  -  Shortly after we anchored AE2 came alongside & then we found that she had lost a blade from her starboard propeller & at once preparations were started to put a new propeller on & remove the old one  -  All was well we heard  -  Tahiti had been shelled by the Germans & the cable at Fanning Island destroyed  -  We had heard a rumor of this before  -  The bombardment of defenceless Tahiti was loudly condemned on all hands  -  Pure savagery to bombard such a beautiful spot  -  There's a paper here - the Fiji Times - we got news from that  -
