<p>I cut my finger (little one) pretty severely today on a piece of tin &amp; tonight it is very painful &amp; hot hope it dont get bad on me, I also have a heavy cold in the head but Thank Goodness it has not settled on my chest</p>
<p>You wouldn't believe what a difficulty we have in keeping any thing here for the rats, the place simply swarms with them, &amp; they are so bold that they will scarcely get out of your way, they tear great holes in your blankets &amp; eat your clothes &amp; equipment, even while you are lying down in them of a night, &amp; when you are sleeping they simply run all over you</p>
