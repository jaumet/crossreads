I'm only a trooper, and some many English people over here are such snobs. I fell terribly frightened. It is really very funny though is it not? but it seems really tragic to me just now. I'll keep this letter till tonight and tell you what happens.
Next Morning
Every thing in the garden is lovely. I called on Mrs Trelawny yesterday afternoon and she is a nice lady and she did not think I was a Major. She thought I said I knew Major Wilson. I had afternoon tea there and met a couple of officers wives and they all were very nice and I enjoyed the sfternoon very much. I went and saw Jim Leask in the evening. He is still waiting for a boat to take him home. He gave me his address and offered to go and see you but I told him I did not know when you would be in Sydney. His address is L J U Leask Leacholme Boyle Street Cremorne
Just at the foot of Spofforth Street
Love to Father and the boys & yourself. I am Your loving Son Robert C Wilson
