<p>Somewhere in France.<br/>2nd April 1916</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I am writing this under a new heading   We left Egypt about a fortnight ago &amp; had a good trip up the Mediterranean.  I saw both Walter &amp; Ol whilst I was in Cairo prior to leaving, &amp; among the first persons I saw on the wharf when we landed in France was Rid.  I could only spare him 5 minutes &amp; he was looking well.  We left Alexandria on [date obliterated by censor] by the [vessel name obliterated]   We had one Submarine scare coming over when one of the transports of the convoy fired 2 shots at a box they saw floating  On the [date blanked out] we received the S. O. S message that the "Mineapolis" sent out when she was torpedoed.<br/>We put in at Toulon, &amp; I was greatly pleased with what we saw of it from the boat.  We only stayed there 24 hours &amp; then cast off again.  The last bit of the trip was pretty rough &amp; nearly all of us were sick.  I thought once or twice my heart would come up.  As far as we have seen of France it is a lovely climate.  We have had a good bit of rain, but the countryside is looking perfect   Everywhere the fruit trees are out in blossom, &amp; the fields are crowded with grasses &amp; clover.  The people are very obliging but it is rather comical sometimes trying to make ourselves understood.</p>
