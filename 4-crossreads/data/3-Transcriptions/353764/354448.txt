<p>sandstorm which last on &amp; off for 40 days.  When the Clouds of Sand approach everything goes Black as night.  It smothers every thing in fine sand  makes things very unpleasant.  I hope it drops to-morrow.<br/>I am expecting the riding Horses in to-morrow &amp; am on the look out for one for myself as I can not trust the one I have now at night.</p>
<p>14.4.16 Friday  15.4.16 Saturday<br/>Nothing of any note occured to break the monotony.  We are still at Racecourse &amp; I understand our Colonel is fighting hard to stay here until we have to embark so as to have only one move.<br/>We all naturally hope he is able to fight them on the subject.<br/>I have a new Horse now but do not like her as much as my former one.<br/> I rode over Pont De Koubbeh last night &amp; it was a perfect moonlight night just as you see in Biblical Scenes.</p>
