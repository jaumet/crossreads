will only put me in position where will be possible to put for the effort, and direct others to do the same it may be that a useful time is ahead of me.  In this rotten show, nothing can be done on account of the puerility & ignorance of my chief.  Like all dear kind good creatures of the class, he spends most of his time flattering himself.  Between him and the ignorant egotistical dirty ill mannered coarse voiced little commedian who is next in rank after me in the show, my place is not one to be envied.  Mostly has my mouth been shut, as a voice producing emitting cavity, at meals and between times, a line of conduct for which I am becoming more thankful each day, because its effect is now being felt, and if it be that the General leaves me with the unit my prestige will improve and matters will be better.  God giving me health and strength I shall pull through all right, but much precious time is wasted when one has to battle against ignorant lazy incompetence, it is always a dead weight dragging upon the best of intentions, more especially so in war time when anything may happen, & where the opportunities are rapid and must be grasped as they are rushing past.
At the end of the week arrangments are being made for me to give a lecture at the medical school in Cairo, and all being favourable it may be that the affair will pass off well, anyhow you shall hear further about it.
Good night!  Good night!!!  Good night!!!!![A line of Xs and Os.] Car. [A line of Xs and Os.] Joe. [A line of Xs and Os.] Kit
