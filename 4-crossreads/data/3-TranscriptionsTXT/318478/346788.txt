At this I have to pull myself together and a disappointment namely the Cold Fact in capital letters that I do not get away tomorrow.  Some of my best Pals go on the Boat ("Juliana") but I am high & dry B B & B Far From Home & restless and must face another week without grousing & take my chance - I am booked for a ship seven days from now and she does the all sea route & saves myself, my (escarrie) esquarie, offsider, my work a certain amount of knocking about, and further there is the evidence in me that I retain of the Desire to play the game as there was at Moascar, and one must not give in, so 'stay with him lad'.[Drawing]Yours EverG.W.
