<p>My Dear Judge</p>
<p>I have just received the news that Arthur has been killed. It is useless for me to try to express my sympathy you know just how I feel for you all. Poor Mrs Ferguson I hope she is strong enough to bear it as bravely as the rest of our wonderful women seem to at home.</p>
<p>I am as well as ever, and am enjoying myself in between   [indecipherable] very well. The French people are wonderful. They are perfectly happy in all their troubles &amp; their hospitality is immense.</p>
<p>It is great to be mixed up in a stunt like this and to see the way all the wheels work. The amount of movement is more than you can imagine and everything seems to go like clockwork</p>
<p>We are constantly on the move from Billet to Billet to   [indecipherable] &amp;  back</p>
