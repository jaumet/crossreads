<p>purpose sending over another Draft. &nbsp;It will not be amiss, and it&#39;s handy to be able to put my hands on it if wanted at stosh call. No, no sight of any leave yet.</p>
<p>You left the stock-taking a bit late this time. &nbsp;It&#39;s just as well to keep it as near 4th March as you can, as of old.</p>
<p>Well, there&#39;s not much more to mention. &nbsp;I hope you are in the best of nick, and keeping things going cheerfully at home.</p>
<p>Fondest regards,</p>
<p>Your loving cousin,</p>
<p>Jim</p>
