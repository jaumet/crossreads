I obtained leave inspected Abbeville last night.It is like a lot of other Towns in France very gay"The whole population have drifted back one cannot help but admire their pluck when you think that the firing line is not far distant German Aeroplanes are always trying to bomb them.They treat us well, will do anything for us. Some of them are haughty, but they are a decided minority.It is from this region that the Germans drove all the prisoners into Germany, the females bear striking proof of the way they were treated when the Bosches were driven backThere are anti-aircraft Guns posted all round the City they give the Bosches some trouble when they visit this regionWe are going to equip tomorrow within a very short time start on a 5 days trek to the base of operations centered on Lille. This town is our objective one which from all accounts our side is very anxious to obtain as it is an important Railway Junction.It is still impossible to write but I will complete
