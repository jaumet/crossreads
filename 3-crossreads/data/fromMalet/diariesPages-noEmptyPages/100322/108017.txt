Marcinelle
At 6 pm Colonel Davis called with sidecar and took me over to Marchienne au Pont where we went to a caf and sat down at a table ? full was the caf. The waitress solemnly brought us our coffee cups full ? of whisky and we as solemnly sipped it. There is much traffic going on between civilians and canteens. Men buy and resell. Went to Dr Hiernaux's and spent a pleasant evening. Alix will be fat later and is petite. The Madame laughs insincerely. Drank wine talked and had some music. Tasted here mint tea for the first time. Left about 10.30 and had a quiet run home ? a fine mild night. Read for a while before going to bed.
