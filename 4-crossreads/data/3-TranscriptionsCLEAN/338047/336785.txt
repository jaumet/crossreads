The weather was now very hot, and orders were issued that we were to parade in shorts and short underpants (white cotton ones). most of the parades were for physical jerks. We made a regular feature of swimming every day in the dam or the Somme Canal. I was still trying to teach Bill Collins to swim.

It was contained in a closed in wagon, and about half a dozen could have a shower at the same time. It was "goodo". We were paraded to have a proper bath, although about this time we were keeping reasonably clean and not so troubled with chats.
