<p>7 September 1918 Saturday   (X to X crossed out)<br/>Thermometer has been over 100&deg; everyday but much cooler than the past month!<br/>Gift stuff from N.S.W. Comfort Fund arrived today &amp; as we have plenty of water we are O.K.  Did I tell you what happened to A.J.C. gifts on July 14: the Germans got them from the 2nd LH &amp; then we took them back again.<br/>X A consignment of BEER has also arrived I am a great believer in letting the men get good "grog" better than [indecipherable] buying poisonous KONIACK of the country.X</p>
