10.12.15I am finishing this letter in Camp having arrived here safely on Monday night. Clive Single was in the train coming up & I saw him at the Continental Hotel the following night.We have been going like mad here since we came back getting the horses ready, regiment made up to strength etc etc. In the reshuffle I went to B Squadron & have a good troop there. First mounted parade this morning & no one fell off. My old horse has been destroyed I have two others but want a third.
I have been in to see Rania both nights in Camp, but am on duty tonight. Got measured for a uniform which is to be finished tomorrow, & some new clothes. There are a cwt of parcels for me, only had time to open an odd, so can only send my general thanks for the lot.  I am going to try & arrange to have them sent on. We are likely to move very soon, no spell for which I am rather pleased as I hate these training camps.Rania looks very well in spite of all her work.These nibs my batman brought are the limit. Have pockets full of letters, but have only had time to glance through them yet.
