  
 Thursday 28th Dec. Nothing to do.  Were to have visited the caves but conveyance not available. Friday 29th Dec. Filling water carts from 280 ft. well.  185 turns of the handle to haul up one bucket.  French Battleplane landed in fields close by unable to face the gale which sprang up.  We had a fine opportunity of viewing the machine.
