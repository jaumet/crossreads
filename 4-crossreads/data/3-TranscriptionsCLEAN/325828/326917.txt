  
 France 25th Apl 1916. 
 My dearest Father, Since I last wrote on 14th inst I have received your letter of 13th Feby.  I must thank you very much for it & also for a parcel of sox I received from you by the same mail (21st inst) To-day is the 1st Anniversary of "Anzac Day" & the troops here show they haven't forgotten.  Since I last wrote I have left my old Unit & am now an orderly to Colonel Sturdee (ADMS) who is a brother to the Admiral.  He is a fine old man & I give him all the attention I possibly can. The weather here seems to have taken a change for the better.  It is typical spring weather now & is quite decent after all the heavy rains we got just after landing in France Where I am at present is quite within sound of the guns & some of them shake the windows etc a good bit when they explode Aeroplane bombardments & duels are of frequent occurrences, & it is quite interesting to watch an aeroplane being shelled. There is a big difference in the marksmanship, our gunners being far superior.
