  
 [30th July contd] in half an hour.  Everything else forgotten we made frantic efforts to get our gear together & in half an hour we were on parade ground in steel hats iron rations water bottle etc & 2 gas masks awaiting instructions.  Even whilst there Fritz's long range gun was putting them into the paddock next door & I can tell you the whizzing of those shells was very unpleasant. We were given 5 minutes to get  a bite & then we pushed off to march the 8 miles to trenches.  Some cursing the Colonel for not providing a waggon but all of good cheer.  It had rained that morning & ground was sloppy - hence the trenches must be worse still. 
 At length we arrived at Kandahar Farm - our H.Q's for the stunt - where an Army Hut chap gave us each a drink of artificial lemonade & a cigarette each (the latter being sent from Queen Mary to the soldiers)  There we were detailed into parties - Gooseberry Farm - German Dugout - Advanced Fanny - Cross Av R.A.P. - Sunken Road (being the different posts in our Sector (the southern sector) 'A' Section had to work the northern sector.  The stunt does not start until 3.50 tomorrow morn,
