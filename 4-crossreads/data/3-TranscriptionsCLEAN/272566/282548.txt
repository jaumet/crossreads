  
 Friday 13 April 
 On Incinerator. Showery weather. Lance Corp. Marlow went to Beaulencourt to Div. Headquarters where Gen. Birdwood presented him with the Military Medal ribbon.  The Tanks have so far been something in the shape of a failure, 6 out of 12 were hit yesterday by direct shots.  Others got caught in Fritz's wires.  4th Division got fearfully cut up at Bullecourt. All this news comes from Gen. Birdwood. Before breakfast this morning we were tramped off on a Route March for half an hour.  We are wondering what officer has gone mad.  Snowing heavily in evening.
