A beautifully mounted triple, all acted together & it went with a swing.   I was supposed to be a chic Parisienne of 30 & Bernard & Whitaker dressed (including the famous "confection" of the English Co. now disguised as a white & sexe "Dolly Varden" chapeau)The doctor (the Italian) pronounced the result "tres elegante!"   Praise indeed!   Nearly had an accident.   Was entering when the hat caught in the damned portiere & cocked over.   I sailed across to a providential mirror and then returned to be "received" by M. le Colonel.
