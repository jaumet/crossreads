little boozer, with the intention of having a bit of fun, we all sat around a big table the mob of us threw in as many francs as would do us for the night, the pile amounted to a bit over 100 francs, the drinks began to circulate freely the call for Madame was very insistent, kept her going filling the glasses, after a while the lads began to mix their drinks, champagne was called for to give the beer stout an extra bight snap this soon settled Pricey for his head began to droop he got sleepy but the majority of the lads stuck it out, I never laughed so much for a long time for I was as sober as could be had only 1 glass of light wine a dash of champagne
