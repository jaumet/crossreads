Our batteries of course are hidden by "camouflage" (mimicry coloring and mimicry generally) as much as possible & never see the object on which they are firing. This  being  is all directed from group headquarters (generally a strong dugout), by telephone to the various battery Commanders. Group headquarters which controls a number of batteries, obtains its range & direction information from aeroplane photographs & maps. The accuracy of their fire is reported by baloon, or plane. Each battery has a small sector for its activity & only operates on that sector.  The value of aeroplane photography is indispensable. Our machines pay dally visits over the bosh lines, & takes these photographs, which are forwarded in very short space of time to the batteries. These photographs, show exactly the results of the fire, & battery positions, without these magnificent records, accurate work would be both tedious & inefficient. I was much interested
