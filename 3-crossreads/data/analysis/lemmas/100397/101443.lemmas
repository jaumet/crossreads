 I think that I will go down to Surrey to Mrs. Horton . She wrote and invit me down there to spend my convalesc period , but that will not be allow . So I will wait until I get my furlough . I believ Wallington Surri is a veri pretti place . So I will have someth to look forward to , we will get 10 day furlough when we are discharg from Hospit . I may be abl to see Eric Elder if he is still with the Battn . The other I will not have a chanc of see if he is still in Egypt anyway I would stand a veri small chanc of see him , for we do not see much of the A.H.S.C. men they are general behind at a good distanc except when on duti . I am glad that I did not get into the A.S.C. now . The artilleri or Engnrs would have suit me but still there is a sport chanc for the " common or garden " Saper The infant . ani way we get plenti of work , and Balli the latter doe not agre with me and the former I begin to like less less , but what is the use of tell the Cap . he would n't believ it realli . I ve got a nice Souvenir of Pozier to send out to John if it get to Austral . safe you will see it if it goe astray , then you will not see it . " That a piec of good solid reason " Say I receiv the letter with account of the lilli and it white bloom yess it is a veri pretti thing and up on Blue Nobbi there are hundr of them . I also receiv a letter from Harri with a Pen ink sketch of a way back
