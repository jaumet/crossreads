<p>is winter.   My promotion to Staff Sgt came out to day being dated back to the 18th December 1917 on which date an order came out affecting the matter.   I now draw 2/6 per day so will feel more comfortable, as since my alteration of allotment last March I have been drawing only 1/- per day which is not enough really for me to carry on with comfortably.</p>
<p>Friday 25 Jan<br/>   A perfect day, bright &amp; sunny, the trees showing the effect of the warm days by commencing to bud, of course a couple of months before their proper time.   Went to Frenck to see a football match in the afternoon, one of the semifinals of the sports conducted in this area.   Our team was known as the No 5 group being chosen from all the technical units of the division.   However only one pioneer was chosen so that the team was practically chosen from the 3 ambulances.   The opponents were the 14th</p>
