 Aug.  7.   We returned to Arques today, marching, in all, about 28 Kilometres. 
 Aug.  8.  A parade was called for today, and we were marched to a lake near by & had a fine swim in it.   The fact that bathing-pants were lacking did not embarrass us in the slightest, indeed it added to the pleasure of the swim.
