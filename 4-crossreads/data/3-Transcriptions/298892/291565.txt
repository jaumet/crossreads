<p>Dear Father and Mother/.<br/>I have just heard that the Mail closes this afternoon and am hurrying off this note to let you know I am all right.<br/>Camp  seems very dull after our holidays in London, although we are having a very easy time now. Any sick men in the Battalion are marched up to shanty to see the Quack at 6.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. We give them whatever treatment he orders mostly only a dose of cough medicine, and any who are really ill are sent off to Hospital right away, so that we have none of the trouble of nursing or feeding sick cases. Most of the Hospitals are chock full of wounded, a number of them Germans. Numbers of German prisoners are arriving in London almost daily now, a great many of them badly wounded, and mostly boys.</p>
<p>During our spare time we go for walks through the neighbouring villages of which there a number within easy walking distance. We are constantly coming upon interesting old buildings and monuments which have stood for centuries. Yesterday I went for a stroll through Durrington and in the middle of the main street we saw a very old stone cross with stone steps leading up to it. We were puzzled as to what it could be for and bailed a passer</p>
