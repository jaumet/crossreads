Morning very cold & heavy fog - mist away & sun out about 9 a.m. During the morning had a ride round the camp lines on our bike. Rumours are about  there  that there will be an early move of Troops from Egypt - I hope we get a move on too. Had a hot bath & shave in "our suite of rooms" upstairs before turning in.
