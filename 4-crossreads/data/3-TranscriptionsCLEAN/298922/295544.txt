 Left Alexandria 8 a.m. arrived KANTARA 6 p.m. & travelled all night in company with Details from my Regiment in Egypt, SCOTCH, WELSH, IRISH, FRENCH, British WEST IndiaN etc:  New Zealanders & Australians more comfort on the train now that it is fitted with Westinghouse BRAKES etc. 
 Mrs. Chisholm at Kantara with Miss McPhellamy are still running the Soldiers Club, which is so much appreciated that the G.O.C. has given it official recognition.
