  
 25-11-16 Tonight; we got in at sundown & are not watering our horses tonight as they had a drink at 3 oclock & the water supply here is not too plentiful yet. After tea Laney & I went down to the Hod where Bde Head Qrs are & heard the Emperor of Austria died a few days ago. A large air raid is expected within the next few days; We are within 22 miles of El Arish here & the maps we have been using are of no further use to us. A few miles to the South of us is a large sandstone ridge which is impassable to troops.The troop of Military Police are attached to Head Qrs at present for rations. No lights are allowed in this Camp after dark. The sand dunes we crossed this afternoon were very steep.
