<p>7th. The morning broke nice &amp; sunny &amp; the weather shows signs of clearing up, I am writing this sitting under one of the great sheds &amp; the sun is pouring down, in the distance Amiens lies a great white patch in a sea of green &amp; she looks very pretty with the <strike>she</strike> sun glistening on the roofs &amp; spires of the buildings while overhead the drone of our planes almost lulls one to sleep so continuous is it, they are there in hundreds coming &amp; going to the line in regular flocks, one Fritz was foolish enough to get a peep at what was going on over our way but he was simply eaten up being rushed at from all directions <br/>Things are very busy round our billet getting ready for the line, there are officers &amp; men about here from all</p>
