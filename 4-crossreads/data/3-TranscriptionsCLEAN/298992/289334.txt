Dear Father,
I received your letter written early in March, yesterday, and was more than glad to get it. You cannot imagine how we all look forward to mail day here, which only occurs once a fortnight.
I'm glad you were all interested in that one of mine written on the Reef, and why I did not mention anything about publishing it, was because I did not think it would be allowed to be put in print. But so many things have happened since then, that all that seems a very long time ago. We have been in Egypt about a fortnight now, and I reckon I have had the stiffest luck of any soldier here - but more of that later.
I think when I last wrote fully we were on board the "Seang Bee" nearing Suez. The trip up the Red Sea was, contrary to expectations, quite the coldest we had experienced since leaving Sydney. I had always thought it was supposed to be very steamy & hot. The nights were really cold & we had to use our blankets the first time for a good while. Well, on arrival at Suez,
