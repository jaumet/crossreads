Flattley he also was going to Paris, so we hopped in the same carriage, but on the way down at Amiens I lost Tom while changing carriages in the crush but expect to pick him up on arrival. 
A funny little thing happened me while waiting at Amiens, I was holding the door of a corridor carriage open looking out for Tom, I noticed a French officer walking up and down, at last he said something to me in French. I could not understand what it was so I says "whats the matter digger" the old boy says, "me no speak" an English officer was standing just close he said to me with a laugh That's a French General you were calling digger" Aussy. not bad was it.
8th. After travelling all night I arrived in Paris at 6.30 It was raining steadily quite dark so I could see very little, a guide met us at the station collected al the new arrivals took us round to the Club which is in an immense beautiful hotel (Hotel Moderne) here we booked our beds
