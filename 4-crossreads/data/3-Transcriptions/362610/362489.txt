<p>Saturday 30 Sept. 1916<br/>Most beautifully clear &amp; fine, thus causing great aeroplane activity. All the morning going round the front line, being again late reaching home for lunch. In the afternoon walked back to the 4th Bn. in reserve, a long tramp over what must have been very fertile fields on each side of the Ypres canal, past lovely chateaux now wrecked &amp; ruined, &amp; through woods &amp; avenues in a similar state. Raiding stunt at night. Watches put back from 1 o'c. to 12 midnight so that we had an extra hour's sleep.</p>
