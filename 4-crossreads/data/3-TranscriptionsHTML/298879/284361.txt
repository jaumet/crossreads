<p>April 1915<br/>Friday 16<br/>Full marching order. Went ashore to practice landing with the third Batt. as advance guard to cover the landing of our Reg. Our Platoon (No 11) were fortunate in having told off as reserves. We sat down and had a good time buying &amp; talking to the people of the Island, until it was time to go back to the boat. Painter broke while being towed by Naval cutter &amp; we had to row in. Had a swim overboard. Water very cold.</p>
<p>Saturday 17<br/>Several boat loads of our Batt &amp; the 3rd went for rowing practice. Beautiful calm day. Did more signalling practice. Many wild rumours going round about Naval &amp; land fights about the Dardanelles. We have physical drill every morning for about half an hour.</p>
