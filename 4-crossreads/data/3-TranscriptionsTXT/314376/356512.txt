201to the bombardment it was suicide to send fatigue parties. Then to make us thirstier the dust from the bombardment got into our throats. It must have been about 30 to 36 hours before any water reached us and then it was only about half a cupful! We did not want much to eat, I notice in cases like this, one always requires water.
It came on to rain one evening, I put on a German coat which I found lying on a trench. Coming round the corner I said "Mercy Kamarades".
They took me for German and it is a wonder that I didn't get a discharge into me as some of the fellows were pretty well worked up.
