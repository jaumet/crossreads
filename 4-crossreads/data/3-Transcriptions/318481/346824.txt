<p>Rest Camp<br/>Marseilles<br/>7/8/19</p>
<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>After a very delightful &amp; peaceful voyage across the Meditteranean the long &amp; rugged arms of Marseilles Harbour enclose us safely;  and with the French green trees &amp; mild sunshine the blue water &amp; cooling breezes one may perhaps for an hour forget.  Forget now for an hour the awful country we have left, I trust for ever as far as I'm concerned.  My health state is good and improving.  This break is annoying but we may resume our journey tomorrow.  I will let you know by wire my progress towards London.  The worst is over &amp; I feel I shall arrive in good trim possibly 4 to 5 days after you receive this.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
