<p>Mch 27 windy this morning.  Land in sight &amp; the boat is beginning to rock a bit. Am on baggage guard again. Arrived Toulon (a French Naval Base) about 21.30. Several other troopships in harbour &amp; of course our old band played its d---dest. Rather a pretty place, especially after Egypt. Background of high hills (or rather mountains) covered for the most part with trees, those directly behind the township proper are of a chalklike formation from about midway to their summits, &amp; on these patches trees do not appear to thrive. Naval workshops extend along a great part of the main water frontage, &amp; Perched on the hilltops are several forts which with aid of W.Qs glasses I was able to see fairly plainly. The harbor mouth is rather narrow &amp; is almost closed by a couple of breakwaters. In all, the scenery reminds one of dear old Sydney. The journey</p>
