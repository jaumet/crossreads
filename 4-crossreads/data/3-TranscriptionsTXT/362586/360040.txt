Dear Mr FergusonI desire to acknowledge your kindness in giving this Presbytry a ring to remind me of the date of embarkation etc.  I had the good fortune to remember what Capt.  [indecipherable] told me &amp; I kept in close touch with the ship's authority so everything was in order about date etc.  For your kindness to me during my stay in camp I offer grateful appreciation.Farewell!Yours faithfully[indecipherable] King
