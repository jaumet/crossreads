<p>last night I was assailed by a Trantula some 4 inches long. They are unpleasant beasts however "da mortuis nil nisi bonum". However he gave me the horrors all right directly after the candle was out. I could see in my fertile brain about five crawling steathily onto me,  &amp;  I would break into a cold sweat  &amp;  light a match. After about an hour  &amp; a box of matches were gone, I arose, took up my bed  &amp;  walked  &amp;  now I live on top of a table in the open.</p>
