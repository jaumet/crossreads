Soon after he was established in the room next to the hospital, containing a bed,  &  table & chair, with mats on the floor, I was sent in with a bottle of Vichy water, so I was able to speak French. He (the General) is an exceedingly polite fellow. Dressed in khaki from head to foot excepting the fanciful tarbush with embroidery which gave a touch of distinction to him. His leggings were worn & clothes slightly war-stained, & his right arm was in a sling.
