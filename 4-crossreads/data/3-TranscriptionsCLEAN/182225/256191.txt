1916   SATURDAY 5   FEB.
Raining in morning but it cleared up in afternoon  We got off guard about 4.30 pm & I got the 5.40 train to Sydney, had a bath at the Metropole & had a hot bath & then met Linda on the wharf. Got a taxi up to Tissots & had dinner & went to "So Long Letty" at Her Majesty's. It was the prettiest piece I have seen for a long time & not so board as I was led to believe. I think Linda liked it also, but she was very tired when we got home
