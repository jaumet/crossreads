September 1915Friday 3Fine I believe I am to go on Batt. H.Q. as they are short of H.Q. "Sigs". Did another shift at the phone. Needless to say we have another place for the "phone" now. The beggars shelled us out of the other one. Our artillery gave them some hurry up this afternoon
Saturday 4Cool breeze from the North. Blows a lot of dust about. Turks are very quiet today. They usually open up with their small arms about 5.30 P.M. and also with bombs about 3 AM. We have been ordered to be prepared for an attack from them any time. I think myself that "Jackie "realises this to be too costly though.
