We had a long & trying march, went through Brueire, Dernacourt & Meaulte, had dinner just outside Fricourt it was cooked on the march, we pulled up in Adelaide Camp, a pretty good camp.On the way up we passed some 3rd Bn. men they were sitting on the side of the road boozing & when the Colonel passed they never even saluted him this narked the Colonel & he told the Adjutant to put the Sergeant who was there under arrest, Depina was told off to bring him along
