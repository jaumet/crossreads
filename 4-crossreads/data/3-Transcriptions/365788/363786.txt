<p>Mena<br/>7 Feby 15<br/>My darling little Margaret,<br/>Thank you very much for the lovely card you sent me. It was such a lovely surprise.<br/>There are such a lot of donkeys here and camels and the camels have two funny humps on on their backs. The people here ride camels and donkeys mostly instead of horses. When I go to town I will try and get a picture for you &amp; one for dear little Tingse.<br/>There are a lot of people here called Arabs and they wear such funny clothes just like women and instead of hats most of them wear a funny thing called a Turban.<br/>Please give dear little Tings &amp; Peter a hug and a kiss for me. Did you see any flying fish when you were coming from Australia? We saw quite a lot sometimes and one day we saw hundreds of Porpoises and they swam all round the bow of the steamer.<br/>Hoping to see you soon and with much love to mother and Auntie and my dear little Margaret<br/>from<br/>\Your loving Uncle<br/>Fred<br/>Daddy sends lots of love to you all</p>
