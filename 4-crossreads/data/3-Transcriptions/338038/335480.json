<p>W. Garling Esq<br/>Burns Bay Rd<br/>Longueville<br/>Sydney, NSW</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<br/>I am writing both in my own name &amp; in that of his other comrades &ndash; officers NCOs &amp; men alike &ndash; to express to you our very deep sympathy at the loss of your son &ndash; Major T.W. Garling.  He was badly wounded in the upper part of the right thigh &ndash; received all possible medical care and when he died at the Casualty Clearing Station his body received religious burial at the Warloy Cemetery &ndash; a small town some 5 miles from Albert.<br/>Your sons batman was with him a great deal towards the end.  A cross will be erected over your son's grave.  Your son died doing his duty and will I cannot put on to paper what we all feel; but this much I say, your son was undoubtedly one of the most respected and popular men in our Artillery Division.  The Doctor authorises me to say that your son did not suffer much pain.<br/>Again in very deep sympathy<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>G.E. [Shaw ?]<br/>C.F. (C of E)</p>
