 Rode over & saw Eric to-night the weather is glorious. I'm sitting on the window sill writing this by daylight 10 to 10 p.m. Our landlady gave us a bottle of Cider this morning it is A.1. Received 4 letters to-day 2 from home & 1 Dorie 1 Trish. The home letters were lovely & long. 
 5/7/16. Arrived safely here (Sailly) yesterday about dinner time. Are billeted in a bosker cottage & have a long room with folding doors, reminded me of home somewhat. The folk are very nice & seem fairly well to do. Sailly is a very dirty place & shows signs of bombardment. Received 13 letters yesterday
