  
 & tired  & have a wash from my water bottle through the window of carriage  The weather is beautiful & what a prospect before us. Here is southern France in all it's beautiful grandeur. No wonder the Frenchman shouts "Vive la France" & "J'aime ma Patrie".  Such country. The view is enough to refresh one of the drowsiest. Everywhere is green & as we pass villages snugly ensconced in hillsides & on the fields, every one has it's beautiful church, the spire so prominent. In Marseilles I was struck by the beauty of the streets  the wide squares & fine trees, also the hospitality of the people. Of course it is more pronounced in the country, &  I practice my French which is very handy. The towns we passed I have detailed in the back of this diary. Many famous old Chateaux on hillsides &  strong Castles where probably many a famous battle has been fought
