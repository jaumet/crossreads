<p>The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and Me<br/>When we are absent and the World seems drear<br/>Though many miles may part us, land or sea<br/>His arms enfolding us, will draw us near.</p>
<p>The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and Me<br/>We miss each other so, He knows it well<br/>And, in His love, will make our love to be<br/>Our joy and stay wherever we may dwell.</p>
<p>The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and Me,<br/>And guard and shield us both from harm &amp; pain<br/>And grant that soon together we may be<br/>Together, nevermore to part again.</p>
