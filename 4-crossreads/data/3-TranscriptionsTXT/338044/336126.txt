2nd Dec:-New duties in Deaths & Missing branch (temporally) doing typewriting. I manage this rather successfully for the first day but not being experienced typiste, make a few mistakes but Malish. Was paid before leaving hospital yesterday & we have a good time. Bed late &  having secured a mosquito net from Sister Bourke at the hospital to-night, sleep a little better.
3rd Dec:-Arise late &  arrive at office 9pm. We are very nicely situated here, our quarters being about 5 minutes walk from the base  & the little tramp in the sun about 8-45 am is very enjoyable. Pay another visit to the hospital this evening  & get some letters    Very welcome indeed. Leave me quiet
