Went for route march with Major Kay. We quite enjoyed it. The country is very pretty about here the cropsof wheat and oats are ready for harvesting and the pears and applies on the trees look very tempting. We saw plenty of women men and boys cutting the crops with the old fashioned sickle, and handbinding it. We travelled through a good few miles of country with crops on either side of the road, but only saw one reaper and binder, and that was a Massey Harris. After dinner B. Section had stretched drill which they thoroughly enjoyed (I don't think) Mac.D. and I were told off to make a grease trap so we missed it. Just before the 9 o'clock parade we had a sing-song and a few speeches were made by Bricky Howard and a number of them, protesting against the "drill in the firing line" Doherty fell foul of "Serg. Steward" Price and was awarded 3 days 2nd Field Punishment by "Maudie"
Tuesday 8th
On Picquet. The rest of the crowd went for a Route March. On their return, we had a lively few minutes, owing to the crowd in the rest billet bombarding us with apples which they had collected during the march. We had more stretcher drill in the afternoon which was done with the usual "gusto" by B. Section. The 9 o'clock parade passed off uneventfully.
Wednesday 9th
Route march in the morning. After dinner we went into Estaires. Div. Baths and had a bath and a change of clothes, which were very acceptable. Baths are not near nor so good as the ones at Erquingham which were running. Things rather quiet. A. Sec. returned from the trenches where they have been 3 weeks.
Thursday 10th
On picquet again. The rest of the crowd are waiting round A. Sections Tents and they are not going sore at all. We had the afternoon off and it passed quite uneventfully. Another party of A. Sec. went out to the trenches, they were 1 man short, so Bricky Howard filled the breach and went with ?em.
