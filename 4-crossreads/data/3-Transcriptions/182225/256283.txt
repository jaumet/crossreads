<p>JUNE &nbsp; TUESDAY 13 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Very misty in morning but when it lifted it was a perfect day. We (27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Bat) all went ashore, the rest of the brigade it was optional whether they went or not, but a lot went. They were all in full marching order except for overcoats. We were taken off about 10.30 AM in a lighter &amp; a tug (Sir Charles Elliott). We got ashore about 11 AM &amp; the brigade marched out to Sea Point about 2 miles out, and they were dissmissed at 1 pm till 3.45 when they had to be out at the wharf. Bill Hunter &amp; self &amp; Farrier Seagent Armstrong ([Beda&#39;s/Bedd&#39;s?] husband) got off as soon as we landed to get some neatsfoot oil We got it easily &amp; went to the Grand Hotel grill room &amp; had lunch then went out to Cecil Rhodes old home. Its a beautiful</p>
