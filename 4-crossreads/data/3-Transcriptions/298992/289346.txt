<p>Section, Capt. Baker, was wounded and another lad named Birmingham was killed. Its rather hard on me being here &amp; reading about all this, when I ought to be there with them, but I daresay there is plenty to be done yet, and I hope I won't be long here before getting away again.</p>
<p>How is everyone at home? You can write to me here, and I am dying to hear something from home. I am going to write to Tom Bochine now I think he will get a surprise when he hears from me too.</p>
<p>Goodbye now, Mother, and don't forget I am quite well, so don't you worry at all. I may be home any day or it may be a week or so before I can get leave.</p>
<p>With Love to you all<br/>Alan</></p>
