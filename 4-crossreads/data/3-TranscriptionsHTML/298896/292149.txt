<p>Saturday 24th August<br/>A very quiet day being taken up with reading the paper, writing a letter, making the Sgts mess larger and having a swim. The day started cool but warmed up &amp; I appreciated the rest. No word of moving yet. Our 1st Div. total of prisoners is now 2000 with 60 officers. Elsewhere we are pushing the hun back &amp; all appears bright.</p>
<p>Sunday 25th Aug.<br/>Passed rather a poor night. About 10 P.M. one plane bombed our camp with grass cutting bombs. The nearest to my tent was 30 yds another 45 yds &amp; the air was thick with dirt, dust smoke &amp; the smell of powder. Two horses were wounded, one of which we had to shoot during the day. Dozens of planes were over &amp; it was a continuous hum overhead for a couple of hours, quite the reverse of a comforting noise. Rumours of a move again. Had one swim only as have a touch of neuralgia. Sent a req. in for signature. Transferred to a dugout during the day, also wrote some letters. A cool change in the weather with rain.</p>
