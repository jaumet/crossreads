 V I came across an old photo of the Brigade tonight taken at Bailleul in France &ndash; amp; enclose it.  Unfortunately I was away with Maurice Fergusson at the time &amp; did not get into it.  I probably won't know the old crowd when I get back there are so many changes &ndash; Col Williams has gone to the 12th Army Brigade, and Col R.M. Edwards D.S.O. who used to be a section commander with me in the old 8th Battery has our Brigade &ndash; Must say goodnight now with fondest love to yourselves &amp; the Brother Your affectionate Son Terence
