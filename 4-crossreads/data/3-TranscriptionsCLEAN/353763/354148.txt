  
 we came suddenly to a big square - grassy & open & there was the Parade grounds & a mob of men - a band & a ceremony just starting  - Three sides of the square were occupied by armed men - rifles with fixed bayonets  -  On our left was the Naval brigade & in front & to our right the Berrima boys in Kharki & slouch hats  -  Our  open  side was full of officers & others & I noticed a few Germans & one German lady on the side walk  -  They looked at us & talked & we looked at them but said nothing  -  In the centre of the square was a band & a military man giving the orders  =  We learned subsequently that Brigadier Holmes read the Declaration & generally superinted the show  -  The good old Flag was hoisted & the Fleet saluted with her big guns  -  We sung God Save the King & gave 3 tremendous cheers - the men - in fact all of us - cheered vociferously  -  It was good to hear it  -
