7.11.16we had the line finished to Geisi by mid-day & connected up   We found a steep sand hill here very high, (an ideal Sig Station) & found Watson in touch with stations in every direction. New Zealanders in front, Tommies & our own troops on the flanks & rear; I received orders to send another Sig out this morning & sent Teddy Mann, & have decided also to send Edwards out tomorrow as there is plenty of work for two good helio. men, & I can see a busy time ahead on this post, we arrived back in Camp tonight before sundown & found a large  English  Australian mail waiting for us.
