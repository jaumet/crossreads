A wonderful success is the only term fit for this morning's stunt. We were up the line at 1 a.m. the barrage fell beautifully on to the Bosche line. All objectives were carried well to time the result is that we now hold Mont de Merris took prisoners over 300, ten trench mortars, fifteen machine guns rumour hath it one field gun. Our casualties were wonderfully light, about one fifty including forty Germans going through Borre. Everyone concerned was highly pleased. Practically no shelling by Fritz no counter attack. Glorious day. The 10th 11th Battns. were the attacking force, part only of 10th. The fact of the great number of prisoners is due to Fritz changing over when the attack started. The 29th Division on our right also did very well.
