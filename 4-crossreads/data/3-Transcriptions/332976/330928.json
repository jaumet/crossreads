<p>September 1917<br/>nearly all through the day.   Fritz began to counter-barrage about half an hour before us &amp; he also kept it up throughout the day, with Glencourse Wood as its centre.   The Division (5th) "hopped over" at daybreak &amp; took their objective (about 1000 yds)    The 3 sections followed the infantry over, &amp; finished their job.   Both Engrs &amp; Inf. had received heavy casualties, but not nearly so great as the enemy<br/>The 1st Brigade had lost all their officers &amp; Pritchard took charge, "dug in" &amp; consolidated the position.   Over 2000 prisoners were taken &amp; many machine-guns &amp; trench mortas.<br/>The casualties of the company up to 8 P.M. are as follows:- 9 killed, 14 wounded, 5 missing.<br/>This afternoon I went out to find Lt Pritchard &amp; brought him back.   About 8 P.M. I took a party with a "Norton" Tube-well up to Hooge.   No 4 section went out about 10 P.M. to the front line &amp; "wired" (barb-wire) in front of the front line trench &amp; returned home about 6 A.M. (no casualties)</p>
