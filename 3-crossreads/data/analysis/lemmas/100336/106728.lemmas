 There were two good footbal hockey ground . Mr. MacLachlan was the princip and he threw this beauti build open to Prison of war while they were in Smyrna . Imagin our joy at live in a place like this after the hovel we had been in for 3 year previous . We were allow out in the town daili without sentri , but were advis to go in parti for our own safeti , this was a real treat for we all had a fair ammount of money after sell our cloth ; also the Dutch Ambassador had just paid out 10 per man . We soon found that money did not go veri far , for a decent meal cost 1 . A small bottl of German lagar beer cost 4/-. I never heard a prison refus a drink even though it was made in Germani , and cost a high price . There was not much chanc of get intox on this beer . This went on for about 10 day , when one even the joy news came that we were to be readi to leav first thing in the morn . Previous to this we had rumour that a hospit ship was wait outsid the harbour for us . We got veri littl sleep that night
