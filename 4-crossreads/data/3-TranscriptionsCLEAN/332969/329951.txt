 Sunday 22.11.14. Last night it came on a very heavy shower of rain so we threw a tarpaluan over us so we were alright & never got wet. This morning one of the boats broke down & one of the cruisers went to her assistance this morning is much cooler & also the  y  days are getting shorter just fancy 8 am here & its dinner time at home this afternoon passed away very enjoyable to hear the band &  also some Piano and Cornet playing 
 23.11.14.  This morning we sighted land on the East coast of "Africa", we could just see it in the distance I suppose its 20 miles away we have noticed an Island on the coast its very barren looking with sandy hills behind. 
 25.11.14.  We passed Aden this morning & we expect to call at port "Said' which we will reach in about 7 days 
 26.11.14 we are getting close to the Red sea now while in Aden which we did not expect to see
