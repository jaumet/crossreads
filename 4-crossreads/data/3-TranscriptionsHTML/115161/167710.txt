<p>another large town and well worth a visit.&nbsp; Streets are very narrow but a very busy place.&nbsp; A great railway centre, where the railway people have nothing to learn from us in <s>the</s> respect to politeness and do not expect a&quot;tip&quot; for their assistance.&nbsp; They help the foreigner in every possible way - they do it because it appeals to their nature.&nbsp;- and take it as a pleasure to be of service to you.&nbsp; No! they don&#39;t expect tips, they don&#39;t want favors, they are above that kind of thing.&nbsp; They do their job to the best of their ability, and if they please you, they are satisfied.&nbsp; I don&#39;t say they would refuse a &quot;tip&quot;, but what I say is that they don&#39;t expect one, and you get just as good attention without giving one.&nbsp; Wonder if we should in our own countries, eh!</p>

<p>About this time I was promoted to a corporal, and the means whereby I gained this preferment were both novel in the way of getting, and somewhat surprising in the matter of the retention of the said rank.&nbsp; It was during the absence for a couple of days of the boss, that a list was called for by the headquarters of all those men who had enlisted very early in the war.&nbsp; There was no allowance for another corporal in the section I belonged to so</p>
