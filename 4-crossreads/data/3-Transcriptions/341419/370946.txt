<p>Wadi Hinane, 8.11.18<br/>This is my Nunc Dimittis.  On the 6th we reached Wadi Hinane, on the 7th there were alarms &amp; excursions the outcome of which was that all the 1914 men of 32 Coy A.A.S.C.[Australian Army Service Corps] were to depart in the Evening.  This set me thinking, I enquired &amp; found that the 1st Bgde. came into camp about 4 oclock so last night I went over to the ambulance after tea expecting to find them all drunk in anticipation.  To my surprise no one knew anything about it, so I got busy, made them 'phone to Bgde. &amp; Division, the result being that a wire was received about 9 p.m. stating that one allotment was 12.  There are only 8 of us left now so that was all right.  We then cracked three bottles of Champagne on the strength of it &amp;</p>
