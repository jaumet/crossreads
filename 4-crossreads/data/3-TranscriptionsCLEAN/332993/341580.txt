  
 another smashing blow to the Hun in Flanders.  Langemarck is captured.  Important successes & over 1,800 prisoners,  the attack was on a front of over 9 miles N. of Y[p]res-Menin road.  French troops operated on the left. This afternoon we received this morning's London "Express."  This is the first place I have been where we could get the London morning paper in the afternoon. 
 Saturday August 18. 1917 (1111) A fine morning but cloudy.  There is a plague of small minute vermin like wood lice in these old buildings which have not been in use for years.  They crawl on our clothes but do not bite.  Horse lice still annoy us and we have frequently to take off our shirts and pick them. [One line of shorthand] I was at a very good concert at the Australian Y.M.C.A. Tent which followed us here for the entertainment of the Troops.  Capt. Toul contributed two recitations which met with great applause.  An officer in the Artillery also contributed two items.  All the other items were contributed by the soldiers of this Battalion. 
 Sunday August 19. 1917 (1112) A fine day.  There was a general inspection this morning by Major Robinson including the transports section.  He was highly pleased with the Transports.  Alick Holmes had a toe broken this morning shoeing a horse, & was taken to the Hospital.  We have a holiday this afternoon.  I went for a walk with Fred Barclay this evening around the village & out into the country lanes.  Most of the crops are all cut and stooked in sheaves. An Australian mail is in & I got two letters from my dear wife dated June 1, No 69. & June 5, 70. I was on picquet last night. No 4. from 3 to 6.
