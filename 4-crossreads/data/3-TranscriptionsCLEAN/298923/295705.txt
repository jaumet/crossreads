  
 8 February 1918 Friday Raining hard.  Last night an Egyptian Camel Driver had been left sick on the road-  Our Officers found him about 10 p.m. & forced whisky down his throat & dragged him up to our Picquet, covered him with Bks- this morning he was alive & has gone to Native Hospital Very cold on these poor beggars they only wear a cotton overall, & their lives are not of much value these times.  Brother thou art!
