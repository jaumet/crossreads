<p>steady war upon the ubiquitous mosquito which came like the Germans in Mass-Formation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then away again, running past a pretty white Chateau perched high on a crag, uphill again, and then we saw beauty, I don&#39;t think I have ever seen anything more beautiful and in such splendid variety, each turn in the road displayed something new, now a fine expanse of rolling cultivated land in various stages of cultivation, now an orchard scene; now an open grassy space unfenced, the road (unfenced) llike a ribbon of white on a green ground, and bordered with apple trees, the fruit plentiful, glowing with its ripe russet tints, now a mysterious dark beech-wood with here and there an avenue roofed like a cathedral with the branches over-hanging from both sides, but best of all were views over and through all these toward a gleaming expanse of river curving and winding on its way to the sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On we went from beauty to beauty, past tall cliffs burrowed by ancient cliff-dwellers, and many of these cliff-houses still occupied, through prosperous river towns and villages, till after curving up a very high hill we looked down upon the town we had come to see, Rouen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We had left the school only after the afternoon parade so it was becoming dark when we arrived, but though we failed to find our hotel we found another and quite a good one too.&nbsp; A late dinner, some yarning over cigarettes, then a very comfy bed with sheets, and that finished Saturday for us.</p>
