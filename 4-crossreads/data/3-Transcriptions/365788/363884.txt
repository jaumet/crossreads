<p>3<br/>the cable you sent me to Lemnos &amp; also for the good wishes it embodied.<br/>It is awfully hard work writing subject matter here which is not censorable.<br/>Did I tell you I saw Beatrice Russel Glasson?<br/>I am writing part of this as I wait outside the Dentist's tent here. His name is Lt. Amphlett. He really seems to take a lot of trouble with our teeth &amp; it is a God sent to be able to get them done.<br/>Very sorry to hear you had to go to Moxham &amp; hope he did not give you much pain.<br/>Please remember me to Frank &amp; Mrs Dight when you write.<br/>Very much love to you all<br/>Ever your loving brother<br/>Fred</p>
