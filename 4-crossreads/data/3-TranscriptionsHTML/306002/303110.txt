Major Vernon was in command of the Regt. to-day &amp; we were out doing Regimental drill, had dinner in the same spot as yesterday, we also had some trench jumping this morning.  We returned to camp soon after dinner.  Reveille has been altered from 6 oclock to 5.30 since Monday, &amp; we have been doing half an hours bayonet exercise every morning before stables, &amp; consequently work up a decent appetite for breakfast.  Put the evening in boxing &amp; writing.  Concert in Y.M.C.A. tonight.</p>
