  
 19.4.15 Mon. 19th.  Regimental drill all day & had a fairly rough time of it.  Idleboy has been lame since Friday, & I rode Nelsons mare to-day & found her to be as rough as it is possible to get them.  We were drilling on the desert;  arrived back in Camp before 3 oclock.  After tea Pitt & I had a game of billiards & then put in half an hour at a concert that was given as a send off to Mr. Bell who is connected with the Y.M.C.A. here.
