 28-12-16 Thurs 28th Rained a treat last night but we managed to keep fairly dry, bodies of Bedouins come in daily waving white flags to show they are friendly a good many of these are armed &amp; are coming in for orders &amp; the head of El Arish sent out messages for them soon after we took possession, there is no doubt they are quite willing to fight with the winning side, the Sheik of Mecca fighting with us greatly influences the actions of the Arabs in this part of the world, it is now asserted that the Turks are all concentrating at Rafa &amp; reinforcements are coming for them.
