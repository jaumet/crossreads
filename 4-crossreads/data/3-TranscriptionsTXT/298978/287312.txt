 August 1914 Entered Camp Blackboy Hill West Australia. Am in camp for three weeks during which time I often break camp to go to my studio to work on my large canvas which I hope to finish as it may be the last I shall ever paint. After the quiet of my studio I find this terrible, life in camp and the uncongenial society of rough Bushmen. They are good fellows and seem to think a lot of me. On one occasion, when drilling, there was a rather fine sunset which greatly occupied my attention. Suddenly I head an explosion of frightful language  - I looked round, found myself standing alone at the attention; the remainder of the squad having marched off, which I also should have done. It is needless to remark what the drill sergeant thought about it. 
 September 1914 This morning at drill I nearly fainted; for five nights I had little or no sleep. I go to the M.O. I am given a pill which seems to be a general cure for all minor complaints. My terrible imagination, the thought of having to give up my brush, is getting too much for me. I have not yet been sworn in, and as I don't feel I am going to be much use, and as I can't get into the A.M.C. where I know I should be useful, I think I shall take everybody's advice and give it up.
