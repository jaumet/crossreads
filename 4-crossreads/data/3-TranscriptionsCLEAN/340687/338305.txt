 January, 1917. Monday 1 We were given a holiday today and stayed in bed until 11.30 doing various things when we got paid. At 2 p.m. we had a parade for rifle inspection and after I cleaned the hut and myself thoroughly. Had a shave and wrote up diary in evening. Ingram on shift 7 to 1 a.m. Cloudy but mild with wind and guns normal. Fritz sent over several whizz bangs to 2nd Division Ambulance. Great run on canteen to day by troops from everywhere sold out in evening and we couldn't get what we wanted.
