 Tue 8th Lifted anchor & came alongside the wharf at 9.30 AM;  In a remarkably short space of time a gang of Egyptians had lined up along the boat some wanting to sell oranges, some papers, etc while the greater number was there to beg pennies (or piastres) (2 1/2)   A penny was thrown down to see them scrambling for them every 5 minutes or so; about half an hour after we were here the native police came on the scene & started to hunt the beggars back & a penny was thrown & there was a rush for it & the police started on the crowd with a good lump of a stick, the pennies fell constantly at the policemans feet afterwards & the niggers (who will take plenty of hits for a copper) would dive for the penny right at the policemans [indecipherable]
