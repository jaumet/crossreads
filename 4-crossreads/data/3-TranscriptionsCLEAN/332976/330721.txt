October 1916.a fairly long march from the railway station, & soon settled down.10th   We went for a route march of about 7 miles through the country & I enjoyed the scenery very much.  We passed through two small villages & through beautiful cultivated lands & returned in time for tea.  The Sergeants Mess here is very comfortable & is the best I have been in since leaving Sydney.  It is a mixed mess & includes Engrs., Artillery A.S.C., & A.M.C..  We went to the pictures after tea & had a very enjoyable time.
