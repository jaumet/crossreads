 Thursday Have been to Houplines.  It is my week at the Canteen.  The Germans have been shelling today down there. 
 Friday The Hun has been pretty busy again at Houplines, quite a lot of shells went over our Canteen &amp; landed about 100 yards away.  He is searching for guns evidently.  He shelled our trenches with shrapnel this morning.  Tonight at 8 oclock our guns opened a terrific bombardment which lasted &frac34; of an hour.  It sounded like a raid.  Flares went up continuously from the German lines.  The weather has been cold but not so cold as last week. 
 Saturday Feb. 17 I did not go out to Houplines.  I had to have a hot bath &amp; it took most of my morning.  This afternoon I made arrangements for Sunday.  The British War Loan closed yesterday.
