  
 the war was really won, so long as it did not materially affect them. 
 Villers Brettoneux - the small and apparently insignificant village on the hill overlooking the great city of Amiens - was the deciding point of the whole war.  Had the enemy burst through here, then Amiens was his.  "He" knowing that, put all he could into the means of gaining a decided victory, and victory seemed very close to "him", and Amiens seemed almost within his grasp.  The coast was very close, and with Amiens his, the whole of the allied armies would be cut in two, and the "day" would have been "his".  The whole thing looked so very simple from that ridge on which stood this village. 
 Well! as the French will tell you, and as history will relate later, the city of Amiens was saved by the dogged pluck and bull-dog determination of the 13th. and 15th. Brigades of the Australian Army, at Villers Brettoneux in April 1918, and the French people will never forget this marvellous achievment. 
 This reverse was the beginning of the end.  The enemy had put his very best into this venture, but he came up against better stuff than he could produce.  He did not know what Australian were.  He was not acquainted with the determination and doggedness of the "digger".  He met him (to his sorrow) at Villers Brettoneux, and I don't think "he" will forget him in a hurry either. 
 Villers Brettoneux belongs to Australia, as does also Meucke [Mouquet?] Farm, and a few other places I could mention.  But the former stands out as a master-piece of Australian determination and endurance. 
 The enemy never did like meeting our fellows, but this action made "him" realise more than ever what "he" was up against, when he pitted himself against the only purely volunteer army opposed to him. 
 A very fine cemetery is here, where many of our dead have been transferred to. 
 After remaining here for about a fortnight we move back to 
  BUSSY les DAOURS .
