    How I won the
Yes, thats the red ribbon i?m wearing
Just a small strip of scarlet you see
But there is no one can tell how I prize it 
nor the memories it brings back to me
For it speaks of the broad fields of honour
That we rung from the red jaws of Hell
 my eyes grow bedimmed for my cobbers
Who battled fought fell.
Yes that's the V.C. ? How I won it
Is not for me to relate
we heroes are always so modest
 boastings I thing that I hate
But seeing you write for the papers
I'll make an exception for you
Don't mention my name if you write it
Though every particle is true
It was during a fight for an outpost
It was called "Green Knole" I believe
 the Turks on the top dealt out slaughter
In a way that would cause you to grieve
It was five thousand feet to the summit
 almost as steep as a wall.
 they met every charge as we rushed it
with bayonet shrapnel Ball
It was defeded by nine lines of trenches.
(That's strong for an outpost you'll guess).
also twelve 42 centimetres
That kicked up a duece of a mess.
The bombs fell amongst us like rain
 machine guns ? why, just to remember
even now brings a feeling of pain.\
We?d been fighting for months without resting
ah! well may the angels weep
for the blood ran in streams down the gullies
