<p>This last week I have been down to a slight attack of Malaria. To day the Sherf of Mecca's arrived here.<br/>I had heard such a lot about them that I looked forward with interest to meeting them. I never saw a more undisciplined lot of Troops. All hands seemed to go where they liked &amp; do just as they chose. Some were mounted on Camels, some on Horses, Turkish mules &amp; Ponies others were on foot.<br/>They seemed fairly well dressed but there was no uniformity among them. They have the reputation of being plunderers &amp; I must confess looked it.</p>
