<p>Sun. Apr. 21</p>
<p>Tucker not bad in No 7 Camp, but after having fed in Officer's mess so long, it comes rather hard.</p>
<p>After Tea George Lawson and I went into Warminster and attended Evensong at Methodist Church and the Sing-Song and Bun Fight afterwards. Attended Morning Service at Sutton Veny Church. Bishop of Salisbury preached the Sermon.</p>
<p>Mon. 22<br/>Beautiful day. Went on Parade, first time in 3 months.</p>
<p>Went for slow walk with the Hut corporals and D.A.H.s. At night went to Warminster where I met "Pig" Johnson. Had a great old yarn.</p>
<p>Tues. 23<br/>Classification Day.</p>
<p>Toby asked to be marked A3 and "Von" willingly obliged him.</p>
<p>Went into Warminster again and saw Johnson again. He belongs to this district.</p>
<p>Wed. 24<br/>Some of the fellows got mail dated March 18. <br/>No bloomin' mail for me yet, Can't understand it.</p>
