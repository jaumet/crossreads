 Fricourt 21/12/16 A cold bleak morning with lowering clouds. Left on horseback at 10.30 for the Chateau rather a misnomer for in the centre of muddy and splintered wood is a small collection of huts and dugouts which mark the site of the old building. There at Bde H.Q. saw the Brig. who was unwell but happy in the gazetting of his tempy full Colonelcy. Struck out for Montauban getting pretty wet. Fortunately a steel hat does not readily lose its shape in rain and an Aquascutum coat also keeps out wet. The road commenced to get crowded with traffic most 4th Div on their way up and passage was necessarily slow. A wonderful sight this throng of traffic greater than many a large city with traffic inspectors and policemen keeping it under control. Everywhere the old Australian slouch hat, proud emblem of insolent independence and typifying the care free propensities of our army. Cursing and flogging the drivers keep their mules straining at collar and trace.
