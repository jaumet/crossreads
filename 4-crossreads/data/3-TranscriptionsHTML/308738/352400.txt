<p>Feb. 27 Saturday 1915<br/>The Brigade on parade mounted this morning.<br/>Major Fuller &amp; party out of camp.<br/>Posted photos to Clem Taylor, Jefferies &amp; mother &amp; Maude. Went to Cairo, back 11. 0 am also letter to Maude &amp; Mother.<br/>2 Battalions of Australian Infantry left under sealed orders for unknown parts today.<br/>Saw a large Wealthy funeral in Cairo headed by police, then 4 men carrying an elaborately worked cloth by the 4 corners, then the Parson followed by chorister boys in colored surplices, chanting, then the coffin richly decorated, no flowers, after which the mourners walked behind hearse followed by a number of women on carts drawn by mules, and all making a wailing hideous noise. The square cloth carried by 4 men signifies = asking for mercy for the deseased = a Greek idea.</p>
<p>Feb. 28 Sunday 1915<br/>Major Fuller &amp; party viewing Cairo &amp; other interesting places<br/>Went into town visited [indecipherable] &amp; Mosk every visitor had to put on sandals before entering the large square yard in centre of Square a Well 366 ft deep where water used to be drawn from the River Nile. All covered in and under lock &amp; key.<br/>The mosk or church is similar in some respects to a C. E Cathedral without seats.  The floor is covered with carpet, &amp; the walls are of Alabaster, the ceiling is richly carved &amp; painted. A most interesting place.  Beautiful view of Cairo.</p>
