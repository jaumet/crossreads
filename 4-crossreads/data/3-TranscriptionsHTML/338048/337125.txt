<p>Wednesday 9th<br/>Usual early morning pilgrimage to the stables and then we were put on mending cables This lasted all day &amp; is not too bad work. Walked to Haynes in evening.</p>
<p>Thursday 10th<br/>Repairing cables again. Worked seriously interupted by arrival of mail. There were 9 letters for me and we were all very glad to receive them. They make up all the letters which I should have received &amp; none now appear missing Spent evening in writing</p>
<p>Friday 11th<br/>Spent morning on air line work and received good tips from an officer who was a sergt. in the Royal Engrs. &amp; was 11 months at the front. Repairing cable again in afternoon and spent evening on parade ground on Fire alarm practice. Just when I was going to settle down to write we had to go on parade &amp; say there 1 &frac12; hours. Received 3 Australian letters today</p>
<p>Saturday 12th<br/>Went out with wagon as No. 7 which is generally easy. The hedges on the side of the road made it very hard and I worked harder this morning than I have ever worked I think. That say a very great lot indeed.</p>
