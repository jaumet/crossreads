I have ever seen. At this time of the year the flower gardens that sweep down to the river a ablaze with colour and the clipped trees and neat lawns make a charming scene. I had not dreamed that the work of man could be so beautiful. Had dinner at "Les Goblins" Regent St. and went to see "Theodore & Co" London is very quiet of a night, now that the lighting restrictions are in.21/8/17An odd morning, so went to the Tower of London, and half a score of other places, including the Royal Stables where I inspected the Kings Horses. Splendid beasts they are too. Saw much cunning craftsmanship in steel and gold at the Tower. I wonder how those ancient workmen did it. Saw the Crown Jewels; 4.000.000 worth, all in a heap. A dazzling sight. They are quarded by "Beefeaters", husky chaps too.
