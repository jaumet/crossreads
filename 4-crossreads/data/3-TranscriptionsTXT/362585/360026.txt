Dear Mrs. Ferguson,
The parcel arrived a few days ago in excellent condition.  Thanks very much.
I wonder whether you received my answer to your letter written in Dubbo.  These circuit trips seem to be rather enjoyable I should so like to try one.  Perhaps in about another 10 or 15 years I may be able to do so.
I am going back to France on Wednesday next after having had a very enjoyable time.  I don't know what they are going to do with me but expect to be went back to my old Battalion for a while.
I have had no letters from Dorothy for quite a long time now.  Will you please see that she writes to me at once.
Best love to everyone,Yours affectionatelyC. R. Lucas
