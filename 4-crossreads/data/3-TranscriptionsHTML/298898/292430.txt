<p>place &amp; also the Hostel frequented by the Quakers. Stopped inside &amp; yarned during the afternoon the man driving us to the station for the 6.30 P.M. train to London. From here Will went onto Scotland having got an extension of leave &amp; I promised to run up later. That night I stopped in the Hotel yarning &amp; enjoying the lounge. Found letter from friend Ramsay announcing his arrival in London &amp; to meet him next morning at 10 A.M. Weighed myself, result just under 12 st.</p>
<p>Thursday 11th Jan.<br/>Went to meet Ramsay at 10 but he did not turn up untill 11 A.M. having made a mistake in the time, a very unfortunate thing for me as I was up late &amp; had to rush away without breakfast or a shave. We had lunch in The Strand, booked seats for the Opera "Young England" &amp; later returned to the Hotel for tea. The show turned out to be very good, the theme, Sir Francis Drake being a stirring one &amp; the music being splendid. Saw</p>
