1917Sat 10th Nov. (cont.)The Spaniard is the "Igotz Mendi" of Bilboa.
She is brilliantly painted in comparison with the war-grey of all allied vessels at present, the hull being French-grey, masts and upper works white, funnel yellow with a red A.S. monogram.  She is en route from Delagoa Bay with about 6000 tons of coal for the admiralty at Colombo.
The vessels are heading back through a slightly choppy sea to the Carcados anchorage.
Rumours say that the Jap. cruiser "Tsuschima" is amongst those searching this neighbourhood for the "Hitachi".   Opinions are divided, sharply divided, as to whether it would be beneficial or otherwise to we prisoners if the Jap. met "Wolf".
The majority (including self) favour the latter opinion.
