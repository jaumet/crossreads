First of all we got a lift on a Motor Ambulance, then we got into a transport waggon, and finished the trip in an Arab's cart. We had a good dinner, then took a stroll round the town. It was a great treat to be in town again, after having been in the desert for so long. We got the train back again at 3.30 p.m. and arrived back in camp just in time for tea.

Thursday 20th
This morning Capt.Irving took us out to the "Spinx Outpost about 4 miles away from our camp, and set us on digging to make a dug out for a Dressing "Station" We took 10 minutes spell each with the shovels and I never knew 10 minutes to last so long. We arrived back in camp about 12.30, and did full justice to the Boiled Mutton awaiting us. As usual after a mail, papers scattered everywhere. The sanitary section are busy disinfecting and sterilising our blankets. A big number of Reinforcements came in today for the 57th and 58th B.
