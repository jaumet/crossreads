<p>awful.  Stretcher and bearers fell time after time but still we had to plod on.  It's the heaviest and most exhausting duty on the field as even infantry admit.  When our attack comes in a day or two I don't know how we are to get on.</p>
<p>26th October (Thursday)</p>
<p>Heavily shelled today.  The colonel of the 31st asked our artillery to retaliate and they did.  Relieved two hours late &ndash; 8 pm instead of 6 pm so had to find our way</p>
