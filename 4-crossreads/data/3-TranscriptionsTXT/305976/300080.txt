Thursday Nov 7Left Latron about 8 AM & proceeded on the last stage of our journey. We passed through Ramley just after 12 and arrived at our old camping ground about 2pm. Fortunately we had fine weather all the way & fairly easy stages.Friday  Nov 8As we are likely to be some little time we are making ourselves as comfortable as possible. There are plenty of tents available now & most of us have made wooden beds. Richon at present looks its best. We are expecting the rainy season any time now so are preparing for it.
