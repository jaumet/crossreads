<p>Reveille at 5</p>
<p>Got camp straightened up &amp; the Sig office going properly, paid a visit to the Squadron &amp; met old friends, later we went up to the Redoubt which is one of the most complete that I have seen, prisoners are coming in every day &amp; aeroplanes are here in droves &amp; got a rather stiff job for they have so much ground to cover, the enemy is coming down the coast about 3000 strong &amp; we hope to strike him very shortly, the 5th &amp; 6th are out on a raking up stunt today. Downing is out at Romani with a cable section &amp; is supposed to be doing fine work in communications. Motor sand car has got out as far as Gabriel about 40 miles out, the going is exceptionally heavy but the old bus slips over it at 20 mile an hour.</p>
