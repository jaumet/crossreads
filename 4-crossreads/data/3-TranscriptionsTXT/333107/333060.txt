 Sun July 14 Raining again. Wrote to France during the morning, must write Mother tomorrow. After dinner had a good read of "Motor Manual" and about 4 went into Town. Had Tea at Soldier's Club, and went to Pictures in Jubilee Hall. They were very good and the music was fine. 
 Mon 15 More Rain. At Motor School we started over the Lectures again and had a little talk about I.C. Engines. Saw Mr O.P. during the day and he says that things are going good. When I sit and think that there's a chance of getting back to B.E. again, it seems almost too wonderful a thing to happen. 
 At night attended Recital in Y.M. which was very good. 
 Tues July 16th Heard this morning that the D 17[?D 16 mentioned in entry on July 19th] was torpedoed and the crowd who were going Home on her are returning to Camp. I believe she was the "Ceramic", if so that's another big boat gone under. 
 Fritz has started another offensive, but he doesn't seem to be doing much good. The Yanks are in the mix-up. 
 After Tea Perce Taylor and I went out to a place along the Prom. The invitation came thro' the Y.M.C.A. When we arrived we found five more of our chaps there and the two parson daughters completed the party. It is a pleasantly situated House overlooking the Prom. We had a few songs, played a few Games, then had Coffee and Cakes. Finished up by singing a hymn. It was a very pleasant evening. 
 We saw the return of a Train load of the torpedoed party and they did look characters.
