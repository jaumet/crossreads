 Clugie have not come to tea so far. 
 Thursday  2 Sports again today. Otherwise uneventfull. A few nights ago some of the 18th decided that some of their men had not been bathing enough. And they were taken up by force & given a shower. Of course things went a bit too far & clean men were ducked for fun Since then they have been paraided to the shower Treevers for tea tonight & one Padre came down for a time afterwards. Treevers is trying hard to get the swearing cut out, its an uphill job as there are so many boys in the 17th & 18 Batlns. A canvas ventilator has been put in
