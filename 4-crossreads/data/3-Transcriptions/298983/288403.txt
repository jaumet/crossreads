<p>Friday. The only way we have of keeping a count of days is that we draw Matches on Thursday &amp; Job on Sunday Worked in 2 shifts today I went at 7 AM. Things seem to be going against us in some parts. The yarn is that we go to the Somme in a day or so. Thought this would be a good quiet Camp but He has droped a few big ones fairly close to us yesterday evening &amp; again this evening</p>
