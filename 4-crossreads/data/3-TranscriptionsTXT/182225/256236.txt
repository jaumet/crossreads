 there are no very big public buildings or parks like there are in Durban. The prople too are more Dutch and not nearly so friendly. The blacks too are scarcer their places being taken by Cape Boys or halfbreeds. There are no ricksha&#39;s either. The docks are all made up inside the breakwater and they are very cramped with a very narrow entrance, scarcely wide enough to fit a ship in easily.
