We have no time even for writing letters, & how must friends at home know this  Impossible to write, so they must rest content with a few letters now &  again.
23rd Jan. SundayAfternoon off  & I spend it in sleep & writing a few letters. Feel properly knocked up & am sure I shall be pleased when these long hours are over. The weather now is not quite so cold & we soon expect it to rather pleasant. Still cold at night
