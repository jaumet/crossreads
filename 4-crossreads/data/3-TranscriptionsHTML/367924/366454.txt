<p>14th Australian Hospital<br/>Port Said<br/>May 29. 1918</p>
<p>My Dear Aunt,<br/>I wonder will you have heard that I was wounded in the thigh about three weeks ago, and after much travelling and stay-overs in several hospitals on the way down, eventually arrived here at Port Said.</p>
<p>I had thought I was only lightly injured but owing to the bullet having damaged an artery a haemorrhage came on one night and I had to be hurriedly operated on; I was then hoping to get better when a few days after, it was discovered that the track of the bullet was dirty, thanks to the dirty Turk's ammunition. However after the second operation which I had this week perhaps things will go well now. Lets hope so at any rate.</p>
<p>All your letters have come along regularly and I thank you for them. I hope you are keeping well. Summer is here now and we are having very hot weather, but every evening up to the present is cool. I expect that I shall be on my way home as soon as I am able to be moved, so you may look for me soon.</p>
<p>The English Church Padre is writing this for me as I am not able at present to write letters.</p>
<p>Every good wish<br/>Your loving Nephew<br/>Will.</p>
