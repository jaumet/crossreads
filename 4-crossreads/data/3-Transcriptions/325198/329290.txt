<p>25 April, 1916<br/>Desert<br/>Up at 3'0 am this morning &amp; had to saddle up right away, no water for horses or men &amp; gosh Im thirsty.  We moved off about 5.0 &amp; A troop formed the Advance Guard.  There has been nothing doing so far, we are about 5 miles out in the desert from our camp &amp; have been halted for some time.  They don't seem to know what to do, we are posted out &amp; await any orders.  Oh for a pot of Tooheys</p>
<p>We were relieved &amp; came in about 3 oclock to the wells &amp; gave our horses a drink.  I thought they would never stop drinking, I drank about &frac12; a gallon myself.  The water is a bit brackish but it went down alright.  Our section dined on Tinned Sausages &amp; tongue which I found in a deserted camp, so we did not do so bad.  We saddled up again &amp; came over a little way &amp; put down our horse lines.  I had to go on picquet worse luck</p>
