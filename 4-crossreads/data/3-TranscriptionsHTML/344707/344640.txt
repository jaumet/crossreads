<p>August 28th<br/>Musketry on Ranges &ndash; Wherever a standing camp is made targets are set up to keep the men's eyes in &amp; to exercise the new drafts of reinforcements, which come along from the Base. Some are Bushmen &amp; some are not. Forty cases of Comforts from Australian C. Fund for the Regiment arrived last night &ndash; Tinned Fruit Sauces, Pickles etc some excellent khake shirts for the men &ndash; Not the least valuable are the cases for firewood which is always a scarce commodity in these parts &ndash;<br/>29th<br/>Personal<br/>30th<br/>Leave party back from Port Said. The men were very full up of things going down, they enjoyed their spell  As one of them said "The sight of a pretty girl driving in a Gharry was worth their trip". Innoculated again for Para Typhoid Cholera etc &ndash; I forgot how many times this is. Thanks for Grazier with Ralph Anderson &amp; Jack Ellis notices- but sooner go out in a fight than by disease &ndash; This is a healthy spot facing my Bivy. I can see trawlers sweeping mines off Gaza &ndash; I am only 100 yards from the sea</p>
