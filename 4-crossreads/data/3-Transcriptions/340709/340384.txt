<p>the Mission Fathers to enter the line of Guards. I am leaving at 9.15 for Madang.<br/>9 pm : I saw the Major this morning &amp; he approved of my action. He has for various reasons, however, decided to extend the time for the production of the "Gabriel" another week. We are therefore withdrawing our embargo &amp; the works will start again tomorrow. I have just had an interview with the Father Prefect.<br/>Thurs 26th : Normal conditions again prevail at Alexis Hafen &amp; the works are in full swing. Some of my men are down with malaria &amp; Doctor Kloster, assisted by one of the Brothers, has been continuously in attendance on the victims. I cannot speak too highly of the way this excellent medico has given time &amp; trouble to the alleviation of the sufferings of his country's enemies.<br/>From my quarters I occasionally catch a glimpse of the summit of Maulun Beng looming dark &amp; mysterious from among heavy clouds. This peak is over 20 miles away and is the highest point on Dampier Island.<br/>Since leaving the Madang garrison I have been thrown more into the company of my P.O.'s &amp; leading hands. They are old sailors &amp; some of their yarns are redolent of the salt. Thus, "one day, Sir", said one, "I was settin' up some riggin' taut &amp; I called out to one chap. 'go &amp; get us a handy billy'. Away he goes &amp; I waited &amp; waited &amp; kept on waitin' till at last he turns up. 'Here y'are mate', he ses, handin' me a large billy-can. 'It's pretty big but it's the handiest I c'd find'." Those who know what is meant by a "handy billy" will no doubt appreciate the above.</p>
