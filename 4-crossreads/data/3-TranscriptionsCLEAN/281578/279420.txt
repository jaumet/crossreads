  
 had disembarked at the historic old spot of Calais. We wore life-belts on the run across. I can hardly believe I am in France. Oh well, we are right at the serious part of the business now, & a big gun firing near where we landed gave a chap a nasty reminder he's at the real thing now. On stepping ashore there was a Red Cross train waiting, filled with wounded from the present big battle, about to go across to "Blighty", where we had just come from. We marched off with this awful load on our back, & wondering how far we would have to lump it. Passed a camp of Chinese who do labour duties, they were looking through barbed wire fences like monkeys. Imagine trying to control them in action, eh, wouldn't they yabber? Saw French soldiers in all colored uniforms, Belgians, Scotties in their skirts & bare knees. Our packs were feeling very weighty, & shoulders getting pinched, when we had a halt, & immediately flopped down on the ground for a rest, near a hospital, where we saw some Aussies come out for a yarn.
