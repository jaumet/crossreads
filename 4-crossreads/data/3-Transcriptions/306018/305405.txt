<p>February 1917<br/>&amp; then went for a swim.   The water was fairly cold.  At 11 oclock attended the sick camel parade &amp; watched them all treated.  They are dirty creatures to handle &amp; I don't think it is possible for anyone to like them  The Brigade went out early in the morning as a covering party to a vessel taking soundings on the coast.  Am picking up a bit of Arabic &amp; often have little yarns with the nigs.  It is the only way to learn.</p>
<p>Monday 26th<br/>In the morning went with the sick parade &amp; later went over to the Regiment.  There were 3 mines exploded that were washed ashore  It was a good sight to see them go off.  A Taube came over in the morning.  An Australian mail arrived.  I only received 1 letter from home.</p>
<p>Tuesday 27th<br/>Had nothing to do all day.  The Brigade was out on reconnaissance &amp; saw some mounted Turks.  Some gift stuff arrived &amp; was distributed &amp; was very acceptable no canteen being yet out here</p>
