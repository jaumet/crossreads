<p>I signed on at 3 oclock for an Emergency run &amp; stood by until tea time when I had to take several trucks of Ammunition up to Reigersberg Siding (Gas Shells) after making a good run &amp; placing the trucks in the Siding I received further orders to go further up past the Canal <strike>for</strike> to bring back two trucks of Duck Boards, &amp; off I went &amp; on arrival at Reigersberg Nth there were no pilot there so as it is not permissible for two trains to proceed over the Canal I had to return to Regersberg &amp; then was ordered to go back to Trou Trois Siding &amp; pick up a full load of Empties for Peselhoek. After waiting line clear for some time I was let go &amp; soon arrived at the Siding &amp; we had to pick up a lot of trucks on one road &amp; put them on another when my train was complete, this siding is used to unload the shells from the Broad Gauge into the Light Railways. After several delays I eventually arrived back at 12.40 am</p>
