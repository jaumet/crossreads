duplicate set of pictures, but was also turned down.
I cannot understand at all the attitude of the A.I.F. in the matter. All the photographers, British, Canadian, and even my own Section have received recognition for their services and I have been conspicuously turned down! 
Still I have come out best after all, had it not been for the Military, I had not met and married my little partner, who indeed is worth undergoing the tribulations of a lifetime for, and I have made many friends, and have visited the battlefields of France and Palestine. Surely after all this is a recompense. The time will surely come when I shall be able to repay the other injustices.
