<p>Dismounted dill commenced today, from 9.30 to noon.  Lectures each afternoon, so we do not get an hour's respite during the day.  Fatigue parties filling in all the old Rafa redoubts &amp; trenches.</p>
<p>30:  Very quiet night; band played a few carols &amp; fireworks at One Tree Hill, but our Division were not allowed to participate in the fun.  Went to bed at 7 p.m., being on horse piquet from 10-12 &ndash; and 2-4 a.m. so did not wait to see entry of the new year.</p>
