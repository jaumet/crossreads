<p>Poor Phil Knight was wounded on another fatigue carrying wire; and at the same time bullets struck the wire I was carrying on my shoulder.  Knight subsequently died.  At 10 pm relief came &amp; we moved out to a position near Borre.  Had to wear gas masks as we went out for a time<br/>May 28<br/>Our camp was shelled with a result of nine casualties, including D Company's assistant cook who was blown into the air.  Selected for a picquet at St Marie Cappel, but I was hardly able to march there.  Have been queerish ever since the platoon was smashed, but fancy that if I can stick it till we get a real spell which the Battalion has been anticipating, I will pull through. What has made matters worse is my inability to rest.  I can only sleep for a few hours, and all the rest of the time I feel I must be doing something.  I put myself on all the fatigues and patrols there are, and if nothing is doing get digging, improving the trench position.  The sweat pours off me immediately, &amp; I get in a fever, &amp; soon become exhausted with exertion; but almost immediately, after I have been told to rest, I want to get back &amp; do some more.  My shaking fits have been recurring during the last few days; and carrying my pack or blanket &amp; equipment, for a few weeks now, has seemed a nightmare.</p>
