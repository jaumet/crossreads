  
 [The beginning of this letter appears to be missing.] bonza season you are having. 
 I'm very glad to hear all this but its most aggravating, why could it not happen when I was home. 
 I was dying to see Gum Creek running & I  know  it won't run this year even if I am back by then although that is doubtful. 
 We are off again tomorrow back to the line again.  I don't mind much but I hate the moving part.  We have been 41/2 weeks out & it has been a good rest for the nerves anyhow if nothing else. 
 I wish I could tell you lots of things but they will all have to wait for a while.  It is most aggannoying. 
 I am doing well with my French, can actually make myself understood although my speech is very halting. 
 Are you at Manly this year.  Is it true Margaret Johnson is engaged.  Alas for my blighted hopes. 
 Shall you be displeased if I bring back
