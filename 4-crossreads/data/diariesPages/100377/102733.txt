12th Sept 1916
Started with our own HQrs in morning. Then some more military stunts. All put together signallers from Div. HQrs and Batteries. Makes one sick tired of the whole show. Anyhow I can see waste time trouble for nothing. I suppose the Winchester training going to Hell now.
Gen Sir John French visited this camp today. Received first letter from my father sister since arriving in England. Answered their letters also Lauries Wyns.
