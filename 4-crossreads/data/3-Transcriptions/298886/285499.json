<p>cool today. I suppose the clerk of the weather must have taken pity on for once. The trumpeter put his fountain pen down this evening and could not find it again he had intended writing a letter He said that he was in a good humour The end of the incident was he banged the writing pad down in disgust and walked out blaming us two for hiding it on him which of course is wrong. He has just come in still in a bad humour and the pen not found yet.</p>
