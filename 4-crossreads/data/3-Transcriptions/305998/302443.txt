<p>In the night &amp; our dugout began to leak badly, we both got wet but would not get out before fall in time next morning, We worked hard in our little spare time to fix the dugout up, being lucky to find a large peice of canvas we tied it up to the roof to catch the water for washing purposes. We took over guns in position at Flers from the 6th Aust Baty. &amp; they took ours that were parked. Had pack up ammunition &amp; lost two horses in the mud, they get leg weary</p>
