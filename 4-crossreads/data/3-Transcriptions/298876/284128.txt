<p>Friday<br/>18/2/16</p>
<p>A beautiful day &ndash; a fine fresh breeze blowing right through our Cabin, result, we have had the best sleep today since we've been on Night Duty.</p>
<p>No 1 Hospital full 15 beds 3 cases of Pneumonia, very bad, occasionally go off their Heads, think nothing of breaking out of bed &amp; God knows what they would (<u>Can't get any sleep</u> if a night they want too much watching). Two more cases of Mumps reported today.<br/>No Boat drill today.  Sea as calm as a lake.<br/>We were all disappointed at not seeing Cocos Island; we passed it on Wednesday night about 30 miles out. I fancy I saw some flashes of light during night so think it must have been the Light House there. Each Reinforcement in turn have possession of Deck for Cocerts of a night, some very good talent</p>
