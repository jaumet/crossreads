Sunday June 16
Beautiful weather.
Tam and I went into Town after dinner and strolled along the Prom. We went into the "Popular Tea rooms" where we had Ham and Eggs, B and B'ter and Tea; followed by custard Jelly and cakes. A good variety, but I was far from full when I left. Went back to Camp about 8.30 and com. Letter No 26 to M.S.

It's marvellous the fellows one meets in this place. Today I met Jack Edgar and Bert Pryor. Charley Bowler is also with them. They have been sent over from France as P.U. [Personnel, Utility]
Finished Letter 26. I hardly know what to say about Lill's coming to England. It would be glorious to have her here, but when one thinks of the Food Shortage and Air Raids, and the risks she would run coming over, it makes one think. Anyhow, I'll wait and see what her next Letter says and see if Nell has anything to say about it, then I'll cable.

Tamblyn went away today on the Munition Stunt, and I feel quite lost without him. He was a very decent chap.
