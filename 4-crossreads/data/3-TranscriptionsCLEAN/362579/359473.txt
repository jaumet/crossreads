Finished up by going out to Myra's   &  had dinner. She also had another visitor a Flying Corp Officer. He is brother to a Mrs Edwards who is staying with her. An awfully nice fellow but very young.
Saturday afternoon   &  evening stayed in my room, had a nice fire, so had a busy afternoon mending   &  writing - also washed my hair. A real cost afternoon, made tea   &  toast. It was a very cold day, so thought best to rest a little.
To-day am on duty all day. We are not busy, so I'm in my office trying answer a few letters   &  write my usual one home.
A number of new sisters have come lately waiting to take our places. Quite a crowd are like myself going on transport.
