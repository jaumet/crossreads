 August,1918 Thursday 8 
 Villers Brettoneaux and 1st Objective. Weather fair and slightly misty. Bombardment opened at 4.20 am and we left for an advanced position at 7.20 am The stunt was well expected and the final objective of the infantry was in their hands at midday. Plenty of work here today. Salvaged some good switchboards and phones. Also a clean shirt. Fritz downed a couple of our planes but we dropped 6 of his. Some very spectacular sights. Felt fairly tired at 4.45 pm when we turned in. expect a counter attack tonight.
