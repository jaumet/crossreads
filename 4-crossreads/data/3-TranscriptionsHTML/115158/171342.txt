<p>Forty-eight hours later we were actually in the floating dock in the Tyne, &amp; about to commence eight days&#39; leave.&nbsp; The Contractors (Smiths Dock Company) took the Ship&#39;s defects in hand, whilst the ship&#39;s Company was on leave.</p>
<p>Feb. 9</p>
<p>The day following the completion of the leave, the ship was undocked &amp; arrived the same day in the Firth of Forth.&nbsp; Here our stay was a short lived one.&nbsp; On our arrival we were placed at one hours notice.&nbsp; It appeared that one of our mine-sweepers &quot;Arabis&quot; had been sunk by a flotilla of German torpedo boats in one of their &quot;tip &amp; run&quot; expeditions, other minesweepers escaping in face of superior numbers of the enemy.&nbsp; We were at once ordered to go out, but this order was cancelled at the last minute.&nbsp; The next day, evidently things quitened down, for we were allowed to go to 4 hours notice for full speed.&nbsp; This lasted for exactly two hours, when we were ordered to raise steam &quot;with all despatch&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Australia&quot; was reported ready in the astoundingly short time of 1 1/4 hours for which I received the congratulations of the Captain, which I duly conveyed to the whole Engine Room department, who were entitled as much as I was for any laudatory comments</p>

<p>By midnight we were well out at sea, &amp; the following morning at 6.30 a.m. we &quot;cleared for action&quot;</p>
