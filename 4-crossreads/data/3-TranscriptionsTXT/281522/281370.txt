 3/7/17 Beaulencourt First parade 9 am. Strict inspection by OC Coys in preparation for that of the General which was timed to take place between 11 &amp; 12. Open attack and company drill were practised and we found ourselves very rusty on these points. A very fine sunny day and one could not help marvelling at the great observation Fritz had from here over all our trenches and the land behind them. The air was fresh and it was good to draw it well down into the lungs. Struck all the tents in camp. At 2 p.m. put in some more similar practice out at the ground near camp. The "regimental sore" is giving some trouble again and causes me perhaps more worry than it would to one older and less sensitive. Jack came in after mess. Sent all the officers out to reconnoitre the line of advance for the battalion in case of attack and went out with Bunning to choose a place for the night operation tomorrow. Found a good German trench well wired.
