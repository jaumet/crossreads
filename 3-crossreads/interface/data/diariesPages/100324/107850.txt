All on the ship derived great fun from crowds of little Gyppie kids scrambling for coins ? a native policeman futilely trying to stop them. At 5.45 pm we swung out from the wharf and were tugged through the shipping. The beauty of the scene was very striking.

The home of an intensely fanatical religious people. Fascinating but filthy. Outside the breakwater the process of dropping the pilot was quite exciting owing to heavy seas. At 10 p.m. we are bowling along in pitch darkness with all lights out on account of feared submarines. Two machine guns
