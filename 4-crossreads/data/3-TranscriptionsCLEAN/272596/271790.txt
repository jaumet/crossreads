  
 tumble down buildings & its variety of smells noises & sights, there is about one good street in the whole town & the buildings & shops are very poor, taking her all round I was greatly disappointed for I expected to find a much lager & more important town, she is at the present time full of French British & Australian troops all waiting for ships to go home in.  I came across plenty of our light horse there down from Aleppo, they reckon this is a rotten hole & covered at the present time with 2 ft of snow, I also came across some Tommies who had been taken prisoner at Suvla Bay by the Turks, they reckon if it had not been for the Germans they would have starved to death, for they were the only ones who took the slightest interest in them, we passed a few hours pleasantly there
