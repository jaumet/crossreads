  
 May, 1916 Thursday 11 Work as usual Very hot & windy Go for a walk to Zeitoun in the evening 
 Friday 12 Work as usual through the day. The summer heat struck us today in real earnest & a hot wind was blowing enough to frizzle the hair off our bare knees    impossible to go into the sun without helmets on.
