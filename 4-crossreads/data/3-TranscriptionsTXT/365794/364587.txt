 Thursday 4 July 1917 [1918] Off 2-8 p.m. &amp; went to Helouan with G. Hanly, A. Dowling &amp; his friend Sam, glorious day &amp; the sunset over the old Nile is very fine.  A day of mixed feelings.  Never had such a snub from anyone as is dealt by Miss Gemmell as to "who told you to go to 2nd breakfast?   No staff nurse  goes to that!" &amp; yet I was a "Sister" before she ever was in the Army.  Well it is good that there are women like Mrs. Belcher in the world.  Miss Gemmell talks of improvements but I want only one, better food for these boys &amp; am going to fight &amp; fight until we get it.
