<p>on the 1st November we were sent to a big salt factory at Luneburg. Here we were engaged making salt.<br/>On the 3/2/18 I was sent to a smaller factory at the other end of the town. Here I was employed as fireman in the furnace. On the 5th October 1918 I was sent back to the big factory and they gave me a job at loading</p>
