<p>Monday, 12 April, 1915<br/>New sister allows me up all day and put me on the smoking list I take temps &amp; pulses for her at 4 pm there are 57 to do.</p>
<p>Met an old friend named C. B. today he was only two beds away &amp; I did not know it.  Good news from the front the crisis is rapidly approaching &amp; I received two letters at night from M &amp; E. satisfactory news.  I cannot sleep so well at night as I am never tired enough, so about a dozen of us put on overcoats and sneak out in a summerhouse and yarn &amp; smoke for a few hours.  There is a party of  old Indian &amp; African service men, and their yarns are good enough to print.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 13 April, 1915<br/>Fearfully hot day, hot winds and muggy air, better in hospital than out in the desert.  Just lay about in the shade of the trees of the garden all day.  Fearful rumours have come to hand concerning the 3rd Brigade that went from here about three weeks ago, but as it is not confirmed I will wait before writing.  Soldiering is the game to hear rumours they allways come straight from the heads or the front.</p>
