Sgt. Day an old Imperial N.C.O 
Knowledge of work very fair. Control of the men at times good although on one occasion he failed to hold the platoon when out of hand. General behaviour good but has been guilty lately of one bad lapse in being disrepectful in manner to an officer.
Sgt May, ex-naval man.
Sound general knowledge & can pass it on. good control. but has to be held in hand by myself.
