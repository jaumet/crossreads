 I'm one of the two officers in charge of the Lewis Gun training and we are getting very good resuts for the men are most interested. 
    We are talking nowadays of the Christmas mail and in case I don't get a letter away next week I'll just wish you a Happy Christmas and Peace and Brightness in the New Year. 
   
    With love, 
       Harold.
