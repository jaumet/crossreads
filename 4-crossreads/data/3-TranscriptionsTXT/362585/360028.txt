Dear Mrs. Ferguson,
I received this parcel yester, but letters have not been delivered for a very long time now, about 3 weeks I think.
Have been having an extremely busy time lately but have now got things running fairly smoothly and have not so much to do.
Had a spell of frightfully cold weather everything was frozen including ourselves.  If you left water in a jug in your room over night it froze & smashed the jug.  The sauce on the table and the ink in the offices were like everything else as hard as iron.  The thaw came two days ago and life is again worth living.
Had a long ride yesterday through the Forest of Crecy rather interesting.
Golf has started again.  I appear to become worse & worse each day.
Thanks very much for the parcel.
Best love Caesar
