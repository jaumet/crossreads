limbs might be the "result" if the parties came into contact with one another.            After two days of this bliss, being waited on hand and foot, fed decently and when you told a good tale about a bad I toothache a drop of whisky would be put into your hands, we were I put aboard the boat for England the same boat that had brought la number of Germans, repatriated, the previous night.            The first night aboard we spent in the harbour in I the first class saloon, singing choruses and hymns to the accompaniment of the piano - in short "getting the glad feeling of liberty and relief " off our chests - for only those of us who had seen the hun at his worst could realise to the full hilt what "liberty" really meant.            We had no escort but the Germans had guarranteed anarea free from mines. The trip of about twenty-four hours was uneventful except for running into a heavy sea, which made the majority of us mighty sick men.            We lay of the Wash for some hours and were then takenoff in tugs (the Dutch people on board not being allowed ashore) to the railway station at Leeds, passing en route a number of fat german civilians with an abundance of luggage - going "back" in anything like the exuberant spirit in which we had left Holland.            At Leeds, after a bit of a snack and some good old English tea we entrained on a Red Cross train for London, having our first meal (English) on the train - a big healthy plateful I of roast beef and vegetables, followed by apple pie. The Dutch I had treated us fairly well in the "eats", but they were rationed pretty severely there. This meal on the train was my best for close on eighteen months - it is over two years now since I ate it and I've not forgotten it.            On arriving at Charing Cross  London at about eight o'clock - Royalty was in attendance and one of the Guard Bands was playing. We were greeted by a number of the Australian Red Cross ladies who had worked so untiringly on the organization that had kept us alive during our internment.            I well remember that the first words spoken to me by two Melbourne ladies, who knew I came from Sydney, were " have you seen our arbour".            We were motored from the Station to King George's Hospital Waterloo amidst the cheers of a large crowd and the Guards Band playing "Home Sweet Home", - It wasn't "Home" to me but near enough,            A few days after our arrival Princess Mary entertained us at the Hospital with a belated Xmas dinner, followed by a concert. This almost made me forget my "German Xmas's" - one in
