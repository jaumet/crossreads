<p>experiencing beautiful weather just now.  Our ship hasn't a roll in her, this is our fifth day.</p>
<p>26th January<br/>Today is Australia Day so we have celebrated it at Sea.  We also passed the Star of Australia.  We have a fair sports programme on for today so as to remember the Day of our Native Land.  We fell in on the boat deck at 10 oclock &amp; was given a list of sports.  Most of the Lads who were fairly fit entered their names.  2 oclock started the events, Tug of war won by South Aust.  Drawing the Pig (game of bull), Bun &amp; treakle race &amp; a nail driving Competition for the Nurses.  In the evening we held a Competition of Comic &amp; sentimental Songs.  At 9 oclock the prizes were distributed &amp; we finished up with a speech from the O.C. of the troops so I think we kept up our day fairly well.  (We are just about fifty miles from (Dakar Island) where we are going to put our Gun off. 27-1-16 today.)</p>
<p>27-1-16<br/>Have arrived at Dakar, Africa west coast.  Arrived at 11 a.m.  This country looks well from the boat.  all our officers have gone ashore &amp; we are left here on board, expect to go out tonight.  Dakar harbour is artificial composed of a breakwater.  Cheif products Nuts, monkeys.  Languages cheifly spoken are French &amp; Spanish.  Fever is very contagous here, Whites suffer considerably. Moved out of Port Dakar at 6 p.m. 27th Jan.  Senegal is the town.</p>
