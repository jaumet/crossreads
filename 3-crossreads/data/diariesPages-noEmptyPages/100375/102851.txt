that we were going. We had a pretty stiff climb up on to the moorlands. Destruction was to be seen all along the way, remains of ammunition, and equipment, the trees were stript of their branches and foliage, but one thing remained and that was the beautiful mountain air.
After we passed Herbecourt we were fortunate in getting a lift on a Motor Lorry which took us to Peronne.
Four bridges that had been destroyed by the Germens in their retreat were being rapidly rebuilt by our engineers
There were large numbers of troops employed here clearing the roads and making them fit for traffic
After having general look round the town, which we found like the rest of towns we had seen lately, nothing but a mass of bricks and mortar we retraced our steps back to the tumble down hut of the Y.M.C.A. and there had a cup of tea and biscuits. The hut was crowded with troops, a thing one meets with wherever a YMCA Hut is, thus going to prove, once again, the value of these places to the troops
On our way to the hut we passed the No 12 C C S and No 53 C.C.S. and I noticed on the railway an Ambulance train this proving that the railway is clear up to Peronne
