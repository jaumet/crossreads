<p>Dear Arch, Lynda and Children</p>
<p>By the time you get this letter I will be well into some of those squareheaded - or in some Hospital, bear in mind I&#39;m mot going to Pati, I tell you to look forward to seeing me in a couple of years time.</p>
<p>It just reminds me, when Lord Nelson sailed the Fleet up the channell for seven years until the men were hardened and fierce, well we are doing the same, I tell you it&#39;s very trying but nevertheless I take it all in the best of Spirits and not at all down hearted, there&#39;s snow a foot thick now and the tucker is not the best, that bit of traning (silent traning) I had come&#39;s in very handy, you remember it, 3 weeks on frozen milk and Pork (Frity?)&nbsp;I tell you I often wish I had some more of those &quot;Gallipoli&quot; sausages</p>
