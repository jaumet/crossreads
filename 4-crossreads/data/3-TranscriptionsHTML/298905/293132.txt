<p>should have seen the buttons flying off the cover, it took us 25 sec's to get them on not so bad I reckon but there is no time to lose once the alarm is sounded, for a mouthful of the stuff is about enough to settle a man for life.<br/>The weather is still holding fine, it was a little cloudy today but nice &amp; warm, just right for us.<br/>24th. Nothing much doing today except for the usual bayonet &amp; rifle drill, &amp; physical exercise first thing in the morning. Mr Graham our officer wants me to take the sec. of our Platoon. I have not made up my mind yet. I don't care much about the job.<br/>The cricket match will have to be postponed for to-night I believe we have to find 100 men for a fatigue</p>
