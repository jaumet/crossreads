18 September 1918WednesdayMaking good progress with fair weather and a smooth sea Nothing of importance to note. No war news. In sight of the coast all day.
1918 September 19ThursdayPassed Cape Otway about 8.30 A.M. Entered Port Phillip Heads about 3 P.M. Anchored near Port Melbourne about 6.30 P.M. Excitement seems to be running right through boat. It is a fine homely sight to see the numerous lights along the foreshore of a house. Port once more & a relief to know that we are at our sea journeys end.
