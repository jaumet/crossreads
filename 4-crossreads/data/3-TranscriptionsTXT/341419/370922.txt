It is very circumstantial too.  For they say that some of the 1st Bgde. saw the flash of the gun at Shunet Nimrin & laid information & hence the battery opened & got him.  Certain it is that they engaged him all right, that was obvious but if they succeeded in knocking him out well - they were lucky;  one gun is not a large target at about seven miles.
Of other news there is not much.  The Battle section of Des. Corps H.Q.s & the big evacuating motor Ambulances from the Anzac Clearing Station have all gone to Jaffa, which points to something big happening there.
