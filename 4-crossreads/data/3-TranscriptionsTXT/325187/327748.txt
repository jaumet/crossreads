 [Monday January 2 1916] 
 Went Alexandria to see about Brigade Baggage in Anzac-  A good train runs &amp; a Hamper can be ordered en route so I travelled  in  de luxe  The delta is all green now with growing crops-  Found the wharfs covered with Kits, Guns, Rifles, etc etc, &amp; after sorting thro' large quantities found a few Signal Troop Baskets of Lamp Helios etc:-  Much Baggage had been broken &amp; looted en route all jumbled up together &amp; lying in Pools of Water, as it has rained all day. I do not expect to find any of mine, I am getting too old a soldier to worry about Kit now, Cut the loss &amp; buy some more &amp; be thankful you have your own carcase.
