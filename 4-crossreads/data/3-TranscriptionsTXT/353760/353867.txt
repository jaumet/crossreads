February 27, 28readers, and quiet yarners, then Basil at the piano, and Vin or Roy singing, the evenings here have passed quickly and well, now for war work again, and the faint ticking of rain is over the hut.
February 28195.Last night the best 'rough house' for ages.  Johnny under compulsion "Why Whunded".
A night of hellish nightmare, and today a slight touch of Trench Fever.  Packing all finished - C Section already moved off for M.D.S. Kemmel.  We tomorrow morning.
Books distributed amongst Drugs, with A.A.D. Room staff, and O.R. boxes.  A lovely April day of sun and white clouded skies, twice it has snowed slightly and now the light over the country is clear and rich with fine colour.
No mail, expecting W. Watson's "Father of The Forest".
Ends February at R'Avelsburg.
MarchMarch 3At the M.D.S. in Kemmel, Belgium.196.On the 1st at 10 a.m. relieved at Ravelsburg by 4th Field and a marching to here taking over M.D.S. from 13th F.A.  Arrived here with Temp. of 102.5 and a fair dose of Trench Fever, admitted to hosp. and "still going strong".  The Col. just blew in.  "How are you, Sergt.?" to Frank K, - down with Flue" - and you, Molony, both feeling better? eh, eh?" - and he had blown far along the duckboards.
197.This is a quiet front.  On the night of the 1st the Boche raided as our Battalions were changing over - 1st Div. relieving the 4th - he broke through to a Company H.Qtrs. and our guns opened the concerted argumenting and for over an hour the world trembled to their individual recoils.
"Gheitz" of the stunt are vague:  but evidently he attacked up to Passchendaele and by reports his losses far heavier than ours.  Snow fell yesterday.
