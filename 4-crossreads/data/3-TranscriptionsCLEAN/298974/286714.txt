6For two days we were quarantined so we had no leave. Then we got 4 days. Of course we all made off immediately for London. They paid us the measly sum of 4 to 'do' London on. But we had one free ticket to take us anywhere & back on the British Isles, and as many half fare ones as we wanted. I got my free one to Cambridge via London, so needed no others.
Well, you'll just simply have to wait till I get back to hear what we did & saw in London. But those four days were absolutely the best days of my existence so far.
