Voting took place today on the Conscription Referendum; personally I should like to see Conscription come into force, &amp; of course voted accordingly; there is something to be said for both sides of the  country  question, but I think the pros outweigh the cons. I am keeping in splendid health, &amp; so far have been quite free from colds, &amp; coughs, I am thankful to say.  I was noticing the other day that the hole in the drum of the ear that Dr. Verge attended to about 6 months before I enlisted has closed right up.  Whether it has grown together or whether is has filled up with wax I can't say but I never have any trouble with it.  I haven't seen anything of Walter for close on a month now, but heard a few days ago he was O.K. Must close now with love to all at home, Your loving son, Leo.
