average is much more hilly down here than the north, we put the night in the train & we were very tired by the time we reached Etapes which was day break, here we got out & were sorted out.  I took charge of the 1st Div details & marched them up to our camp, where we were all fixed up, saw quite a number of our chaps down here some "swinging the lead" & some strutting about with "bucksheesh'  Sgts stripes up, they don't kid themselves either
