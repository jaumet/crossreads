Revielle at 5.15
76 wks from home
Same old caper, men horses went out to the palm grove where I rode out at lunch time, had a swim then turned the bike for home arriving there a quarter of an hour later to find all the boys asleep.
Telegrams came through from the CO saying that he had received command of C Troop only under McColl so I guess E.W.D. will have something to say to that.
This troop is going to be commanded by a Lance Corp of the 2nd Sig Troop so I think the troop will not benefit by the change, but I guess we will get our own way as usual if not there's likely to be a misunderstanding somewhere.
Played Australias National game for a couple of hours then went to bunk at 10.

Revielle as per usual
Same old caper exercising horses taking out stuff to the boys taking things easy whilst there, the only thing of importance is that a flea plague has visited us the boys are bitten to bits, they are of the tick family can be caught easily. 
Motoring today was a brute as the thero registered 115 in the shade we are nearly blistering with the heat.
Aeroplanes over today but they never landed so we heard no news. Freddy met with an accident whilst watering his horse, she pig rooted threw him against a tree injuring his chest slightly but nothing serious.
Fly's getting as bad as last year they give the horses what:oh, nevertheless they keep your thoughts occupied, played cards at night turned in at 10.
