<p>through to the Brigadier, and we saddled up again and made a bee-line for the camp over the sand-hills, getting nearly choked on the way.  All sorts of rumours flying about as to going to the front.  Hope they are true.</p>
<p>8th<br/>Struck tents and cleaned the lines.  50 re-inforcements arrived in camp.  Our machine gun sections warned to be ready to leave for the front tomorrow.</p>
<p>9th<br/>Fell in for church parade.  The hymn "God be with you till we meet again", was sung in farewell to our machine gunners.  The last time I heard that was when the Suevic, with on on board drew away from the wharf in Sydney, 20/12/14.  In the afternoon the Brigadier, Colonel Ryrie, made a speech to the machine gunners wishing them luck, and they marched away to the station in a perfect storm of cheers.  They are the first of our Brigade to go into action and may God's grace and mercy go with them.</p>
