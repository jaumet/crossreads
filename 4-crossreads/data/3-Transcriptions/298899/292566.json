<p>mean another 1/6 a day but the A.D.M.S has refused to grant it, altho' the promotion has been given in the divisions.  Only last week a L/cpl was promoted to Staff Sgt &amp; the Colonel hearing of this personally approached the A.D.M.S explaining the injustice to myself.  He admitted the injustice but showed that if he granted the promotion he would render himself liable to have to pay the difference himself.  As things now stand 4 divisions of the A.I.F. grant it whilst 2 refuse, a ridiculous state of affairs &amp; injurious to me as I thus lose my seniority.  More Australian mail today so feel well set up.<br/>Tuesday 28th. Aug.<br/>  Had rather a miserable day.  In order to rehearse the divisional inspection we marched out at 8 A.M. a distance of about 4 miles and just when we reached the place word came that it was postponed until the afternoon.  It was raining practically all the time</p>
