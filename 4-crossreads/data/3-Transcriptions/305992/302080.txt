<p>gun drill. Since we left Basra 8 days ago we have had only 10 of the troops in the hospital during the whole time &amp; these are suffering from minor complaints, so that the health of the troops are splendid.<br/>Living on curry &amp; rice &amp; pancakes 2 meals a day &amp; no variation in this respect. They are very peculiar as regards their religion &amp; habits, for instance whilst they are cooking a white man's shaddow must not fall on their food &amp; the same thing applies whilst they carry the food along the deck. They always keep the sun side to avoid the shaddows. Some of the castes (yet of the same rating) would not cook, clean up or do any work in the respect of a servant.</p>
<p>22.10.18<br/>Steaming up the Red Sea, temperature 96&deg; very warm &amp; muggy. No war news on account of atmospheric disturbances, lightening, showery &amp; muggy. All troops doing well but very trying &amp; impossible to sleep or keep below decks for the temperature is too high. Troops drilled throughout the day. Canvas water swimming baths</p>
