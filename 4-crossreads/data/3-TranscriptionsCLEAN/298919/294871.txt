  
 knots cannot be kept up for the whole trip as the extra 2 knots would mean a saving of about 10 days on the trip.  Throughout the morning the sky was overcast, but the sea perfectly calm.  This in the Bay of Biscay surprises the most seasoned mariner.  There is not the slightest doubt about it that this is a fine weather ship, for we have not had one really boisterous day since leaving Australia.  At 5pm we overhauled a steamer which had been in sight since before noon.  She was the most peculiarly built boat I have seen having 7 pairs of masts, and built turret fashion.  We must have been doing very few revolutions more than she because we only passed her after chasing her all these hours.  When relieved at 8pm I went down to the C Engineers room for a while wher[e] he, 2nd Eng & Purser were playing Banker.  Then up on the bridge for a while before turning in.
