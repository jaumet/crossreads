light job to do such as cleaning up the grounds, collecting tools & etc. one thing & another you are kept going all day & well into the night though I could not complain about my job today.
Saw 2 Taubes & one of our machines brought down today.
Fritzie has been dropping some more heavy shells quite close to us tonight they make the ground fairly tremble.  Was rather a nice day, but tonight it is raining once more.
Put all the evening in playing Bridge again, it passes the time away.  Lindsay Graham & Digby came back from the School today, & Arthur Sands sent on "leave".
The Band was going strong again tonight up at the Pioneers Batt.  I suppose they were having another spread.
