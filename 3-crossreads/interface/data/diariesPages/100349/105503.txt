30/4/18.
The gale has been blowing for three days now. It is giving us a most uncomfortable time in our crowded quarters. We do not get much to eat and have a wash sometime; we ship a wave occasionally, and it makes up for the deficiency of water. Many of the chaps are afraid the ship will capsize; she does roll very badly, But the old hooker is battling along at a fair speed. I like to stand for hours by the forward rail of the Promenade Deck to watch the flying spray and spume and swing with the ship as she rolls over giant combers, that seem to tower over us one moment then, rush beneath the ship leaving a great valley into which we sink. I think this storm is the most fascinating thing I have ever seen. A good sailor was lost in me.
