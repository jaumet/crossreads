<p>L'ESTRADE<br/>[9th July contd]<br/>About 8 oclock the Royal Irish Rifles Fritz under a heavy barrage &amp; cut him to bits holding the trenches subsequently.</p>
<p>Tuesday 10th  [July]<br/>Changing over today.  Two of our Sections to proceed to L'Estrade  D.R.S. &amp; one Section to Bailleul  D.R.S.  The 11 Fld amb to carry on at Westhoff Farm.</p>
<p>Wednesday 11th<br/>March fron Neuve Eglise to L'Estrade.  When we had almost arrived at Bailleul Rd the Hun commenced to lob some 8inch (?) stuff across for horse lines &amp; cross road apparently Capt Bartram [?] who i/c therefore took us round the shelled area &amp; thereby lengthened our journey considerably.</p>
<p>Thursday 12th<br/>Have the job of D.P.M.C.[?] or acting Bob Thomas to the unit &amp; on that account had two trips to Bailleul for mail.  On second trip we stopped at Steenwerck on return journey (Chas Hamblin &amp; I) &amp; had a good hour of French domestic life. It was great. All the males were at the war &amp; here was this old lady &amp; her young daughter carrying on &amp; looking pleasant.   The garden was beautiful.  Chas cousin was billeted here.</p>
<p>Friday 13th<br/>Heard some bad news of a repulse at  Nieuport &ndash; which is regretted.  1250 prisoners taken.  Position isolated by enormous barrage by enemy.  Only a local affair though.</p>
