  
 We are getting into hot weather again.  We hear we are calling at Malta- aren't we lucky- we missed that on the last trip. 
 Wednesday 28th On Monday morning early found us anchored  at  in the grand harbour at Malta & at 10 a m we went off in pretty little boats to the shore.  Another sight-seeing day.  Sister Barron & I went off together we first had a drive around the town- then went to the Military Hsp. to see if there were any Australians there & discovered they had been transferred the day before- but the majority of the large buildings having for the time being been converted into Hospitals & there being 15 in all we coulden't possibly visit the lot, though we learnt later that there are a lot of our boys there.  Then we looked at those enticing shops & how I wished my pocket-money hadden't been so low so as to have purchased the cheapest & lovliest Maltese lace work.  The town Valletta is full of it.  This Island of Malta is most interesting.  In the beginning itself it was a barren rock 22 miles long & 8 wide- no soil at all.  The Venetians brought it all there as toll when they came.  The scenery is exactly the reverse of England- the tiny patches of brown soil surrounded by rather high stone walls.  Grapes, figs, melons & tomatoes grow in abundance.  It's so funny you see goats everywhere- they meet you at the boat, in the streets, at the shop doors etc.  After enjoying a delicious cup of tea- we intended to spend the afternoon at some cultivated gardens.
