<p>on the Menin Road. Got our gear together and moved up further; to camp on dugouts on the Yser Canal. Have a good possie.<br/>3/11/17<br/>Still hanging fire here. The railway construction job is finished there are more stiring things forward. Went for a bath. Met Syd Chisholm and George Doyle, they have just returned to the Battalion. Paid 20 Franc's.<br/>4/11/17.<br/>Drew our fighting gear; bombs, grenades, etc. Was inspected. Warned to proceed to the line in the morning. I have slipped a lot in condition lately. Went and saw the new O.C. about my promotion, he reckons that it has not been gazetted yet. Captain Hewish's death was a great loss to the company. He was a very fine solider.</p>
