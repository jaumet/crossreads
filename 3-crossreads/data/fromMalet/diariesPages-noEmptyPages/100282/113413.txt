23rd. Discharged as cured this morning from 1st Field Ambulance rather too rapid I think to be permanent, I'm certain that they will break out again After leaving I walked about 4 kilos to our Camp wasn't it cold, but I soon warmed up once I got going, the trees looked very pretty loaded as they were with the white hoar frost, looked more like as if there had been a heavy fall of snow than anything else, only the hard dry appearance of the road ground exploded that idea, for everything was frozen as hard as steel.
There was a little incident that happened in Paris that I had forgot all about I think it is worth mentioning, it concerned both Frank I, we were returning from the Opera it was about 12 oclock previous to this Frank had complained about feeling sick dizzy while in the theatre but he reckoned on coming out into the cold night air that he felt better so we took a tube all went well till we got right to the Place de la Republicque
