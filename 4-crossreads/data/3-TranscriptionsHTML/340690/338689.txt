<p>Mail in.  Out at 9 and with whole section but 2 carpenters Doyle &amp; Carter stopped at C.H.Q. and some others on wood chopping to block road.  Followed trench round on right after having some hurry up past C.H.Q. as the fire shewed us up coming over rise.  Whizz bangs and machine guns.  Digging a new hop over trench on right and did about 6 yards each.  Told we would have to work till morning.  At battalion one shell fell very close and during night snipers and machine guns were rather disconcerting.  However stopped at 2 and home with some argument by Jacobs &amp; Sarre about way.  A lot working on trench including miners, and infantry.  Home old way very tired and soon to sleep.  Bailleul as last night still burning very fiercely.  Drizzle all night.</p>
<p>23.4.18<br/>Stayed in bed all day and only left time for a wash and to clean my rifle which was in a bad state.  Out at 8.15 but some of us, myself included at 8.45.  Most going out with No. 4.  Toogood &amp; Bailey with me and usual carpenters and woodchoppers.  Went out with Kernot new way straight through crossroads and over fields.  Past battalion and straight on over hill to "C" Company headquarters.</p>
