Sunday August 19thA lovely day. A boat roll was expected out today, but so far hasn't some out, three more are expected this week. Went to church in Y.M.C.A, very good service. Played cards this afternoon. The English people here seem very fond of bike riding, as nearly every one has a bike & no wonder too as they have love smooth roads, just the thing for bike riding.
Monday August 20thThe boat roll came out this morning. There are still a good few men in camp here to go home. Had to go before the Medical Officer this morning, to see if I am fit to do gymnastics. Everyone who is going back to Australia have to do exercises, so as to develop the system, & so they would not be a cripple all their lives. I was classed as unfit to take on exercises. My word we get splendid food here, it is absolutely the best I have had in the military. The O.C. (a Colonel) personally examined the food today at dinner time.
