<p>3 April 1915<br/>Saturday<br/>Revielle at 6.<br/>I accompanied Sgt Masters &amp; the troop details into Cairo last night they caught the 3.20 am train &amp; had to entrain at 12.30. The full news of the Battle of the Wog have come to hand the casualty list is as follows killed :- 2 Red caps 1 NZ  1 Australian (Mena) &amp; 1 Manchester. I had to run round the battlefield &amp; to judge by the debris things must have been humming some, there's hardly a whole window in that quarter. All leave is cancelled &amp; hear that all troops are to get CB. Infantry leaving in droves for [indecipherable] &amp; I met Teddy H who is to embark on the Minnahousta on Monday for Syria. 60,000 Manchester arrive to give a hand against the Turks. Motor cy's to remain at Base. Bed at 8.30.</p>
<p>4 April 1915</p>
<p>Easter Day</p>
<p>Revielle at 6.30<br/>Stables, stables always bally well stables each man has two or more gee's so of course have to keep their back bent. I wrote home &amp; to Nell also forwarded photos. The boys (wireless) have gone to a place called Lemnos its an island about 40 miles south of the Dardenelles the island is 20 miles square two stations are here &amp; the other two are on the main land, the work they are doing is signaling the result of the firing back to the warships. We hear that the 8th Brigade is there also. The C sigs &amp; Bert M have been attached to Army Corps HQ permanently so we cant hope to see them again here. The LH Bde is to move to Alexandria when the Inf have got clear we may not be wanted for weeks worse luck. We had the afternoon off thanks to M Bell Bed at 9.30.</p>
