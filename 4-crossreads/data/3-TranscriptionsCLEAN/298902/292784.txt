French officers with a wife on arm would pilot the said wife in our direction & so on.  This went on until midnight when I was tired to death & had had enough.  Up at 6 in the morning. 
 Monday 18th Nov:  the day of my return & had to rise at 6 in order to catch my train.  Paid my account, tips etc & caught the 7.45 A.M. to Gamaches which I reached about 12.30 reaching my unit an hour later.  For breakfast I had 2 small rolls so enjoyed a good dinner which I was fortunate enough to find ready.  Found that we were under orders to move to Germany so had to get into the collar immediately
