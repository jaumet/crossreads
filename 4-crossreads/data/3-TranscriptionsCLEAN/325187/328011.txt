[Monday 25 September 1916]
Went 160 miles per car with Mr & Mrs Ferrar to the Giants Causeway- went via Coast road & returned via Ballamena & saw Sir Sam McCaughy's birthplace-Ireland's green is very restful after the Sinia Desert & I enjoyed it all immensely.so Had lunch  at Larne where the guns were landed by the Carsonites before the war- you remember the gun running- I'll make one to sign the Covenant against Home Rule in the North.
