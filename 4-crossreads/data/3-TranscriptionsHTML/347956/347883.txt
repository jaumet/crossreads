<p>until after midnight;  It was 2 AM when we arrived back in camp, &amp; had to go to bed hungry as we could get no bread;  The ground was hard &amp; the picks blunt &amp; we had to sink the trenches 4 ft 6 in deep, &amp; we just about knocking when we got back &amp; took no rocking to sleep</p>
<p>Tue 9th<br/>Were hauled out at 6 o'clock this morning as usual, &amp; had another Brigade scheme;  we were marched out to where we sank the trenches last night &amp; had to fill them up again; so it is a bit of a mugs game digging trenches in the night &amp; filling them up in the day time.</p>
