 Dear Captain Peters, 
   
    I have to thank you for your letter of December 7th and regret that we have troubled you in regard to your records during your busy period.  Although we are anxious that eventually copies of all your papers will be included in the War Memorial Library, there is no great hurry for these to be handed over and the matter may well await until your slack period - if any. 
   
    With best wishes for Christmas and the New Year, 
   
 Yours sincerely, 
  J.S.Treloar  [signature]
