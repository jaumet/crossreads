<p>wounded &amp; dead this morn, some horribly messed up. A Sniper put in some good work on the opposite bank while we waited to go up to trenches. Got one fellow through the upper leg whom Balmer carried down at some risk. The next got it as far as I could see in the stomach &amp; he was bandaged up in his dug out &amp; Robinson helped to carry him down. He looked to have got it badly as we saw him later at the F H &amp; he was like death then</p>
