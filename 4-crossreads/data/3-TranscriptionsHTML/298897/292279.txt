<p>buying some drink &amp; tinned fruit &amp; charged through &amp; smashed some guy ropes but I was able to stop them before that had gone any distance.  We arrived home in the cool of the evening about 7 oclock.  Everywhere I went they were talking of our early embarkation so we are naturally looking forward to it with high hopes.  We had two interesting items read to us in orders.  One was that fishhooks might be found in Davis brand of bully beef &amp; that great care should be taken when corresponding with people who wish to write to lonely soldiers.  Lonely soldiers letters are to be stopped altogether as they fear information is leaking out to spies who style themselves sympathisers with lonely soldiers.  [indecipherable] there is some leakage of information as precautions <strike>means</strike> are being taken to prevent further leakage.</p>
<p>Tuesday 16th May<br/>Made a start in the dispensary &amp; was not sorry either as the weather is astoundingly hot.  Reveille now at 4 A.M. which makes the day very long.  We had several cases of heat stroke brought in during the day some of which played up in an alarming manner as they had had recourse to the wet canteen</p>
