<p>3/3/16<br/>Spent the morning's half holiday recovering from the effects of the preceding night's experiences. A hot day with a wind full of sand which penetrated everywhere and spoilt all food. The last night and day have nearly killed all our trenches and the shape of Hogs Back is completely altered, a valley having formed down the middle.</p>
<p>Had early lunch 1100 and rode out to front line the company coming afterwards. All the outpost withdrawn and with improved targets we carried on with musketry firing out into the desert. The wind abated in the afternoon and the shooting was not too bad. Marching across the desert we found its appearance quite altered with drift sand and firm underfoot. Against each tuft of grass had grown quite a small hillock &ndash; these big sandhills are built up in this simple way. A row of small scrubby bushes and a prevailing wind are the two requisites. A small mound grows up over the stopwind of bushes and mounts up like a growing mountain with fresh deposits.</p>
<p>Our wags again. We are in the wilderness of the Children of Israel and Moses and the wandering of the Chosen People are frequently discussed. A sentry challenged a moving figure in the pitch dark of a night or two ago. "Halt! Hands up"! Who comes there?". "Moses"! was the reply. "<strike>Advance</strike> Pass Moses &amp; hand over the Ten Commandments". Yesterday I sentenced 2 men for talking in the ranks to 3 days Field Punishment No 2. When read out on parade "pour encourageur les autres", - I heard one remark. "There you are: Joe, got mentioned in b &ndash; despatches!" .</p>
<p>Notice camel drivers though of the lowest type and half imbecile snatch any spare moment, such as while their camels are being unburdened, for prayer. Five times a day from Russia to South Africa and from Sierra Leone to China, do the faithful turn in devotion towards Mecca in obeisance to a small cube of black stone there.</p>
