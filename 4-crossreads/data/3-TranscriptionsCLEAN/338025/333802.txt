 Painting notice boards for Officers quarters2pm left camp with waggon. Arrived Howe Dump about 4pm where we took on a load of ammunination for 105th Batter, Very heavy traffic going through Ypres. It took us about two hours getting through.  After a great number of stoppages we arr at battery about 8pm. Fritz shelling us going home a few landed in front of us and we had a great job trying to dodge the shell holes. When we got on    road we had to pass through the 2 smouldering timber of a dump (which Fritz had dropped a shell into it about 20 minutes before). A few yards further on the road blocked with wagons, timbers etc (all knocked about with Fritz shells) tried for about 1/2 hour to get clear but impossible so unhooked donks and left waggon as the shells were landing all around us. Seven of our wagons were left there. After a exciting time we arr back in camp at midnight all safe.
