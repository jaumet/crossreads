Officers are having the time of their lives, we have been out here now 16 days and during that time no officer or N.C.O. has been near us (not that we want ?em) Certainly the Col. and Capt. Wooster did come down for about 5 minutes but as soon as they heard a bullet go off, they cleared for their lives. Finished off my weekly epistle to "M.S." and posted it. Went to Bed early as I've got a rotten cold.
Monday 9th 
Very quiet last night. Hooray, More mail in this morning Got 3 long letters from L. and 1 from N. also 2 snaps of the dogs. An officer Lt.Connor got his ankle smashed by a sniper and Bert Hunt and Co. took him in to the A.D.S. He had been waiting to put a German Sniper, out in "no Man's Land" and was just hopping back over the parapet when he got spotted himself. Wrote to France. Got papers from her this morning, which were mighty welcome as we are very short of reading matter.
Tuesday 10th
Woke up this morning to find unusual excitement just outside our dug-out. One of the Frenchmen who are digging drains in our lines, got shot in the leg by a sniper, and the rest of the crowd are buzzing round like a darktown Fire Brigade. No less than 10 of ?em knocked off work to carry him in to the D.S. just after breakfast one of the N.F.S. got shot through the shoulder, so that's No.2 hit to Fritz's credit already this morning. Billsy May and I were Cooks today and the food was so excellent that the rest of the crowd want us to give ?em lessons on Cookery. Write to Mother and Nell. The 24th came into the trenches to day and relived the 26th N.F.
