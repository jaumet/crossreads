 Early morning parade at 6.30 am followed by the usual morning parades later when triangle of error was done what time boots and gas helmets were also on issue. In the afternoon route marched again over the same ground as yesterday. The roll of guns came ceaselessly from the south as the battle goes on. The village of Harponville is a quaint small place with a "barny" looking church the spire of which is surmounted, like all French churches, with a large gilt tufty tailed rooster who perches on top of the cross. Very open rolling country this like that about Broadmeadows and eminently suited for open fighting. Heard today that the 5th Division were tidy up to some extent at Fleurbaix and poor little Norris killed.

 All night long an intense bombardment was kept up and some big stuff kept landing comparatively close with big thuds. The shelling was about 12 miles away and a constant roll of deep booms continued. Towards dawn it increased in ferocity and there was a furphey that our 1st Divn. attacked and were met with the flamenwerfer. Wounded men passing through all day. Being Sunday we slept in until late and then had a Battalion Church Parade. 
In the afternoon a kit inspection was held and some Australian tunics arrived. These were most welcome and were used to requip the officers and senior N.C.O's. A grey day today. A Taube came over this afternoon and gave the anti aircraft gunners some practice.

 A grey day. Slackening of artillery fire in front. Stood by for a route march but no orders having arrived at 10 a.m. we carried on with bombing and other work. Lyon having reported took charge of No. 9 platoon. Major General Legge, Col. Bridges an A.D.C. came round and dropped a few platitudes. Heavy bombardment in front all night vivid flashes darting up luridly. Quite a party assembled here in the evening we merrily gambled at poker till late, our batmen serving supper.
