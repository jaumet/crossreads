Quite well in health. Usual routine followed up to noon. Sea rough and very picturesque. The valley below seems to become more and more denuded of undergrowth daily and with its now well made and graded road is quite a different place to the scrubby and precipitous ravine up which we climbed a little over two months since
Some gift articles from Lady Hamilton's fund arrived and were duly distributed, some unpatriotic dog though having appropriated some money chutney alleged to be in the parcel when dispatched
The Valley full of men who are coming to take part of our line off us ? a good target for shrapnel but their aeroplanes have not been aloft today so the enemy gunners are probably unaware of their presence there. - After lunch some cold rain fell just enough to make the air fresher and the ground muddy and the sun shone out for the rest of the afternoon 
"Beachy Bill" rather busy but our artillery much more so it is said one of our shells the other day killed 5 Turks and wounded 27 others. The howitzers and the siege battery certainly do good work. A Turkish sniper got Todd "B" Co while emptying sandbags Probably served him right for exposing himself and he was taken away pretty bad, shot through back. Rumbling bombardment over towards Achi Baba. It is wonderful how used we now are to shells going overhead and give them no notice, and can generally tell by the sound where they are going whether ours or the enemy. When they start to get close one sits up and takes a little interest and wastes no time dreaming before diving into dugout.
