I am to leave by P and 0 Malta tomorrow. 19th  Left by train at 11.25 am for Tilbury and after passing through the usual formalities finally boarded the Malta. Towards evening we slowly dropped down stream and in the morning anchored off Deal.  20th Novr /17 Here we lay all day and at dark crept out to Plymouth.
