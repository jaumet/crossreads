<p>Saturday 22 September 1917<br/>One week gone &amp; very slowly.  Boat drill 9.30 a.m. then cabin trunk rifled &amp; all the "wanteds" brought to light.<br/>Played cribbage with Chap. Birch &amp; did well.<br/>Patience is my prayer and the game my unfailing resolver [?].<br/>For one hour with someone to talk to whom I know &amp; like, what would I not give.</p>
