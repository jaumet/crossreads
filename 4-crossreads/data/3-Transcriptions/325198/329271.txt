<p>19 March, 1916<br/>Gabul Mirium<br/>We put up three tents yesterday &amp; we had a gay go in the wind   Nothing to do here all day but we have to patrol the Canal at night  Johno &amp; Cameron are on duty on the post   Perce &amp; I were on last night.  We are having quite a good time  Cookie took on the cook house &amp; did great work to day.  Porridge, Bacon &amp; steak for Breakfast Curry &amp; rice at dinner &amp; steak &amp; tomatoes for tea.  Bread is a bit light &amp; we would have had plenty only the bally camel when coming across the crossing took it into his head to sit down &amp; think &amp; he could not be induced to shift for a while, so our bread got wet;</p>
<p>There are 21 of us here all told. Mr McKenzie is in charge.  There was also a nigger in charge of two camels but he stayed over the other side this evening &amp; Cookie is a bit anxious as to how we will get to morrow provisions.  The wind has dropped thank goodness I hope its warm to morrow, its too hanged cold to chance a swim so far.</p>
