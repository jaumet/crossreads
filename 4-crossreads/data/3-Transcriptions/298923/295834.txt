<p>17 June 1918 Monday<br/>Supposed to be relieved in 2 more days- one cannot get exercise in the Trenches-  Among reptiles around us is a lizard that makes a noise like a Cabby driving his horses or a Bird, I thought it the latter for a long time-  great collection of immense Scorpions Tarantulas etc:-  All hands fit &amp; well so far;  one man shot a hare another a snake-  Jacko is busy wiring his side &amp; so the days pass-  We stand to arms <strike>at 0320 or in Australian language </strike> 20 minutes past 3 in the morning, it is light then the days are long &amp; hot but nights fairly sleepable.</p>
