occurred to me that it would be interesting if the ghosts of the men who marched from Rimini could blow along and tell us what they think about it all. But the poor blamed ghost has no chance in the air now - his graceful wafting stunts are fini - he's too-too immaterial to compete with the modern war-angels.
These old Roman roads are now only Roman in origin - for the rest they have long since become plain macadam. But this straight sweep is grand. No wonder R.K. raves about his "rolling R.Rd. etc." There's no end to your view if you get high up - the road goes out before & behind, a shimmering snow white band rolling up hill & down until it dwindles to a silver thread in the haze. There's not even the deviation of a yard to relieve its rigidity. As for the ruins - well most English ruins seem the same....a litter of broken wall, a tangle of vines and rank weeds, mostly soil smelling & stinging if touched, an old boot full of ear wigs and the inevitable rusty jam tins. That's the picture. You hear of some old relic that you  must   see (for the sake of saying you have done so). You go to see it. And all you see is a heap of moss-covered  rubble
