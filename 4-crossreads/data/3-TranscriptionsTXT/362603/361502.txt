Arrived at Eastleigh at 12.30 A.M.  I had an Hours wait for a Train to Salisbury.  Arrived Salisbury at 2.30 a.m.   I left Salisbury on the Bike at 2.45 am & was snug in bed by 4 a.m.  I arose at 8 a.m. & went through the day allright & not being very settled in mind I could not write last night.  I went to the Pictures with Dave, Ellis having gone to Salisbury.  Now Ellis & Dave went to Scotland, (Edinburgh) this morning & will be about for 5 more days.  I went and played cricket to-day & we won by 30 odd runs.  I went in last & got 8 not out but I did not get the chance to bowl, "Have not been practising my fast bowling."  It is nearly 11 pm now, so I must wind up.  I am feeling well but oh, I do long to go back to Auntie again & then when I'm there I absolutely think of nothing else but Home in Australia.  Oh! I did have a lovely Time but
