The GrousersOh: we grouses w'en  we trudgeThough a sticky stream of sludge,And we mustn't light a pipe without permission:And we 'as our little chuntWen we 'as to sweat an grunt,With our pouches crammed with bloomin' ammunitionOh! We cusses till it's blueAt the daily round of stew,With a special cuss to fit the cook wot sent it.But you precious soon will find Quite a different frame o' mindIf we hears a fellow grouses as if 'e meant it.
We enjoys our little cussWhen the major makes a fuss,An' we likes our playful grumble at the colonel.An' we grouses good an' 'ardWhen we 'as to go on guard,While inspection makes us chunder most infernal.But although we grouse an' swearW'en outsiders interfere,They are given the straight office to be keerful:They receive a big surpriseW'en they start to sympathise -'cos it's just our funny way of bein' cheerful.
When we chunts with all our mightYou can bet that things is rightAn' there's nothing that's particularly riling.But w'en things is goin' badAnd we should be raving mad
