<p>1915<br/>Dec. 25 Sat.<br/>Considerably more cheerful than last Xmas Day spent on Troopship in Indian Ocean  - Palace very well decorated &amp; plenty of jollification (some of it rather boozy).<br/>Gifts were distributed. Practically nothing else but tobacco &amp; cigarettes &ndash; no earthly use.<br/>Had a very merry dinner in the Sergeant's Mess in the evening.<br/>Escaped early from the Dinner &amp; went into Cairo. Town crowded with troops (some the worse for booze). A few rowdy chaps pinched a motor car &amp; burnt it in the street while others sacked some houses of ill fame &amp; threw furniture etc. into the street. Plenty of military police but no use at all. Pretty disgusting.</p>
