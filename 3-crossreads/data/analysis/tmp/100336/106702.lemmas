 After walk a mile or two we sight a hous which answer his descript , but on go over to it we found it was occupi by Arab farmer . We spoke to them in Turkish but evid they did not speak Turkish for they spoke to us in Arabic , which we scarc knew a word of . We thought we had best get away while we were safe . After walk anoth 2 mile we came to a small villag just half a dozen hous . My mate decid he would tri his luck again at buy some egg and bread . I remain just outsid the villag and wait till he return . After half an hour wait he return with four egg and two juchupatti . We immedi set to work on them for we were raven by hungri . We still kept the onion in reserv . We move off again and had not gone far when just as we were cross a small ridg we found ourselv right on top of a militari camp . Our Greek friend had warn us of these camp . We could see the sentri post out we thought if we turn and went back they would have suspicion on us and come after us , so we decid to go straight forward into the dri bed of a small creek which we could see just to the left of the camp . We pass within 150 yard of one of the sentri but they took no notic . When we got to the creek we took shelter in the shade of the bank . We were pretti well conceal so we talk the situat over .

When the sheep had stray away for some distanc he went away . After anoth hour walk without meet anybodi we sight what we knew to be the town of Tarsus . ( 16 mile from Mersina ) We could see the chimney of the two cotten factori which we knew were there . It was about 3 p.m. we were go to have a hard tri to reach Tarsus by dark and attempt to buy some food . Just befor dark we came to a small orchard and we could see some fig tree and made our way over to them to see if there were ani but just as we were near them two men in a cart call out to us .

We arriv outsid Tarsus about 8.30 p.m. We made our way to sever hous but in each case we were met by savag bark dog and in our weak state we
