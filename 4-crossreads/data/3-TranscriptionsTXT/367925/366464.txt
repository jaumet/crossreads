Freeme (who had previously won the D.C.M) in fact who was the first man to get the D.C.M. on the Peninsular) left via our trenches &amp;amp; went out under cover of infantry fire to carry out the work allotted to them.Unfortunately a trench which was supposed to be unoccupied by the enemy had during the night filled up with Reserves of enemy Infantry.Lieut Street &amp;amp; Segt Freeme were a considerable distance in advance of their &amp;amp; were surprised to find the trench occupied. Lieut Street immediately grasped the situation &amp;amp; saw that if prompt measures were not taken the whole of the party would be wiped out.He at once gave the order to retire &amp;amp; he &amp;amp; Freeme opened fire on the enemy with their revolvers &amp;amp; threw what bombs they had at the enemy &amp;amp; during the confusion which prevailed the whole party made it safely back to their own trenches.At Three oclock the following morning Capt Lloyd in charge of 50 men charged the same position with disaterous effects to themselves 5 men being left dead on the field &amp;amp; almost every other man being wounded.Capt Lloyd was Decorated with the Military Cross for his Bravery but in my opinion Lieut Street was just as much entitled to honors as I consider his deed was the bravest that I saw.No. 762.
