 From Col Paton 
 To Col Holmes [VO DSO] 
 Have ascertained that town is very short of provisions and Chinese population have been giving some trouble on account of the shortage of food. A Temporary dressing station has been established at the Government offices which are also my headquarters for the present I have a small guard on the road leading from the wharf at the intersection of the first street about fifty (50) yards from wharf
