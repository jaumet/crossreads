 1915 Sep. 19 Sun. To-day 3 swims, 3 times out in one of the boats, a couple of walks round the ocean front &amp; another one over the Sultan's estate &ndash; passed away the best part of the day. In the evening there was a Service on one of the fine wide verandahs looking out on to the ocean &ndash; The Service went off with quite a swing. I am writing up my diary on the same verandah after the Service, having bid goodnight to my young Scout friends.
