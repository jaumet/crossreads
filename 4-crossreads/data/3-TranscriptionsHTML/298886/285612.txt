<p>15 minutes. "Jacko" is having the time of his life since occupying Qatia He wont have a leg to stand on soon. Those Turks must be in a fearful mental state by now.</p>
<p>Later 11 AM. Another of our planes just sailed over at great hegth [height] and has been dropping about 10 more bombs on "Jacko's" luckless head. One of our escorts going to Hill 110 last night with water for a patrol there got ambushed and about 4 of them are still missing The remainder got back by the skin of their teeth (as I write this the noise and crash of those frightful aerial bombs can plainly be heard although Qatia is at least 6 miles away) There must be something like 120 bombs dropped this morning already. The damage must be frightful but the moral effect is infinately worse. I think Qatia will be quite safe for us tomorrow morning I hope. so because its no joke standing out in the sun all day with no shelter for man nor horse as we were yesterday</p>
