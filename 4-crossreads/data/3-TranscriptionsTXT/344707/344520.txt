Inf supported by some guns and got near what is called the Balkan Gun Pits &amp; started to dig in when they were shelled by our own Naval Guns who made a mistake. Our men retired as they had no orders to hold anything &amp; lost 20 killed &amp; 108 wounded. The Naval guns were responsible for half the casualties.
