 10/3/17 On the whole the show may be described as rotten.  At the back is the promenade a very brilliant sight and nearly the whole audience repair there between the acts to stroll and listen to an orchestra there.  Throngs of girls &ndash; some very beautiful infest the place and persistently keep pestering you clinging on to belt and having to be beaten off almost.  The performance on the stage would not have been tolerated  in Australia first on account of its dirt (which had not even the redeeming grace of smartness) and secondly on account of its absolute weakness. 
 Most of the songs and gags were in French. The only bright spot was at the last when all lights were turned out and a girl appeared in the air sitting in a chariot on the end of a long pole.  This was thrust right over the audience and her feet brought just above the heads of the audience.  There was great competition to get her shoes and eventually she lost them both.  When the show terminated we set off for home and had to run the gauntlet of guides &amp; girls which took not a little negotiating.  Then to the hotel and well after the hour of midnight turned in.
