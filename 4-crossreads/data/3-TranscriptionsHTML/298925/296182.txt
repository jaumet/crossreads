<p>O how the Spring of love resembleth<br/>The uncertain glory of an April day<br/>Which now shows all the glory of the Sun<br/>And by and by a cloud takes all away</p>
<p>O Say not woman's false as fair<br/>That like the bee she ranges<br/>Still sucking flowers more sweet &amp; rare<br/>As fickle fancy changes<br/>Ah No The love that first can warm<br/>Will leave her bosom never<br/>No second passion ere can charm<br/>She loves &ndash; and loves for ever</p>
<p>If she be not fair for me<br/>What care I how fair she be</p>
