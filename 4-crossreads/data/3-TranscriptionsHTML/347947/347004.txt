<p>Misses of the house a nice old lady.  she was only too pleased to let me stay to if any money would come from home for me next morning Tues went out to the bank again but none had come so I put in the day at the anzac Buffet an nice place for Australians in London in the evening got another ticket there for a play at strand theatre playing "Mr Wu" a nice play.  after went back to russel square and told the Lady of the house I would not wait any longer.  I would go and report myself at Headquarters and forgo the rest of my furlough so next morning I packed up my kit after explaining that my mate would fix up for me</p>
