<p>a good chance of going to Blighty"<br/>It was one of the most wearisome marches as ever I have been on, for we held up every few hundred yards by the heavy traffic.<br/>At last we got on to the "Bazentin Road which carried us nearly to "Delville Wood" the place which cost so many men &amp; of all the sloppy dirty walks as ever I have been on well this one takes the bun, it was neither mud nor water but it was about the same thickness as cream, &amp; as we went along we got covered with white mud from head to foot, talk about a mess we were in you would scarcely have known us, especially some of the boys who came "gutsers" &amp; fell in the rotten stuff, well we reached our destination at last just back</p>
