I think my Camel has all the Ticks in the world judging by numbers I found on him this morning. On Picquet at night. Have christened my Camel Hobo because he hums. Thursday August 2 Leave to Cairo this afternoon. Visited Citadel where prisoners are kept. Well where Jacob was cast. Visited blue mosque & others. At Blue Mosque there is an Altar where cripples & sick people pray under belief they will be cured. A fine panoramic view of Cairo can be seen from tower of the Mosque
