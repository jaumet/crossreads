<p>whine of an aeroplane engine would be sweet music to your ears now &amp; the extreme quiet of the air &amp; surroundings would be felt by you. But still Colonel it is much the same here now no "A" or "Ax" no planes &amp; things very quiet &amp; above all lights &ndash; yes would you believe it Electric lights are shining out brightly nightly in the village where we are located. Glad to hear Geo Lee is still Commandant &amp; hope he continues in the job for years to come. Thanks very much for words of praise uttered to friends at V.B. regarding my work here but if I have satisfied you &amp; I hope I did that really is worth a lot to me for after all you were the one I worked for as you were my C.O. &amp; one I will always be proud to work under any time. Yes Rooney came to H.Q. at last &amp; still smiles as large as ever but I am afraid we are going to loose him on the 23rd as he is due for return to Aussie in next draft. Regarding the Rhine I am sure you would be just a little disappointed like most of us were &amp; are if you were here as we have not got as far as the Rhine nor is there any chance of us doing so we are in Belgium &amp; are being demobilized from here and as a unit are practically finished. I hope you enjoyed your furlough of 60 days but expect you found it rather tame over there being away from the old show. So Sutton, Hall &amp; others have arrived back in Sydney how do they like the change? See by the papers that Influenza is bad in Sydney hope you escaped free of it: wish one had some of the heat you write of it has been fairly cold lately</p>
