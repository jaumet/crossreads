bales of fodder built up to a considerable height fore and aft and were drawn by 2 horses arranged tandem fashion, magnificent percherous fitted with tinkling harness .From Arles the line led in a general N direction to Avignon which we reached at 8pm and thence went through to Orange, a further 1 1/2 hours journey. We quite begrudged the hours of darkness that prevented us seeing the country passed through. Arrangements had been made for a stop for tea at Orange, where after issuing rations and large quantities of hot coffee containing rum, we went to an hotel close by where a meal had been prepared for the officers. Heavy rain had been falling but it moderated sufficiently to allow us to get to and from the place without getting wet.There were many peculiarities in the meal. Soup was served in a tureen, each helping himself (or not) to the rather queer looking green thick soup. The bread was the light French make in the shape of a huge loaf and was voted first class. Next came pork and veal served in slices with gravy on a large dish; it was accompanied by oily looking salad. Sweets were missing but bread and jam and fresh colourless butter took their place. Wines were on the table and jugs of light beer provided as a matter of course without extra charge;  after some delay black coffee appeared but was scarcely a success.

We were most unfortunate in passing through this region during the darkness.Wednesday 5 April 1916 Awake at daylight after a good sleep on the seat and found that the morning was fine but cloudy. We were still going in a N direction but had left the Rhone and were following the fertile valley of the Saone. Although the hour was early there were already many workers out in the fields. Vineyards occupied most of the space.The river was perhaps 20 yds. in width and had much the appearance of a sluggish canal. There were numberless little tributaries flowing into it from its broad floodplain on either side which extended out to the foothills. The whole of this area being like a huge garden in which every available sq.yard was being utilised for some purpose. This indeed was one of the most striking features of the country. In Australia the train rushes through vast areas of land that are used for nothing, but in France it seemed like travelling through a long series of gardens of which the utmost use was made. Even railway embankments were planted with grape vines and the
