I send for an officer to tell him something and when he arrives stand speechless not knowing what to tell him and only long for a little rest away from things military in a peaceful region. 
 28/2/17 Much better. In camp all day and attended a lecture by Forbes on the need of better communication. Otherwise quiet in camp.
