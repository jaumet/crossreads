<p>1917 Wednesday 5 Sept.</p>
<p>Yet another brilliantly clear night.   as anticipated Fritz planes over again.   Several more bombs dropped &amp; some damage done.   They flew right over the hospital.   We almost had "Wind up".   Great activity of anti air craft guns &amp; search lights in vicinity.   Nose caps fall in grounds.</p>
