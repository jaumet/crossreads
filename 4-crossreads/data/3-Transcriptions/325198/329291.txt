<p>26 April, 1916<br/>Romania [Romani]<br/>We had the usual stand to at 4.30 this morning, but I was up a 2.0 on picquet &amp; feel a bit dozy on it.  We have watered the horses &amp; are having a bit of a blow, there is only tibbin for our neddies &amp; not too much but some one is going away for grain.  We had a laugh at too chaps coming in off out post this morning, they had two bints with them &ndash; All niggers are detained at the camp &ndash; After being on fatigue cleaning up the tents that the Tommies vacated I had some dinner then Joe Wood &amp; I went down &amp; had a wash at the wells by throwing buckets of water over one another &ndash; The water is not nice to drink but better than nothing.  Jack [Francis] Cheater our Q.M.S. has been out foraging &amp; came in with a load of tinned stuff &ndash; evidently these Tommy Officers lived high.  Some of the boys found a god lot of whisky, not I however.</p>
