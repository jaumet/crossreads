<p>During our stay the Fiji Banana Company thoughtfully presented some hundreds of branches of bananas to the ship&#39;s company, which was a greatly appreciated gift. It now appears that after we left Samoa the German Governor &amp; his Staff, with the manager of the Apia Wireless Station, were taken prisoners &amp; brought to &nbsp;Suva &nbsp;on board the &quot;Pyramus&quot;. They were to remain in the Grand Pacific Hotel for the present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sept. 4.</p>
<p>The following Friday morning we left Suva for Rossel Island, a small island situated off the South East corner of New Guinea. Our course led us through the New Hebrides group.</p>
<p>Sept.6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In these islands&nbsp;were several active volcanoes which lazily smoked &amp;&nbsp;cast a dismal pall over the surrounding land. The atmosphere here was hot, heavy, &amp; damp. It is scarcely two months ago since the sloop &quot;Torch&quot; was up in Malekula (New Hebrides) on a punitive expedition. A tribe had eaten a few missionaries, which seems to be a favourite pastime in these islands. Three days later we arrived at Rossel Island where we found the &quot;Sydney&quot;, 3 destroyers, 2 submarines, 2 transports, &amp; 2 colliers, waiting for us. One transport brought mails for us, which were the first letters we had had since leaving Sydney 6 weeks previously &amp; was, therefore, welcomed with huge delight. Without delay we pushed on to Simpsonhafen, New Britain, which was reached at 7 a.m. on Friday in glorious weather.</p>
<p>Sept. 11. &nbsp;There is a very fine harbour here, with deep water everywhere.</p>
