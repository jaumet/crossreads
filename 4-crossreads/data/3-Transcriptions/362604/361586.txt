<p>We were sorry that conscription failed.  Most of us here voted aye.  But it cannot be helped.  We have enough to go on with if you can only keep those blighters under in Australia.  We have only had 3 weeks winter so far.  The past week has been lovely spring weather.  To-day was glorious &amp; equal to a September day in our own Country.</p>
<p>I think it is waste of money nowadays Dad to send parcels.  They are nearly all put at the bottom of the Sea.  When you notify Jones' H.Q's that we can draw money we will avail ourselves of the amount.  I drew &amp;pound;10 last time I went on leave.  I spent nearly all of it.  Everything is such a frightful price over here.  I only buy the things that I can't <u>steal</u> so don't think that I'm buying things that are unnecessary.  I will not be going to the Island next time.  Those confounded Submarines have got the "wind up me".  I may go to see Jennie again this</p>
