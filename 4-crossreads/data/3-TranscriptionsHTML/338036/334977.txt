<p>Was detailed for night duty in operating theatre.  Was offered position of Lance Corp. but owing to previous treatment and the unfairness of Warrant Officer I saw fit to decline same with thanks.  Our chaps were so fatigued in Paschendale stunt that infantry were detailed to assist and conditions were so bad that if 2 trips a day were done it was considered good.</p>
<p>50&percnt; infantry chaps were killed &amp; the other half except a few could not be found anywhere so that our chaps had to carry on as best as possible.  Sam [Crook] was killed near a dugout just behind the new front line (Passchendale) and as the bearers could not work at night they were withdrawn &amp; Sam left in charge of about a dozen wounded men.  He was apparently in the act of getting them into shelter when killed together</p>
