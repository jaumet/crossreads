<p>My dear Parents/.<br/>The books mother sent me came to hand safely and I was delighted to received them. They are what I appreciate most just now but if you could post one now and again it would suit me better. As we are constantly on the move and have to carry all our own belongings it is difficult to keep more than what is absolutely indispensable. Hence it takes a lot of squeezing to get even one book in.<br/> I purchased "Micah Clark" by A. Conan Doyle about a month ago and had just finished it</p>
