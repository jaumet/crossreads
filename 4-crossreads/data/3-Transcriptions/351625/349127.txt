<p>I hear I don't think there will be much chance of us getting transferred &amp; if Hosier and a few others remain in the company I don't think we will try.  I believe they don't send any boys under 19 to the front but keep them here for guards and other such purposes.  I expect it will be 6 months before we get to France unless they want the reinforcements very bad.  I believe when we get out of the contact camp we have to put up our colors so when you get this we will be wearing purple/green so you can all put up our colors.  I have written to Aunt Gretta so if she has any letters for me I ought to get them tomorrow.  An Australian mail came in today but has not all been sorted yet.  I am hoping to get a letter by it or else from Aunt Gretta in a few days.  My ordinary address is still the same as when</p>
