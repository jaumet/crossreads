 Tuesday 18 September 1917 Bad, bad day.  Woke during night to feel decided roll &amp; pitch of our trustworthy "Ayrshire".  No attendance at any meals, stayed on deck 'till 12 m.d. then retired to berth &amp; stayed there, feelings not worth describing, read &amp; finished "Lost Prince" &amp; very enjoyable it is. Miss Roach otherwise known as "Cook's tourist" visited me with offers of foods, &amp; stewardess very attentive. Padre enquired for me l.d.s.  Still the young fry stands along the deck shriek with laughter over nothing in particular and strum at the poor piano.  Still it pleases them and does little harm.  Hear from the Chief Officer that he went home on the boat with Spence 1915 and that Argyleshire is not a wreck but will be out again.  Goodbye day.
