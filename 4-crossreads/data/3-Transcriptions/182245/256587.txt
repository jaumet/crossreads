<p>1917 MARCH</p>
<p>13 TUESDAY</p>
<p>Fine, but cloudy most of</p>
<p>the day. I went for a</p>
<p>bath parade in the morning</p>
<p>&amp; saw old Warren up</p>
<p>there. Cleaning my saddle</p>
<p>all the afternoon. There</p>
<p>was a big stunt on about</p>
<p>midnight but Fritz got</p>
<p>wind of it &amp; our infantry</p>
<p>could not get over.</p>
