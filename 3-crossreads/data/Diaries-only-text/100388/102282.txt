up on deck at 4 am to See entrance into the Sound. We dropped anchor at 6.35.
There are a few Small islands at mouth of Sound, one of which is Breaksea. There is a lighthouse on it, and is situated to the right as you enter the Sound. I have not seen any beaches like we have in Sydney yet; though I am told there is a nice one near the township. One of the Engineers caught a small shark about two feet long and the men started to cut it up alive. After they had ripped it up taken its tail off, they threw it back into the water.
1 pm. The Shropshire has just come into the Sound. There is another one following. Supposed to be the ?Saldanha".
There are now about 14 troopships in the Sound.
Officers went ashore returned to ship about 6.30. Rumours of march through Albany. I hope it comes off. The H.M.A.S. Melbourne arrived about 8 pm.

Heavy wind blowing. Sea rough. Orvieto and Geelong arrived about 8 am. There are other boats continually coming
