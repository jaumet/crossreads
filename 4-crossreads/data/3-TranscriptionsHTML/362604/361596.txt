<p>but that was nothing.  At the first stop I got up &amp; jumped into a second class carriage so I had a nice comfy bed then until I reached Eastleigh.  I had to change there &amp; wait another Hour for a Train.  I was quite awake after walking round the Station for an Hour.  I reached Salisbury at 3.45 a.m.  I lay down on the waiting room seat for an Hour &amp; a half &amp; then went for a walk round Salisbury.  I had something warm from an all-night coffee Stall &amp; some breakfast at 6 p.m. [a.m. ?] when a certain Soldiers Home opened.  At 6.30 a.m. I went up to Mr. Edmonds place to tell them why I had not been able to visit them.  I caught the 7.50 Train to Bulford &amp; arrived Home at 9 a.m.  I went straight to bed &amp; did not get up till dinner Time.  We are both well &amp; as I'm writing to Mum also I'll give Her any further news.</p>
<p>Kind regards to all<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Harry.</p>
