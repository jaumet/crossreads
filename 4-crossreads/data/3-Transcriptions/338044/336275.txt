<p>of German helmets etc. A most miserable day, Raining in torrents &amp; cold. Unable to work all the <strike>money</strike> morning in our "pleasant" barn, being almost frozen &amp; shivering all day. Great life this.</p>
<p>20th September:- Wednesday<br/>Another cold day, furious biting winds blowing &amp; simply sit down &amp; shiver all the morning. We do have some great times here, without a doubt. The rain enters our sanctum, but clears off altogether after lunch. One thing a fellow can appreciate here is our lunch which, in true English style, Mrs David prepares for us each day. Another notice calling for applications for training for commissions in the Royal Flying Corps. Great news from Serbian front, where the Servians are truly giving the Bulgarians hot &amp; at last regained. Our boys are doing well, all German attacks repulsed</p>
