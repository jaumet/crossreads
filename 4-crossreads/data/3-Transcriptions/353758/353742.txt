<p>27/5/15<br/>Went back to trenches on Quinns Post.</p>
<p>28/5/15<br/>At 3.30 a.m. the Turks blew up part of our trenches (both we and they have been sapping to undermine each others trenches) and rushed our trenches their front line throwing bombs the explosion throw up a lot of dirt and buried some of our sappers alive and injured some of our men in trenches and shook the whole of the top of the hill where I was some Turks got into our trenches but were all killed. Our chaps threw bombs and drove the Turks back again to their trenches. We lost some our men but the Turks losses were much heavier. At dawn our artillery started and poured shells over our heads into the Turks a treat. The attack was general but the main Attack was on Quinns Post. We kept at it like hell till about 9 a.m. When things quietened down a bit we got the dead out of the trenches and laid them on the hillside at the back of our supporting trenches. There were a good many of our chaps but a lot more Turks. The heap of dead was a very ghastly sight in the daylight as most of them were fearfully mangled by bombs. In fact no one could tell to whom some of the limbs belonged. Our Colonel was wounded on the arm by a bomb. We were relived about 4 p.m. by the light [Light] Horse chaps and went down the valley for a sleep.</p>
<p>29/5/15<br/>The Light Horse and others rushed and took three lines of Turks trenches in front of Quinns Post but had to retire later being enfiladed by the enemy.</p>
