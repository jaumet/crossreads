<p>March Thursday 22 1917</p>
<p>The wind dropped completely last night. &amp; a heavy fall of snow lay on the ground by morning, so soft &amp; lightly it fell. No one had any idea it had settled.<br/>A brilliant morning for a few hours soon overclouded &amp; intermittent snow again all day. <br/>Thirty 2nd Field bearers arrived yesterday to release the 4th Field Bearers who have been here for 3 weeks &amp; are going to Bapaume this morning. I suppose when the 1st Div, goes in again it will be our turn to "impati".</p>
