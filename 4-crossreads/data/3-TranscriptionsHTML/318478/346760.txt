<p>Having made a final sketch of Semakh where the 11th regiment with one squadron of the 12th Reg. both 4th Brigade, with 4th machine gun squadron attacked just before dawn on 25 Sept. 1918 &ndash; my conscience is easy, and also I felt very luxurious &amp; contented when I found that my two stalwarts could pack up &amp; get me ready for the road in double quick time.  The drive around Gallilee by the western shore through Tiberius to our present possy namely Jisr Binat Yakob was really a ride of joy to the artist and the knowledge that we were getting gradually above sea level was also encouraging &ndash; for Semakh is <strike>691</strike> 677 below.  The Sea of G. is 682.5 below, quite enough to remind us unpleasantly of the Jordan valley near Jericho and its 1292 ft. below.</p>
<p>At Semakh there were rumours of Arab stealings <strike>from</strike> &amp; a killing of one Jew from the Colony also the local Arab village lying between the Railway Station where we camped &amp; the Sea, had the wind right up &amp; sent a small boy to spread the glad news to the 3 pip Bim Bashi (myself) that at least a hundred wild Arabs from the hills were coming in to clean us all up.</p>
