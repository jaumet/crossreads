<p>it was all under water.   I have been very careful to guard against colds &amp; have so far escaped.   Whenever the air gets a bit chilly I put on the woollen sweater that I bought in Melbourne.  I am longing to get a batch of letters describing your tip on the Demosthenes.   There are lots of things that I would like to tell you about but our letters are censored &amp; there is no use wasting pen &amp; paper.<br/>I went last night to see the Sphinx by moonlight &ndash; it was quite a weird experience &ndash; the moon at its full &ndash; the wide expanse of sandy desert with here &amp; there the lights of some small Arab settlement &ndash; a group of camels &amp; donkeys &amp; their Arab attendants looming up largely on the skyline &ndash; in the distance the long straight sycamore bordered road to Cairo up &amp; down which went a never ending cavalcade of tram &amp; motor cars &ndash; right in front of us the imperturbable Sphinx with its background of pyramids.   Some natives for the consideration of a small amount of backsheesh started their magnesium lamps &amp; showed us how the Sphinx smiled.  On the way back two of us essayed the task of riding on a camel &amp; a queer experience it is.  I don't think I would like to make a very long journey on the back</p>
