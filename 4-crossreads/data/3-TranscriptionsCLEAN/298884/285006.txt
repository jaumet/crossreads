  
  3rd April   Instructions received from the Defence Department to the effect that we are to go to Fremantle where we will discharge all Western Australian troops & coal. 
  5th   Later instructions from Defence Dept. cancel our proceeding to Fremantle & order us to proceed to Albany.  The Western Australian people on board are very much annoyed about it. 
  7th   The first bit of Australia was seen this morning about 6 o'clock.  I saw it about 7 o'clock.  We passed Cape Leeuwin about 11 o'clock.
