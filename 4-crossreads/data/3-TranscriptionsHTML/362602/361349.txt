<p>Monday</p>
<p>At Sea<br/>26th day out</p>
<p>Dear Dad, Mother &amp; George,</p>
<p>I have kept a diary of a sort, which will give you a fair idea of my doings since we left Sydney.  We saw you (M &amp; G) on the Manly boat quite easily.  I suppose you saw us as we sat on the stern.  Billy also saw other people we knew on later boats.  At the time of writing this, we are a few days sail from our next Port but have not sighted land as yet.  All the sailors say that if we travelled for 20 years we might never strike weather like we have had.  We have not had a hot day or a rough sea or been left without a breeze.</p>
<p>Our mascot, Nigger the dog, fell down a hatchway &amp; has torn the tissues of his stomach &amp; he is paralysed in the hind quarters.  He may get over it but it will</p>
