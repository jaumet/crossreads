 Saturday 13th July A very quiet day fine & cloudy.  Towards evening had some excitement in the air which I will describe as I saw it. -  The hour is 8.30 P.M. & already night draws near bringing thoughts of bed.  Outside all is quiet save for an occasional gun firing and overhead to right & left are the balloons watching the enemy's lines, to pick out gun flashes in the gathering dusk & so locate their batteries.  Suddenly a shot rings out in the sky & I look up for the enemy plane which has occasioned it.  Bang, Bang, bang other guns have picked up the mark & I wait for the bursts to see where he is.  Ah! There he is  two of them, just coming out of the lowering clouds & both are diving at the nearest balloon.
