<p>Commonwealth of Australia<br/>Attorney General<br/>Melbourne, 27th August, 1915</p>
<p>My dear Ferguson</p>
<p>I am sending on to you a further communication I have just received from the Department of Defence respecting the training of troops despatched from Australia to Gallipoli.  You will see that in order to ensure a high standard of efficiency some recent instructions have been issued in the direction of materially improving the soldiers' knowledge of musketry before they leave Australia.</p>
<p>With kind regards,<br/>I am,<br/>Yours faithfully,<br/>W.M. Hughes</p>
<p>His Honor<br/>Justice Ferguson<br/>Judges' Chambers,<br/>Supreme Court, Sydney.</p>
<p>P.S.  I'm doing the best I can with the matters you send along:  but the Defence Dept. is very busy &amp; doing its very best, but of course the machine creaks a bit.  That is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Yours,<br/>W.M.H.</p>
