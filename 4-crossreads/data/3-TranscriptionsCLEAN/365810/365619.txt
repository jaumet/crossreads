London22nd November 1917
My dear Judge,
It is nearly two months since last I wrote to you and I can offer no excuse for this apparent neglect other than a general disinclination to letter-writing.  My unfitness, the effect of the knee trouble on the whole leg, rather than the knee itself, has kept me in England when I should have been in France, and now the arrival of winter has removed the prospect of useful work for me in any part other than the East.  Also London winter weather does not present outstanding opportunities for one to get rid of rheumatism.  It has been a much longer & more tiresome business than I ever expected and I am only kept up by the prospect of being able to get away to Egypt or Mesopotamia as soon as ever I am fit again.
The last letter I have had from you is dated Aug. 16.  This was in the middle of the strike and before Keith's arrival, of which I have since heard from Dorothy.  She spoke so cheerfully of his recovery and good health that I can hope that by this time he has been discharged from the hospital and is enjoying a well-earned furlough with you.
As I write now and look back over the past two months a very kaleidoscopic view of events is obtained.  In spite of our series of successful (though pretty expensive) "peckings" in Flanders and the considerable gains in the East, we are only just recovering from the feelings of depression produced by the German master stroke in Venetia.  The flood of Austro-German progress seems to have been pretty well held up
