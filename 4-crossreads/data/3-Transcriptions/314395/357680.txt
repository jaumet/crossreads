<p>hear from each other in letters we will have the pleasure of telling, when the job is through.  I had the full-length photo taken in Paris, and will send one on as soon as they arrive.  My weight when they were taken was 12.9.</p>
<p>I'm going to make another prophecy as to the duration of the war.  I give it until October 1918.</p>
<p>Best wishes for your welfare during the coming year.</p>
<p>Your affect. Son<br/>George.</p>
<p>P.S.  Shortly I will receive 10 days leave and as I expended that other money in Paris I will shortly cable you for some more.  If it is not convenient, I hope you won't send it.  But I am asking on chance, and, being confident of your approval, express my sincere gratitude in advance.<br/>G.</p>
