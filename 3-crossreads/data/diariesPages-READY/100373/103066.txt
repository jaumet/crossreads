April 1st Thurs. 2nd Frid.

Riot amongst some of the Aus – troops in Cairo.

April 3rd Sat.

All leave stopped.

Troops moving off to the front in high spirits, those not moving off are very disappointed. Animated scenes are being enacted. The bands are marching past playing inspiriting music and cheer after cheer is being raised as the battalions march away, to, no one except the heads know where. It is very galling to be left behind.

April 4th Sun.

More troops leave to-day. It is stated that we move off very soon. It is expected to close Mena House within 24 hours.

In "La Socurs" ward on my own to-day. Suffered terribly from mosquitoe bites last night.

Another severe sand storm today. More troops moving off.
