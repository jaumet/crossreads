January 191728th   I was put into Convalecent to-day which is a great relief after being in bed.  This afternoon I went for a walk into Albert which is only about a mile away.  I got a few interesting "snaps"  Albert is a fairly large town & although there are very few french inhabitants left the place is full of troops & very busy with motor transport.The ruined cathederal is the most interesting feature of the town.  Although once a fine building it is now a mass of ruins & presents a very wierd spectacle.  Many of the buildings there are in ruins & there is hardly a window in the whole town that is not broken.  Although the Germans still bombard it, the shells are few & far between.
