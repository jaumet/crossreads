<p>route and already the men who a few hours ago were in the thick of the fight were making their toilet; mirrors and shaving gear out. By the time you get this you will know much more than I do now, so, I won't bother you with more reports especially as they won't be too accurate; but I'm glad to be here for Aug. 8. '18. Our men are in splendid spirits and the Australian flag is planted many miles east of where the Hun lines were early this morning. The diggers are busy now, trading souvenirs; for the booty in that direction was huge. They want to finish him right off. What about stereotyped discipline now? Ours was so bad that, we had some spare time to consolidate. It's a case of "if whisky is bad for business; give up business". Anyway our brand of discipline suits Foch and what suits him will do the Australians. What a day. What glory!! It is said that a bunch of armoured cars was told to make for a headquarters and get it, or kill it, or something; but the little trinket that fires the 13 in. shells and is run by the handsome Goya like young French officer, got in first and dispersed, disintegrated, dissipated, pulverised, precipitated and annihilated the vile brood. How it shook this place! But it's lost its job now - its mark has been pushed back so far. "And that ain't the end of this terrible tale." I venture to gamble he's going to get a worse canning than to-day's. The air work was to me the most wonderful thing. These multitudes of planes were simply Carter, Patersons on wings; carrying ammunition, wire and rations to the forward lines; and as many were coming back as were going forward; all day long. Coming home the road was full of a never-ending stream of English cavalry going up to put on finishing touches. They were splendid men and splendidly horsed. They'll do great deeds. But you already know more than I do. We will be on the move again shortly. Much chance there is for calculating when canvases will have the chance to dry, or, whether it is safe to start new work!</p>
<p>France, 9/8/18.<br/>VILLERS BRETONNEUX.<br/>Most of to-day I was out having a look at things. I first went and saw a great mob of Boches being taken out of a cage and marched down the road. They were a big brand of Hun, a good many being well</p>
