wet ground in the dark. We got into our various position, sat down and waited. The ground was very wet. I was sitting in a pool of water. It was raining all the time and most of us were for wet through pretty cold. I was rather tired and despite my condition I doozed dozed off to sleep in the little shell hole. It must have been the rum.The attackThe next thing I knew I woke with a start to hear a terrific roar of guns violent rattle of machine guns. I was then wide awake and fully realised where I was and what was doing. It was a foggy, dark, wet, miserable morning. In front, in fact it seemed all round us, nothing could be seen but the flaming flashes of bursting shells and behind the tremendous rattle of machine guns. We had a machine gun barrage supporting us which was the greatest that has ever been fired. 6,000,000 bullets were fired in that barrage and in support to our battalion alone we had 4 brigades of field guns artillery apart from other bigger guns. The noise was awful. One could not hear one's own voice, much less anyone else's. This barrage was not only in front of us but also on left and right. The attack was being made along a 15 mile front. We had English on our left and French on our right.10percent; of the shells used that morning were smoke. The morning being damp and foggy kept the smoke down. We had not gone far when it was almost impossible to see more than a few yards. A slight breeze was blowing towards us, which which brought the smoke and fumes of the exploding shells back on us. It was not very pleasant stuff to swallow.
