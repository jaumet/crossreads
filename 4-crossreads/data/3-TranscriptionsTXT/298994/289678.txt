I went to the London Coliseum in the afternoon, I happened to have seen four of the star turns, when they appeared in Australia. I also saw an extract from the "Better 'Ole", judging by the nice life led by Bill, Alf and Bert, the future life in France did not seem too promising!
London was quite dark, when the theatre performance was finished this afternoon
