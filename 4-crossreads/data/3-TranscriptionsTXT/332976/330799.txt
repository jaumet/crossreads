 Febuary 1917 26th   Orders came from H.Q. early this morning that we are to discontinue with the Anti-Tank Gun Position as the scheme has been cancelled for the time being. This afternoon I carried on with the remainder of the section, on repairing  the  and duplication of the "duck walk" tracks between Needle &amp; Rose Trenches.  Nos. 1 &amp; 2 Sections were put on to advance road construction this morning &amp; are to continue with it. 28th   I am still on the same job with the "duck walks."  Last night we had the Gas alarm.  At midnight we were woke up &amp; informed that Fritz was sending over gas.  We got our helmets on &amp; I fell asleep again, but very little of it came up here.
