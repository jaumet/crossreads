<p>13/1/16<br/>Thurs 13th<br/>Came out in orders yesterday that the 12th Regt. were not to be reformed but used up as Reinforcements for the other N.S.W. Regts 10 ops at a time needless to say the Prince of Wales' own does not relish the idea of being reinforcements to us; We have been issued with a pack horse to carry our signalling gear &amp; did not go on parade this morning but put in some time fitting the pack saddle on.As soon as I had finished dinner I went to No.2 Auxiliary Hospital &amp; gave Stan his mail which arrived this morning, then came back to camp &amp; was paid &pound;2-10-0.Then to the A.V.C. &amp; went to town with Bottom &amp; Arthur. Met Stan at the Kursaal at 6.30 &amp; then put the evening in at the Picture Show &amp; then back to camp, we have everything ready for the road tomorrow</p>
