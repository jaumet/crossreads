 London. The biggest village on the face of God's earth. 
 I have a military overcoat and I want to have it cleaned. A woman in Ludgershall, the village by our camp would do so right away but her fire is out "If you walk down the road and find a chimney smoking they will clean it for you" 
 I find the fires are all out. I ask the village shoe-maker to put protectors in my boots. He carefully wraps his muffler around his neck and regardless of his wife's atrocious beauty, leaves me alone in the gloomy shop for about half an hour with her. After buying about a bob's worth of protectors he spends about ten minutes driving them in. I ask "How much?" "A penny halfpenny Sir" is the humble reply. Is there a chemist's shop here
