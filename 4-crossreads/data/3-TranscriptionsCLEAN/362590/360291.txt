  
 Camp 24/1/16 My dear father 
 Since I have now received letters from all of you, it is about time that I answered one or two of them Dorothy wrote very cheerfully & seemed to be highly amused because some poor unfortunate captain fell overboard, all owing to a rotten flag pole. 
 I am glad to say that my term as Camp Adjutant has at last come to a close; & my new designation is O.C. 12th Reinforcements to the 17th Batt. Every day I have the pleasure of going up to barracks & picking my own men out of the crowd of fresh recruits. 
 It never struck me before what a few men these are, whom you could really call fine men enlisting now. Most of the decent fellows are trying to get into every arm
