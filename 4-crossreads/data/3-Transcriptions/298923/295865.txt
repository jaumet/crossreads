<p>18 July 1918 Thursday<br/><strike>Talet-Dumm</strike><br/>Well we are a much diminished Squadron.  I suppose we will go on like the "BROOK" &amp; until each one goes WEST at his appointed time.  The German prisoners said if<br/>"We would only fight <u>with</u>"<br/>"then we could beat"<br/>"the world."  General Sir H. Chevaul is going to inspect &amp; thank us tomorrow-  the prisoners look fresher cleaner &amp; better clothed than our poor chaps-  Posting this to let you know ALLs well &amp; my love to all at home.</p>
