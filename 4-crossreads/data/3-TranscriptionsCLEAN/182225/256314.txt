 1916   FRIDAY 14   JULY 
 A fairly warm day, but cloudy. M r  Neylan gave us flag drill in morning & we cleaned up our huts for an inspection in afternoon. Andy Fisher & the Lord Mayor of London were coming out but they never turned up. We got our first mail in the evening and it was great to hear from home. I got letters from Linda & Jo. It was the third letter from Linda, but they say that there are more to come shortly so I dare say the first & second will be amongst them.
