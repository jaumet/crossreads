when I got better I was put in another Red Cross Train & taken on to Havre to the Convalescent Camp there & after two months there, was sent to the Infantry Base depot at Havre & being examined by the Doctors was classed as B3 & was sent to England   Weymouth was the place & from there after waiting three weeks, went by train to Devonport where we got on Board the Medic for Australia.
We left there in a big convoy 12 large ships & 1 cruiser 5 English destroyers & one Yankee Destroyer also an Air ship which kept with us for the whole day & then went back.  All ships were in darkness at night, no smoking on deck at night, & no lights to be shown,   We kept together in three lines, the destroyers cutting in & out all the time & the Yankee keeping guard in the rear, all ships were continually changing position first we would be in front then another ship would go ahead & zig-zagging all the time.
We never sighted any submarines on our trip & after a few days when we were out of the danger Zone we separated & the ships went their different ways & when we arrived at Colon at the mouth of the Panama Canal we found one of the ships there before us & all the destroyers except the Yankee ship had left us.  so we coaled ship & next day we started to go through the canal which is a wonderful piece of work & very interesting.
The ship goes into a lock & is then raised by water coming into the lock & when the ship is at the same height as the water outside  the gates open & the ship is towed along by powerful land tugs
