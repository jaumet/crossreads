<p>Hop on our station would align the helio &amp; call up hour after hour in hopes of getting a message through. He overlooked the fact that the master mind of E A Long was at the other station where no work would ever be done. We knew it &amp; it amused us to hear him cry aloud in anguish that the other station "would not work". Many a happy day we spent thus, never dreaming of the end of these perfect days.<br/>Often we would go straight home &amp; stay all day &amp; have a splendid time whilst Hop &amp; Pierce did their level best to call one another up, but never did the answering flash come. On our return to camp we would always arrive after 5 pm &amp; so miss the parade for dismissal, that is of course providing we did not want to stay out. I vow I can guarantee that the Engineer Sigs were absolutely the cleanest unit in the camp &ndash; the reputation being held up by Hop alone. We always went out polished up well</p>
