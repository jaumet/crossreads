26/9/17 Dominion Camp
After lunch an N.C.O. from D.H.Q. showed the new signal rocket which ranges 2250 yards. Inspected all the companies again this afternoon and found them excellent: My heart to heart talk this morning produced good results. Went to BdeH.Q. during the afternoon and had a tete-a-tete with the Babe. Back and we had our Officer's Mess once more this evening. Good to see all the faces round the dinner tables. After mess I told them all I know of todays the projected operations and complimented them on this afternoon's turnout. The evening was quiet, and I ordered all the blankets to be issued to the men so they can sleep warmly. King returned from the 6th. Trg. Battalion after being over there since Xmas last. At BdeH.Q. got a good quantity of medal ribbons to keep on hand for the many M.Cs. D.C.Ms. MMs etc.we are going to receive in the near future!
