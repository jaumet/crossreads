<p>the crowd of Aussies that were alongside the road having a look at the prisoners.  That night we went up to the trenches which were a long way off, we went slow under a Guide &amp; entered the winding trench cut out of chalk &amp; as it was nearly dark when we started it was very dark when we eventually arrived there about 12 midnight &amp; the few troops we relieved were very glad when we arrived to relieve them, it was the first division we relieved &amp; they had suffered a lot of casualties.</p>
<p>We started from Sausage Gully with 180 N.C.O. &amp; men &amp; six officers &amp; 13 days after we came out 28 men &amp; one officer so we had our share of knocks also &amp; lost some fine officers &amp; men killed. our Captain was killed there on the firing step, just in the act of taking off his gas Helmet a shell burst &amp; a piece of shrapnel got him in the head &amp; he died soon after in a German first aid dressing station in a big dug out about 40 feet down in the ground which was fitted up with bunks to hold about 20 men   it had been fitted up with Electric light but of course the lights were off.</p>
<p>Outside the dug-out in the open, there was a German field ambulance loaded up with men, two Horses &amp; driver &amp; another man on the seat in front, &amp; inside full up with men, all dead.  A shell must have got the lot when he started to move, for the horses &amp; the whole lot were riddled with shrapnel bullets &amp; as this was July or the beginning of August the smell of the dead was awful &amp; during the time we were in</p>
