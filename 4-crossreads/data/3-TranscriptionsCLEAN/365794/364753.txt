No use writing these things it hurts too deeply. 11.30 a.m. went A.G.H. No. 14 & voted yes for conscription, saw Dick. Off duty 2-5 went town with S. Heathcote (nice girl). One pt. in Connaught tells a story of pt. adm. who had "cut his throat with bully beef tin and made a bad job of it".  Very unromantic that is.
