We had to run the gauntlet in one place for about 200 yds, for we were quite exposed to the Germans but they never shot at us, we then went through a shallow trench to the firing line, here we had a look at a job we had to do this afternoon, I can't make old Fritz out although he can see hundreds of our men quite close to him he never shoots at them, they work all day long right under his nose real close to him, I think he is frightened of giving himself away for at the present time he is hiding anywhere never discloses his presence from fear of our guns which never stop night or day.   The Colonel was up there also we had a short yarn with him then came back, had dinner such as it was a piece of dry bread water yes I thought I was lucky to have it one can't be too particular these times if ever I get back Ill be able to sleep out in the yard anywhere in all weathers live on
