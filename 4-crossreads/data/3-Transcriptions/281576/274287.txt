<p>Bed 54<br/>FRI. Oct. 5.  Last night I put on my Blighty clothes &amp; sat up in Bed till about 2 a.m.  I heard the motors buzzing around, &amp; thought, "Oh, they'll be here for me presently".  After that I dozed off to sleep &amp; was awakened by the night orderly at about 5 bringing round the water to wash.  It appears there was no evacuation last night, so now I must hope for better luck tonight.  Another big crowd of wounded arrived &amp; the ward is almost full again.  After Break. the Charge Sister brought her tray around &amp; dressed my leg.  After the operation they put a wad of lint in the wound to prevent it from healing too quickly.  This morning this had to be removed.  It was a ticklish job, but Sister Sharpe was as gentle as a lamb &amp; it was soon over.  They took the Serg. Maj. away for his operation &amp; afterwards took him to another ward.  He went crook about it, too.</p>
<p>A.10 Wd.        Camieres<br/>This is the Operation Ward where the chaps are brought after visiting the Pictures.  Some of them say very amusing things when they are under Ether, &amp; we get plenty of laughs.  Hope to goodness I get away to Blighty tonight.  One thing certain, I cannot get any better treatment, anywhere, than I am getting in this A 10 Ward.  What a good long letter I'll be able to write to B.E. when I get over.  Our chaps continue to give Fritz Hell, which is certainly good news.  And they are holding all the ground they took.  --  About 1.30 a.m. on</p>
<p>Sat. Oct. 6  the stretcher bearers arrived to take me away to Blighty.   They carried me down to the Orderly Tent &amp; from there they took us away in Amb. Cars to the Hosp. Train.  Here I was put in a Bunk.  The Train was staffed by V.A.D's, &amp; they looked after us well.  The Train left about 4.30,  They</p>
