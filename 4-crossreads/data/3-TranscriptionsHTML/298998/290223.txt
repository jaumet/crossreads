<p>any means surprised, discovered that I had decreased 3 stone 7 lbs, since April. Before my parcels commenced I had decreased considerably more. The French Interpreter brought me a letter from home, (the first since capture). I was almost overcome with joy, you can imagine the pleasure derived from those few lines; I had suffered eight and a half months torture without news; my happiness is indescribable. Only men in captivity can understand the trouble obviated by news from home.</p>
<p>CHRISTMAS EVE. I assisted several officers to organize a concert. We experienced great difficulty in obtaining permission from the Huns to celebrate the occasion. The officers arranged this part of the programme and managed to persuade the C.O. to grant permission. The evening was very interesting and cheered many weary souls. The most humourous and enjoyable item, was contributed by four Russian dancers accompanied by a badly damaged concertina. Various nationalities contributed and now a few good artists numbered in the programme. The evening concluded in the midst of many national anthems, regardless of Hun feeling. Later a "canny Scot" visited me, to my surprise he produced a bottle of port wine. He obtained the wine through a Hun sentry. "Posterns" are easily bribed and no doubt "Jock" gave him two or three small biscuits to get it. The officers were allowed three small bottles of red wine and I think, managed to create a little diversion.</p>
<p>CHRISTMAS DAY. The ground is covered with snow but the air is quite pleasant. The Huns supplied a Xmas tree and decoration and ordered us to complete the decorating. Huns celebrate this custom very conscientiously; per force we were obliged to submit. Dinner was served at noon. A very agreeable change. First course:  two ounces of roast pork, boiled potatoes and vinegar sauce. Dessert (a mystery) the mixture looked very much like jelly, but was quite tasteless. I soon disposed of my dish by handing it to a Russian. We also received a small bottle of lemonade. I had recently received a parcel of niceties from the 16th Battn. A.I.F., this supplemented the meal. I thoroughly enjoyed the day. Many lads in "Swei Ward" shared our parcels --</p>
