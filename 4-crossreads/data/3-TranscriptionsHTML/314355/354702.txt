<p>March 29<br/>Mail:  receipt from Davies &amp; Oriole for 141.</p>
<p>Rain blown across the country, sun, and brief patchings of blue amongst great deep clouds, cold.</p>
<p>Evening:  yesterday and today, a cleansing out of panniers, medical cases, and O.R. boxes, equipment all cut down, for move to La Somme, so tonight have "Songs Before Sunrise" again.</p>
<p>Posted to Mrs. H. package of first four numbers of "Gheitz", the first three of "Aussie", Hunt's "Cadences" and Sydneian of Dec. 1917, and home to Geoff copies of late Anzac Bulletins.</p>
<p>Read today chapter of "St. Pauls, London" of Bond's, some good theory of Architecture in it, and an interesting essay.</p>

"1st Field Ambulance!"<br/>"Ah!"<br/>"It's all these Tommy-inspired &ndash; think about:  saluting and damned imitation disception &ndash; we must bloody well win the war y' know!"</p>
<p>Yesterday on the way back from one of the C.C.S. trips, by the road to Loche, nailed against the trees, was a great notice, "all wastage drags the war out", and about 40 staff cars pass it in a half day.</p>
<p>21.<br/>Back from 11 C.C.S. &ndash; Tommy, with 1st Pioneer chaps, head wounds, arm and leg.  On the way down took his boots off, and threw them down in the car, and forgot them.  At the C.C.S. after the Bearers had taken him in, one of them sighted the boots, and fancied them &ndash; arrogantly:  so I told him he couldn't have them, and he brought the Sergt. out.  So my</p>
