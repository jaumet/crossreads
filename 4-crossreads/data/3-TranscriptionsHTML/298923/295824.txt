<p>7 June 1918 Friday<br/><strike>Jericho again</strike><br/>Marched all night again in Clouds of DUST I saw a car with axles deep in nothing but dust- we just blindly follow the horse in front- "Cum-lila-cum-loo" as the gippy sings meaning<br/>"How many days"<br/>"&amp; How many nights ere I "<br/>"See my beloved again"<br/>Very hot, I may have a "figure" again after a month or so down here- still FAT!!-   The Priests in Bethlehem promised to say a Mass for me!!! every morning when they heard we were going to <strike>Jericho</strike> Valley, but I'm quite fit &amp; well-  The mere name of the place in Summer frightened them.</p>
