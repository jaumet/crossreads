<p>to supply that.<br/>Yesterday afternoon Jock Mackie took up a collection among the Sergts, for our Imperial Instructor Jock Knowles, a jolly fine chap, it appears he has drawn no pay for a couple of months &amp; is still &pound; 2..10 in debt, this is a fair slap in the British Army, for he only receives 3/6 a day &amp; he is a C.S.M. old Jock did not like taking it, but he recognised the spirit it was given in &amp; accepted it.., when we get it all in, the total will be about &pound; 10. Jock Knowles is a bit different to the other Imperial Instructor we have attached to us, for he is hated by officers NCO.s &amp; men &amp; don't think he will last very long here</p>
