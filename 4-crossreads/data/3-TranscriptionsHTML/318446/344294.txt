After they had gone last night, our 'planes were buzzing about all night, so we must have strafed them considerably.  The Blaze they started last night was the dispensary marquee in the 53rd C.C. Hospital.  I went down there this afternoon &amp; everyone is dug in.<br/>The canteens have all been sent back to Rafa with the exception of two who are not allowed to have more than 3 days stock.  It looks rather as if they meditate clearing out if the Turks attack.  If it is true what the E Mail says that the Turks have 5 In. divs. &amp; Cavalry, it is quite possible.</p>
