Sunday 20 January
In a sincere eloquent speech, maiden speech, Mr. Smallwood in the House of Commons on Friday, drew attention to the gros mismanagement in the Army., He instanced his own personal cases of his two sons he called "for a soul in the army something human". He said that he would rather a stoppage of any reinforcements until the authorities could use them properly. It is this idea which moved me against conscription. Weather raining a little generally cloudy but warm.
Heavy bombardment on right.
