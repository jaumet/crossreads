After tea sat in the dugout by the fire. Received letters from Laurie & Ben. Laurie tells me in the letter that she is engaged to be married. Quite nice news. Anyhow good luck to her.

9th February 1917. Got up at 6 for duty till 8.30. Had breakfast & collected wood for fire. Went on duty again at 12.30 till 5. Enemy aeroplanes very busy today. Some of the pilots were very daring and hovered overhead for some time despite the fact of the anti aircraft guns. These gun crews put in some very rotten shooting anyhow  Came off at 5 & had tea.
