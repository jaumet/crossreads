<p>managed to get straw &amp; coal from passing trains so all was comfortable.  It was a splendid trip.  All this day we amused ourselves snowballing &amp; at our numerous halts we made things willing, some of the civvy victims taking it well, others objecting.  Then we had a mandelin and two good singers so music was not neglected.  At 1 P.M. we had a halt &amp; issued rations, tea sugar &amp; milk for the whole trip, bread jam cheese &amp; bully for 24 hours, also some Australian comforts Cocoa, puddings &amp; tommy cookers, Rum was also issued &amp; was a great success.  We finished the day with a singsong &amp; retired about 7 &amp; spent a splendid night notwithstanding the bumping &amp; stopping &amp; vibration as if we were running on square wheels.</p>
<p>Friday 7th Feb.  Our route was via Mons, Arras, Albert to Le Havre &amp; was very interesting being through the old battlegrounds but snow hid most of its ravages.</p>
