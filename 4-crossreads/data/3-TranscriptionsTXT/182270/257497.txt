 FRIDAY, JULY 4, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; warm. Tickle took the wagon 
 down to Boundary with netting &amp; 
 salt. Got some logs in Boundary 
 scrub &amp; took them to Walhallow 
 for cutting. I brought 198 sheep 
 out of Wheelers &amp; put them in 
 Woolshed. Were going to Merilong 
 for the night then over to kangaroo 
 shoot at Glen Moan but it 
 was put off at last minute.
