<p>Ayunkara Dec<br/>I came up from Deir el Belah yesterday taking 3 days to do it in owing to the bad roads from the heavy rain which we had all the time I was down at Belah. Now we are camped right in the village of Ayunkara around the town hall which is being used as a hospital by our tent division.</p>
<p>It is quite a good little building about the size of the Masonic Hall at BS with quite an up to date little stage &amp; gallery in it.</p>
