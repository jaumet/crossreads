  
 On steaming into Sydney Main Station I hopped out, got my leave pass and found the family waiting for me outside.  Was soon home. 
 Tues. 31st Dec. Have not settled down yet and feel almost a stranger in a strange land.  Everything seems terribly quiet although Sydney looks the same with the addition, of course, of numerous new buildings.
