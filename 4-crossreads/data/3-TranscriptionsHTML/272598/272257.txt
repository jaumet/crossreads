<p>Tuesday 22.1.18 to Monday 28.1.18<br/>Foot extremely sore for the first few day, could not sleep at night owing to pain.  After a couple of dressings improved &amp; now is fairly good only I cannot walk very well.  Have not yet been ordered up by the Doctor but get up each day for the last couple of day; get very tired of bed.  Food &amp; conditions here very poor &amp; no amusements of any description, will not be sorry to get out.</p>
<p>Tuesday 29.1.18 to Saturday 9.1.18 [?]<br/>Still in hospital but am going to be asked to be marked out in a day or so.<br/>Time drags awfully, nothing whatever to do to pass the time.  Have walked out</p>
