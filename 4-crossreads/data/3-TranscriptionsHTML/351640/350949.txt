<p>Northern sky were to be seen the rapidly setting great bear, the saucepan of the small bear folling in its wake, the pole star fixed as has ever been its habit, the W reaching upwards in its orbit wheeling round the pole star.  As the earth wheels round the stary firmament of the North appears to revolve round the Pole star.   The atmospheric conditions of this part of the world, at this time of year are ideal;  the cool breezes tempering the effect of the heat of the sun, which had been just a little too great during the afternoon.</p>
<p>This afternoon I took Father Vrigille S.J., and two of his colleagues for a drive to the pyramids at Mena.  The eldest member of the party had not visited the place for more than twenty-nine years.   Many of the Jesuits now in Cairo come from Beyrouth, where before the war they were engaged in teaching, this city is their sancturay during the progress of the great struggle.  Vrigille speaks English fluently, the others have knowledge of it more or less extensive, being in many cases but a nodding acquaintance.  The pyramids and the Sphynx had not moved since my last visit, each wore its accustomed air of solemnity and silence.   No questions were asked from the Sphynx so that there will be no record of dissatisfaction with the Delphic answers which she may vouchsafe.  When shall we be home would be a frequent question with many here now, if a reasonably correct answer were to be expected.  Mena House is again occupied as a hospital with Dr. Grey in charge.  I did not call to see him or the place, it would not grieve me if I never saw either again.</p>
<p>144 suits of pyjamas came from Mrs Fraser, they will do first class for the men, being much better in quality than those which are procureable in this city.  I have written to thank her and the ladies of the Isle of White [Isle of Wight].  The letter was short but I hope that they will like it.   Mrs F. is quite delighted that she took up the work because it had brought her into contact with many of the families in the neighbourhood with whom it might otherwise have been difficult for her to become acquainted.  It was by accident that I told her that hospital suits or pyjamas would be very acceptable here.   They are making alltogether 500 pairs.   If ever I get to England I hope to have the pleasure of going to their home.</p>
<p>My lambs are all asleep, and I must go to bed early to night because I have not had a nap during the day.  The weather is ideal and unless we get hot weather during the coming month there will have been nothing to growl at for the summer time.</p>
<p>The river Nile is in flood, which can be easily seen when crossing it, the water being at a higher level than ordinarily and it is discoloured with the mud which it carries in the current, it is this mud which when it has deposited upon the other annual layers</p>
