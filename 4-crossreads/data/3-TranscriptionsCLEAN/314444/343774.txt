 My Dear Mother, 
 Have sent a few cards lately, but have your letters of April 14, 16, 18, and 22nd unanswered. Also received a letter from Hilda telling me she had been a month in hospital with diphtheria. Bruce Evans sent a long letter, and Adeline said she was going to stay a week-end with you. I see you "have the wind up" in Aussy
