<p>Today we are going over a little more of Cairo, but at present it is a little warm for walking and this is a good place to write.   The Y.M.C.A. here is for Soldiers only &amp; they have a Skating Rink on which there is a game of Hockey proceeding at the Present moment.   Now about myself there is little to tell except that I am in good health, and Received your letter written on the 17 Dec for which many thanks   I received it after I came into camp on Tuesday I daresay it Reached Egypt before I did.   Where we are going I cannot say, but I fancy we will be here Training for some time, there are of course plenty of rumours afloat.   Regarding our destination when we leave, but I will know when we get there that is the most I can tell you.   I found out that Alf Phillipss' Regiment is camped not far away so Tomorrow I may be able to look him up I will try anyway    I will also try and see, May Bowman now I must close with heaps of love to all.   Heaps for yourself &amp; Bett from your loving son CGP.</p>
