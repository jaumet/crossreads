<p>23rd  Bull ring has begun for those who have not seen active Service.</p>
<p>25th  Went to Corfe Castle, a fair sized village about 4&frac12; miles from Wareham, the main features of which are the Castle and the church.  The Church has been rebuilt (1860) but the tower dates back to 1260.<br/>The Castle as cards show has been a great stronghold and in Cromwells time, it was besieged for 3 years but was finally taken by treachery.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Part of this was built</p>
