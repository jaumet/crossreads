Sun 7thChurch parade this morning in the YMCA & had an exceptionally good service;  I was thinking of going to Mena after dinner with Stan, but decided to stay here & write instead & got quite a surprise when Arthur Welch & young Hoddenot turned up at 2.30 PM
After stables we went into Cairo & had a good time together.  I arrived back in camp at 9.30 & scribbled a letter to Jessie before turning in for the night  I heard from Arthur that Morgan had been sent to the canal escorting the men, who were discarded back to Australia
