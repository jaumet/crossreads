<p>August,1918<br/>Thursday 15</p>
<p>Cayeau<br/>Weather very warm and inclined to be very hot.<br/>Received letters from Home. Went up to Bty position for wire and material that we had already carted up on previous days.<br/>Salvaged quite a considerable quantity of wire, very good material too.<br/>Geo Stone's pass came out for Blighty, he is very lucky indeed. Had a few bombs over, no damage.</p>
