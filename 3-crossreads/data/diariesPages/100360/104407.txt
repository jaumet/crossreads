Thursday. July 26th Last night’s postponed match was played at Henencourt. About half the 8th were present & "barracked" for the good old "Blue & White". 
It was a ding-dong game. Billgy May played a rattling Game, & so did Jack Woodward & Pat Heffernon. Bluey Stanton arrived on the Ground pretty well "inked" & caused a deal of amusement by his antics in supporting the 8th.
The Final scores were:- [not recorded]
Received 2 Letters from Lill France.

Friday. July 27. Glory Alleluia: Got a 9 page Letter from "L." Good old "B.E." Mail closed today, so I wrote straightaway. Clarrie Blanton was evacuated today with bleeding from the Lungs which was caused by falling on his sword, when we were having a rehearsal for "The Anzac Wafer". The Nursing Section returned from Warloy today.
Got a touch of Trench Fever. Maj. Wooster ordered me into Hospital.
