<p>&amp; the views are magnificent, we stopped round Ramsay for a few hours, during which time we bought some souvenirs I sent home a pair of serviette rings with the Isle of Man's coat of arms on, Laxey was another little town we visited it is the prettiest little place that ever I have seen being on 2 sides of a big deep valley &amp; every house is of stone &amp; as white as snow while flowers &amp; trees are everywhere, the wonderful Laxey water wheel is here I took a snap of it, we reached Douglas about 9 oclock that night &amp; went down into the town to get some tea we went to a good restaurant the Cabin Caf&eacute;, here in Douglas you would never know there was a war on there are no food restrictions, you can get meat sugar butter &amp;</p>
