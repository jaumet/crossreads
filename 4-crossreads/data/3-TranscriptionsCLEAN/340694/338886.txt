My reason for not commencing a diary before was because life in Egypt is so monotonous when not actually on Service as we are now.
We left Polygon Camp Abassia last Tuesday & arrived here early Wednesday morning with difficulties facing us from the jump. The sand here is very fine & the wagons sank nearly box deep in it. Extra horses had to be pitched on & then numerous spells were necessary before the hard road was reached. The lead horses were then taken out & returned to the Station
