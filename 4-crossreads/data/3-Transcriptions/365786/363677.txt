<p>These hospital trains are extraordinarily long &amp; it is possible to walk right thro from one end to the other.  The wounded are classified while in the train &amp; valuable time is thus saved when they arrive in Cairo.  At Cairo numbers of Red Cross Assistants meet the hospital trains &amp; like the good Samaritans here supply light refreshments &amp; cigarettes etc. for the men while they are waiting for their turn in the Ambulances which take them to the Hospitals.  Now when a man comes back wounded from the Front he seldom has any portion of this world's goods.  Some arrive in bandages covered up with blankets &ndash; others have torn dirty bloodstained tunics minus buttons &amp; sleeves &ndash; I heard of one man who managed to retain one of his puttees &amp; cap only &ndash; but whatever they do bring back goes straight off to the sterilizer</p>
