<p>Gallipoli Peninsula, 10/7/1915<br/>Dear Mr Stephens,<br/>I know that the sight of indelible pencil makes you in your official capacity very annoyed still this is written to the man.  And anyhow I have nothing else to write with.<br/>There is not much I am afraid I can tell you about our position here, even were the censorships entirely well drawn.  It is really surprising how little we know of what happens anywhere else except before our own eyes.  Of course when we go down the valley for water there is always someone with a startling rumour.  I would not be at all surprised if the rumours that must be now floating around Sydney about the duration of the war    &amp;  what some high authority predicted concerning it, about a battle in the North Sea,    &amp;  other things, originated from that water cask.</p>
