The French are most enthusiastic & friendly not like the south of ITALY. I drank VIVE (a France in Vin Ordinaire with some French Officers at Aix la Bains a pretty spot near a Lake Lac de Bourget - it is autumn here & the foliage is like Macedon. Some Boches were on a platform under guard. Every child woman & man of France between 8 & 80 years of age is working. Arrived St. Germain au Mont d'or on Rhone & stayed the night at Hotel Restaurant du Sport & it was "du Sport".
