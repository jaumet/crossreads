<p>23/7/18<br/>Aberlour<br/>We left Carron at about 6.30 after meeting Audreys comrades &ndash; "land girls" in smocks, leggings &amp; breeches. Arriving at Aberlour &ndash; a small stone village &ndash; we found our arrival to be the chief excitement of the place. Went along to the local barber's with the Colonel and then went for a walk along the village streets. All the shops bore Scotch names &ndash; Grant &amp; MacPherson, Thomson, Gordon &amp;c. We had dinner and absorbed a number of w. &amp; s's and then went for a long walk along side the broad river Spey with its tributaries with their waters all black and peat stained. There were a few fishermen plying the rod but not getting much result. As we walked along heavy rain commenced and was continuing after our return &amp; going to bed.</p>
