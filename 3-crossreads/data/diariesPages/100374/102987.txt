give wonderful exhibitions of how they can control their machine. The turns and twists they make are magnificent

General Plumner, who was in command of the Messines stunt visited our C.C.S. to-day.

We were formed up on parade and he addressed the men complimenting them on the splendid work they had done during the Battle of Messines. General .P. does not look like a general. He is a grey headed wears an eye glass, so neat and clean that he looked as if he was only fit for a glass case. He is a wonderful general. I do not think anything could be more wonderful than the way he conducted this latest stunt.

Everything was as if it had been worked to a time table. During the battle some of the wounded had only been lying wounded two hours when they were in our C.C.S. and being operated on. One C.C.S. was seven miles away from the scene of the fighting.

June 13th. Wed.
Off duty to-day. Went a walk to Mount Noir along with little "Chick". The day very hot perspired freely.

In Bailleul square there is a large number of guns of all descriptions on exhibition. They had been captured by various battalions during Messines Battle.

I noticed one of them was marked to be sent to Parramata. It had been captured by an Australian battalion
