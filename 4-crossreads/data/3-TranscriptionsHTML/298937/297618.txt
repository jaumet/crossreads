<p>Dr Voss was relieved &amp; Dr. Van Epen of Lismore sent in his place a couple of days ago.  As he has to attend another dispensary at No. 2 Stationary Hospital we don't see much of him.<br/>We have two big marquees &amp; a bell tent.<br/>The latter is for our accommodation, one of the former for dispensary &amp; the other for observation cases.<br/>The heat is still terrible.  I feel sick of Egypt &amp; when we move off I shall be heartily glad.</p>
