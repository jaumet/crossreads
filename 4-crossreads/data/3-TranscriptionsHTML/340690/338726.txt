<p>arriving about 11.30 and got settled to fairly good billets and prepared for dinner.  However got orders to move again and had to pack up straightaway.  Transport moved straight away but we we waited till 5 and took lower track through L'etoile and across Somme to near Pont Remy where we got motor buses.  Big convoy about 140 cars, 11th Battn., 10th, and some of 9th, waited for about an hour started at 9.30.  Through Flixecourt again &amp; Longpre and roundabout track to Catennets, [possibly Cardonnette] arrived about 2 and put in bad billets 1, 2 &amp; 4 together.  I slept out under a wagon.  Got to bed about 3.30 and slept on till 9 when we had breakfast.  Fine.</p>
<p>8.8.18<br/>Got mobile and I snatched a short rest before moving again.  Fine.  Moved about 3.30 and on through Allonville to Vaire.  Stopped on road at about 5 for tea and several long stops.  Following behind M.G. 21st Coy and 11th Battn. and arrived coming through Corbie &amp; Hamel at Vaire at about 9.30 just after dark.  Corbie shelled a good deal but otherwise not much sign of war.  Good few shells round Vaire but roads very good and hardly any guns going bar 2 or 3 heavy and long range 6" guns.  News of us doing very well and attacking at 4 in morning and various rumours of advancing 10 miles capturing 19000 prisoners &amp; 200 guns etc.  Extremely quiet and not many wounded coming down and many troops going up but very little extra transport.  Got straight to bed after piling arms and</p>
