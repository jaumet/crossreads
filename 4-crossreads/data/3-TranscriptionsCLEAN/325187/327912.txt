  
 [Trinity Sunday 18 June 1916] 
 9 aeroplanes flew over this morning our own Flying Squadron going somewhere. Attended Church Parade Ralph Arnold's brother was there fit & well. BOILS on the arms again every Prick from a Palm Tree s  festers, flies help this on, but on the whole I'm fit & well. Russians seem to be doing well now, how long can this last  but it is not the British Army that is doing the Push,  unfortunately but the NAVY is still there.  Our men say they want Moth Balls for their Blankets as it is so long since they have used them,  a facetious crowd of good fellows now dog-tired.
