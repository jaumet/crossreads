<p>Thursday: 5th Nov 1914<br/>Have to start thinking about washing dirty clothes. Am getting a big pile. Lovely weather again, but a slight roll on boat.<br/>Went on parade &amp;  did physical drill &amp;  Knotting lashing &amp;  splicing. Menator crossed on the port-side going back to the rear. Travelled 242 miles up to 12 o'clock "Osterly" passed up tonight at about 7.15PM. Full lights. She looked real well too. She is a sister ship to this.</p>
<p>Friday 6th. Nov. 1914.<br/>Instead of going to physical drill at 6.30 washed clothes &amp;  had to go to office over it. Only got told to see that was there in future. Easy let off.<br/>Very funny experience last night. A private from inf. Who was drunk came to our cabin (I suppose because our door was open) &amp;  was very sick at 3 in the morning. I woke up &amp;  thought it was one of our boys in the cabin but it wasn't. Very nasty.<br/>Travelled 253 miles yesterday &amp;  today.<br/>Had a lifebelt inspection &amp;  a lecture on earthworks this afternoon. Everyone had to turn out with a life belt on. Came into the tropics today &amp;  it is getting real hot.<br/>Went to Mjr. Brand's lecture on "Ammunition supply in the Pula". It was very interesting.</p>
<p>Saturday. 7th. Nov 1914.<br/>Got up &amp;  went to Physical Training.<br/>Getting real hot now. Had a half holiday &amp;  No 1 &amp;  2 Sections played cricket against G. Coy Inf. Had a washing day &amp;  washed sox.<br/>Travelled 253 miles again today. Doing well now. Had a close crop Hair cut.</p>
