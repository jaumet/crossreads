Saturday 4
Worked at the incinerator in morning & lit it just as the howitzer started firing.
Unfortunately it made a big smoke & up came the artillery major with "Put the b-fire out its obscuring our aiming post & will attract fire". Worked like hell to put it out.  In the afternoon it started again while Bourne was getting wood. Got it out.  Shells burst bursting all roads all day.
Had to stick there in the open.  Just finished when Beachy Bill burst right overhead & gave me a pellet in the right thigh.
