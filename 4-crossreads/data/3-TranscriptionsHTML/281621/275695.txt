<p>Sunday 22<br/>Plenty of aerial work this morning &amp; Fritz very daringly came very low &amp; destroyed one of our balloons. The division is to be relieved tomorrow &amp; the rumour is that we go to Belgium. This evening many aerial combats took place in which one Fritz plane was destroyed &amp; came down in our lines. Very fine sight.</p>
<p>Monday 23<br/>Relieved from the line &amp; march back to Bapaume via Lebuquiere. Beautiful day.</p>
<p>Tuesday 24<br/>March back to Pozieres where we expect to stay a couple of days before we go back further. Tomorrow Anzac Day is to be celebrated &amp; we are going to have a 'beano'. Rather a coincidence being at Pozieres. A monument is being erected to the fallen of 1st Aust Division &amp; many to separate battalions. <br/>Beautiful day.</p>
<p>Wednesday 25<br/>Anzac Day. We had a dinner in the evening and it was followed by an impromptu concert. Beautiful day. Visit Albert.</p>
<p>Thursday 26<br/>In Albert again to see the "Anzac Dandies". Again a beautiful day. Expect to move shortly.</p>
<p>Friday 27<br/>Beautiful day. Walk across to Thieperal where a scene of desolation more than any I have seen before, is to be seen.</p>
<p>Saturday 28<br/>Again beautiful day. Visit Albert.</p>
