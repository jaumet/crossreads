<p>the men have suffered from it<br/>13/9/1915<br/>A bombardment this morning, started at 5.30, lasted half an hour, no rifle fire at all, only machine gun fire. No information available. Great talk about our moving to Anzac. The Adjutant went past our lines at 10.30 A.M. on his way to Anzac. We had a lively half hour this morning. Shells falling everywhere, I think they are 15 lbs. A French G.S. wagon with water casks on it at well, One shot about 10 yards over, they thought it about time to move, just moved when another shell fell in exactly the same place where the horses were standing. I never saw such luck. Two more shots just cleared our horses. No damage done whatever. This happened at 7.15 A.M. Monday. We had Lieut Olding here with a sprained ankle. Had to take him to the Battery in a wagon. He hurt his ankle on the way down to the wagon line, fell down a trench  The night was very dark<br/>14/9/1915<br/>Terrific bombardment last night by the French and Navy, on the right flank, and another this morning on the left, by the British Artillery. A French torpedo</p>
