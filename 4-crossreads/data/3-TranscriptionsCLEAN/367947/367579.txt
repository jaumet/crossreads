 My dear Jack, Got both yours & Clare's letters & glad to see you are more settled than when Clare wrote. Hope you are still all well also the new arrival, & that the job is still holding out well. 
 This war is going to play old Harry in the next few months though in the long run it looks to be the making of Australia & the Empire generally. Let's hope that in the future we will be buying & selling only English marked goods. No doubt they are putting up a great fight; yet when we think how well prepared they were, it looks as if they must be getting to feel rather disappointed that they are not yet in Paris.
