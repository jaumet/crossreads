<p>31-5-1918<br/>Fine day.  Extensive bombing by the enemy.  This is worthy of note, as the British authorities were asked by the Pope, not to bomb Cologne on the 30th, as a religous festivity was being celebrated.  The Feast of Corpus Christi.  Last night was terrible.  Bombs dropped all around us.  Where the 1st Bty. were camped an aerial torpedo was dropped, making an awful hole.  These Huns are mongerels.  During the interval of no bombing, they rushed troops and munitions up to firing line.  One of our drivers injured jumping a horse.  Horse fell.</p>
