September 10th MondayNot a bad day. Feeling very sick, I have rather a heavy cold, & a terrible head-ache. Rumor of a boat-roll coming out on Friday. Supposed to be fourteen hundred on it. Went to a place called Weston, it is right on the end of this Island, & is about four miles away. We were very tired when we came back.
Tuesday Sept 11thWe were all called out for our pay books again today, & still mine has not yet come back. My word I was wild too. The Sergeant promised to try & get it for me. Went to a concert in the Gym. The party was from Bournemouth & wasn't too bad either.
Wednesday Sept 12thWe have a route march every morning now & sometimes of an afternoon. We generally go on the same route every day, a distance I suppose of about 3 miles.320 came into camp this afternoon, there are now about 2500 in camp here. It is just about full now. Went and had a look at the Easton gaol this evening, but there was nothing to see bar a very high stone wall.
