half past nine- so constant a stream of men for their passes & railway warrants.  I issued just over 650 all told & at last when I knocked off I had some supper & was glad enough to crawl into bed without a murmer.On Friday morning- Good Friday-  things were much quieter & I went back to the Medical Room  When I woke that morning, Nature had draped the earth with her mantle of purest white & up till 11 a.m. the snow was still falling fairly thickly  At 12.30 the sun was shining from a beautiful blue sky & I have never, in all my life, seen a prettier picture that than Nature on Good Friday Afternoon in London here- overhead a blue sky with a few fleecy clouds about, below, a pure white covering where it had remained undisturbed.
