Two million Beer Wasps die;Shackleton has met his fate;The Bulgars fly on Bikes;The Kaiser runs a "two-up" schoolDutchmen flood their dykes
The King is now in New South WalesAnd says he's gong to stay;Zeppelins bomb a few more babes;Yanks are making hay.And this goes on for ever,And seldom is it true,But I know for a blankey certThat Tomorrow we'll have stew
Many a ship's been lost at seaFor want of a skilfull Master.Many a Tommy has lost his tartCause Anzac's Proved the faster.
