 a little way out of Bapaume so that we got back by 1 A.M. 
 Saturday 24th March Daylight saving comes into force again today the clocks going forward one hour during the night. Spent all day getting stuff away back to "Bernafay" in preparation for a removal, very tiring work as difficult to carry stuff in the tunnel. A note just arrived for me to go to Bapaume tomorrow so will shift quarters in the morning. 
 Sunday 25th March Started the lads working on clearing out the place &amp; then went back to "Bernafay" to arrange for stuff to be sent to Bapaume. Whilst there took the opportunity to have a hot bath &amp; change of new underclothing. Went back to the tunnel for my blankets &amp; continued on to Bapaume calling at the various posts on the way having tea at "Lusenhof"
