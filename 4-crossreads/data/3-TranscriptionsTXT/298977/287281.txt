Dear Mrs. Richards,
I was very sorry indeed to hear the sad news of Roy's death, and wish to convey my heartfelt sympathy to yourself and family in your very sad bereavement.
Nothing else on earth could have cast such a gloom over the Section, for he was idolised by every one.  Having been informed that the wound was only slight, we were pleased for his sake that he would get a rest, but we little knew the nature of that rest.
The last occasion on which we went to the trenches was the first time he and I had been separated, having been together ever since coming to France.  None knew him better than I did, and I can assure you his memory will ever live with us, for the memory of such a loving character can never fade.
Words can never describe our feelings, so will you kindly accept our sympathy, as we would wish it.
Yours sincerely,(Sgd) Donald S. Gibson
