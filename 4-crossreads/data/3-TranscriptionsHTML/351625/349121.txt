<p>there is a bit of spare ground.</p>
<p>Everywhere <strike>is</strike> there is the <strike>sigh</strike> sign of economy &amp; war restrictions especially in the food line which is cut very fine.  We are allowed one slice of bread for breakfast, &frac12; a slice for dinner &amp; 3 slices for tea with dripping or margarine &amp; jam or treacle, for dinner we generally have a stew, with every meal we have a weak kind of tea, in everything there is a scarcity of sugar, although there is enough food there is never any left over.  Our reinforcements have been put in contact where we will have to stay for three weeks or a month when we will be given 6 days leave which I believe is about the only leave we get.  The discipline is very rigid here &amp; the drill very hard but we have not had any yet but are starting tomorrow morning.  It has been raining &amp; windy ever since we arrived here &amp; I don't think it</p>
