96it lands one in Paris at 9.40 pm & it is to difficult to get a room or find one's way around. A train leaves here at 7 pm & reaches Paris 10.30 pm but this is worse However it means spending night at Quevilly or Paris & I decide for the attractions of Paris.
The mess here is a profitable institution run by base wallowers for their own profit at the expense of the fighting troops. The two officers decide that any profit in the mess must come into their hands & go on ordering whisky right up till last day. All of which will revert to them. I am glad to get away from such a grasping crowd & hope I have seen the last of the A.V.C.
On way down lorry containing our kits bolts & after an exciting time finally pulls up without smashing anybody or anything other than the reins & the tail boards. As it will mean missing this train if I wait till fresh harness is brought I take my orderly & small kit on in tram & reach Gare Rue Verte - meet Turgy - get an Ordre de Transport for Paris & off we go.
I have the whole carriage to myself as French RTO has cleared out all 2 & 3rd class passengers. We pass over Bridge Pont des Anglais & circle round town & then swing into Seine valley & follow it stopping at Sotteville
