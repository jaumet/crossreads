 Saturday.&nbsp; Our unit supplied the picket on shore for our boat.&nbsp; I was not in it, thank goodness.&nbsp; Did nothing all day except lie about in the shade and look for coolness and have the usual immersion in the afternoon.

 Sunday.&nbsp; Went to Church service 10.30.&nbsp; Nice service by Padre Forsyth.&nbsp; Ship&#39;s complement had to coal the vessel.&nbsp; Engineers had the first go at it.&nbsp; They made a very good showing.&nbsp; Mr Gray and Mr Dumas in it up to their necks.&nbsp; Was not picked, so did not help.&nbsp; Did not feel too good so was rather glad to be out of the dirty job.&nbsp; Day is very hot.&nbsp; Men looked like the niggers when they finished.&nbsp; Took Duncan Woolley&#39;s photo while he was smothered in the black coal dust.&nbsp; Norman Walker was discharged from hospital.&nbsp; He is not too well.

 Monday.&nbsp; Helped to-day with the coaling operations.&nbsp; Looked like Uncle Tom&#39;s brother when I was through and felt as if I had ventured too far into the hot place.&nbsp; Got a bath and was then informed that a Concert Party was to be sent off to the H.M.S Kent that evening, in which I was numbered, in the quartette.&nbsp; Left ship side at 7.30 in Kent&#39;s pinnace and had a delightful spin across the harbor.&nbsp; The party included Dad Rice, Willey, Patis, Wilson, Cameron, Mathieson, 6 stewards, Adjutant and O/C Troops of our ship.&nbsp; When we got on board the Kent, we saluted the Quarter Deck and were taken by the Padre - an excellent fellow - to the Officers Smoking room and mess and were dealt out and treated in a way that was worthy of the traditions of the British Navy.&nbsp; After getting smoke and booze into us we went on the Quarter Deck and the concert (program for which I sent home), began.&nbsp; The Quartette rendered &quot;Dear Little Shamrock&quot; and &quot;Comrades in Arms&quot;.&nbsp; The program was an excellent one and more cigarettes were put at our disposal.&nbsp; After two or three hours entertainment which were enjoyed by all the tars - judging by the manner in which they cheered us after the conclusion of the concert - we were again treated to drinks and smokes.&nbsp; We then embarked aboard the pinnace once again and set out for &quot;home&quot; which we reached at 10.40 and thus ended the most pleasant evening&#39;s enjoyment we had so far experienced.

 Tuesday.&nbsp; Still very hot.&nbsp; Will it never change.&nbsp; Duncan Woolley in hospital with slight concussion of the brain as a result of his fall some weeks back during sports.&nbsp; Concert party from Kent gave us a return visit to-night.&nbsp; Proved to be very enjoyable and clever turns.&nbsp; Sat on hatch for 2&frac12; hours before it began in order to get a good seat and view of the performers and performance.&nbsp; Got program of items.&nbsp; They also showed slides through a lantern.&nbsp; Finale of their bill particularly fine.&nbsp; Gave big cheers as they ended their bill at 10 pm.,
