<p>Flanders<br/>19 June 16<br/>My dearest Irene,<br/>The nice parcel you sent me has come to hand. Thank you very much old girl. It contained 2/3 of a tin of biscuits, I tin condensed milk, 1 pair sox &amp; 1 tin Sardines, so the rotten low bred creatures in one of the Post Offices through which it came thieved from the parcel 1/3 of a tin of biscuits, 2 cakes Chocolate, 1 tin of Jam &amp; 1 tin of sardines.<br/>My wish for those who stole the afore-mentioned is, that they may develop Consumption &amp; awful cancerous growths &amp; live in agony till they reach 100 years in age. &ndash; The cardboard box in which the things came was not broken in any way, but must have been undone &amp; tied up again. &ndash; It was a cardboard box from the Civil Service. &ndash; The biscuits were a bit broken but would not have been if none had been removed. &ndash; Nevertheless I enjoyed the parcel very much.  I am afraid it is very necessary to sew parcels up in some stuff. &ndash; Had a letter from Roy Waldron the other day. He is a Captain now &ndash; has had a bad Knee &amp; just as it got well got Laryngitis &amp; just on top of that developed Measles &amp; is at present</p>
