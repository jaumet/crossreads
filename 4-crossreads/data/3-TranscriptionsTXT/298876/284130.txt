Self & 3 Orderlys were rudely awakened in our snug little deck Cabin by W.O. about 9.30 am, to pack up our wardrobe & get out - as a Case of measles had broke out & they wanted to Isolate him - we forgot what we said to him - after having a big night & had just got in dream land, I roared to such an extent about not getting any sleep & always being disturbed, that I was going to refuse to act of an night etc - At any rate I bluffed the W.O. & he said well keep quiet & follow me - my home is now in Cabin 95 - One only wants to travel on a troopship to know what a Chuck in this is - quite enough I slept soundly the rest of the day.
To night Wireless seemed to be calling & talking with Ceylon. I never saw such beautiful sunsets.Full moon tonight is also charming. Feeling a lot better
