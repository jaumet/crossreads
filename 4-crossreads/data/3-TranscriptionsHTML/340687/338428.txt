<p>May, 1917. Friday 4<br/>Up at 8. Day hot with a good breeze. Cleaned cylinder and took down water circulation. Savage came round in after. but we could discover nothing wrong. Tried to run her again but same result and must be inadequate cooling system. Wrote letters all evening until 10. and then pumped as much as she would go.</p>
