Sun. Jan. 27
Glory! Alleluia. At last I got a Letter from Lill. What a Beauty. One of the Best she ever wrote. It is dated Oct. 16, but that doesn't matter, it's just as welcome. Finished No 3 and also wrote to Nell. Must write Mother tomorrow. Sun night. Must ask Lill if she ever received any copies of the "Tattoo". Not much use me being Sub-Editor if she didn't. Had afternoon off, but having no decent clothes to wear I stayed in Camp and read thro? some of B.E's Letters, which are always interesting. Wrote to "Westy" Harefield. This time last year we were at No 4. Post, in front of Bapaume, and strange to say, my diary for that day, commences just the same as this. I got 9 Letters Mon. and 3 of ?em were from M.S., and it's exactly a year ago today Peter Murphy was wounded. Must tell Lill that. 
Mon. 28
Got paid this morning, drew 15/-. Also went to Q.M. Store and got a pair of riding strides and puttees. The Pants are too big, so that means I'll have to change ?em. The weather is fine.
There is a very fine Band attached to this Command, and the O.C. is very proud of it. They went to London last Friday and returned today. Got P.C?d from "Jacko".
Tues, Jan 29. 
Air Raid in London. They did a lot of damage, but there's not much in the Paper about it. The nights are quite moonlight, just the weather for Fritz to come over.
Stayed in the Hut and commenced Letter No 4 to Lill; also wrote to Mother.
