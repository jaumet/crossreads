 Been very busy in the horse lines in proper positions and generally running about. The sand here is beautiful and clean and also beautiful and deep, ankle deep in fact and extremely hard to get along in a great strain  of  on the leg muscles walking about in it all day and for my part I do no more walking about than is strictly necessary. Everything is covered with sand, it gets into the food which is very annoying and very disagreeable and also injurious. It has its compensations though and its only redeeming feature lies in the fact that it is soft to lie on if that can be called a redeeming feature

 Recommenced signalling practise this morning Nearly all new men and some of them are rather backward at present for lack of proper training and there is also a lack of cohesion They are all in strange surroundings they dont our methods of work and they dont know my methods of training which I might say are severe but after a time I shall have them in good going order I hope and then I shall have no cause for complaint
