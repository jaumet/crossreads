<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I am enclosing in this mail a few snapshots that I have taken fairly recently- mostly when we were in the Ypres section.  Nothing important of course but a few sidelights in our life.  I will forward the negatives on later.<br/>I am getting on very well.  Was outside for about an hour yesterday but it was too cold to be enjoyable.<br/>I received a letter from the Commonwealth Bank yesterday saying that a remittance for &pound;12 had arrived from the Sydney Bank &amp; was at my disposal.  This is the amount I cabled for when I was on leave a short time ago.  Thank you very much, Father dear for sending it as I asked.  It will be very useful at present as I am unable to draw any on my paybook under War Regulations<br/>I haven't heard where Walter is yet, but hope to hear very soon bow.<br/>The weather has brightened up considerably</p>
