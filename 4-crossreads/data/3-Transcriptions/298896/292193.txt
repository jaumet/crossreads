<p>two of us went into town &amp; booked seats to see a show given by "The Grousers" the 24th divisions concert troupe. It was first rate &amp; had a full house several nurses, W.a.a.c.s. &amp; French girls being present. I saw the same company at Reninghelst just about 12 months ago. It was a fine treat to me. Strolled round after &amp; bought some postcards for my nephews &amp; nieces &amp; then picked up the car in the square &amp; returned home<br/>Thursday 24th Oct.<br/> Did very little but prepare the indents for the battalions. Weather  much improved. Beginning to feel ready for my leave now as when we first left the line I was not a bit anxious. War news good, all the Flanders Coast now ours also Lille &amp; surrounding towns &amp; the hun is reported to have lost 5000 guns. He is still fighting well &amp; is retreating well and methodically getting away with most of his material. 500,000 civilians have been liberated being so many more mouths to feed, an extra burden on Gt Britain.<br/>Saturday 26th Oct<br/> Ran into Abbeville by</p>
