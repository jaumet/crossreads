<p>Commissioned HMS Glory, Portsmouth 2 August 1914<br/>[Note, Britain declared war on Germany on 5 August 1914, following the expiry of an ultimatum sent to Germany on 4 August. The ultimatum demanded that Germany immediately quit the invasion of Belgium or Britain would declare war.(Germany crossed Belgium frontier on the morning of 4 August) Germany ignored the ultimatum. The recommissioning of HMS Glory on 2 August indicates that the navy was engaged in a mobilisation exercise given the build-up of international tensions, and Glory was either resuming with the fleet following a period in reserve or resuming operational duties following dockyard refit. The diary does not indicate whether this was Nansen's first introduction to sea-going service, and/or that he had previous navy experience.]<br/>Left Portsmouth 5 August 1914 6pm Arrived Plymouth ditto [5 August] 10pm?<br/>Left Plymouth 6 August 6pm<br/>Heave to steamer Spencer-Liverpool with cargo [of] grain for Germany. Sent her into Falmouth.<br/>[It appears that Glory apprehended a cargo steamer with a load of grain finally destined for Germany, In other words, the British blockade of Germany had commenced.]<br/>[This action was incidental to Glory proceeding to Halifax to commence duty, based at that port, as a guardship, ie a ship specifically located in order to repel any enemy attempt to invest, disrupt or damage port operations. Halifax, by virtue of its strategic position adjacent to the Atlantic , was seen as a vital port in the British - Canadian relationship, and the Canadians, not having much of a navy themselves, relied on the RN to perform such duties. Likewise, troop convoy escort.]<br/>Arrived Halifax 16th [August]<br/>Coaled ship -1500 tons<br/>[Coaling ship was a disgusting job, and involved most of the ship's company. Many descriptions as to this exercise abound .eg Churchill - "The ordeal of coaling ship exhausted the whole ship's company" [Masse -'Dreadnought' p784] Because of the bunkering system, coal could only be taken on board in bags, by individual sailors. It was filthy work. After the loading was completed, the clean-up was monumental, because the coal dust permeated into every nook and cranny..]<br/>Left Halifax 25 August Cruising around New York<br/>[The entry "cruising around New York" indicates the ocean area patrolled by HMS Glory in the role of guardship, port of Halifax. Sailing south from Halifax {capital of Nova Scotia) immediately brings a ship into proximity with the U.S. New England states and the waters adjacent to the coast of New York.]<br/>Arrived Halifax 31 August Coal 9oo tons<br/>Left Halifax 5th September<br/>Cruising - Captured two steamers &ndash;</p>
