<p>There were 4 cargo ships in the convoy with her, escorted by a sloop &amp; 4 trawlers. Two of the cargo boats were also sunk viz. 3 ships out of five torpedoed &amp; sunk. One of the cargo ships was the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Shire.<br/>A large Italian oil tank came in having been in collision in a convoy off Alexandria, bows bulged &amp; badly stowed in opposite No. 1 hatch.</p>
<p>At 11 am this day the flying convoy composed of Kiasar I Hind, Malwa, Canberra, Ormond &amp; Norman arrived with a few hundred white troops &amp; the rest a matter of 18,000 colored troops from France via Taronto for Palastine &amp; Mesepotamia. We are still awaiting our turn for docking. So many ships being torpedoed that the dock is kept exceedingly busy not with standing the fact that only up to the water line is repaired whilst in dock &amp; the rest done outside so as to cause as less delay as possible.<br/>Finished our Australian stores &amp; now on local foodstuffs. The 20 tons of flour we received a few days ago was so bad that it was sent ashore today &amp; returned &amp; replaced by another lot. The butter so they call it is worse than ordinary white lard. Tasteless &amp; by all accounts it is local</p>
