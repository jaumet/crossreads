<p>especially "Beachy Bill" make a great impression on us &amp; causes profound respect from all classes.  I witnessed a very sad spectacle yesterday (8/7/15) which is quite a common incident in the daily routine here.  The enemy, per medium of their eighteen pound guns, situated in the olive grove behind Kabe Tepe, opened fire &amp; after raking the beach, transferred their shooting on to a camp of Engrs. near Shrapnel Gully.  The shots, which tore over our heads, lobbed with great force &amp; precision among the men &amp; it wasn't long ere a good number were wounded.  It was sickening to watch percussion shells tear great holes in the earth &amp; catch some helpless unfortunate in his dugout &amp; lift him out bodily.  The last shot burst close in to earth &amp; lifted one man fully five feet in the air &amp; foward.  He fell, probably mangled, as a frog would into water &amp; apparently quite dead.<br/>The war is still in progress here altho the calendar is getting on to August.  Our men are forever bringing guns &amp; ammunition to our portion of the beach &ndash; the right <strike>was</strike> must be a fortress ere now &ndash; in addition to field guns &amp; mountain</p>
