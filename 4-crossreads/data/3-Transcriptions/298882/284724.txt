<p>concert given by some of the hospital staff.</p>
<p>20th S. Hosp.  25.11.17</p>
<p>I went to a concert last night in the YMCA given by the M Gun Coy.  They had a very good orchestra and the items were rendered for the most part by professional actors.  The weather is very windy and cold.  I am sharing my ward with two very nice English chaps.</p>
