<p>[Printed page]<br/>THE SUM OF CHIVALRY</p>
<p>What shall be said of him, your friend,<br/>That very perfect gentle knight<br/>Whose fair life, crowned with such an end,<br/>No graven scroll could praise aright?</p>
<p>There is a simple line can tell<br/>Of the great spirit, proud and free,<br/>Whose steadfast vision still would dwell<br/>Upon the star of Courtesy.</p>
<p>No shining warrior prince of old,<br/>Whose glory fit the knightly days,<br/>But this brief epitaph had told<br/>The perfect measure of his praise.</p>
<p>Yet him we mourn a courage graced<br/>That finds no ancient counterpart,<br/>What knew they of the deaths he faced<br/>With laughter from a boyish heart?</p>
<p>There needs no marble, just the small<br/>Rude cross of wood that soldiers rear,<br/>And this for proud memorial &ndash;<br/>"AN AUSTRALIAN GENTLEMAN LIES HERE"</p>
