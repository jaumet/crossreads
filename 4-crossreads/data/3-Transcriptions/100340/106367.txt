<p>France<br/>17/8/18<br/>Dear Vol  &amp; Sis<br/>I received your letter of 6 June a few days ago but this is the first opportunity I have had to answer it. We are back at the A.D.S. (Advanced dressing station)  &amp; are most likely going out for a week or two's spell tomorrow. We have been in for nearly seven weeks  &amp; have been in the line since this last stunt started 8/8/18. It was a glorious stunt  &amp; I wouldn't have missed it for anything. We are barred from giving an account of it but no doubt you will have got the guts of it from the papers. I am quite alright  &amp; never got a scratch out of it although one night I was partially buried. Am sorry to hear about Ivy's mishap but of course she will be quite alright by now, anyway I sincerely hope so. So pleased to hear that Noni is doing so well. She must be growing</p>
