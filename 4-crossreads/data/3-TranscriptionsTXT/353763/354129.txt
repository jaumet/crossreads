 about 9 pm I generally go to bed    -  quiet steady life   -  The food is all right &amp; we are a very contented jolly crowd  -  From all I can see &amp; hear if our chaps get a chance they'll distinguish themselves  - 
 W'day &ndash; Sept 2  - Fine weather   -  ports open   -  Temp 75 &deg; F  -  Jolly  -  We are passing islands &ndash; bare on the W but with trees &amp; vegetation, so far as we can judge, on the Eastern or Pacific side   - Talking last night I learnt that our oil fuel on board is worth 3000 &pound; Each torpedo 400 &pound;   -  we have spare ones   -  we have a spare periscope   -  value 500 &pound; It was said the value of the ship's cargo is &pound; 10000   -  We have 1600 packets of revolver ammunition &amp; ? 14000 cartridges  -  303 that R knows for our magazine Lee Enfield   -  we are worth capturing   -  However we are mighty well looked after &amp; the vessel wd  -  Be sunk before we gave her up to any Germans   -  Our notion is, in case a cruiser came in sight to go for the shore for all we'r worth   -  The gunboat isn't worth much so far as fighting goes so she'd signal our Submarines &amp; then fall back on them   -  By the way we haven't seen them since last Saty  but they're somewhere round    - All well on board  -  I report daily to the Captain &ndash; a man put his foot thro a skylight yesterday but got off light   -  Just fancy, not a word of war news since we started   -  By the way I find each torpedo when fully equipped costs close on 800 &pound; The steel part holds the machinery &amp; propelling power   -  To its end is fixed a 'war head' - This contains the explosive &amp; it comes into contact with a ship's side  -  A force of 400 lbs liberates its energy &amp; tears a hole in the ship's side   - Gun Cotton is the explosive   - 
 Thursday 8 am  - We are anchored off Townsville  - The Protector alongside &amp; the Hospital ship - Grantala is here too
