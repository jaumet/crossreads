 surpris than myself when they told us we were there ; our trench they call it ? whi it was no more than 20 yds long about up to your waist ; it seem so funni after scrap fight so long in good trench . My platoon took over three of these littl outpost with a gap of 60 yds between 200 between platoon settl down for the night , we reliev the 59th Bn . when I came to look at our posit I did not like the look of thing at all for it would not be a veri hard job
