<p>August 4th<br/>Two Companies of our Bn. left St. Vaast this evening and after a very hard and lengthy march reached billets here in Cardonnette in good style.  The spirit and staying power of our chaps on the march was never better illustrated.  Good news in the France papers.  The Allies have driven the huns back between Soissons and Rhiems (about 50 kilos) to an average depth of 10 miles.  It is a wonderful victory for our armies.</p>
