Saturday 3rd July 1915

Watch on bridge 8 am to 12 noon – 8 pm to midnight – a stormy day with fierce head winds & rain squalls. Passed Albany to the northward, a good many miles south at about mid-day. "Berrima" proved herself a good sea boat but a perfect devil as far for shipping seas f’ward. Our mess deck frequently drenched down companion way & saloon deck wet all over. Heard frequent complaints about uncomfortable conditions aboard, men smoking in latrines & lavatories to avoid dampness overhead.

Sunday 4th July 1915

A brighter day – sunshine with pleasant southward breeze – mess orderly. Watch duties cancelled by Captain of ship.

Monday 5th July 1915

Monotonous day – buck concert at night – the monotony of the voyage is depressive & becoming more accentuated every day. Due west of Sydney at noon.
