<p>December 7<br/>a photograph shews his badge as English.  Across then to 'Q' for A.I.F. list, and found one J.L. Turner, a Capt. in 5th Div. Train A.F.A. [Australian Field Artillery]<br/>From Williams and Norgate the book of Mestrovic has been issued &ndash; 750 copies at 25/-.  Another interesting announcement is from Lane &ndash; a Bundle of Aussies &ndash; with illustrations by Jim S.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning in to Chatelat to Pay Office &ndash; and find no money order through yet from C.P. &ndash; while notification from the bank was posted Dec. 24.</p>
<p>25.<br/>Post away this morning Morris' 'Hollow Land' and Stephen's 'Hill of Vision':  and a bundle of old and Dec. 'Aussies'.</p>
<p>December 7<br/>26.<br/>Afternoon to Chatelat in the Chat with Ken A. and Mick &ndash; they on to Brussels.  Pass to Bruges and Antwerp through this morning, so to the Pay Office:  and no money through!  So the problem stands at 'funds'.  Will see Geoff in the morning, failing that, call on the Amb. people.</p>
<p>A keenly clear night, high dark skies frozenly starr'd:  and a crescent brilliant moon:  the pines black-cut shadows, and the ground by the Chateau vaguely green in the cold light.  If only the weather lasts.</p>
<p>'Thais' on at the Brussels O.H. on the 9th so leaving here the day after tomorrow, D.V.</p>
