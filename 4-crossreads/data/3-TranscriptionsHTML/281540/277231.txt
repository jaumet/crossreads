<p>22/10/15<br/>for the job so trust AW to detail himself !   Hear stories of a little village there where a decent meal is to be had and donkey rides to it from camp.  Whisky 8/- a bottle and lager beer also procurable.  Will suit some but not a "wowser" like myself !!  C.O. is  a staunch Rechabite but returned from a tour round the trenches when the miners were getting their daily "dose", and remarked that he found the smell very enticing and felt he was cultivating a liking for the smell of it.</p>
<p>Monitor lying alongside cruiser today &ndash; two big guns one for'd and one aft and an anti-aircraft gun pointing skywards.  A blustery, bleak, wintry day the sea rough and foam-flecked, and looking grey &amp; forebidding, the swim at daylight was a chilly business and as they are breaking up the barge I had a devil's own job to get out of the water, struggling for a long time to haul myself out much to Drummonds amusement.</p>
<p>More miners reported from 18th Battn. Taking out over 400 bags of spoils daily now &ndash; air pump working.  We are driving right underneath Abdul's trenches.  Went to bed at 1050 and read for a while</p>
<p>23/10/15<br/>Cold &amp; dark &amp; bleak at stand to.  Cutting wind.  Had to keep the lads standing a long time as day was slow in breaking.  Reneged on swim and went back to bad.  Slept in until 0800, <br/>Went to Bde HQ and got orders for Imbros trip.  Worked my batman in as one of the men to accompany me as the party.</p>
<p>Leave on Monday at 1400.  Dead Engineer lying in sap shot through lungs by sniper.  Sea rough &amp; foaming.  Expect a seasick trip on Monday</p>
