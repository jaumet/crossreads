 Sunday June 10th The weather is great now, getting warmer every day. Went for a very nice walk round the promenade &amp; right over the cliffs. Very tired when I arrived back home. 
 Monday June 11th Put on draft to go to Perham Downs tomorrow morning, of course we went through the usual medical inspections, also kit inspections. Went for a very nice paddle in a canoe, I was out for two hours, &amp; went all over the harbour. The water was very calm. 
 Tuesday June 12th Was up at 5.30 am, &amp; had an early breakfast. Left Westham Camp about 7.30 &amp; entrained at Weymouth, (left about 9 am). After changing at Poole, Andover &amp; Salisbury we eventually arrived at Tidworth. Marched from Tidworth to Perham Downs Camp. Put in No 5 Camp Details. I do not go much on the camp here, it is in a very outstandish  place, &amp; seems very dead. We are camped in tents here, &amp; with only three blankets, it is very hard sleeping on the boards. It is very dusty, it will be very hard to keep anything clean. There  are  is a great assortment of different units here. Viz:- Infantry, A.M.C. Artillery, Engineers, Flying Corps, wireless operators, Light Horse, cyclists, pioneers, etc, well in fact I think every branch of the army is represented.
