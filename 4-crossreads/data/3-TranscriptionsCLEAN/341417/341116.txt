  
 Commissions in this force as soon as the vacancies occour so it may not be long before we gain our rank as officers. I may say mum we have plenty of sport of an evening now in the shape of boxing the other night I was boxing with a chap & I got worked in a corner & when trying to work my out got a beauty in the eye which closed it up completely but you can bet I gave one in return a few minutes after. To night our company is having a concert in the mess room & I can tell you there are some characters who sing comic songs we also get the nurses along to sing a few songs as well & the men appreciate them very much. 
 To-day Thursday we are again trying to keep cool as it is to hot too drill we parade to day at 4. p.m & get back to camp at 10. p.m. I can tell you it is beautiful at night here as the moon is always bright & the nights cool so we do not begrudge the night marches & hot coffee when we return is just alright. We have only two meals here breakfast & tea it is
