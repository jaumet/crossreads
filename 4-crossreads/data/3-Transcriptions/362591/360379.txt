<p>and photography in connection with aerial work, general flying, artillery observation, Reconnaissances and other subjects the application of which would take a long time to explain.  In addition &ndash; and most important &ndash; are the <u>practical</u> lectures on the types (6) of engine used, and on the construction ("rigging") theoretical and practical of aeroplanes themselves.  As you can imagine the evening is well occupied with study.</p>
<p>At the end of the course there are examinations in all these subjects, and after passing these satisfactorily an officer is posted to a reserve Squadron and sent to an aerodrome.  There in stages he learns to fly probably a dozen different types of machine, and at the same time consolidates and improves on his knowledge of the details and methods of the work to be done out at the front.  While waiting to be sent out he may have to take delivery of new machines from the makers, test them (a <u>nice</u> job in the Shakesperian sense) and fly them away to other aerodromes in the country, or even to France (returning by boat).  By the time he is sent to the front he should be a thoroughly efficient man.</p>
<p>That is a general idea of the process of training an officers, though of course it may have minor variations according to the ability and personality of the individual.  I hope I have made it fairly clear.</p>
<p>Since I last wrote to you &ndash; on Jan. 25 &ndash; I have moved about a little.  As the 3rd Battn. Manchesters, stationed at Cleethorpes on the east coast near Grimsby, takes part in the defence scheme of the Humber, my expected leave at the end of the Cambridge course was not granted.  I went direct to my battalion on Saturday 5th Feb. and remained there for a week, in billets and with very little to do.  We had one practice night-alarm and I spent a couple of days out with my Company (about 40 strong, as the 3rd is a reserve battalion) constructing trenches and erecting breastworks near the coast.</p>
<p>On Saturday 12th I came down to London, had three days of quiet amusement, purchased some camp kit according to orders, and on Tuesday 15th reported here for duty.  Since then I have been fairly busy.  The course was 1&frac12; weeks old when I joined and in order to be able to sit for the examinations I have a good deal to make up.  There is a good deal of talk and speculation about the amalgamation of the two branches of the Air Service, but we have no inside information yet.  At present it seems that I cannot hope to get out to the front under three or four months, but realising the amount there is to be learnt and done, I am not grumbling.  With luck I expect to be posted to a Squadron and to start actual flying about the end of March.</p>
<p>It is now 10.45 p.m., and as I have spent most of the day (Sunday) writing up lectures I feel ready to turn in.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson and yourself (and Dorothy if I do not have time to write to her this mail).</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>L.O'G. Whitfeld</p>
