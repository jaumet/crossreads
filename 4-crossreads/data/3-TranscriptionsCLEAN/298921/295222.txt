  
 September, 1915 Wednesday 8 We are a most jolly crowd, it is the pleasure of clean sheets beds, good Tucker, Baker Barber, deli make me forget all troubles. Cutler came in to see me today he still drives Brigade car. He is a good boy  & has only knocked over a small number of niggers - The latter do not love us, - & we are in an unfriendly country & it is fear not respect that keeps them under - not to mention Motors . At times one feels a bit lonely away from the Regiment & all mates in Hospital out here one is only a Number. is of no interest unless dangerously ill or wounded.
