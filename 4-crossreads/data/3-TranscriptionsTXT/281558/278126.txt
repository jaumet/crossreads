Pal of Mine
Ginger wasn't much to look at he was dirty vulgar lowBut I bet he's a favourite where game dying soldiers goHe'd never had no schooling & he'd sell his shirt for wineBut I loved him as a brother - lion hearted pal o mine
Oftd I see you little comrade as I did that winter's mornyour blood flecked lips swearing the old smile ever wornWhere the rattle of the rifles & the roar of bursting shellWith screams of men hard dying made it all a proper Hell
On that grey & cheerless morning the mist wrack all aswirlI kissed you lips old comrade as I've never kissed a girl"Fall in" for you was sounding - the last great trumpets callYour soul "stood to attention" on the field that levels all
Well I don't know much of Heaven this harps & halo gameThough the Chaplain used to tell us as how a Christian cameWho'd save the poor & lowly if they pray'd it to him squareThough in hell I am game to meet you little comrade if youre there
Yet I sometimes get to thinking in the day beyond the nightThere's a Heaven home for soldiers who battle for the rightThe soldier's Hell is No mansland with the star shells overhead& the red moon kind of leering on the battered bloody dead
