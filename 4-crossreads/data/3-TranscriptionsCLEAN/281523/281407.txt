  
 28/7/17 29/7/17 Arques & Campagne Berguette and the convoy was reconsigned to Arques where there is a big railway yard.  Just about 18 months ago we detrained in the same spot from Marseilles in snow and sleet.  The indefatigable Rodda was on the spot and all our billetting NCOs under Keith Anderson.  From the YMCA we got hot cocoa and all had a drink before moving off.  The wagons and limbers were all unloaded by an unloading party of the 21st.  After everyone had gone went down by an ambulance car to our billets at Campagne - a very clean and tiny little village in which the 21st are also lodged.  My quarters at a two storied place evidently the home of the leading people in the village a nice white little chateau with pretty grounds.  A number of rank and file were also here but they soon had other billets found for them.  Madame produced hot coffee and bread and made a request for not too much stamping in the rooms above.  At 6 am turned in and slept until 11.  Lunch at noon and had the telephones put on.  An attack of hay fever today - unusual.
