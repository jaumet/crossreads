 have to hurry away at once for a buss or Tube to get into Victoria 
 Station in time, he produces two other men to help him blow whistles. 
 They make Portland Place hideous with their whistles and then all three 
 come and tell me that a taxi (which I have no doubt has been round the 
 corner all the time) is at the door, having been secured at great 
 difficulty.&nbsp; My advice to Hotel visitors is never to leave at seven 
 in the morning for at that hour you catch the staff &quot;changing over&quot;: 
 there they are, both the night and the day shifts forming a sort of 
 &quot;arch of palms&quot; on steps.&nbsp; The girl at the &quot;leave keys here&quot; counter 
 grins.&nbsp; How I hate that girl.&nbsp; I get through with the loss of much

 the window I sort of take a liking to him.&nbsp; He is going to be paid 
 for DOING something for me.&nbsp; The idea appeals to me and I give him 
 an extra shilling or so, instead of the customary tuppence.&nbsp; &quot;Thank 
 you Sir&quot;, he says, &quot;And I hope you have a comfortable crossing&quot;. 
 Somehow I was glad to receive that old chap&#39;s well wishes, they seemed 
 genuine.&nbsp;

 leave train is one which has over and over again been described in the
