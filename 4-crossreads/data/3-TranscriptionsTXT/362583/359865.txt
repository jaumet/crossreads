 as his father was so devoted to him and so full of plans for his future. 
 It is so difficult to realise even now, that it is all ended and that he can never come back to us. It seems such a cruel end to much ambition &amp; keenness and just when he got the chance he longed for, to "really do something." 
 I am remaining in India until the war is over, I was ready to be off at a moments notice, but as my people are out here on a visit, I shall wait to go home with them. Poor [Normand McLaurin?], I was very sorry to hear about him, we got to know him so well and I think he was the nicest man I know &amp; such a good soldier. 
 You will be having an anxious time about your boy but I hope he will get through safely. 
 With kindest regards &amp; please tell Mr. Ferguson how greatly we appreciated his letter. We shall meet you at home sometime I hope c/o Knight. 9 Pall Mall. London- will always find me. 
 Sincerely yrs [Emily Irvine?]
