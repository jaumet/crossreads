 27-5-15.   Hot.  Jolly hot. 
 Last evening my pen commenced to spill out words to M. M. Thomas, but the spirit which animated it was not active enough to do justice to any subject.

 10.10 p.m.   Hot!   Jolly hot!!!   All day. 
 Hot now as I sit in my room writing a few words to you, and munching a biscuit which will be washed down with some water or some lemonade after a little.  You would laugh to see me, seated at the table nearly everyone else in bed, my room amply large but not richly decorated; a bed in the centre of the room; the windows and doors wide open; packages scattered here & there; writing materials of all descriptions on the table - another piece of biscuit.  Blow the fly!  One of the persisting insects of Egypt.   Again he is at my face.   Again.   Again.   Again.  I must kill him with a whisp.   He has departed. -
