<p>For weeks prior to the evacuation of Anzac &amp; Suvla Bay, by our forces, things denoted that troops would be shortly withdrawn from that area.</p>
<p>The rumour that went the rounds to account for the gradually clearing of hospitals, removal of troops &amp; the diminution of Ordnance &amp; supplies, was that the garrison was to be reduced by &frac12; owing to winter approaching &amp; a reserve force kept on the Island of Imbros, about 5 miles off the coast.<br/> I must say this gossip seemed to satisfy mostly everyone &amp; if the departing troops were not off for a rest then Salonica must be their destination.</p>
<p>Then the news, that 1 gun per battery was moved during one night. Still we never thought of such a thing as evacuation.</p>
<p>On 15th of Dec. 5 days before we finally left, no doubt as to what was going to be done, existed.</p>
<p>I happened to be near Mule Gully where the Ordnance Dept had their stocks &amp; witnessed a sight which perhaps reminded me of a Bargain Sale at Winns. [Winns Department Store, Newcastle, NSW.]<br/>An officer announced that the stores were "open to the public" &amp; immediately the yard was a mass of struggling soldiers. Cases were burst open &amp; if the contents was not needed, then others were serched. Gum boots, revolvers, ankle boots, water-proof</p>
