<p>At Sea</p>
<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>We are all well and comfortable and very happy.  We had a few days (3 or 4) of rough weather after the 2nd or 3rd day out but she is a beautifully steady ship and we came through it wonderfully well.  The sea for the last few days has been quite oily with a long slow swell which keeps the ship lazily swaying from side to side with a rather monotonous motion.  I personally have not once been troubled with seasickness and have been as fit as a fiddle all along with the excepn. of a day and a half of innoculation troubles which however did not keep me away from work.  There was a good deal of sickness amongst the men at first but they are all well now except the usual colds &amp; that sort of thing.  The officers have 1st class accomodation.  My cabin is exactly similar to those on the Otway except that there is a communicating door with the next cabin in which is a chap of whom I am very fond and who is in the same company as myself.  The service of the ship is run by the shipping company just as though the ship were on an ordinary passenger trip and the table is about the best I have ever enjoyed.  The "Officers' Mess" is quite the</p>
