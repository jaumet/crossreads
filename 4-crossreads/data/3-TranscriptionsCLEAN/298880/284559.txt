broken very badly at that by shell fire. On Saturday night Saturday Sunday night three men & myself started out with about 3/4 mile of DIT cable to find the trouble & mend it. About half way between H.Q. & the front line we found the cable smashed to smithereens. We found one broken end to the line on the drum & started off to run an earth return line to the firing line. We accomplished this & got back safely once more. During our stunts the other line was patrolled nightly by two others of the section & their job was no less risky. "Last night was a beautiful moonlight night too". Now after all our trouble on both lines are 'out' again. It would send a man grey headed in no time.
