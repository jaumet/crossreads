Etaples<br/>Since my last entry I have been more or less on the sick list &ndash; Early in January I returned to duty with the Engineers &amp; was up at Pommiers &ndash; I had only been back 4 days when I was given my long expected leave to Blighty &ndash; wasn't feeling over fit but as <strike>as</strike> I told my O.C. I would have crawled there.</p>
