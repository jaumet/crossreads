<p>&amp; not the best for billeting but two of us arranged for a billet of our own &amp; we were extremely comfortable, in an attic.</p>
<p>Wednesday 1st August<br/>   Raining all day &amp; most miserable everyone almost being wet through.  Not having much to do spent a part of the time in my attic writing letters.  The place full of refugees as the huns have been shelling places 20 miles behind the line.  Very sad to see a load of furniture followed by the owners trudging along looking for a home.  For 3 years this area has been safe to within a couple of miles of the line, now the new offensive has changed the whole area.  A vast effort is apparently going to be made here, troops are everywhere &amp; any day we expect it to start when we will all take our turn.  The huns know that it is coming &amp; are attempting to upset our arrangements</p>
