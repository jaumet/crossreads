<p>rather more than I should but its not a bad town, very quaint &amp; old fashioned.  There are nice shops &amp; tea places &amp; I have a great friend in a music shop who likes me to go in &amp; play his piano, he has a beauty, one simply can't leave off on it.  Saturday we had a great treat there, the Garde Republican Bande were there &amp; they gave a concert so we stayed (we're supposed to be out of town by 7-30 p.m. but we got permission).  It was a great concert, I never heard anything better, just like an absolutely magnificient organ playing.</p>
<p>Weather here has been a bit cooler lately, about a week back it was very hot &amp; close, then we had about the worst thunderstorms I've seen &amp; then a couple of wet days.  Now its not too bad but I have been a bit off colour.  Always did hate these lulls.  Plenty of fruit in Amiens, we get a bit round here too.</p>
<p>I'm glad to know you were pleased to be back home &amp; that Mac welcomed you nicely.  I'm simply dying to see Grahame &amp; the garden (nobody &amp; nothing else of course).  But I've been so cranky &amp; homesick &amp; restless lately &amp; can't settle to anything, not even write a decent letter, I'm owing stacks.</p>
