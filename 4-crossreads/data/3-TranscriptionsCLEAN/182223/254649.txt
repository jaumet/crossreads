 Wednesday 31 March 1915 Ride before breakfast. Air warm. Locusts. Snails on shrubs, glued to stalk by gum at open End, Alabaster, bones human & other, petrified wood. Moisture deposited on stones before sun rise then evaporated by the sun light gives a coolness to the atmosphere on the ridge of the plateau.  Ride during the afternoon across the cultivated lands. Looking at the Locusts on the banks of the Canals, where they were in large numbers  being  the females being impregnated, & it may be getting ready to deposit their eggs. The females are grey the males a bright yellow.
