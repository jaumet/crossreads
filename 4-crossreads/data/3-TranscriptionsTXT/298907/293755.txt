Saturday afternoons doing this kind of work instead of playing, rather a good idea, its surprising the amount of work they got through by knock off time, they have a special costume for this work & they look very smart & businesslike too, after I had been there a while a few Aussies sick of the howling screeching sopranos began to trickle down & by 8.30 there was a decent crowd I wonder what the Commandant would have said if she could have only seen her patients, down in this forbidden ground for the vegetable garden is "out of bounds"
I have to record a painful loss, nothing less than my beautiful fountain pen that I had carried so far & through all the batles in France for the last 2 years, & I thought the world of that pen for she was such a beauty, it was an Ideal Watermans & I gave 1-1 for it when I first went to England in 1916.  some dirty stinking low
