<p>Marching to attention kicking tins. Jeff &amp; I turned in together.</p>
<p>23 October 1916 Mon<br/>Left Buysscheure 9.30 &amp; after a [indecipherable] pace we halted about two miles from our starting point just off the main road having to wait for a large column of infantry to pass by joining them up in the rear. Apples, blackberries. Passed many vills finally getting lost after dark. Striking matches to read sign boards. Boys all cursing. Dry bread &amp; tea for tea.</p>
<p>24 October 1916 Tues<br/>Fell in 10.30 &amp; whilst on parade the O.C. read out that Sgt Christmas had received the Military Medal. It was not [popular] with the boys so they [hooted]. Left St. Omer about dark after 17 miles walk. Raining all the way. Cattle trucks again. Very bad cold Clive rubs me with eucaytus.</p>
