<p>-2- 14th June 1916.</p>
<p>out in billets together, so we have organised a programme to celebrate.</p>

<p>Love to all at Home, and hope all are O.K.<br/>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>

<p><u>P.S.  Next Morning.</u>  The Concert came off and was a brilliant success.  Will enclose a programme if I have time to copy it out.  The Band was a scream.  Home made instruments including xylophones (don't know how to spell it), banjoes, numerous mouth organs and kerosene cans, not forgetting the <u>dorg,</u> with the "Colonel" officiating.  You should have seen the stage. &ndash; An old bench decorated with tins of jam, sandbags and dirty towels, and about 50 candles for footlights.  I've seen less for more in Sydney!  We had some real good talent.  A few very fine voices and the humorists were &ndash; humorists!!.  Here's some of the supper &ndash; Lobster, Asparagus, Tongue, Biscuits, Cake &ndash; Cigars and --- Champagne!!!!   My sore head this morning is probably due to the latter.  Out of respect to the ladies of the Billet, who were invited, and the Officers who came along and helped (at the supper) everybody was very well behaved, and things went off O.K.</p>
<p>We are not doing too bad for Active Service.  This all took place within 2 miles of the firing line.</p>
<p>Love<br/>from<br/>Roy.</p>
