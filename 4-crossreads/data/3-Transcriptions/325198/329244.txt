<p>15 February, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>It has been raining to day. Just a mizzle but unpleasant. This morning Capt Ryrie took the squadron off parade for drill, he formed us into "Line of troop Collum" when we got out on the desert &amp; then gave "Trot" then Gallop. I wonder what Roley Weston would have said, had he been with us. He used to call the Capt "Don't over do it Harold"  We had quite a decent morning &amp; I enjoyed it.  This after noon we did not go out as it was wet but they dug us up out of our tents &amp; took us into the stables &amp; stood us there for an hour, just to keep us from going to sleep in the tents &ndash; I think I got 4 letters to day one was from Mr Gibbons &ndash; I was pleased to hear from him</p>
