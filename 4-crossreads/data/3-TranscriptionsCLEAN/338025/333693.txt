  
 Monday cont. Left camp at 8pm (40 men) and were driven in G.S. Waggons to the Gully near Noreuil where we were having to dig a trench from HQ to the Battererys for cables. As they wanted 400 men and our 40 were the only ones there, we were put on another job. Taking damaged shells from the battery and putting them in a shell hole. While there, there was a stunt on, the gully was lit up by the flares fired in the front line and our artillery was giving Fritzy hell. We finished at midnight and coming home we a good cup of tea and a packet of biscuits at the YMCA (free buffet). We then had a six mile walk before us but we were lucky in getting a lift in a motor wagon to Bapaume. Arr camp 1.40am.
