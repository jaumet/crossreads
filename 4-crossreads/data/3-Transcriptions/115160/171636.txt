<p>I saw at Girvan Uncle James&#39; place where you where you bogged in to the turnips. &nbsp;They were all asking very kindly after you.</p>
<p>I have been down playing at the Sergeants&#39; Mess twice this week and had a good time and hearing. &nbsp;Our daily bread ration has been reduced from 13 to 11 loaves for 30 men, and we haven&#39;t had any jam for a week.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a job writing, for there&#39;s so much talking, and someone has just finished blowing the guts out of a mouth-organ. &nbsp;I hope you are looking after home matters well, and assisting Mother in every possible manner. &nbsp;Tell Cissie Kelly I will answer her note as soon as I can. &nbsp;Her letter was good and quite amusing. &nbsp;Well, Bess, ta ta for the present. &nbsp;Remember me to all the boys and girls.</p>
<p>Fondest love,</p>
<p>James</p>
