Letters again Censored. Mother 17/2/17, Day 19/2/17 JOE 18/2/17, Clare Wheeler HAY. All so welcome. Yes little Mother your housewife came at last & such a useful one. I can see how you thought of everything little things I wanted & Days SOKS too. So many thanks.
I hope some day to go fishing with JOE on the Hopkins. I always love old Carrakoorte & the River. I cant see how JOE could volunteer - he is doing more than his share by carrying the load at home - & keeping us going. I see you are sending me another parcel & Barrini sends the Cakes & chocs - I'm afraid I'm getting terribly spoilt.
I would write Barrini but forget her address.
