  
 Sunday 10 November Move from Epeny to Baseul, on the le Cateau-Landrecies Road, about three kilos East of le Cateau. Move by bus, most interesting, over the old Hindenburg System of defences, where barely a wall stands, till we came to a country of green crops and civilians, who were liberated from the Germans in the recent advance. Le Cateau is a fair sized town indeed but badly smashed about, and there are still civilians there, as also in this village. But where is the war?  Here even, we cannot hear a gun or see a flash & we are twenty miles East of Cambrai.  Personally I think the Boshes have bolted!! News from H.Q. says Kaiser has evacuated & Socialists are in power in Germany. 
 Monday 11 November At 11 a.m. this morning, 72 hours given to German delegates to sign armistice expires.  I wonder what will be the news to-day in view of yesterday's news. The day we have been looking for for years has come and hostilities cease at 11 a.m. to-day on the whole western front. A walk round the country to Ors & Catillon, where there are civilians still living, though very poor indeed. The shelling round some of the villages has been severe, & where the civies got while it was on I don't know. We, the 1st Division, are to represent the Aust. Corps in the march through liberated Belgium, following the Boshe back to his own country. It takes some believing but is nevertheless official.
