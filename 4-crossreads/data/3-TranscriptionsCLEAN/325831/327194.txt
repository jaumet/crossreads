Dear Judge Ferguson
At the suggestion of Colonel Anderson, Commandant, A.I.F. Headquarters, London, I am forwarding you the correspondence that has passed in relation to a request that was made to me, not by you, for the employment of your son on duties away from the firing line. I thought you would be relieved to read through this correspondence, & when you have done so, I should like it returned to me.
Yours sincerely
G. F. Pearce
