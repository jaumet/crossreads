  
 which was much appreciated. Beautiful moonlight night, sea like a sheet of glass, slept out on the deck. 
 21st November. Church parade at 10.30. Very impressive service. Slept nearly all day, weather like hell. Church again at night. Had our own orchestra, a piano & two violins, I presided at the piano. 
 22nd November. Getting near the equator weather like hell, all drilling etc- is cut out, as the weather is to severe. Swimming baths erected up on the aft deck, they are well attended. Taking up signalling while off ward duty, it is very interesting work. 
 23rd November. Weather still very hot, the crew are erecting awnings all over the ship, so we are in for some hot weather. The air is stiflying & down the hold where the Infantry are quartered, well, you can guess what it is like there, we are exceptionally lucky being so well off. Now in the Indian Ocean. Band performance in the evening. 
 24th November. Nothing startling, same routine as yesterday.
