Tuesday 23 October 1917A day of turmoil - 10 a.m. Dr. Parry assembles 25 sisters in smoke room & addresses us on anonymous letter! greatest disgrace for all.  If letter taken to C. Wallace in first place we would probably have all been put under open arrest until Suez reached!  Old proverb, "Put a beggar etc."S. Wylie challanges Dr. & brings charges on other side.Result of depression all go early to bed on deck.  As punishment, we are awakened 5.30 a.m. by clapping, singing, etc.  How can a mind become so small as to punish nurses in this way?Thus our voyage draws to an end!  A little tact & good management at the beginning & it might have been so different.  On reflection my sorrow is for Dr. Parry in such an awkward position & not of his making.
