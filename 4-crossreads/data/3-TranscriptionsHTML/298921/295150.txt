<p>June, 1915<br/>Scyce natives<br/>Paid the Scyces as usual today their womenfolk are more like "Crows" than anything else, heads &amp; shoulders covered with long black shawl.<br/>All the men issued with new boots &amp; I am having them sprigged in anticipation of going to the Dardanelles. Doley Wilshire came into my Tent last night, he looks Brown &amp; fit, I told him to keep an eye open for Harry Mulligan but if no Battalion given it is almost impossible to find anyone.</p>
