We were rather fortunate that the crows nested early this year. we were able to get a good many youngsters with a fair share of old ones too we fought some very exciting and strategic battles with some who could fly with great success. this is the best time to get them as if one goes to work right away he can generally get the old ones. a crow generally has four sometimes five youngsters to look after. the very last one we got we captured alive. he is not half a bad sort. they are the best bird of any to tame will learn to talk sensibly as though they understand what they say. there is an old chap in who has been there ever since the place was a town he can converse on any subject at all. no doubt he is now a great authority on the European picnic. I have not been far into the wilderness for some time but the most of the lease now is in the last stage of ruin a bush called burly bush has taken possession of most of the black soil areas it is very dense and in some places about 4 feet high it is a absolute impossibility to see a wallaby in it. it covers all the open spaces where we got shooting as the wallabys went from one scrub to another. there was practically none of it here when we where here first. I think I can safely say that no local men will bother this paddock much strangers wont stay in it long we had to stop here
