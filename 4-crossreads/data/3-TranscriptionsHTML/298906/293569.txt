<p><strike>W</strike> 31st. Weather looks to have taken up, but I suppose it will be raining before the days out. Have been off parade all day the result of what we call "working our head" Johnny Nicholson &amp; I work together &amp; we can do it easily we had no men at all on parade, so we could not see the sense of us going out &amp; drilling, &amp; besides Capt. McGregor is a good chap &amp; he knows all the overseas N.C.O.s. &amp; therefore overlooks a lot of things, but we do take some risks, &amp; there are some funny incidents at times.<br/>The Coy were paid last night &amp; judging from the number of drunks the canteens must have done a good trade.<br/>1st September Very windy but</p>
