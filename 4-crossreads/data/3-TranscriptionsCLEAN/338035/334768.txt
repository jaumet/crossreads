  
 Zocchi, Fox & McLean.  We entered a team in Keystone Drill competition with 6  mean  men, Messrs. Sam (as 'Mephistoples') Stevens ('Robinson Crusoe') McLean ('Scotsman') Woodman (Convict) Daley (anything) West (mixture) & self (Marmarlade & soldier half and half). We lost to Machine Gun Co. who were A Keystone band.  But McLean brought for us the "Most Comical Dress".  While all this was going on the No. 1 Hold was on fire and a quantity of wheat burnt.  To quell the fire the ship had to be turned completely round for half an hour. By night the fire had been controlled this making  the  about the fourth occasion this boat had caught fire, twice on this voyage though the previous one was hushed up. At night we could see a lighthouse & lights of a town (Port Elizabeth). For 24 hrs. ended noon we did 316 miles and now 26 & 34 sth.
