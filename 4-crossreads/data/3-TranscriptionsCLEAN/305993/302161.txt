  
 We brought across from Batun Russia, Prince & Princess -- & maid.  Their Castle having been burnt & completely destroyed also their furniture by the Russian Boselvesks.  The Prince being a Russian Georgian the Princess a Italian Cinoma artist formally.  They told me that their former estates were large & the income large & that his castle contained 60 servants.  Now his property is conviscated & also his title & all rights to eane in Russia.  But like the rest of the high officials he has money invested in other countries.  He is on his way to Florence, Italy.  Sad & gloomy his pride like many more a thing of the past & treated as a ordinary passenger.  Yet very gentle in their way.  This day we discharged the mails & sent out a odd tin trunk which was sent aboard in Batun.  I discharged the mails & Trunk, the lot went ashore in the Patrol boat in charge of a Sargeant & Corporal & obtained signatures on way bills.  An hour afterwards the O.C. of troops Colonial Forbes approaches me & asked me what I had done with the specie.  I told him I knew nothing of any specie.  It appears this Tin trunk had been sent aboard with the mails at Batun as a ordinary trunk & contained one million Pounds of notes.  So a guard was sent ashore after it & Colonel Forbes cleared me as they at Batun should have notifered us & then it would have been locked up in the ship's strong room & not put amongst the mails.  "All's well so that ends well".  The Cash reached its destination like we won the war.  Blunders.  At 9 p.m. we left Constantinople for Port Said.  No troops & no cargo.
