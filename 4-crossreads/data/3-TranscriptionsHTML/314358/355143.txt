<p>4<br/>boldly thrust a pen and drawn the simple details as a rustic place.<br/>There before me as though of indian ink on the whitest of paper, is a black and white gem.<br/>I shall only describe some of the black of it.<br/>There is no other way.\<br/>A few leafless trees.<br/>A streatch of broken fence<br/>The underwood of a furze tangle<br/>The eaves, one wall, and a smoking chimney of an old farm cottage.<br/>Less than half a haystack<br/>The leafless stems of a hawthorne hedge.<br/>The sombre butts and the under plumes of a pine-wood thicket.<br/>The white and all which is lost in white, I cannot describe.<br/>The picture is as crude as any description, but it has the beauty of being real.</p>
