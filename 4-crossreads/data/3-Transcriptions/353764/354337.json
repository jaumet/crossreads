<p>Wifes saying good-bye to Husbands &amp; Sisters to Brothers, &amp; Sweethearts to Sweethearts.  Although I only had Father to say good-bye to, my thought were sad, with the recollection of you one &amp; all.  There was a touch of splendour to all the sadness, when one glanced along the Boat &amp; saw the thousands of Streamers, which were held by friends on Shore to the Boys on the Boat.<br/>After a delay of 1 hour, word was given to "Cast off", &amp; then we all realised that we were really leaving Australia.</p>
<p>Heavens!  how slow the huge Boat moved out, as if she was mocking the saddened crowd of Relations &amp; friends, frantically waving their farewells, alas in many cases for the last time.  We were towed down to Mid-stream where we anchored, to the absolute deafening accompaniment of Whistles &amp; Sirens.  Never in the War, has there be such a send off.  All day long crowds of friends have been flashing round the Boat in Launches.</p>
<p>Punctually at 3.30 pm  the anchor was weighed &amp; the nose turned towards the Heads.  of the trip through I cannot say anything, save that one had a choking sensation of lonliness.  Onward we steamed till night fell, no sign of Land, &amp; the constant sound of the waves dashing against the sides of the giant ship.<br/>Night, - everything black but we still steam on</p>
