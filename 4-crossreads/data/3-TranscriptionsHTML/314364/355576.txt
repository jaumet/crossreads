<p>Sun.Mar.30th Another glorious day. Received parcel no 2 from B.E. &amp; Nell containing a delicious Home made cake which the crowd at my table greatly enjoyed. The Tinned Fruit &amp; cream we had for supper. Gilbert &amp; I start the day in the surf. It was glorious I had a good Sun Bake. It was my turn to get the morning coffee. Next Sunday I hope to have the extreme pleasure of taking morning Tea in to B.E.<br/>The time is passing by quite pleasantly, but the sooner Wed. comes round the better. After Dinner we were marched down to some buildings near the main Quarantine &amp; went thro' this [indecipherable]. We went for a swim afterwards. I write to B.E. also Mother &amp; Nell.<br/>Monday. Mar.31st  Another month gone only one more Day to go &amp; then my dream will come true &amp; I shall <u>see</u> B.E. &amp; the wonderful Boy. I was very disappointed at not getting any Letter from B.E. today. Thought she would surely write to me on Sunday, but then of course, she may have been <u>too</u> busy. I wrote to B.E. during the Day. The sun was very hot &amp; it made me quite sore. The Y.M.C.A. erected a Picture outfit &amp; we had quite a good open air Picture Show at night. I'm hoping to get a Letter from B.E. tomorrow to know how she got on about the Cottage.<br/>Hislop, one of the chaps at my table lent me his Camera &amp; I took a number of snaps. Hope they turn out alright, as they will be interesting souvenirs.</p>
