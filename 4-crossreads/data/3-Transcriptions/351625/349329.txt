<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>I am afraid you will be wondering what has happened to me of late but as you can guess we have been going like wild fire ever since the big push started.  I received a letter from you today written just before Kings B'day.  It is a good while since we have had a mail but there is one in now so I am expecting a big batch of letters any day.  I was sorry to hear you misunderstood Ken's cable, he got to Blighty on his own,</p>
