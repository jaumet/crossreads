<p>I left Albert in the Somme region on Tuesday afternoon by the leave train for 10 days in England.  It was a very slow train.  We reached Abbeyville at midnight &amp; had to wait till 7 next morning for a train to Boulogne.  We reached there at 12 oclock.  I was glad to get a hot bath, shave &amp; good meal.  We crossed the Channel in the afternoon &amp; landed at Folkestone, then on to London by train.<br/>Reported at the A.I.F. H.Q. &amp; stayed the night at the Y.M.C.A. at Belgrave Square.  Next morning went &amp; saw Col. Green &amp; made a few purchases &amp; left by the 10.30 train for Edinburgh travelling all night.<br/>Had a quiet day next day</p>
