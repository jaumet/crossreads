<p>PotsdamHafen 9.30 pm : The return of Awu was not the only thing of note that occurred today. I was concerned also in (a) a ride on horse-back (b) an earthquake (c) the entr&eacute;e of Lucia.<br/>To the ordinary individual a ride on horse-back is nothing, but to me who was astride a nag only once previously, and that about 25 years ago, the event is of vast importance. I went with one of the brothers to visit the Mission Station of Bogia, situated about five feet from the clouds or at any rate many hundreds of feet above the sea. I put my foot into the port stirrup and landed square on the upper deck of my charger.<br/>We were off!! (at a walk).<br/>For about &frac12; a mile the road was level after which it rose abruptly. By that time I felt quite at home; five minutes later I wished I was at home. The track led along the side of deep declivities and miniature precipices and if that horse had not been as sure-footed as the proverbial mountain goat I would now be a mangled corpse. But up we went, the most ticklish bit being reserved for the last where we went along a ridge about 3 feet wide with grass covered slopes descending steeply on either side. The mountain goat was not in it with the mounted goat who wished he'd never seen the blanky horse. At last, however, we reached our destination and with a sigh of relief I got (no, fell) off.<br/>The view from Bogia was magnificent and the "Gabriel" looked like some toy steam-boat apparently almost at our feet.
