 in a dugout then rush out snap . We elud shell until just about 150 yard , away when a terrif angri rocket like shriek warn us to duck . This we did by throw ourselv flat in a shell hole , half fill with mud . A fortun precaut for immedi a terrif roar made us squeez ourselv into as littl bulk as possibl , up went timber , stone , shell , everyth els in the vicin . A dump of 4.5 Shell had receiv a direct hit , the splinter rain on our helmet , the debri mud came down in a cloud . The fright concuss absolut wind us but we escap injuri made off through mud water as fast as we possibl could . Egad , I ve never heard such a row in my life . ( 26th ) What a relief to be home again , I am grime with dust mud to get into this littl hut is like a touch of heaven .
