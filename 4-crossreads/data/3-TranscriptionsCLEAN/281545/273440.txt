Strange to say we were stranded at this place last year being over carried from Audurique, when we first arrived in France.   After a few minutes run we arrived back at St Omer at 2 Pm & had to carry our kits over to the Loco Sheds & then into the Electric Light Station, were we had to sleep for the first night.  My Mate & myself slept in the Boiler shed alongside the Boiler with several others, the remainder slept in the machinery Shed,  as we were all very tired, we soon turned in early  although some had to start work straight away.   My Mate & myself went for a stroll up the Town as it was his first visit here & my second I piloted him around, took him into the famous Notre Darme, Cathedral, which he enjoyed very much, after wandering around & having a good hot Tea we came back to the Depot & turned in & had a good sleep.  We were aroused at 5.30 am & had to sign on at 6 am, & after preparing an engine for work we stood by all the morning until 2 Pm when we were ordered to proceed to a place called Arques on the Bologne Line to back a Train up to Wardreques, although I did not know the road I had to go steady, leaving the Depot at 3 Pm I arrived at Arques in 15 minutes, were a Train
