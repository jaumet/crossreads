It is written by WMB Cory military number 307]Lieut Weston 24.9.17By bearer 1 Gun & spare parts case to replace damaged ones. Am not sending any belts & boxes to replace the 2 of yours blown up - both runners to remain with you tonight, one coming in in morning with report. If your spare parts case was undamaged please return the one I'm sending. If using phone to us use BAB - Battn must have a copy.
