  
 The Song Tune: Marching Through Georgia Strap your belts and buckles on, and slope your blooming guns; Show our own loved Commonwealth that we are just the ones; Shove your manly bosoms out and prove we are the sons Who mean to be a credit to Australia. 
 CHORUS:- Hurrah! Hurrah! We don't know where we are Hurrah! Hurrah! We're on the "Berrima"; We volunteered for service from our own Australia When we set out to capture Papua. 
 First we learnt the goose step, then to hold the gun; Then they taught us how to shoot at targets one by one, Then with our Hekometer we double out and run, To calculate the ranges for Australia. 
 CHORUS:- Hurrah! Hurrah! etc. 
 Our Expedition's No 1 we're always fresh & fit; We're all the very best of pals, work hard, & play a bit; We mean to leave the "Berrima" as models every whit, When we set out to capture Papua 
 CHORUS:- Hurrah! Hurrah! etc
