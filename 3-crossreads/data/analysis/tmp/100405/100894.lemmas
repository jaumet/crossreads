 St . Georg For England By Jo Chamberlin in the " American Legion Journal . " Reveill 1.3.40 " Volunt are want for an undertak of real danger . " These mysteri word went quiet ?round the British Navi in Novemb , 1917 . And the volunt , it was ad , should not expect to return . The time had come for desper endeavour . A German victori was terribl close in those dark day . Russia had collaps on land , the Alli were retreat befor German legion releas from the Eastern front . At sea , the U-boat were sink 400,000 ton of ship a month , four time as much as they would send to the bottom in the first month of the repeat war in 1939 . If they kept this up , the Alli would collaps befor the Yank could unleash their full power . Man by these volunt , there assembl in the mouth of the Thame a broken-down battleship , sever obsolet cruiser , two ferryboat from Liverpool name the Iris and Daffodil , and other craft ? seventy-four vessel in all , includ motor boat . Admiral Roger Key , command of this strang armada , reveal at last to his men that they would attempt what no navi had ever accomplish : the block of a harbour . In fact , two harbour ? Ostend and Zeebrugg . Captur by the German in 1914 , and heavili fortifi by them , these two Belgian port were a threat to the lifelin of ship from England to Franc . Here , onli eighti mile from Dover , was the lair of at least ten destroy , thirty-f torpedo boat and thirti submarin . From Zeebrugg ran a ship canal to Bruge , six mile island . A similar canal connect Ostend to Bruge . At Bruge was a great shipyard , convert by the German into a naval base 300 mile nearer England than ani German port . Onli torpedo boat could use the canal from Ostend . But down the deeper canal from Zeebrugg destroy and submarin came and went at will . Admiral Key propos to cork these lethal canal by sink British ship across their entranc . If he succeed , thirti submarin would be bottl up for the rest of the war . Zeebrugg , the German sub-bas , was natur the No. 1 object . Shield the canal mouth from the storm of the North Sea , a mole , or breakwat , curv in a semi-circl one and one-half mile out from shore . Most of the mole was a huge railway dock for the suppli of German warcraft . Connect the dock with the shore was a viaduct of open steelwork which support the railway . To protect the mole were machine-gun , barb wire , eight heavi gun mount on the mole itself , and along the coast 225 gun with rang up to eighteen mile . They were there to blast to bit ani Englishman silli enough to tri land troop at this strateg spot for a flank attack on the German armi in Franc . Key plan to land troop on the mole mere to divert and mislead the enemi . Meanwhil , three old cruiser would slip around the mole , sneak into the harbour , and sink themselv across the mouth of the ship canal . It sound simpl , yet it was complic , becaus wireless or other method of signal was taboo and everyth had to be done on time schedul . The most import actor in this drama was incalcul ? the weather . There should be no moon . The wind ought to be blow toward the shore , to permit the attack to lay down a smoke screen . High tide was need , to get the block ship into the channel . The sea had to be smooth , so that troop could be land on the mole . The obsolet light cruiser Iphigenia , Sirius , Brilliant , Intrepid and Theti were overhaul . Explosiv charg were laid along their keel . The Unite State Navi was consult on use cement to balk effort to rais the ship after they had been sunk . The Vindict was fit with a fals deck and special gangway to land men on the mole , which rose 32 feet abov the water . The two lowli ferryboat for storm troop , Daffodil and Iris , were armor with steel . The public protest when they were remov from servic at Liverpool had been quiet by announc they were to be use in America to embark troop ! Two old submarin had their bow pack with ton of explos . Were their crew to be human bomb ? Aeroplan photo were taken of the harbour . Marin and bluejacket practis storm object , with a full-scal model mark on the ground . Final , in March , 1918 , all was readi ? except the weather . Night after night the moon was too bright , or the wind too fickl , or the tide too low . The men were on edg . Each moment increas the chanc that the enemi was warn , and warn meant annihil . From Franc came noth but bad news . No one knew where the German would stop . It was the hour of despair . Twice this queer fleet start out , onli to return to it lone anchorag . On April 11th , when but a dozen mile from the goal , a favor wind veer , threaten to blow their own smoke screen back into their face . On the 13th , rough sea forc anoth cancel . On the 22nd the tide was high , the sea was smooth , the wind was right . But the moon was full . Admiral Key decid to start onc more . The men were at a high pitch . They would reach Zeebrugg at midnight , when it would be St . Georg 's Day , and he was England 's patron saint . It was a good omen . Admiral Key signal his fleet , " St . Georg for England ! " Captain Carpent , on the Vindict , signal back , " May we give the dragon 's tail a damn good twist ! " Under the full moon one could see for mile . Then down fell a drizzl , blanket mist . Perhap St . Georg was on their side ! At a given point the Brilliant , Sirius and other craft left to blockad the Ostend canal mouth , while the main group continu on to Zeebrugg . Short befor midnight the monitor Erebus and Terror began the bombard of Zeebrugg with their long-rang gun . The German were not surpris ; this had often happen . Two or three searchlight casual explor the night , then went out . A star shell rose and fell to seaward , unwit locat the mole for the approach ship . Like angri hornet the motor boat sped ahead to lay down the smoke screen . As the German sight them , Zeebrugg explod into life . [Articl continu on Page 67]
