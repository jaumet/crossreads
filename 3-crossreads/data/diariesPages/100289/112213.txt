with success
Sunday 14.1.17
Snowing. Bearers left again to go out to the line to take over from 2nd Division.
Monday 15.1.17 to Friday 19.1.17
Has been snowing for 3 of the 4 days, country certainly looks beautiful, but looks are far the better part of it. Many exciting snow fights among both officers men. All very quiet, no news of importance from the line or elsewhere. Still in hospital but improving. Another batch of the boys went on leave to Blighty. Rumors of leaving here.
20.1.17 to 22.1.17
Snow still lying on the ground. Received a large mail from Australia, after having not had any for over three weeks
