after the Colonel had inspected us we had some Battalion drill, I can tell you it was pretty hard with full packs up, just before marching off he spoke a few words about the portion of line we are going to take over told us we would have plenty of work to do, for the present state of affairs was very unsatisfactory from a military point of view, hanged if I know why it is but we generally get a very weak unimproved section of trench to go into, we have to set to put it into a proper state of defence, but I suppose it can't be helped some one has got to do it. Issued iron rations ammunition to all the men just before dinner. In the afternoon the final for the championship of the 1st Division came off between the Engineers us, it was a very windy afternoon this to a certain extent spoilt the play nevertheless it was a good game we won easily again by 14 to nil
