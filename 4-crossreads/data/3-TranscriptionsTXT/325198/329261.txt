 4 March, 1916 Serapeum There was 35 men on Fatigue from the Squadron  this morn  to day so that made us short handed we had to do two trips to water the horses.  This evening we went down to the shops &amp; imsheed in some [indecipherable] &amp; mats for the tent so we were a bit more comfortable  To day has been another windy day &amp; Im afraid that Ive eaten as much sand as food.
