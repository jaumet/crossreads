My dearest Father,Just the day after I posted my last letter to you on the 15th inst I received yours of 23rd of April for which I thank you very much.Things have been much the same here since last mail.  I went up on Saturday to where Rid is & together we went to that part of the trenches where Wal is.  I was very thankful to find him unscratched even and I sincerely hope & pray that he will pull through none the worse for it.It is a miserably wet tonight & in fact has been raining on & off for the whole week.  Naturally everything is very muddy & sloppy
