 Revielle at 6.30 As I'm writing this the men in the YMCA are singing hymns which sound lovely in a sin sodden hole like this & make you wish that you were home. Nell dear I'd give everything to be with you now if only for an hour. All motor cyclists met in Cairo at 3 pm opposite Sheppards Cafe 29 in all & had our dials taken & then went from there to Mena had a drink at the Pyramids & then climbed em had a look at the Sphinx, got our dials taken again & then set sail for home, it took us 22 minutes to do the 17 mile.
