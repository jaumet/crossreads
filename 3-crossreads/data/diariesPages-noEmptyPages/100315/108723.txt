27/3/18 ? La Basse Ville
Went up the line after dark saw all the O.C. Coys. There was an inter Company relief on which was carried out quietly and without incident. At 10.30 we put gas over on him, up went his red lights and we had a rough passage to "C" Coy. Little Scotty O?Neill one of my old original boys was found dead in a dugout this morning killed by shell last night. Poor Parsons died very bravely this morning. Realising both his legs were off he asked for a revolver to shoot himself but presently he had less pain. Carricks held him in his arms and he said "It is hard, Larry, but I'm not afraid to die". He passed out a couple of hours later his last words being apologies to the stretcher bearers for giving them so much work.
