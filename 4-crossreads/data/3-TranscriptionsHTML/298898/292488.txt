<p>Thursday 5th April<br/>Received orders today to pack up to move next morning. Weather very fine in great contrast to the snow etc. we have had the last few days. <strike>I</strike> Had a few shells land near us today the closest however turning out to be a dud. Will have to ride again tomorrow as I ran a nail in to my foot again, this time in the heel. Heard that some of our heavy guns were knocked out by getting up too far. Great activity on the road motors passing all night long besides guns of all descriptions.</p>
