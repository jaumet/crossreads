 [Thursday 3 February 1916] 
 Had a Field Day &amp; like last summer a good deal of pretence at fighting. One bridge over a Canal was supposed to be blown up &amp; the Tommie Sentry blocked a L.H. Trooper Scout from going across it. So he tied his clothes on the Saddle took off his boots &amp; with the reins in his teeth swinging his arms as [indecipherable] swimming &amp; yelling out,  walked  over, saying &ndash;"the bridge is blown up" &amp; I'm swimming alright." All this is to keep men &amp; Horses fit while we wait for the attacks that never come.  Men soon get stale &amp; we I want a football badly- but by the time it could arrive, we will be fighting again in Ernest.
