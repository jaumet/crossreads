After passing "Cassel" the road led down the hill on to the level ground & here we passed some beautiful mansions set back from the road in a patch of green trees, & round all of them there were beautiful lawns & fountains playing, & most of them had a fine stream of clear water running past the lawn & over & along these little streams of water hung lovely spreading trees some thing like what we read about on the South American rivers, I think & with the exception of the South of France this was the finest part of France that I have so far seen.The Germans had been for a short while round this part for I saw the marks of their shrapnel in several places, notably on the gasometer.
