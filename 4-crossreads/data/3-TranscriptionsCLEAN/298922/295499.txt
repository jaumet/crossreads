MAZAAR
I noticed GUNNEDAH was on the case of Rabbits anyway they were very good. Just seen a photo of myself in Sydney Mail when I had a septic neck dated May 16 1917 entitled enjoying a Shave rather sarcastic.
I note mice are eating Motor Cars etc. I suppose if the war keeps up they will be frozen & sent to feed Tommy.
Our men & Horses are often hungry - Commissariate is wonderfully good - far better than Africa & all delivered by a single line of rails across 200 mile desert. All units get Cigarettes or Tobacco sufficient for the week plus 2 boxes of matches every Saturday free.
