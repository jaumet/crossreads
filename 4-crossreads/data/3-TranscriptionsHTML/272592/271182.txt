<p>old Fritz took it lying down we all expected to get the tripe knocked out of us but to the surprise of all he only fired a few feeble old whizz bangs over &amp; a dozen or so "pip squeaks" its very puzzling to all of us how quiet he is keeping &amp; all sorts of opinions are hazarded regarding him &amp; movements, but my opinion is that he has had such a towelling up lately that he is satisfied to remain quiet rather than run the risk of an artillery duel with us.</p>
<p>This morning I witnessed a very pretty piece of work by one of our airmen, there were 3 of Fritz's balloons up &amp; we were commenting on how plucky he was getting when we saw one of our planes</p>
