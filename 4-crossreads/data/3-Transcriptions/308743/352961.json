<p>Reveille at 5.30<br/>Made up my mind to go to church this morning so Bobby and I went, the service was good &amp; the news from the Dardanelles was thrilling but our chaps seem to have been rather venturesome.  in the afternoon I got all my correspondence up to date.  We hear that mail is due tomorrow so am looking forward to it anxiously for news from home &amp; Nell.  Toby got rid of his machine today &amp; is now the richer by a checqe of &pound; 50.  British regulars are arriving here (wounded) from the front, the French have captured Chanak on the opposite side of the Narrows.  H.Qs played the Bde train cricket today but were badly beaten H.Q scored 88 &amp; the Train 112 Bed 9.5</p>
