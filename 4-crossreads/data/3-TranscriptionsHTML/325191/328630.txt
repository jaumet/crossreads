State account of daily.  As the comment upon what I wishe to inform the Public on facts of humanity, wich hawe been practised for years inside this Camp, not one Internee had foreseen, to wich depths this Officials in charge of this Camp would stoop, to cause of "wholesale murder" amongst the undefendet, much hated German Internees.

This gawe rise to a general hope that our liberation out of this Dante Inferno wher close at hand &amp; everyone lived cheerfull &amp; in hopes to hawe</p>
