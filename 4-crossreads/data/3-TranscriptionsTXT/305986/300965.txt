Everyone speaks of the AnzacsOf their wonderful brave displayBut does anyone hear of the Surrey Boys?Who were up in Sulva Bay?Their work was good and dangerousTheir Trials and conditions hardBut they have not been feted in LondonOr cheered on the French boulevardeNo they are working damned hard out in EgyptFrom civilisation awayIn the farthest unsanitary quartersWhere the Arab himself will not stayBut Tommy's the boy to be cheerfulAnd work like a slave night & dayAnd put up with sauce for a tannerNot six bob that's Anzac's Pay
