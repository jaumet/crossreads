<p>who cared, as long as they did not penetrate the interior</p>
<p>We were kept there as a reserve. There were about 100 of us. The rest of the battalion went into the support and front lines, some 3 miles off We did a few fatigues up to the line at night, it was a pretty quiet front and there is not much to say about it.</p>
<p>On the 24th Jan 1918, this reserve left Hill 60 and we joined our mates in the line A &amp; C Coys relieved B &amp; D from the front line, the indescribable mud was the worst trouble.</p>
<p>We spent 5 days in the front line or line of trench holes one might say The front line on this sector was just a series of outposts. We manned these posts with machine guns, some with riflemen We had a quiet time, an occasional shell would lob near us at times</p>
<p>On the 29th Jan 1918, we were relieved from the line, the 49th taking our places! We retired back to Spoil Bank, another series of huge dugouts, lit with electric light!</p>
