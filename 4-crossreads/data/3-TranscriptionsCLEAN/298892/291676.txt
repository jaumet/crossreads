  
 The only things I have any use for are a few more pair of socks. I feel the cold most on the hands and I have three or four pairs of very warm mits.  I am sorry I can't find more interesting news than our own discomforts from the weather conditions but every thing else is taboo. I will be able to make up for it with interest if I am spared to return. Military life in France under any conditions is hard to endure, but after 16 months experience I am satisfied that (just by chance) I have secured the pick job in the army. There are a few better, easier, & safer but not very many.
