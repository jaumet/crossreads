<p>the anniversary of my sailing 4 years ago.  Resting my foot in a slipper.  In the evening went back to the caf&eacute; &amp; had a splendid night.  Nine of us in the party &amp; dancing and singing until about midnight making a fond farewell as we left.  They have been extremely nice to us &amp; it has gone a bit towards making our stay here enjoyable.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12th Feb Weather not quite so cold but the same beautiful sunshine.  The men of my draft had a bathing parade &amp; another issue of underclothing was made.  Rumours of us going today, some members having already been warned.  At night went to the camp cinema &amp; listened to an address later by Padre Gault, one of the mens favourites.</p>
<p>Thursday 13th Feb  Applied for a pass in the morning in order to visit Havre which I did in the afternoon.  The city has little for a visitor to see but I strolled round</p>
