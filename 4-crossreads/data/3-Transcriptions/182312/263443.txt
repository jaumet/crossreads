<p>and yet in every case from Admirals to ships&#39; boys there was this</p>
<p>wonderful quality of extreme gentleness bred no doubt of a life</p>
<p>long service in that wonderful institution - the Royal Navy.&nbsp; I</p>
<p>had been shown the mechanism of these big ships, but the humanity</p>
<p>of the cabins impressed me more than anything else.&nbsp; Any nation</p>
<p>can build ships but it is the men in them that tell when the crisis</p>
<p>arises, and in the men who man our Navy we may safely leave our</p>
<p>trust;&nbsp; they have been caught young and have spent practically the</p>
<p>whole of their lives in studying their jobs and in imbibing the</p>
<p>miles of proud traditions out of which the Navy has xxxxxx risen.</p>
<p>You will see an Officer with the rank of Commander who cannot be</p>
<p>more that thirty three or four and you will think what a young man</p>
<p>he is to hold such a high rank:&nbsp; and it is only when you hear him</p>
<p>mention something about,&quot;when I was in the old &quot;Ganges&quot; on the</p>
<p>China Nation in &#39;97 - &quot;, that you realize that this man has been in</p>
<p>the Navy 20 years!&nbsp; He would enter Osborne at 12 and thence</p>
<p>graduate through the various Colleges attaining his first ship after</p>
<p>three or four years and even then his sc<sub>^</sub><sup>h</sup>olastic education would not</p>
<p>cease, for each ship carries a schoolmaster, and a midshipman receives</p>
<p>a grounding in every day subjects quite equal to that of a Public</p>
<p>School boy and in addition is all the while being fitted for the</p>
<p>position in the Navy which he is one day to occupy.&nbsp; I developed a</p>
<p>great liking and admiration for these midshipmen after seeing them</p>
<p>at their work and also as their guest in the Gun Room (the Sub-</p>
<p>Lieutenants and Midshipmen&#39;s Mess) and can easily understand their</p>
<p>good work at Jutland and in running their picket boats during the</p>
<p>early days of the Gallipoli land campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very keen interest is maintained by the Navy in</p>
<p>the doings of the armies and I did not see a Ward Room or Gun Room</p>
