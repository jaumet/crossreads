& the vehicle shifted when whiz came a shell & then we got the devil shaken out of us.
Imagine our plight! 150 odd lorries to unload up to our knees in mud, & shells exploding all round. Nor was this all, at about 1am in the morning the fog & mist lifted & over came some German planes. They dropped some bombs on us but did no damage until they were driven off by gunfire & a few of our planes, By this time we were just about dropping but sticking to our guns & with a final burst we succeeded in completing our task by 3 am. We then turned in until 8am & after a snack, re commenced our days duties. We finished up by 12 noon & the supply train having come in proceeded to unload it which we finished by 2 pm & then utterly worn out we dropped onto our beds & slept until 6pm. At the present time 7pm one of the fiercest bombardments I have ever heard is in progress & the atmosphere is just reeking with gun powder which makes one sick.
Rumours have reached us of the fall of Peronne to the French. Monasti to the Servians & Lemberg to the Russians. I hope these are true.

I receive my first wound.
This day has been a demon & writing of it after in hospital I shudder to think of
