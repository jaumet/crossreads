<p>15.11.16<br/>receive a fair amount of work with piquets, patrols, fatigues etc they are kept going fairly constant but it is one of the easiest times I have had; by digging 3 or 4 feet we can get water anywhere here &amp; it was rumored that we are camped on unhealthy ground &amp; should be moving out of the Hod tomorrow but believe a later order says to remain where we are; Edwards was out fixing the 'phone line from Geisi the night before last &amp; arrested for a German spy by a Tommy patrol, but they did not hold him long as he soon convinced them that he was genuine. Some good boxing took place tonight after tea</p>
