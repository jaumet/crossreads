<p>writing. I am so sorry for all the trouble about the pay it seems queer there is no way of fixing things up.</p>
<p>Your father is off skating &amp; I am chancing this hoping an express leaves on Sunday.</p>
<p>All send their love &amp; Billie has had a lovely red soldiers cap &amp; a khaki waistcoat given him which he thought he was going to wear down to meet you tomorrow. I hope it will last till you come for he looks so nice in it. He is so well &amp; so naughty these days.</p>
<p>It is too late to register this but I am chancing a note in it &amp; will wire you another on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With love hoping tucker has improved</p>
<p>Your loving<br/>Mother.</p>
