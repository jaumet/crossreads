 98 wks of soldiering 
 The boys were only too glad to get into Oghratina this morning at 2 we did nothing all day but sleep I visited the battlefield of the Tommies &amp; it presented an impressive sight &amp; many of the bodies were protruding above the sand where the jackals are playing havoc with them, equipment &amp; stores are strewn everywhere &amp; horses are everywhere. Communications were as usual &amp; the existing telegraph lines &amp; station visual were established on the surrounding hills keeping in touch with Katil Gamit. Water is pretty scarce for both men &amp; horse. One of our planes which went out on reconnaissance this morning is reported missing &amp; is supposed to have come to earth in the district of El Salmana through engine trouble. No sleep tonight for we move out at 10 tonight.

 We made Bir-el-Abd at 2 this morning &amp; the troops concerned in the stunt pushed straight on to Bir-el-Gereil &amp; other places, we were in touch as soon as the lamp came on the scene, the patrols were in touch as well, not long afterwards fire were to be seen burning where our fellows were manoeuvring &amp; an enemy patrol or two could be seen getting away over the hills. The whole job was finished at 10 &amp; we retired on to Hod-el-Debas arriving there at 1.30 &amp; orders to the effect of an advance awaited us, it seems that they located the lost plane this morning &amp; it is now held by the enemy &amp; we are to regain it at once we again moved out at 3 this time with no water as none had come up, made Bir-el-Abd again at 5.
