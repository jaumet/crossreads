 Calm & smooth, only 2 steamers in convoy we are never lonely with small escort - my 3 weeks leave in England has run into a long space. RATS are plentiful & the Goanese get  a bonus  for all they kill each day. Goanese are really Portugese settled on an island near India.  As soldiers they are not worth much altho' our allies.
