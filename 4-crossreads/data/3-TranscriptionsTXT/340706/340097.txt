 On arrival at Horseferry I find that I can get leave for Venice Rome &amp; Naples just as easily &amp; do so 
 At sometime I try to collect the money that was due to me in Rouen on March 13 but was not paid as value of franc had decreased but found that even now it was impossible to draw it. 
 Then aimed with letter from Horseferry visited War Office. A most formidable place. You enter write yourself a pass state nature of business &amp; Room this is initialled by by a flunkey &amp; you are handed over to a little girl who takes pass &amp; conducts you to your room 
 Room 114 is out at 12.45 &amp; will not resume his arduous labours till 2.30 pm so I am given my pass &amp; walk out the way most people are going &amp; being in uniform though wearing Australian hat am taken for staff &amp; am allowed to leave while the all important pass rests in my pocket. 
 On arrival back at 2.30 I march in &amp; surprise the police by informing them that I still have a pass &amp; am told where room is but go straight &amp; do not appear lost or ask questions &amp; I can go then without the guide. The whole place swarms with youngsters &amp; flunkeys
