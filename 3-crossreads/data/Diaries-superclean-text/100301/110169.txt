was at the wireless station in the trenches, his idea was to draw the fire by holding up his hat on his Hand I don't think he thought at the time that we had some good shots amongst us, anyway he got two bullets through the wrist Dr Pockly had just taken off his Hand put his own red cross band off his own arm on to the germans so that he would not be fired at again the Doctor was going on to someone else who required his assistance when he was shot through the stomach, he only lived two hours after being carried on board the Berrima, The german I have mentioned got better was sent on to Sydney along with the other prisoners who used to fight amongst themselves about signing the papers become neutral
