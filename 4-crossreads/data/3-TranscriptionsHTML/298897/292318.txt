After passing this place we halted for dinner on the road  dining on bully etc.  At the same time I changed my boots this being possible owing to my having an extra pair strapped to my pack.  As we approached "Estairs" we saw a good bit of shelling directed against our aeroplanes.  Hundreds of shots were fired, several at one time but it appears to be a hard matter to bring one down.  Here I also saw a motor cyclist pass with a basket of pigeons strapped to his back being ocular proof of their use in the army.  Stationary balloons were quite common much to my surprise no less the 4 being in sight at one time.  At Estairs we were billeted in an old convent being allowed into the town between 6. &amp; 9. P.M. I straight way went to see a friend in the casualty clearing &amp; had the customary yarn.  Over 100 dropped out on the march but very few were picked up, the majority having to struggle in on their own.  The distance was about 13 miles.</p>
