 We got into a little dip in the ground next Bgde. H.Qs. &amp; remained there all the morning. The attack proceeded &amp; at about 2 p.m. our fellows got into the turks first trenches &amp; - horrible dictn.! &ndash; were shelled out by our own artillery who were going hammer &amp; tongs all the while. At about 4 p.m. things got very willing &amp; we were having a lot of casualties.  I went out with another, Robertson &ndash; not the same as at Romani &ndash; to go up to the support trench.  We had not gone half a mile across the flat when Robertson stopped one in the groin &amp; fell off his horse.  We bundled him into the sand cart, it being too exposed there to dress him &amp; went on. I was riding the other side of him thus making the second time that a Robertson has stopped a bullet that would otherwise have stopped in me.
