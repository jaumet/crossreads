<p>France<br/>8.I.17</p>
<p>Dear Fergie,</p>
<p>Your letters of 30.X.17 &amp; 9.XI.17 arrived within a few days of one another. They may have come by the same ship as it sometimes takes nearly a week to get the whole of one mail delivered here. The postal arrangements are as one might expect, somewhat jerky. One week there is a rain of letters of various dates &amp; then there is a long rest. Letters take from six to nine days to go from one part of France to another, &amp; one took five days</p>
