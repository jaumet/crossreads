bardments.Received a lot of old letters from home the other day, delayed on account of wrong address.Sept 9. 16We have had a couple of quiet days. Yesterday morning I went into Armentiers & purchased some post cards & a few other necessary articles. Was told a curious thing about rats. The place swarms with them & run over you at night, will they have them in the frontline also, & when there is a heavy bombardment the noise stupefies these rats, that much so that much so that they come out & lie about, & will not move even when kicked.Sept. 12th 16Tonight I received a letter from Lou & two yesterday from home.Sept. 16th 16 TrenchesThis morning received a Bulletin from Louie.Have now been in the trenches for a month, without a rest outside. Last night a raid was made, found that the bosches had evacuated their front trenches for their supports, the raiders I am told did not see a bosche.There are plenty of bombardments going on lately nearly all of our own.
