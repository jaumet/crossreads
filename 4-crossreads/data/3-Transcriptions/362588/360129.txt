<p>My dear Father,</p>
<p>I'm afraid I have again left my letter writing <strike>too</strike> rather late.  All mails have to be handed in tomorrow in order to give the censors a chance to go through them.  We still have quite a considerable time on board, but from what I've seen, quite a large quantity of midnight oil will have to be burned in order to get through them up to time.  It's not from want of time that I left it so late, I've found plenty of time to do a good deal of military reading, prepare quite a number of lectures, read one novel &amp; in between times read, learn &amp; inwardly digest the Golden Treasury [by Francis Turner Palgrave].  With a few alterations in the selections it would be an ideal book.</p>
<p>To get onto what limited news there is to give, I must first admit that the work is getting fairly monotonous, chiefly on account of the limited space.  If we had plenty of space there would be heaps to do, but with only about fifty square yards deck space <strike>for</strike> to accommodate about as many men, you can imagine that the variation available is fairly limited.  We get up every morning at six o'clock, or rather the bugle goes at six &amp; we get up in time to be on</p>
