<p>people think everything is alright.  They are completely blinded by their daily papers and by their belief that one tommy is worth 2,300 more foreigners.<br/>We have seen a fair number of tanks lately passing &amp; repassing through the village.  The ordinary tanks are big, heavy, clumsy things.  The ordinary male tank can not do more than 6 miles an hour, has a crew of 8 including an officer, carries two six pounder guns and cannot turn round corners without first stopping its engine &amp; restarting after the turn.  The tank weighs 35 tons &amp; is heavily armour-plated, which plating however is not proof against a direct hit nor will it always keep out fragments of a bursting shell.  The female tank carries 6 machine guns instead of the 2 heavier guns of the male.  Yesterday</p>
