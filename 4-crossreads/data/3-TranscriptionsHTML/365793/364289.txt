<p>July 6 going to ask about being boarded. -- Later, unable to get leave until my Board Papers arrive, &amp; goodness knows when that will be. Looks as if I'll be left in England for duration</p>
<p>7  Thought it was too good to last. At first we only had to fall in at 6.30 &amp; then finish, but now the damned Orderly Room &amp; the Quack have put in extra parades, fatigues &amp; put several of us on Pioneer fatigue &ndash; which is a job for a class men. Drew 1 quidlet &amp; am going to the Jubilee if the rain hangs off (Later)<br/>[in margin] M, Mill, R.</p>
