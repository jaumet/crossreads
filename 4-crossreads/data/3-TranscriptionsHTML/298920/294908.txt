<p>Just now we are enjoying a Full[?] moon which reflecting its brilliance on the water ahead makes an impressionable scene.  Not a ship has been sighted all day, and the nearest land is a couple of hundred miles away.<br/><u>Saturday 21st August 1915.</u>  Our proximity to the tropics is abundantly illustrated by the noticeable rise in temperature.  Awnings up, and work in short sleeves are the orders of the day.  The sun shining slantwise on the water gives it the appearance of molten liquid.  About 11 oclock we passed a passenger steamer travelling Northward, a couple of miles off.</p>
