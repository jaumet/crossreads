  
 Sep 16th  There have been a lot of rumors as usual about the disposal of the battl'n.  Some say demobilisation & back to our units  Some think we are off to Wareham, etc.  I, with Asquith, say "Wait & See". We had a grand sports to day on No 7 Camp grounds & we the band had to play all day. There were some fine fancy dresses, the best being a monkey and several swagmen just such as one
