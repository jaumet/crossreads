31/12/16 "B" Camp Thistle Tr
At night 30/12 orders came to reconnoitre a new piece of line and myself and all Coy Comdrs had to be a BHQ at 9 am. just when we were promising ourselves a spell of a few days and a little rest. Saw the Brigadier and then set off guided by two Tommy guides who seemed to plug along interminably in front. We went along a broad road past many heavy guns just like Delville Wood. and then took to duckboards across the usual dirty country. After many trials we reached Ozone Alley where a good strafing was in progress and had some narrow shaves but they did not seem able to hit us at all. Our guns put up a good bombardment on them and we watched the shells bursting thick with a good deal of interest. Entering this sap we found good duckboards part of the way and then troubles started and we sank past the thighs at each step and soon had feet and socks oozing mud and water at each step. Reached a filthy tumble down collection of dugouts near a sunken road and dived down many steps to a deep dugout ? Batt HQ. The coy. commanders went on to the line
