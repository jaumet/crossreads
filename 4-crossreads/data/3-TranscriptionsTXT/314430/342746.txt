1917In England. Part II
August 27th:- At Rollestone Camp Salisbury Plain. Left Liverpool by rail for this place at noon yesterday, and en route received many demonstrations of welcome, especially from women and girls. Hardly an elligible eligible civilian man could be seen in any of the cities through which we passed - Wolverhampton, Warwick, Stafford, Birmingham, Oxford, and Basingstoke at Birmingham troops rushed the refreshments rooms seeking a glass or two of liquor they* not having tasted any for nine weeks. They waved above their heads Commonwealth pound and ten shilling note in their anxiety to pay for a drink. Only three men women were serving; they became very excited muddled the change, and refused to accept the Australian silver tended in payment. We detrained at the little town of Amesbury at 7 P.M. last night. (Sunday night). It was raining heavily when we started to march through the town. After a tramp of seven miles in full equipment and with pack up, we arrived at the 5th Training Battalion encampment, situated about two miles from Stonehenge. No arrangements had been made to receive us; we were not expected. We were huddled into some huts, got a couple of blankets per man, a drop of cold tea, and a bit of stew. We then went to sleep under wet clothes at midnight.
* most of them; there were a few who had, they being friends of the crew and "in the know".
