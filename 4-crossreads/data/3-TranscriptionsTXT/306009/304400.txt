 1915 Aug. 4 Wed. Regularly every evening now after tea about 6 p.m. Ray Smith &amp; I go for a stroll through Gezira Gardens. We have made several friends only 1 or 2 of whom can speak English, thus providing good practice in French for us. The Gardens close at 7 p.m. &amp; then we walk further on, cross by the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge &amp;  strong  stroll along the river front. The Nile is then looking its best &ndash; calm, wide &amp; deep; with its fringe of palms along the opposite bank &amp; lights from house boat &amp; shore dwelling twinkling across the water in the dusk of an African Evening.
