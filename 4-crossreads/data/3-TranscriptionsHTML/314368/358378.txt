<p>me for some time. The weather is glorious here now, we have been having real summer weather for weeks, and it is daylight from 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. at night. I expected to have some more photos to send you all but they did not turn out at all well, so the photographer would not develop them. I got a long letter from Ted Carrigan a week or so ago. I must answer him as soon as possible. Once I get about a bit I will have a bit more news to write about.  I haven't heard from Percy and Clarry for some time. Percy is a very good correspondent, but I daresay Clarry has a good deal of work to get over and therefore not much time for writing.</p>
<p>I have still hopes of being home for next Xmas mother, I think end of the war is almost in sight and would not be surprised at it ending any day.<br/>Best love to you and dad and the rest.<br/>With fondest love<br/>Your loving son<br/>Gordon</p>
