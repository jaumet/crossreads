19/1/19 Gourdinne
A dull and cold Sunday. At 3 p.m. the Battalion paraded in the square to receive an address from the civilians. All the enfants and the best people were there. The old policeman stepped forward and apologised for the old Burgomaster whose 84 years rendered it impossible for him to risk the cold. The policeman read an address compiled by our friend M. Legait and we then read it to the men in English. I then read a reply and the Brigade interpreter translated it into French and let the Belges have it. They gave generous applause, we gave 3 cheers for the citizens of Gourdinne and our band played the Barbencon. We then adjourned to the Burgomasters place and roared the address at him. He
