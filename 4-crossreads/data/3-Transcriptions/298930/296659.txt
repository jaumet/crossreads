<p><u>HOSPITAL AT Gustrow</u></p>
<p>There is what is called the South Hospital and the North Hospital;  the South was attached to a separate camp, divided by a main road.   In this camp the Germans treated some of their own wounded, and they were kept apart from the prisoners.   The Englishmen who were placed in the South Hospital always received better treatment then those in the North, as they had an English Interpreter who had been doing R.A.M.C. work there since 1914.   This young fellow who belonged to the London Scottish Regiment, apparently had more concessions granted him by the Germans than any other Englishman.    He was given a room in which to keep British Red Cross medical stuff, also invalid food.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to go from the North Camp to the South Hospital had to get a special pass, and the same arrangement was necessary in going from the South to the North Hospital.    Most of the operations were performed in the South Hospital, but in both North and South Hospitals the patients of the different nationalities were all mixed together in the wards.</p>
<p>The sanitary arrangements of the South Hospital were much better than the North, and the North Camp Hospital was much larger.</p>
