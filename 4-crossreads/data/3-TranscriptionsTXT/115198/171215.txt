 February 3rd at work again in Ward 17 - busy but had a good staff. Moore Barracks housed some extremely sick troops. A number of the boys were invalided back to Canada. Some had been there since the beginning of the war and were more than happy to go. In March transferred to the Officers Ward, No. 23. The orderlies were difficult and the wards dirty. I gave an order it was to be cleaned before I returned to duty. On my return it had not been touched so I spoke to the Sargeant Major, who said he would see it was done the following day. I immediately said I would get Colonel Scott, giving them the impression I meant what I aaid. We all got busy and worked till 10 p.m. when all decided it was better to work with me than against me. I met Richard P. Qua (my future husband) there, Mr. McGarr and several other officers. Mr. Heron and Mr. Carmichael went AWL for a week. I had to report them as I had covered up as long as possible. They finally turned up and the Colonel, in front of the other patients, gave them a good dressing down. It was the young ones mostly, but when they found we too got into trouble, they decided it was not worth it. After two months I was made Supervisor on Night Duty. It was the time of the outbreak of the flu epidemic which made the going harder for all. Extra beds went into the wards where possible and some patients had to be put on the floor. Quite a few of the nurses went off duty with the flu. In about 10 days they were with us again. Sept. 24 R. P. Qua went back to France, 3rd Cav. Machine. I was worried when all letters from the front had almost ceased. Nov. 11th. Great noise and great excitement as Armistice was declared. Privates and officers going AWL and no one taking any notice. When out of cash they would turn up. We decided to prepare for one Grand Xmas. Our wards were decorated, and the patients preparing for a big celebration. Engineers stationed at the back of the hospital sent over drinks which were given to the boys in the ward. We took extra care of the very sick boys hoping to get them safely home. The troops were getting restless, since peace had been declared they were all anxious to return home and start afresh. We were all a little on edge. After Xmas lots of mail arrived and we were glad to hear most of the officers and men we knew were coming back from France. A map enclosed shows the route they took into Mons.
