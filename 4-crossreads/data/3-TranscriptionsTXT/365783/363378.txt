back from seeing General Williams.   I have not yet had a letter since our arrival at Alexandria - I have been a bit worried at not getting any news but suppose it must be through some mistake - most of the other officers have had letters galore.  Fred is keeping in good form & seems quite happy & contented.  I spoke to him about whether he wanted to change over to a Regiment but he seems quite satisfied.Good bye dearest old woman & God bless you and the children.   Spend as much money as ever you like - I dont want you to go short of anything - take plenty of motor drives & go to the theatres & get decent seats (none of your 6d hangovers)   If you want more cash get it from Arch.Best love to all fromYr. loving husbandWill
