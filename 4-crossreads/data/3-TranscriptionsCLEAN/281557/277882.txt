  
 Erquinghem & had our bath & it was tra bong: it is a big building & was formally a brewery: we undressed & had a good hot bath in disinfected water: the water was in vats & about 4 ft deep: while bathing our tunic & pants were taken away & fumigated & we were given clean underclothes & sox to put on:  French women are employed to wash & mend the clothes & I believe it pays to do it as the men would have to throw their clothes away when they got too louzy & dirty: there are a lot of guns concealed round about here all sizes: I met Fred Riddle at the bath house: 
 Tuesday April 18th  Cold wet day: revellie 5.30 am: breakfast: fell in & went to trenches in parties of six: we were on engineers fatigue & were demolishing a small bridge & filling in under a parapet: Lock & I were working & a sniper got our position & sent four shots before we made ourselves scarce: the mud & water was very bad: met C Wilson & C Brodie: a heavy bombardment is going on over armentieres way: had some cafe on the way back: the people here have orders to quit: the rumour is that a big offensive is to be made & I suppose they do not want the people to be hit by return shells: went over the road & got a stock of chocolates for the trenches: the place we were working in during the day was named "Oxford Circus" & it was a circus to see the chaps slipping on the sliding board path: wrote to Ethel & home: 
 Wednesday April 19th  Revellie 3 am: cold wet day: off on fatigue to the trenches but found on arrival we were too early for the engineers & had to cool our heels in rain for an hour
