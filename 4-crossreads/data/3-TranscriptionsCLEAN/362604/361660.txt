said, "Do you remember travelling down from London with a girl all alone last October.  I had quite forgotten.  Small world again.  When we arrived at Warrington I thought the name was familiar.  I could not conceive why until I saw a Hospital Collection Box on the Restaurant table.  I was searching all over the map for the place once.  Jack Preddey, brother of my Bexley Friends was in Hospital here.  The country-side is looking very pretty.  All the various colours of green & brown - the latter from the copper beeches - make a fine show,.  Of course all the Hedges are in full bloom & the gorse on the Hill sides is magnificent.
