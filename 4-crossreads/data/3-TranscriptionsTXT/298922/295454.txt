Tuesday 8 May 1917
The Turksbombed the Red + Hospitals at Railhead last night & used their Machine Guns. Of course the whole of the Hospitals were lit up & made an easy Target. Up to know now JACKO always played the game, it sounds like German influence. The Crops are now ripe & grass seeds falling (blankets full of them). SCORPIONS & SNAKES plentiful, about the old ruins & in the WADIS but climate cooler than Egypt.
I've not had my boots off at night for 3 weeks now.
Was given some INK last night so Pen goes again.
