<p>19<br/>It was very pretty the little kiddies looked great. This village (Merris) has suffered heavily in this war nearly everyone was in mourning. Heavy bombarding was heard yesterday &ndash; we are not many miles from the line. It rained a good deal yesterday but to-day has been perfect. Am writing this by daylight &amp; it is now 10-15 p.m. the twilight is great over here.</p>
<p>26/6/16.<br/>I forgot to mention about a village we passed through when cycling. The place was called Fruges &amp; we made quite a hit. We were the first Australians, I think, to stop there &amp; the people turned out well to see us. The kids ran</p>
