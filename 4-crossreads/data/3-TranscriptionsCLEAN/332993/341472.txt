  
 The "Express" 8/6/17 describing the battle says "The Earth opened & the line disappeared" Tremendous new attack by the British begun yesterday a new offensive on a 9 mile front just south of Offres. Heralded by the greatest explosion in the history of the world, the British began yesterday a new offensive on a 9 mile front just south of Offres. This moves the vital centre of the whole war to the North for the moment. It may have a tremendous effect on the future course of the operations. A Series of mines, charged with over 446 tons of light explosives, were fired & then at 3.10 a.m. the attack began. The attack is made at a point where British & Germans have been facing each other since September 1914. Messines was the scene of the famous charge of the Loudon Scottish on Oct 31. 1914. The Battle ground touches the Offres salient, where the British, under Lord French, fought two great Battles, which kept the German hordes from reaching Calais." Throughout the day I heard of soldiers I knew well either being killed or wounded but so far I have nothing of the Pioneers. There has been intermitent artillery activity during the day. At tea this evening I heard that N. J. Jorgensen of the Pioneers was killed being blown to pieces and Sgt. Hammett was severly shell shocked while Sgt Robson escaped with a scratch on the back of his neck. I was very sorry to hear of poor little Jorgensen's death. 
 (1042) Sunday June 10. 1917. Cool & cloudy to day. The bombardment last night was not so intense and gradually died away
