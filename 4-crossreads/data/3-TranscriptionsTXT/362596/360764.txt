 France 26/9/18 My Dear May  Just a few lines to let you know I am still going strong over here and carrying on with the war, and don't you think we are doing fine work, we have got the old Bosch thinking somewhat now don't you? And what fine news have been reaching us from the Holy Lands, it will do us. Well May the weather is starting to get wintery now but we have not had over much rain but of course it will come next month, but I'd hope that it will keep off. Well May don't forget to write and I will have to ring off for this time trusting you all are well as this scrawl leaves me at present. I remain with best love Clarence
