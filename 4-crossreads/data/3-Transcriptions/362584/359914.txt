<p>Dear Mrs Ferguson</p>
<p>Received this dear little parcel this morning. My Birthday so delighted. Also got a cable from home to me. Moving again very shortly probably tomorrow. I am going into Ismailia to the Club to Dinner tonight &amp; shall enjoy it immensely.</p>
<p>I am sending home a lot of undeveloped photo films &amp; a few prints &amp; asked Mother &amp; Father to send them to you.</p>
<p>Dorothy would go dippy if she knew my horse Phyllis. Give her my best love.</p>
<p>Please tell the Judge that Alroy Cohen has joined up this Battalion. Shall write to Judge too this mail.</p>
<p>Best of Love</p>
<p>C R Lucas</p>
