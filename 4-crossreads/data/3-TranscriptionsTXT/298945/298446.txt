Our Tent Sub are not working this week - A & C Sections having commenced the work in this new position, so I spent yesterday in helping to fix up the cellar. Eva & I got a roll of tar cloth from a camp beyond the railway, & made a linoleum use of it.
Yesterday we were very rough on any stray Fritz planes the came over observing. One was brought back by three or four of ours, & another narrowly escaped destruction & had to clear away for his life. We got three balloons during the day.
In the evening I went to a concert party which was showing in a Nissen hut next the Sugar Refinery. The show was given by the Boomerangs (3rd Brigade) & Jimmy Dowling, one of our concert party good at ragtime, showed for the first time. Frayne, also is joining them.
Today is fine & in complete contrast
