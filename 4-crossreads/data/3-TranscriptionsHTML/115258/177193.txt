They are not sending anybody out of the hospital at present, but they seem to think the 1st Bde will be leaving in about a fortnight so I expect to go to Raffa&nbsp;to rejoin them very soon.

One of the chaps stuck an empty bottle and a cork screw into a sister&#39;s over coat pocket, on the quiet.

The judge had a big wig of cotton wool and the crown prosiqutor</p>
