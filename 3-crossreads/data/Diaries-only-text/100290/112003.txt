30 August 1916
Wednesday
Day breaks wet stormy. Nothing doing in morning. Hut leaks during night. 22 men packed in these low pig sheds 3"no bon".especially when it get swamped. However its the joys of a soldier's life. Are taken on another march for want of something better to do. Walked 6 miles thro? driving wind rain. All get thoroughly soaked have to remain in wet clothes. Uncomplimentary remarks re officers by men with reason. Tea amp retire early.
