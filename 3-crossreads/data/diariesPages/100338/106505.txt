March

if it was going to set in for good.

I hope the weather will clear up and get much warmer before I get out of here, or else I am afraid that it won’t be more than a day or two before I am back again.

On Thursday the 20th it snowed very heavy, toward evening a thaw set in and by nightfall all trace of the snow had vanished. On the 22nd we had some more snow, but it was only slight not enough to cover the ground, It is very cold outside and even in the ward around the fire it is not too cheerful. I amuse myself and pass the time sitting near the fire Smoking and reading all the day. I am still waiting for news of the sailing of either a Hospital-Ship or Invalid-Ship.

Until the 28th the weather continued to keep very unsettled, Frosty and cold mornings, windy and wet days
