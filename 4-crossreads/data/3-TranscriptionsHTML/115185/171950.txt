Cairns discoursed on how he thought men mostly did great things or wrote great works by doing manual labor, and studying and living alone etc. etc.<br/>After we had lunch at the Continental hotel with Geoffry Street. He looks very much thinner but very well. Capt McKenzie &ndash; (Bondi dairy people) was at lunch also an officer of the 1st Batt. I met him in the Ivanhoe at London on crutches. It was very sad being with the Street boy without his O.C. Major Coultman. I feel his death very much &ndash; he was such a fine man. Geoffry told us about his illness. He went down to Tel el Kebir with his men and developed pneumonia there. He was brought to 2 Gen Hosp at Cairo where he died. I got the no. of his grave from Geoff and I'm going to see it and put flowers there. Geoffry</p>
