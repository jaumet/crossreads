<p>The engineers sleeping in a tunnel next to ours &amp; leading off the same house like part of the hop factory, arose at about 7.30, so I turned in then &amp; slept till breakfast time at 1130, when Walter came &amp; woke me.</p>
<p>News greeted me that we were to be <strike>be</strike> relieved tonight by 1st Field bearers.</p>
