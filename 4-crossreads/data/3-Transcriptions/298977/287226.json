<p>Nothing to add now &ndash; I'm stuck &ndash;</p>
<p>Hope everything is going on O.K.  You should be able to get away for a spell now.  Get someone to take you on the Birtles trip on the Mitchell, but keep her in good order till I get back, when I shouldn't have any trouble in busting her up again.</p>
<p>Love to all at home.<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Roy.</p>
