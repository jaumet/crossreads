<p>September, 1915<br/>Friday 24<br/>My muscles are not working too well &amp; I am going under Cholorform to have my leg stitched tomorrow so have to go without BreakFast. I go to Sulphur Baths daily I described these baths when we camped here at Heloman last March &ndash; A big buck nigger wraps a towel around you &amp; then massages &ndash; Beautiful baths, with Electrical treatment &amp; every form of Turkish Bath. In the visitors book can be seen the name of the Kaiser &amp; most of the crowned heads of Europe. Maimed soldiers are the clients now.</p>
