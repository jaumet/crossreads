<p>ward.</p>
<p>A terrific bombardment has continued night and day. This gives me the idea that the push which was expected to take place up north has been commenced.</p>
<p>July 30th. Sat.<br/>W. I. and myself went to Hazebrouck to have our eyes examined by the Eye Specialist there. Having suffered from severe headache of late I thought if I got my eyes tested and glasses fixed I might be a little better.</p>
<p>We had to remain in hospital for a night. Got permission to go out and we had a good look at Hazebrouck.</p>
<p>July 31st. Mon<br/>Slight astigmatism in my eyes. No glasses advised. It appears to me that you must be almost blind before they will give you glasses in the army.</p>
<p>Unfortunately market had finished at 12 o'clock so that we did not see the market in progress, but the square was lined with stalls selling every kind of household goods</p>
<p>Returned to the unit this afternoon. When we arrived we found the O.T. full of workers. Orders had been given to have the O.T. ready for the next morning, rather a big order when one sees that the roof is hardly on the hut  Always the same in the army first things last</p>
