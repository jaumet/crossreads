<p>27TH. German field post-cards were issued this morning. Each man is allowed to write one weekly. I asked the interpreter if the cards would go through. He replied in the affirmative, adding "why do you thing they are issued, if the cards are to be confiscated"?   This is a case where silence is golden. I merely remained silent. (Months later I discovered that these cards were only a hoax, and all such cards or letters were destroyed in France). Therefore the period confined to the prisoners hospital Valenciennes, was unknown to those at home, incidentally, an additional two months without food parcels.</p>
<p>28TH. Rumours favour our transfer to Germany at an early date. I have a very poor chance of numbering in the party, on account of my wounds. Severely wounded are not allowed to travel, chiefly on account of the lack of accommodation in hospital trains. The usual ordeal.</p>
<p>29TH. Many sick and wounded Englishmen admitted to hospital. Amongst the latest batch, are two young fellows of the Lincolnshire Regiment, who were deliberately shot at and wounded by Hun posterns "en route" to work from a Reprisal camp. Although this sort of thing appears incredible to the average person, especially to those living in luxury at home, it is absolutely authentic and quite common. For instance, numerous prisoners arrive here daily suffering with broken limbs and scars about the head, caused by Hun rifle butts and sticks. One of the lads above-mentioned, was shot through the wrist, simultaneously the same bullet struck another unfortunate nearly, piercing his heart, killing him instantaneously. This barbarism and despicable mal-treatment was the outcome of the two men stepping only severl feet from the ranks (whilst marching to work) to receive a little bread offered by a French woman, running along<strike>side</strike> the roadside. The Tommies were desperate with ravenous hunger and glad to accept anything eatable. Without warning or remark the Hun levelled his rifle at them and fired. If a postern notices a man stoop to pick up a cigarette end, or anything likely to be of use, he immediately fires; or clubs the culprit, with his rifle butt. Many men have been shot and clubbed for less. The men march ten or twelve kilo's to and from their billets to work. Invariably the work is of the roughest and most strenuous kind, under British</p>
