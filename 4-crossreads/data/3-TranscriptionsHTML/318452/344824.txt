<p>Saturday. March 2.<br/>Since my last entry we have covered many hundreds of miles &amp; are now in Capetown<br/>The trip was uneventful except that a severe epidimic of Gastric Influenza broke out &amp; about 75% of the Officers were down with it.<br/>We had some trouble with the young lads who are being returned to Australia under age. They attempted to breach a hatch &amp; even to attempt to take charge of things generally but they were dealt with very severely and the ringleaders punished &amp; the rest soon</p>
