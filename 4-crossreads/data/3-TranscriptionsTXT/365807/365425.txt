My dear Judge
Would you send over the  full  address of your dear wounded Lad - my better half will send it on to her sister Mrs I.F. Payne now living in London & who no doubt will do whatever she can.  As parcels are being received today for troops abroad there is sure to be a mail early next week - I shall not be in town tomorrow but if you send the address to my chambers I'll get it in time -
Yours faithfully
A.S.Dawson
I recd the photos etc - very good werent they?
I had a note from my boy yesterday date 16th Ap - he was to go out that night with a flying column & expected things would be "pretty thick" - His first independent command - in   [indecipherable] F. Am:  with 1st Light Horse Brigade - He was to cable if he got this all right - but none has arrived  yet. I fancy things   were  very thick & he has had his hands full & not been back to Cairo as evidently there was a set back at Gaza.He was camped in an orchard (fig trees & nectarines) but no ripe fruit yet - lovely after the sandy desert -
