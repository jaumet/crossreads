<p>106<br/>job to keep the billets clean.</p>
<p>We didn't stop here very long but moved back again for another trip in the line at Flers. However we had a spell at Fricourt for about 5 weeks.</p>
<p>I shall not forget the 55th Battn here as we marched in it was just getting dark and with no prospect of a tea to follow, it was very cold as well. Then the 55th Battn turned round and handed us the whole of their hot stew meal to us. I had some mates too in the 55th, I went round to them and they shared some of their canteen goods with me.</p>
<p>As I say we spent 5 weeks here in all and they were I knew 5 weeks of about the most pleasant experience I enjoyed in</p>
