Sunday 21 April
Particularly quiet on the front all day. Glorious day there has been much aerial work. Our post is just under the shadow of the Mont des Cats. Two stretcher cases from the line.
Monday 22 April
To-day has been very hot round our Aid Post Fritz has shelled us all day. He obtained one direct hit on our house wounded one chap fairly badly.
A very heavy bombardment on our left. I think things will be quite warm about here in the future.
