  
 7/9/16 London & Bideford. To the Palace of St James and there again saw the guard mounting - crowds attracted thereby. Rather amused ath the breeches of some of the officers which are cut to resemble the Tommies trousers in the war they bunch over the puttees. Some knut has set this new unsightly fashion. The slow march from the parade ground to the street is very effective and so is the advance of the new towards the old guard early in the proceedings. We could turn out as smart a guard at rifle work any day. Caught 1 p.m. train for Bideford and went right through the south of England, which is much the same as the rest of the compact old country until Salisbury is reached. Approaching there the land becomes stony and poorer in nature. But after getting off the plain it gets back to "normal" again. I noticed more old thatched houses and snug old "Frenchified" villages than in other parts. After leaving Exeter (identified the Hall opposite the station I think) the country changes once more in gets more timbered and rougher. Reaching Bideford put up at Tantons hotel which seems a good place.
