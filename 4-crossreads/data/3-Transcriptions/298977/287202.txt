<p>Suppose by this you are all recovering from the effects of Xmas.  I am afraid ours is going to be rather peculiar this year.</p>
<p>How is the Wool going?  I'd be interested to see result of some of the sales.</p>
<p>My partner is just beginning to sing again so I'll have to give in.</p>
<p>Best wishes to everybody in the Office, and love to All at home.</p>
<p>Your affectionate Son,<br/>Pte. 1280 Roy Richards.</p>
