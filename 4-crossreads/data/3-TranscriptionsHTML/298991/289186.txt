<p>Wednesday July 4th<br/>Raining nearly all day. It is very muddy round the camp. Had a very busy time in the store stock taking, &amp; giving the whole place a "spring cleaning". Received a pck from Australia, which was sent over a year ago, &amp; was addressed to Egypt. It only contained a pr of socks, but they are very acceptable, as nearly all my others have shrunk away that much that I have a struggle to put them on. Feeling crook tonight.</p>
<p>Thursday July 5th<br/>Very sick today. Had hardly any sleep last night. I have terrific pains in my sides, back, &amp; chest. Went on sick parade &amp; the Dr ordered me to hospital, but later it was found that the hospital was full, so I had to go back to bed in the hut. Spent a very miserable day. Received another late parcel from Mrs Nelson, it contained two cakes of soap, three handkerchiefs &amp; a tin of ginger.</p>
<p>Friday July 6th<br/>Rained slightly this morning, but came out clear this afternoon. We do not see near so many airoplanes here now as we used to last year. It is a daily occurrence to see them over the camp though.<br/>Everything is fresh &amp; the grass nice &amp; green after the rain. There are a good few wild flowers out too.</p>
