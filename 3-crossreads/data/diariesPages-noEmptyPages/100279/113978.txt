12. for in the afternoon were going to have a "Field day" the whole Brigade were going to practice a stunt, so accordingly after dinner the bugles sounded the "fall in" away we marched to our Battalion parade ground, here Capt Jacobs took charge marched us about 2 miles to the joint where the affair was to take place, over towards Contay.
After we had got all our men in position everything ready I'm hanged if we did not have to wait for a good 2 hours shivering in the icy cold winds but this is the real military style
At last they gave the "order" to advance away we went , for a wonder we did not get mixed up but everything went well, the heads seemed well pleased at the way in which it was carried out
