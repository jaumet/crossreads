  
 mother  & keep mine. You can amuse yourself by taking a few snaps. Where you by the Films will teach you how to use it. I must write a few lines to dear old Mother now for her birthday. I've forgotten whose turn it is for letter, have packed my book, so it will do for the family. Fondest love & kisses to you all.                                                                                                                                                                                        From                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 yours lovingly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Edith.
