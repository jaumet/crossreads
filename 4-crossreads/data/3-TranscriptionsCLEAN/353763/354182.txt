We got on board the SS Upolu without further mishap  -  I don't quite know what impression we create but there's no question about it that for frankness of speech & fulness of comment & a job to be done give me a submarine officer  - There is a strong feeling on the Upolu that we could win the war & round up the Germans better than the rest of the fleet & that we ought to be given shore billets  -  I to be P.M.O.  -  if not Governor - when this show 'wipes out' or washes out as the chaps say  -
The Australia & the Sydney are in - God help a German fleet now  -
Sunday Sept 20  - 1914-  A bathing party of which I formed one- went off at 6  - 15 am to the pier  -  We enjoyed this very much  -  The water was cool & refreshing  -  The usual mob of soldiers all evidently enjoying themselves were present  -  Breadkfast at 9 & then a quiet morning  -  In the aftn  Captain Moore & I went ashore & paid 2 visits - 1st to the Commandant of Police & then to the Provost Marshall  -  Our business was twofold - to get niggers & to get rifles for this vessel  -  9 rifles are too few for us & we want to get some of the German Mausers & Ammunition
