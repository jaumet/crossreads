 Thursday 7 
 Artillery Road dressing station. No cases. 
 Rather surprising that for at 8.30 p.m. a sham stunt started. 
 First came a few stray rifle shots, then the rattle of bags of cans being shot over the edge of  the  our trenches, whence they rolled towards the Turks trenches.  This occasioned a terrific fire from them & at once a star shell made its appearance. 
 In the midst of this hurricane of rifle fire came a rapid carronade from a monitor & destroyer directed at some important target. 
 Stunt lasted an hour.
