<p>3 SATURDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; fairly sunny though cooler</p>
<p>than usual. We shifted</p>
<p>up into the stables just</p>
<p>vacated by the 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery</p>
<p>&amp; we have a bit more room</p>
<p>there. Got all our old harness</p>
<p>pegs ect up. Got the other</p>
<p>sweater from Polpero in</p>
<p>evening. Heard a roumer</p>
<p>that we may be shifting</p>
<p>shortly, but hope its not</p>
<p>true. Four waggons went</p>
<p>up at night with amunition</p>
<p>but I did not have to go</p>
