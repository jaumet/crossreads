when I got better I was put in another Red Cross Train taken on to Havre to the Convalescent Camp there after two months there, was sent to the Infantry Base depot at Havre being examined by the Doctors was classed as B3 was sent to England Weymouth was the place from there after waiting three weeks, went by train to Devonport where we got on Board the Medic for Australia.
We left there in a big convoy 12 large ships 1 cruiser 5 English destroyers one Yankee Destroyer also an Air ship which kept with us for the whole day then went back. All ships were in darkness at night, no smoking on deck at night, no lights to be shown, We kept together in three lines, the destroyers cutting in out all the time the Yankee keeping guard in the rear, all ships were continually changing position first we would be in front then another ship would go ahead zig-zagging all the time. 
We never sighted any submarines on our trip after a few days when we were out of the danger Zone we separated the ships went their different ways when we arrived at Colon at the mouth of the Panama Canal we found one of the ships there before us all the destroyers except the Yankee ship had left us. so we coaled ship next day we started to go through the canal which is a wonderful piece of work very interesting.
The ship goes into a lock is then raised by water coming into the lock when the ship is at the same height as the water outside the gates open the ship is towed along by powerful land tugs
