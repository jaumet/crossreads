Seeing me sucking hard at the rug, with a maniacal look in my eyes, he suddenly grasped the awful situration (I had meantime been trying to convey to him the terrible catastrophe, by frantically waving my right arm in the direction of the empty dixie lid), and without a word, drained what remained in the vessel, and followed my lead. Not till that rug was sucked dry, did we look up, then the cause was explained. I shall never forget the look of horror on his face when he realised what had happened.
We decided that in future we would each drink our own rum, and not worry about having it hot. But what a calamity it was. We ended in a good laugh as most things did in those days.

They must be very nourishing things, as the small quantities I managed to break off (with the help of my entrenching tool) seemed to satisfy me and I really could not afford to lose any more teeth. I used to break these
