  
 Woolich Arsnell a few mile from our camp, had sighted a zepplain.  woolich Arsnell is a great Munition place also a place were Guns are manufactured.  with this searchlight on it the zepp. could be seen plainly.  it looked a train in the air all lit up.  and it was fired upon from all round the place.  for about an hour the sound of the Guns was terrific with shells bursting in the air all around the zepp. which was in full view before this powerful searchlight for an hour when it suddenly disappeared, though the searchlights had the sky lit up the zepp. disappeared.  next morning April 1st it was published that the zepp had dropped in the Thames and the crew taken Prisoner.  it was a very exciting night.  London is well protected with searchlights and land Batteries.  two nights afterwards I was on picket along with others in town near the camp, called Plumstead
