Had charge of a big party who were going over to the Gas chamber, made this job do for the mornings work. The late rains have done all the Camp vegetables the world of good, especially the potatoes & turnips, wherever you go over here you will run across little plots of land between the huts & such places all growing vegetables & etc, it is a good idea & will save an immense quantity of food, this is the result of the U. boat campaign
