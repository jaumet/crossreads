<p>October1916<br/>different duties</p>

Water is scarce it is hard to get any to wash yourselves with &amp; I would sooner be back on the desert where we had the wells.  We got our mess tent up &amp; sent in 2 sergeants to Port Said to buy things for us so we ought to be alright in a few days when we get fixed up properly.</p>

In the afternoon we have no parade but stables is at 3.30 pm so you don't seem to have too much time to yourself.  Leave is being granted to Port Said again  2 men per troop to the rest camp for 1 week &amp; 1 man each day for 48 hrs. 6 per troop were also sent to Alexandria to the Sidr Bishi Rest camp for a week.
