<p>Sunday 15 October 1916<br/>Church parade this morning, Major Anderson in Charge.<br/>Capt. Teece Chaplain of our Regiment decorated with the Military Cross, a Distinction well deserved during His term with us.  He proved to be a man of Sterling worth during the Romani &amp;amp; Katia engagements both in attending the wounded on the Battlefield &amp;amp; keeping in direct touch with all in trouble.  He lived to smooth the rough pathway of the men, &amp;amp; all agree that the distinction is well deserved.  Whilst that is true I confess that the High opinion I held for Clasps &amp;amp; Medals has been shattered mainly on account of the Cheap &amp;amp; easy way they are won.  If Bravery &amp;amp; Devotion to Duty receive special mention, I believe every man who has followed Our Colonel realizes that He has earned recognition for the way in which the Troops were Handled &amp;amp; encouraged during the recent Fights.  If General Chavel does not recognize our Colonel's true worth, the men of the Regiment do, &amp;amp; to-day He is surrounded by their confidence &amp;amp; affection, which after all is the Highest Honour.</p>
