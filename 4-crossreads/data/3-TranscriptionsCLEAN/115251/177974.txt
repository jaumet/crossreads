CERTIFICATE:
The foodstuffs which are on the Steamer under the British Flag, shall be for the Natives of New Mecklenburg, who are in urgent need of it.  The Administrator promised that the food would not be kept for the Troops.  It is therefore requested that the cargo shall go to the destination in New Mecklenburg without interference.
