<p>April 1915<br/>Wednesday 28<br/><u>Fine</u><br/>One man shot dead &amp; a N.Z. Officer badly wounded alongside me during the night. Heavy fighting or firing all night. The Turks waste much ammunition &amp; use explosive bullets. We were relieved this morning by fresh N.Z's about 6 AM. &amp; and came down to the beach where we stayed all day &amp; moved along further in the night. Here we were reorganised</p>
<p>Thursday 29<br/>Roll call <u>Fine</u>. Naval Bgde. Russian Jews N.Z's &amp; more  Australians landing to our aid. We are to have a good spell before going back to the firing line. Bert Sanders &amp; myself have a comfortable dugout to sleep in. Arthur wounded Tuesday. I hear many Royal Marine Light Infantry here</p>
