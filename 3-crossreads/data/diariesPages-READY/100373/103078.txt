Another class of native one comes across, and he is a pest, is the one who is always begging. They are continually beg, beg begging socks, shirts, boots, in fact anything which one has or wears seems to be the thing which they would like to have. They pester the life out of one, no matter how you talk to them. They do not lack for perserverance. Sometimes I feel inclined to give this class of people a bar of soap, for they are usually very dirty and smell awful. The chances are if one gave them a bar of soap they would throw it away.

Visited the Cairo Zoo which is situated near Ghaza. It is beautifully laid out and has a splendid collection of wild animals. The best collection of animals I have ever seen. The pontoons by means of which the Turks had endeavoured to cross the Suez Canal early this year were on exhibition in the zoo. They were very much damaged by shot and shell.

There is a splendid Grotto here. To-day being an exceptionally hot day it was very refreshing to sit in the cool shade and listen to the music of the water as it tripped over the artificial rocks which formed the grotto. Seated in the cool shade of the grotto one could picture up pretty scenes similar, but on a larger scale,
