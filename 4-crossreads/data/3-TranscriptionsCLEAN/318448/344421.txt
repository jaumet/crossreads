We got about 1200 prisoners but the Turks brought Reinforcements up from Nablis which complicated matters & nearly caught our mounted Brigades. Now the impression seems to be that we have failed and the Anzac Div is, I believe, out of it now, but I dont think the fighting is over yet by any means. The position was a curious one, as far as I could understand it was according to the map on the next page.
