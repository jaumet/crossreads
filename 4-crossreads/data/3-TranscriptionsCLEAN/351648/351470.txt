  
 &heaps of filthy lucre attached thereto.  May you soon be rich enough to fulfil all your ambitions and all that - what!  The weather hear would suit you, I mean for us comfortably covered men the cold has no fears, it is my most priceless possession at present, I always did pity "skinny rats" over here, I do more than that they have my deepest sympathy, I'm not trying to be really consoling in view of your asking for a prescription for plumpness, but I'm beginning to bless my hereditary tendencies which ensure for me a portly old age the thin have such a bad time here. 
 But let me see if there is any news, am meeting daily all the chaps I knew in Sydney, it is fine, several old K.S. [Kings School] boys of various eras.  I haven't seen the officer to get any further details of Bobby Burns than those I gave you last time.  Beresford Cairns with a comission is in our division, Dick Waugh has gone home I believe or is to do so shortly, Teddy Burkitt is fit & well & doing very fine work.  What is the name of the chap you told me of from Togomain [Toganmain], he is in our Divl. Artillery, I'll look him up if you'll tell me of him. 
 Well I can't think of any more to tell you so must end up with a huge bundle of good wishes, love & one's round the neck as they say in the Classics if I may be so bold, to you & Jack & the young hopeful.
