 I had a letter from Helen Catt the other day, but have not had time to answer it yet, but I will some of these days. Ted Flanagan &amp; Jim Jones has not arrived in Egypt yet. Arther Chipper when to Hospital about a month ago, but he is doing well. My word there are thousands of Camels working in this Country carrying provisions &amp; different things. I believe that we have not started on our winter yet, worse luck. 
 Well I think I will have to close for the present time, as I cannot seem to find anything new to write about. I will try and write a better letter next time. Remember me to all my friends. "Good Bye for the present" God Bless &amp; Take every care of You 
 I remain Yours ever Loving W. Weaber
