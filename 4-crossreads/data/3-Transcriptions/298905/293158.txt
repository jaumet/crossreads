<p>About 4 days ago I mended &amp; washed a pair of shorts I had, &amp; hung them on an old apple tree to dry, but when I went to get them they were missing, so I kept my eyes open, &amp; hanged if one of our chaps didn't have the cheek to wear them this morning I frightened the life out of him, he made all sorts of excuse's to try &amp; clear himself<br/>This evening our cricket material turned up, &amp; the boy's are bashing away as I write, we will have a bit of fun now for a while, it is money well spent for you can't beat a bit of sport in your spare time<br/>Len was up tonight &amp; brought a budget of papers with him.<br/>4th. Church parade again this morning General Birdwood &amp; Staff were there, &amp; he made a little speech</p>
