Our kit bags were sent into Minia today;  I have been very busy today getting things ready to go away;  I am sorry we are leaving here as it is the best camp we have yet had but we have had a good spell & it is about time we had a little more excitement;  A Sqd shifted to Shusha today & did not like going as they also have notice to be ready to move at any time;
50 was missed today belonging to the Sqd & suspicion fell on Whitby (a batman), he was searched & an inquiry is being held, Whitby has been losing very heavy at two-up & everyone thinks he is guilty
