<p>are a fine lot of officers on board. We all get along splendidly together. Several of them are Varsity chaps, quite a lot of them were doing law. As yet we have not the slightest idea where we are going. Of course there are the usual L.W's going about, some saying that we are going to do garrison work in India, others that we are going straight to Salonica. I think it is quite probable that we will be landed at Suez and train in Egypt for a couple of months. Goodness knows we need all we can get, although it will be a bit of a cow tramping over the sandy desert with full marching order on. We have a f.m.o. parade once a week on board. There is any amount of shipping to be seen now, which is quite a change from the monotony of nearly three weeks without sighting land or ship. We have had no news of any sort during the voyage. We are not allowed to listen in for the wireless news that is flashed round the world and we are not allowed to speak passing ships. For all we know the war might be over by the time we get to our destination. Are you still at the Show Ground? I am sending this to the Supreme Court on the off chance that you are not. When you write don't forget to let me know where and how are all our friends</p>
