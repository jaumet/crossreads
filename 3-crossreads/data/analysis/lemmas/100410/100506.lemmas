 ( 4 ) Kill in action What prepar can I write To warn you of your loss ? To mitig in black white The burden of the cross ? These littl thing kept separ ? His diari half begun ; How can these trifl compens A mother for her son ! The consol men might seek In know how he die Seem so inadequ and weak Where sorrow weigh down pride . The Mother of all Son bestow All grace comfort , till The bid come for you to go Where men no longer kill ! To " F.L.R. " 26/4/15 In Franc You with the boyish laugh ; the sunni eye That alway smile when danger threaten worst ; Would you have had thing order otherwis If death could be prevent , fate revers ? You were so bright , we brighten ?neath your touch , To all aliv , your silenc seem unreal . Can it be true that you who felt so much Lie there alon and can no longer feel ? O comrad , though mayb they call you dead , To us who love you , THAT you cannot be ! God grant when in my turn I too am sped , Someon may find as much to say of me .
