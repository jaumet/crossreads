<p>Monday 4th May 1917<br/>Commenced duty week yesterday, &amp; I, being in the tent division, am on the observation Hosp.<br/>It is a good job<br/>There are three of us with a Lance Corp who is an oldish steady old chap, who knows his work fairly well, but is not very quick.  He is a nice chap.<br/>The other two are young &amp; very straight kind of chaps &amp; full of life.<br/>Went to Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon &amp; saw aunts &amp; uncles.</p>
