 [At top of page] Well my dear I will close now with fondest love to R B &amp; self from your loving Brother Ken France 4th June 1916 My dearest Sister, Just a short note this time to let you know I have had 8 days leave to England &amp; enjoyed myself immensley, after being so long away from an English speaking country. The people treated me fine especially the fair sex it was grand to get into conversation with a pretty little English girl, I didnt leave London, as the time allowed isnt long &amp; the days simply flew round. Well more particulars re the trip later dear when I write you a long leter. Your parcel No 12 to hand &amp; tell Mother her No 3 also arrived. I had a mail waiting for me here when I got back including one from Dad, everybody seems to be going crook about Dave, I cabled to him from London to place my share of the Estate into my account in our London office, things appear to be a bit mixed in my money matters in New South Wales. I am also going to stop my allottment, it is hard luck when one has these worries at this juncture.
