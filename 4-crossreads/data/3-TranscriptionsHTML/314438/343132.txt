<p>The capture of the Mont St. Quentin position and the enemy's efforts to recapture it led to a most sanguinary struggle.  The importance of this position to the Germans was fully realised by them and they made repeated efforts to retake it and to prevent our further advance and seizure of Peronne.  There is no doubt that the whole system of the enemy's defences on the British front was rudely shaken by this important tactical success.</p>
<p>Between the 29th and 31st August all attempts made by the 5th Division and the 32nd Division to effect a crossing of the Somme south of Halle had been unsuccessful owing to the width of the marsh to be bridged and to the fact that any attempt at bridging were met by immediate artillery and machine-gun fire from the eastern bank.</p>
<p>To enable any attack on Peronne to be developed it was necessary therefore for the 5th Division to cross the Somme between Feuillers and Clery and to pass in a South Easterly direction through the 2nd Divisional area.</p>
<p>During the night 31st August the 6th and 7th Infantry Brigades of the 2nd Division and the 14th Infantry Brigade of the 5th Division crossed the Somme between Feuillaucourt and Clery and passed east and south east of Clery preparatory to the continuation of operations on 1st September.</p>
<p>The enemy realised that the majority of our movement must be through Clery and in consequence the area was shelled very considerably during the period 30th August to 2nd September thus making the passage of any large bodies of troops towards the battle front S.E. of Clery a slow and costly matter.</p>
<p>The attack was continued on the 1st September on the fronts of the 5th, 3rd and 2nd Australian Divisions.  The 14th Infantry Brigade and the 6th Infantry Brigade attacked at 6 a.m. and the 3rd Division at 5.30 a.m.</p>
