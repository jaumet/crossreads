October 1915Monday 25Fine. We had to rise early this morning as there was a big brigade scheme conducted by the Brigadier (Smythe). The whole brigade cooperated in an attack. I was told to go off with the brigade signal staff. I went with Staff Capt. Anderson in rear of the 4th Bn. Who were in reserves.
Tuesday 26Cool wind. Did a route march for about 3 hours & then returned to camp. Got paid 10/- and I sent a parcel of curios to Hal. Orders to move off tomorrow morning. Want to know where we are going.
