<p>June [July] 10<br/>257.<br/>Arrives with midday's mail, the first three books of Blackalls, "Sheldonian Series of Reprints", and three bonser little books that are beautiful.  The "Initiate" series of Poets is in the same type &ndash; the Dolphin Old type &ndash; as are the books of "The Adventurers All Series".</p>
<p>In the Sheldonian Series would like to see Hume's "Gods in Exile" and "The Gardener's Story" from Anatole France's "The Revolt of the Angels".</p>
<p>Morning, sun and clear skies:  afternoon Clouds, Thunder &amp; Rain.  Tonight?  Rain!</p>
<p>258.<br/>At 11.30 last night companies of the 4th and 6th Btts. attacked and advanced the line to a depth of about 300 yds., capturing 6 M.G.s and 19 prisoners.</p>
<p>The sun setting, broke through the clouds, and across the trees and the fields under a blue grey sky, coloured whitely the trees and fields, <strike>and</strike> shadowing deeply away from its light the rain falling the while, catching the light high in the air, and throwing a splendid rainbow across the world by the line, then the cloud over and colour fading.</p>
<p>July 11<br/>259.<br/>Another day of sun changing to rain, and wounderful skies.  Working on Borre's and Pradelles &amp;amp. Rouge Croix D. Areas.</p>
<p>An hour with George C. down at the A.D.M.S. Hut yarning of "Erewhon" and Butler and Shaw, left there "Francois Villon" and "Pericles Address to the Athenians".</p>
<p>No Mail.</p>
<p>Midday came down from the line a wire of 39 prisoners being taken, followed an amended message five minutes later of a growing to 70.  Tonight it has grown to over 120, and our patrols are still on the warpath.  An added note to today's summary runs.</p>
