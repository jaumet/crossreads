<p>Monday 22nd<br/>Started out for musketry at 8.30, but when we got over to the range we were sent back.  Groomed up &amp; saddled, &amp; for the first time since we landed in Egypt mounted our horses.  They all went very quietly, but we weren't allowed to put them out of a walk.  After dinner went to the range &amp; were put through our 100 yards grouping.  Didn't do too good.  Only got a 12 inch group.  Troop did fairly well altogether.</p>
<p>Tuesday 23rd<br/>Finished our [indecipherable] musketry.  Got 14, 4 centres &amp; a magpie at the 200, &amp;  2 centres &amp; 2 outers at the 500.  Only hit the disappearing man once.  The shooting made the muscles of my arm fairly sore.  In the afternoon was detailed off to mark, on the 200 yards range.  Didn't finish up till about 6 oclock.</p>
