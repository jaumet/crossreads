<p>a dull miserable day looking like rain a contrast to fair day.<br/>[Shorthand symbols]<br/>I made up a packet of foreign coins to post to my wife 14 coins in all. Tom Martin drove me into Pettigo this evening to catch the train. There I saw another Miss Martin who came to the station to see me. I had only about 10 minutes to talk to her. When I was here before she was in Belfast. I got a letter from Willie when I arrived at Uncle</p>
