<p>February 14<br/>Lyttle's face there's a great fascination, his features are not generally good but all defects are lost in the beauty of his mouth and dimples, he has a most extraordinarily happy expression when he looks up alertly &ndash; and a devilishness when he curses.  Must try and sketch him well.</p>
<p>February 15<br/>164.<br/>Last night &ndash; till midnight dancing:  the Bal Masque a success beyond all other Fetes of the Ambulance.  We are publishing during the coming week a special No. of "Gheitz", working at it tonight.</p>
<p>Today a Boche plane brought down &ndash; falling behind Bailleul.</p>
<p>No mail.</p>
<p>February 17.<br/>165.<br/>The last days have been full of the working out of dresses for the carnival and the publishing of Gheitz I, and the beginnings of Gheitz 2.  Yesterday Shepherd handed me a fine drawing of the Col. in his Nigger costume, and box contributions shewed appreciation by the genuine note of its contents.  Number Two is to be almost entirely a souvenir number.  Between ten and eleven last night, I posted on door of Rec. Hut notice of its early appearance &ndash; and the necessity of handing names early to the Canteen, now &ndash; 10.30 a.m., there are over 50 names in, and our issue cannot possibly exceed 80, perhaps 50 will represent our limit.</p>
<p>166.<br/>Posted yesterday to Mrs. H. "Selections from Lord Dunsany", "Whim" and "Five Poems", 70.</p>
<p>Yesterday Jim back from Blighty leave &ndash; he posted letter to W &amp; N during his second day in Glascow [Glasgow], probably there is a block somewhere in the postal lines, letters are very late &amp; a few bombs over the H.Q. P.O. might possibly shake them up.</p>
<p>167.<br/>Today rich in colour, but cold.  Heavy frost again and iron ground.</p>
<p>Masefield's "Old Front Lines" last Chapter magnificent, stands with parts of "Gallipoli".</p>
