of the heavy casualties was ordered out to the line about 9 AM. Walked about 7 miles to the post commenced carrying immediately. First case I assisted to carry was Capt Smythe of the 56th wounded in leg.
Carrying all through night in a blizzard, far from pleasant circumstances.
Tuesday 3.4.17
Glad to see daylight, ground covered with snow, still a lot of casualties coming through. Had no sleep during night, feeling rather tired. Fritz brought down a couple of our baloons in flames; a beautiful piece of work amid a hornet's nest of machine guns anti-aircraft guns. Two of Fritz's planes brought down earlier in the afternoon.
