<p>August, 1915<br/>Thursday 19<br/>No name of boat but news has just come in that 2600 Troopers drowned Mediterannean (Torpedoed) <u>Later</u> "Prince George" torpedoed &ndash; reinforcements from England &ndash; My difficulty is a Bath &ndash; Too many in bed to be washed so I get on my crutches &amp; lay one across end of Bath &amp; rest wounded leg on that as if I get dressing wet the Sisters growl &ndash; (but they are very good). Another trouble is few of the Pyjamas have any buttons or strings in Trousers -  Why the visitors don't bring needle &amp; cotton &amp; Bobkins instead of chattering away [indecipherable] just put string in with safety Pin &amp; [indecipherable]</p>
