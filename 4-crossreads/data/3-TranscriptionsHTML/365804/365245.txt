<p>At Sea<br/>One day of many</p>
<p>My dearest Sister.<br/>It will no doubt cause you much sorrow to learn that I have not been sea-sick and that I have no intention of being so. Furthermore I have not had the pleasure of beholding anyone in the throes of mal-de-mer so that I cannot provide you with any gruesome details regarding this interesting malady.</p>
<p>Since writing to mother and father &ndash; which took place yesterday &ndash; several interesting and exciting things have happened of which I am not allowed to tell. The consequences may be serious or they may not, but once we get off this confounded troop-ship, I'll write and let you know all about it.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday; and this morning we held a memorial service for Lord Kitchener. News of his death reached us by wireless two days ago, but as yet we know no further details than that he was drowned.</p>
