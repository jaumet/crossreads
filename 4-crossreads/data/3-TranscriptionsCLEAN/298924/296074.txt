Wednesday 2 April 1919Did I mention that Bevy Liddles ex husband W. West is on this boat & has now his commission.  I was about the only one who knew his career & kept quiet about it.  Cold better & Diary nearly finished.  Wireless came today saying calling at Albany, Sydney & Adelaide so I will be a week later than Dolly.  I hope some one meets her alright.
