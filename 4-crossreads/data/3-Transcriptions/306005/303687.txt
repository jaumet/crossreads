<p>7-1-17<br/>the station master &amp; told me to go in the brake van. I tipped the guard &amp; wanted an empty carriage to sleep in till morning, as the train arrived at Suez at 2 AM &amp; it was too late to try &amp; get into an hotel which would have been impossible but the guard advised me to go home with him &amp; he might be able to find an empty cot; This I did &amp; had a decent bed to sleep in even if it was previously occupied by a nigger.</p>
<p>8-1-17<br/>Mon 8th<br/>I told the guard when going to bed to wake me at 7 oclock &amp; this he did at 7.30 had a wash &amp; a shave &amp; went to the WindsorHotel &amp;</p>
