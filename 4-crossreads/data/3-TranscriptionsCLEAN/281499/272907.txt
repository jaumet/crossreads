  
 out to our bitter cost. 5th.  A couple of minutes to go & all were straining at the leash, the moon had almost gone down & there was a faint ghostly light over all save when the flares lit every-thing up in a white shimmering light & the ground could be seen to be all watery & shiny all of a sudden the strain was over, & so were we, I was the first one of my platoon (as I should be) to hop over & I gave a few more a helping hand for the sides of the trench were steep & slippery & off we rushed, as soon as we showed up the flares were sent up in batches which lit everything up like day, & showed us men falling everywhere & the boys struggling through the mud bogged nearly to the knees for the ground was as soft as a well fallowed paddock after a storm of rain, I was forcing my way through as fast as I could & calling for my men to keep up "& box on"
