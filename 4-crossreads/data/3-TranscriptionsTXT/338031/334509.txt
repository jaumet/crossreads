Orderly Room to be issued to us on the eve of departure.A few miles out from the camp we were inspected by the King beyond Fovant. His Majesty looked well. He glanced keenly up & down the lines & chatted pleasantly with the attending officer. He has that bagginess under the eyes which was such a pronounced characteristic of King Edward. Anyway we gave him three hearty cheers & he motored away. On the return to camp General Sir Newton Moore took the salute at a cross road corner. In appearance he looks like a fat publican out for a holiday.
