<p>front line trench, its most unatural the way you can walk about in full view of the Hun's trenches, &amp; only get shot at by an occasional sniper &amp; they seem to be very poor for nearly all their bullets go high, one shot at me 3 times this morning as I was going along the top having a look at the portion of trench I am taking over I have the worst part of the Coy.'s line, &amp; I have to patrol every few hours for there is a gap of 200 yards or so between us &amp;amp the next coy. &amp; the Germans could easily sneak between this gap, so to prevent it we send patrols out from dusk till dawn.</p>
<p>Right close to us is the village or rather what remains of it, of Guedecourt, &amp; though there is not a single soul in it, the Germans</p>
