There are lots of things that I would like to tell you, but I dont suppose that it would be advisable but one thing, "I think I may say without fear," I am glad that I failed to get into the Artillery, for several reasons. one of which is that I am too fond of horses, and just now they are having a rotten time up there, I pity them far more than I do the men. for they are in no way to blame for any part of this hell and they are there, doing their share, carrying food, material etc and following their masters, patiently and trustfully, with shells bursting round them everywhere. it is pitiful to see them struggling through the mud, but, Its no use thinking over these things we are away from them for awhile, and its as well to forget, as much as possible while we can. and the papers at home will give you as much, and more news than we can.
