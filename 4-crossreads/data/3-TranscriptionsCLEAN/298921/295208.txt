  
 August, 1915 Wednesday 25 Suppose I should write a lot but in bed I seem to fill the time sleeping & reading. Egyptians in Tarbushes (Fez) wait on the officers - Greasy soup, Macaroni stuff I feed the sparrows out of the window with it - Mine is an iron bed, but most of the soldiers are made of Palm Leaves - or rather the Ribs - Another Officer Capt Lawry 1st L.H. just arrived from Anzac wounded. We have made no progress over there - & losing men daily- I shall be longer in bed than I expected but have no pain - but I hate the Hospital with its smell of Chloroform & operations & dead men & crutches etc. etc; really tho' I am thankful to be spared.
