Along the main drive, which was a gravelled road in a perfect state of repair, trees of the Flowering Gum, a W.A. native that is without compeer among our Eucalypts for gorgeous flowers which are mainly red to scarlet &amp; crimson, &amp; have the typical eucalypt shape only the crown of stamens measures up to 1&frac34; inches in diameter, - have been planted on each side. They were about 10 to 20 ft high &amp; had been kept low &amp; bushy. At the time they were passed there prime, Xmas being the time when they are really rest, but there were plenty of them out to represent the shades &amp; to give some impression of what that Xmas scene must be, - simply gorgeous.</p>
