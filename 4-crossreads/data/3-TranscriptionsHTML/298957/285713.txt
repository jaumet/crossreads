<p>About mid-day on 23rd June, after throwing our kitbags and Egyptian uniforms down one of the holds, I disembarked in a party of 8 men with our officers baggage and marched up behind the waggon to the railway platform. Waited there till 5.30 pm and entrained with the remainder of our unit into a 3rd Class Carriage. The train had 45 carriages containing in all, about 2000 troops. 1st &amp; 2nd Class carriages were on the train but infantry were more fortunate than us in their accomodation, though we had nothing to complain of. Leaving Marseilles we travelled to the left up the mountain</p>
