<p>"Up till 9 a.m. that morning(a) he (Fritz) made three attempts to raid us.  He raided the Third Division and got there, and the 18th Battalion, came up to support them.  The 18th drove him back, attacking him in the rear.</p>
<p>"About 8 a.m. there was minnen-werfer fire on the 17th.</p>
<p>"At 9.30 a.m. a counter attack was stopped.  He went back up the hill.</p>
<p>"We could see him forming up, and we started to train our Lewis guns."</p>
<p>"We saw him coming down through the grass, and when he got near to the front line we stopped him."</p>
<p>"Three times he came from his own trenches, and hopped out, sending a raiding party first to see how things were."</p>
