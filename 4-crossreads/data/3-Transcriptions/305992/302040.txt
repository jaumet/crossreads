<p>Taranto<br/>hydroplanes &amp; airoplane bases. Also torpedoe firing practice &amp; heavy guns. Taranto being full of dreadnoughts, cruisers &amp; torpedoe boats, it being one of the strongholds of the Italian Navy. Here we met the H.M.T. Ormonde one of our former convoy which is loading troops &amp; foodstuffs for Egypt &amp; due to leave on the 24 or 25 inst. Also several French obsolete cruisers used as troopships conveying troops to &amp; from Salonika &amp; Corfu &amp; Greece.<br/>The British naval officer informs us that up to the present during this war they have had 700,000 troops through Taranto not including Italians &amp; have had not a single accident in the embarking &amp; disembarking. Considering the work is all done by lighters as there is not sufficient water for the transports to go alongside the wharves. This work of Allied troops &amp; cargo (war material is all done by the British naval authorities (which is a credit).<br/>We are expected to leave here in the course of 10 days full of cargo &amp; troops for Kantara, Suez Cannel, the main base for Palastine. Working cargo night &amp; day so expect to fill up. So many ships have been torpedoed amongst the cargo</p>
