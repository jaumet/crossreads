1916 December 13Wednesday
For a wonder no casualties brought down after last night. one man killed. We are to be relieved today. Relief comes in afternoon. Fritz gives us a few parting shells as a farewell. Back to Longueval without incident. Mud & more mud. Shiver & groan all night with the cold.Mary's Xmas parcel arrives & what a mine of wealth it contained. Sweets & dainties of all sorts. How welcome they are.
