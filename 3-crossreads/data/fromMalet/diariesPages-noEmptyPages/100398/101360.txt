It’s not bad at all especially after six weeks at sea. Last night I lay out & listened to the noise of the bush. Every sort of jabber imaginable until a couple of leopards started a sing song in the gully just behind us. The silence broken only by the hurried departure of various monkeys.
There are three dreaded man eaters on this mountain the mamba – a poisonous tree snake, very ferocious, the Cameroon Ape, a grey side whiskered party who is harmless enough by day but a terror by night & the black leopard. The latter are numerous & with the muskcat are the only dangerous felines nearer than Koro. Lincoln refloated.
2nd Returned to ship to remove baggage. M Gr’s commandeered to handle cargo. Ship leaking badly & no good as troopship. She is to run to Gib to repair & we know her no more.
3rd Finally abandon the Lincoln & returned to the Mountain. 
Used my nut this time & gave nigger 9d to carry my worldly goods.
