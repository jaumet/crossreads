Coblenz
With its legend of the enchanted maiden was worth seeing. At Coblenz we saw the junction of the Moselle and the Rhine. From here to Remagen it was very fine and then we came in sight of the Siebengebirge and the Drachenfels. Perched right on top of a high peak the Castle of Drachenfels looks worthy of its story of the dragon. Passed Godesberg and Bonnaud ran through the uninteresting level country up Cologne. Once here took leave of the Naval Officers booked up at the Officers Club went up to the Opera where we saw the heavy ?Orpheus" of van Gluck ? one long magnificent sorrowful lament. Dined at the Club went to bed at 11 very well tired with what has been a really wonderfully interesting day.
