<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I am rather behind in writing this time but I have been kept busy one way and another.  Since I last wrote I have received Anna's letter which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.<br/>I have now finished my training here and have now attained my chief objective: namely my brevet, &amp; incidentally my commission.  Of course it is all very well having the commission for I feel as though I have earned it, but I am genuinely proud of my "Wings."<br/>When I do find my commission a nuisance though is when I am out with Els; strolling along <strike>wh</strike> with her arm on mine &amp; meeting &amp; acknowledging soldiers salutes; for the British Tommy is religiously regimental.<br/>I have applied and have been accepted as a member of the R.A.C. of Great Britain (Royal Aero Club).  It is they who issue the Peace-time Aviator's certificate, which together with the Military Certificate are rather good assets.<br/>Exactly what is going to become of us I don't know at present but I believe we will have to sign on in the A.F.C for 3 years.  There is a wild rumour here that we will be home for Easter but I am very dubious about it myself.<br/>I have to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of &amp;pound10 that I cabled for about a month ago.  It was very acceptable just at the time although now I hope to keep strictly within my pay<br/>I am doing very little flying at present owing to the limited number of machines here at present.  I have been testing machines here lately as soon as they come out of the workshops.<br/>Sometimes it is ticklish work, but I make sure of my engine on the ground before taking off.  It is great experience because of the different types of machines one comes into contact with.<br/>The weather here has been very dud lately as far as flying goes; low mist on the ground till about 10 o'clock, &amp; then it comes up foggy about 3; it becomes dark soon after 4 now &amp; then a very long evening.<br/>Next time I write I hope to be able to send you my latest photo, taken in my Lieutenant's rig-out.<br/>I must close now, with love to you all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>J Leo L. Waterhouse.</p>
