 Rec. 17 Feb 
 France 16.12.16 Dear father, 
 We got orders last night to shift up &amp; join the battalion today, so our chances of being out of the trenches for Christmas are very remote. 
 The adjutant has just sent for me so I will have to go. 
 I saw Caesar in Wentworth hospital London before leaving, &amp; had a day in town with him.  He has a slight touch of pneumonia but is quite right again now. 
 Give Dorothy &amp; mother a kiss from me, &amp; tell them not to worry. 
 Your loving son Keith
