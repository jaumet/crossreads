<p>Friday morning met Jake in Victoria Street, on Tuesday morning, from hospital, he went out to the Pearsons, and arrived there an hour after Mrs. Pearson had died.  Spoke to him of Dorothy &ndash; and found he's in love with Phyllis, and waiting Mr. Pearson's return for his consent on their engagement:  Phyllis is 18.</p>
<p>Jake has changed in the two years and his old pagan expression has lost its rich beauty.  Perhaps Phyllis may change him again, yet it seems he's played rather too hardly since Wimeraux days, and his old beauty seems rather foreign to the Jake of Friday.  Phyllis remains his saving hope.</p>
<p>Utterly fed up with this dull backless note book, so start on one bought in Victoria St. on Friday.</p>
