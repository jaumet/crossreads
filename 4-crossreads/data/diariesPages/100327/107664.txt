Had to prolong the "stand to" until 0610 on account of bad light Dawn did not arrive until that time. Enquired into rays of light reported During night Abdul under fire put out about 60 yards wire entanglements Sent men down for 19 bags of mail and received some letters As the padre was at breakfast I conclude that today is a Sunday On to bully beef and biscuits again for some reason. Much better on two meals a day considering how little exercise we get. 
This morning the sea is idle and hardly a ripple. Searching with telescope notice large boom at Suvla Bay lying like a snake on the water. This is only visible under extremely calm conditions. The Bay still has the cargo vessels there and some warboats. Further inland of course the trenches of the second line of the English defences can be followed. The salt lake is dry, growing canvas camps on the hillsides and along the beach, and between Cathedral pinnacle and the Bay is pleasant countryside. 
Two big hospital boats fine vessels lying at anchor and the usual fleet of sweeps and destroyers also about. The cruiser anchored out of shell range and behind a quaint craft with a heavy gun for?d painted a peculiar colour that is very excellent disguise one old sailing store ship is also at rest. Much afraid the messed up delayed canteen trip to Imbros will never come off as we hear no more stores are there available. Rather disappointing after looking forward to it
