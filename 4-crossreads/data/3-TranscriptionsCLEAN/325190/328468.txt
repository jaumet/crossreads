  
 Monday 5 Nov 17 Were paid on Friday On Saturday at 11 AM Gray & I with Eva & another 3rd man known as Pinky, set out for the 3rd Fld Amb. at Boechepe near Poperinge. A slight halt for refreshments was made at Fletre, where we discussed the Italian question with some pessimistic Tommies, & a bright Belgian girl. At Mont de Cats we had a good dinner at a cottage in which were some refugees from Whytchaete.  This cottage was near the Monastery part of which is now a Canadian Casualty Clearing station.  One of the Belgian ladies contradicted the story of German atrocities at Mont de Cats, but did not satisfy me.
