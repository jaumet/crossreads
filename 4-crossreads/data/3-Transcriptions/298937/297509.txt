<p>Cont. from 1915 diary</p>
<p>New Years Day in hospital.  Both Xmas &amp; N.Y. were very enjoyable days in hospital.  Saw optician who advised me very strongly not to go to the front again, but saw also Capt. [indecipherable], &amp; after chat with him thought I would like to go to the boys again.  Told optician so &amp; he put no impediment in my way but told me I was unwise.<br/>Discharged from Hosp. to Base Camp at Giza on Sunday 2nd Jan.<br/>Met Land there the first night in peculiar circumstances.<br/>Had just settled down to sleep</p>
