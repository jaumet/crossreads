  
 April, 1915 Wednesday 14 Baedacker's Egypt gives a good history of this country which like Ireland has been a most distressful one. Promised 8 day trek tomorrow. Have been feeling off color, cold throat; etc. etc:- but do not want to miss that. Altogether the health of the men & horses has been very good - I am thinner but no worse for that.
