 I saw at Girvan Uncle James' place where you where you bogged in to the turnips.  They were all asking very kindly after you. 
 I have been down playing at the Sergeants' Mess twice this week and had a good time and hearing.  Our daily bread ration has been reduced from 13 to 11 loaves for 30 men, and we haven't had any jam for a week. 
 It's a job writing, for there's so much talking, and someone has just finished blowing the guts out of a mouth-organ.  I hope you are looking after home matters well, and assisting Mother in every possible manner.  Tell Cissie Kelly I will answer her note as soon as I can.  Her letter was good and quite amusing.  Well, Bess, ta ta for the present.  Remember me to all the boys and girls. 
 Fondest love, 
 James
