<p>"Das Seemanns Los" translated "asleep in the Deep". The lighting of the Pavillion consisted out of some Carbide Lamps, made by some of the internees. The necessary Carbide the "Band" used to buy, out of the funds wich got collected nightly around the Pavillion. The funds wher inaugurated to procure Instruments &amp; Music. The wher the foundation stone of our present "grand band". Those evenings I shall never forget: The australian clear evening sky with all Stars glimmering, looked like the prettiest carpet ever wowen. All around of us, as a silhuete, against the sky, wher the Scrub, wich we had not cleared get. The white tents of the Camp shinning like Ghost in the evenings. As says previously all internees wher to be found around the Pavillion during the Concert hours. Not a sound, bar those of the Music could be heard. Needless to say, at the end of each performance, our Band received such a healthy encore, as not a second one in the Colonies. For all Internees had their hearth &amp; soul in the Band. So weeks went by, untill the Military authority granted us a big tent during the ende of November 1914. These tent wher big anough to acomodate 100 Internees</p>
