reside? Where were you conceived, and when brought forth. Was it a brilliant creature with Red Tabs conceived you, or only a poor C.O.? Did the intellectual might of a Commander in Chief sicken and tremble in travail at your birth, or was it an S.M.O. an ADMS, or a D.D.M.S.? You gloriously beautiful creature of some exclusive conception and birth, mystical and elusive as you are you were certainly born to be great to be noble to be loved to be admired to lift us all up to the seventh heaven of political and social bliss, yet where are you to day. 
Strangled alas almost at your birth by irresponsible imbecility, and addle headed inane incompetence, we weep for you. Not the bitter lament of Royal David weeping for his beautiful Absolom can surpass our Cry of Soul travail, as we shed our tears for you, and cherish out tender thoughts, and lay our offerings at the feet of the "might have been". Interior Economy! A long and sad Farewell: You were lovely and pleasant in your short life, and though you have been fouley slain and done to death by blasphemous hands and trampled on by Sacriligeous feet, in all our best thoughts we will be with you Adieu
