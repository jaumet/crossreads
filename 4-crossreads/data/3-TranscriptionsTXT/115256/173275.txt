 Saturday 16 January 1915 
 Quite an ordinary, uneventful day with the single exception of one of those wild rumours of German warships being in close vicinity.  At any rate, our course from Colombo to Aden was suddenly changed to almost due north so that, for about 12 hours, we were steaming up the west coast of India.  Far in the distance, about forty miles away, the faint outline of what were apparently islands of the Lakadive, [also spelt Laccadive] could be seen.  But after 3 p.m., we again changed course, and the fleet is now steaming due west. 
 Received my Sydney papers to-day, and I cannot describe the pleasure with which I began to read them, from cover to cover.  As might be expected, war items formed the most part of the reading matter;  but that portion which interested me most, was the local news which brought me back into touch with dear old Sydney, and all its associations which are so dear to a Sydneyite.  I say a great deal when I declare that I appreciated my papers as much as my letters.
