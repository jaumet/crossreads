<p>Military Camp<br/>Dubbo.<br/>21.1.16</p>
<p>Dear Ida<br/>There isn't much fresh news to tell you but I am sending along a note to let you know I am well. I gota card from Percy this morning, he told me that Mr. Tom Roberts from Stove Creek had enlisted, that should shame some of the single men around that part. The dust is still very bad the show groun is cut up with the men continually marching about, and when it is windy the dust rises in clouds. Things have been a bit lively in camp for the last couple of days, The men were paid on Tuesday and of course got drunk and played up old Harry on Tuesday night. I think there were about 30 men arrested altogether, some of them were real devils and gave the picket a lot of trouble. I was sent out yesterday with a dozen men, we brought in 3 and it took us all our time to do it.</p>
