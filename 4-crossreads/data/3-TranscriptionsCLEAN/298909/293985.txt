 Went to first Mass at 5.30 am.   29th 30th & 31st marched out at 3.30 am for Moaske. Three Battallions of Tommys moved in about 10 am, our fellows gave them a bit of borax, such as - Have you got a Woodbine chum - Have you got a Piastre on you Chum. Had two good swims. Sent my camera although a bit knocked about, over to Frank, somebody must have pinched all my films, only had two films to send away. It looks as tho we will not move out till the 15th Battalion are ready. 
 29th  Monday 
 Rather hot & dusty. Men moving in & Australians moving out at all hours of the night & day. Packing & cleaning up all day - A big passenger Boat passed while having a swim, they said they had come from East Africa & Kindly threw us over some lovely Navel Oranges - I managed to get one & they were just a luxury. 
 30th  Tuesday 
 Hot & dusty - Marching out orders as far as we are concerned are postponed for a few days.
