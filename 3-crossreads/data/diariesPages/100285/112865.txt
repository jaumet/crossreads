Went over saw Len last night he tells me he is going to France at the end of the month.
This morning I got a letter from Horsferry Rd. advising me that they had received my medal that it would be presented to me at the earliest opportunity at a parade in England, I was beginning to wonder what had become of it, for I had heard nothing more since February when it came out in Battn. Orders was read out on parade at Meteren.
From what I can gather, I believe the 1st. Division has been badly cut up in the last advance round Libons.
23rd. Very cloudy it looks a lot like rain this morning quite a change to the hot weather of the last week or two I am not sorry for the change
