<p>Saturday 7th [September] 1918<br/>The great day for France comes yet once again &amp; this all news from the front is good.  Germans on the run &amp; our people winning everywhere.  No outing of any sort this day.  Interviewed Miss Gemmell 9 a.m. re 3 days leave, granted from 15th-18th inclusive &amp; with her opening remarks am simply "tongue banged" as usual, do I imagine she has nothing else to do but plan out our days off duty, etc.?  Verily a strange world this &amp; a very excitable woman at the head of affairs.  Some sisters from Salonika on their way home join us temporaly.  Wrote Miss Alderson re staying at Bulkeley.  24 pts. only in ward.</p>
