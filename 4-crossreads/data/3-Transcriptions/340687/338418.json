<p>April, 1917. Tuesday 24<br/>Lovely day small wind. Got up at 8 and after fixing pumped full and afterwards thoroughly cleaned cylinder and engine room and hut. Engine running very sweetly. In aftn. went to see 15TH F.A. [indecipherable] &amp; saw Paternoster. Smith gone on leave &amp; Close in 14th F.A. [indecipherable]. Went to an excellnt concert at 5 in YM.CA Scotts. Redoubt by 5th Division troop for [no] entrance. Very fine. After spent evening at Water point &amp; enjoyed tales of leave. Perisistent rumours of approaching peace and Austria said to have declared for peace unconditionally. Feel extremely light hearted and almost light headed.</p>
