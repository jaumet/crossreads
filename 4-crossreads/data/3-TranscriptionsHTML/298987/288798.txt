<p>&amp; our "buckshee" march. Passed through Felixcourt &amp; Doublins quite big places. The O.C was very full He managed to balance himself in front of our Co &amp; finding it was A &amp; the B was in front &amp; C co behind could not quite make out which way we were going. Had a rough cramped ride on the Busses untill about 2 AM then marched &amp; waited about eventually climbing 3 flights of stars to the garret of a very large building. Got a drink of tea &amp; turned in</p>
<p>Thursday 8th<br/>Found this morning we were in what has been a large Hospital on the outskirts of Amiens. Did not have to turn out untill 10 AM so had a much needed sleep. Washed shaved &amp; had a good meal. There is a clock tower just above our sleeping appartment  where one can get an excelent view of Amiens &amp; surroundings. Does not seem a very larg place or to be much</p>
