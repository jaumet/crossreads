<p>No barge came to take the luggage and it meant another sleep on the Beach. I waited up patiently to see if any orders might come through but nothing arrived &amp; I went to bed &ndash; Bed I call it.</p>
<p>Thursday 16th December<br/>I was up late &ndash; I saw no reason to get up early &amp; went along to the Engineers Store &amp; had breakfast with Olly G. It was cruel to see the waste of munitions &amp; clothes &amp; stores. It would make one shed tears &ndash; A few weeks ago we were on half rations now we can get almost anything. Everywhere goods can be got for the asking. The old 4.7 naval Gun which we had up by the right was blown up &ndash; Gun cotton is being placed in various places as mines. Ammunition is being dumped into the sea also</p>
