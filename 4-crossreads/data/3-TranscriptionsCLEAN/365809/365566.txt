seen a few theatres during the last fortnight. I somehow do not have the good fortune to run across many people whom I know, but I have luckily been in a mood for reading lately and also am trying to make an impression on or perhaps an incursion into the mysteries of Italian and Russian. The former is very materially assisted by a knowledge of Latin and French, but the latter is somewhat of a Herculian task and a knowledge of Greek only helps with the printed letters, and not, so far as I have yet discovered with the words or grammar. It seems a long cry hense to the time when I shall be able to study Russian literature which , according to Baring in his little book (Home University Library Series) is extremely interesting and worth the trouble of careful study.
Well I hope Keith will be with you for a very long time and will soon have totally recovered. I know how glad you all are to have him back; and he has certainly earned his rest as well as any one.Affectionate regards to you allYours very sincerelyL.R Whitfeld
