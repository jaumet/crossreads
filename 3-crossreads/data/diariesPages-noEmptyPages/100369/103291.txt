July 18th
Have, I fear, neglected my diary a great deal. I had intended keeping it most religiously during the trip, and am now a long way behind, so far, indeed that I wonder if I will be able to pick it up. After all, every day entries would, I fear become very monotonous, as the daily round on board ship is much the same.
The monotony of the ship, the lack of every day regular employment would at first sight seem conducive to effort in this direction, if only to fill in time, and yet such is the perversity of human nature, that the very unemployment which is so galling, seems to take away from one the desire to work, and the lazy feeling grows apace.
The journey to Colombo has been uneventful, as indeed, has been each day so far since leaving Australia. We have drifted into the tropics now and into tropical weather, and the troop decks are anything but pleasant places these times. Flying fish etc.

Was on deck this morning before the stars began to pale, watching the lights of Colombo in the distance, wondering just what kind of new world was to bring.
