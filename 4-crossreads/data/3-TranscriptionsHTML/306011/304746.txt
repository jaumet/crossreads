<p>Saturday 23rd June 1917<br/>Yesterday afternoon went with some patients to No 9 Brit. Cas Cl Stn, Aveluy in motor ambulances. Went through Bouzincourt to Aveluy then to Albert and back to Warley through Millencourt &amp; Henencourt.</p>
<p>Went for a stroll after tea to the next village (Vadencourt, 2.3 kiloms.) and then on to Contay (.8 kilom.). The road was very pretty being bordered with poppies &amp; cornflowers as well as little white, pink and red flowers. Contay is very picturesque little village in which a couple of battalions of Australians are billeted. The fields are full of rusty barb wire entanglements and gun pits have been dug at intervals along the roadside. I passed one trench in good condition with steps leading down to a large dugout.</p>
