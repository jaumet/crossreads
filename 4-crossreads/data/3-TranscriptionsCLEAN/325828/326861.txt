 My dearest Father, Things are very much as usual here to-night.  We have lost two more cases from pneumonia since I got back on Friday- one that went off quite unexpectedly early on Sunday morning, from total collapse & heart failure & the other one on Monday morning- a case that has been lingering on for days.  The one that went off on Sunday morning lived near Sydney, & as soon as he went our Sergeant sent a wire to his people but evidently on account of being Sunday they didn't receive the telegram for in the afternoon his two sisters came up to see him bringing jellies, custard etc, as they expected him to be convalescent for he was up for 3 or 4 hours the previous day.  As soon as the news was broken to them they both went into a deep fainting fit.- The 11th of 1st. F. Amb. instead of going on Final next Saturday as they expected, were rushed off yesterday on 4 days leave.  They are rushing the reinforcements off now, & the 11th are sailing on Saturday next by the P & O boat (Moldavia).  I tried hard to get a transfer into the 11th but there were no vacancies.  Must wait till our turn comes.  We (that is the 12th) are being sent away earlier than we thought, & we were told to report to the Orderly room today & we did so but were postponed for a few days.  Expect to get our Final next week but nothing definite through yet.  Will send you word as soon as I hear.-  An aeroplane flying N.E. passed over camp to-night at 9.15.  Had several lights on, & the roar of engines was distinctly heard.-  Weather been very windy up here last [continued on flap] few days.  Will try and take a run down on Saturday, but will have to return same night Very uncertain though as we are working shorthanded. Love from Leo.
