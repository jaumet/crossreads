queue at the R.T.O's office for nearly an hour in the stinging cold. How I did bless the R.T.O. & then when my pass was initialled I had the greatest difficulty in getting a board as the boat was crowded I pleaded that my stuff was on board & was let pass (the last one.). We drew out at 11-15, a convoy of 3 boats, escorted by destroyers. Except for being rather cold the passage across the Channel was uneventful & the sea was calm It took nearly 2 hours to cross & the trains were crowded I waited for the second train but could not get a seat in the Pullman car so had to fast from 8 till 5 oclockI stayed at the YMCA off hut at Victoria station
