<p>Gallipoli Penin<br/>25th June 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother<br/>I expect you will have been rather mystified by the hazy sort of communications I have been forwarding the last mail or so but I thought it safer not to say too much and run the risk of letters not reaching you.<br/>The newspapers I should think will be as full of news as to our progress here as will be allowed, so I will just give a brief outline of my own movements. Towards the end of April we left Alex and arrived here in time to see the landing of our forces both in the Southern sphere and where I now am. After hanging about on the transport for some weeks it was decided that the Unit I was with would not be immediately required so we were sent back to Alexandria and disembarked<br/>I</p>
