<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>It's just about time for another epistle to you, I am still keeping fit &amp; jogging on in the same old way.  We have been up to our neck in it for the last several months so that it is high time we had a spell right back.  Eccepting for the month we had in February we have been hard at it ever since we formed up, constantly in &amp; out &amp; nearly all my mates seem to get away sick or wounded &amp; now Ken has gone to England I am pretty well on my own</p>
