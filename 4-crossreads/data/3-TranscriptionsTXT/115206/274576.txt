 January 1918 Sunday 6 
 At Beitin Received a considerable amount of mail from Australia, via friend Broome. also two magazines and a pair of gloves from "Mum"- my Cornish friend. Ah! tis indeed a pleasure to receive letters from home and perhaps they make me just a little homesick &ndash; at times. Received several "snaps" from Les Fuller, and a fairly long letter from Roy who seems to be getting better.
