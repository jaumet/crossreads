 Monday 10 December 
 Muddy after yesterday's rain but the sun was shining all day, hence very considerable aerial activity.  Fritz attempted to bring down one of our balloons but the M.G. bullets from his plane didn't take effect.  The balloon men came down in paraschutes.  6 Gothas came over this afternoon &amp; dropped a few bombs.  This evening the sky is clear &amp; German machines are buzzing in the air.  Searchlights are hunting for them. My last run to Corps. Hd. Q. today.  Went as usual to A.D.M.S. at Dranoutre thence to Flete via Bailleul &amp; Meteren We move to Boulogne way in a few days time A Fritz balloon came over dropping newspapers to say how they have  won  the war.
