<p>2<br/>I make myself understood somehow or other by one &amp; another of the inhabitants here. Anna would revel in the chance I have of improving her  French.</p>
<p>I recd a telegram from Ol stating that she was leaving by the Medina on the 11th. I have no timetable of the mail boats here but I fancy she will be by now through the Gulf of Aden and on her way to Colombo. I would like to have her nearer to me but I really think it is best for her and you now for her to be home again.<br/>I met Les first about 10 days ago &amp; have seen him once since. He is well and quite happy in his work. I just missed Walker by exactly five minutes the other day.<br/>I am enclosing stamps from parcel wrappers. Those Kangaroo issue will be valuable some day I think owing to such a limited number being issued. I am sending to the paper a rough outline of Sunday work so I will not rewrite it all here. Work is different here and touches with the men for any real deep purpose are fragmentary.  Still I believe it all counts for something. All the same I shall be glad to settle down again at regular pastoral work. I write a good deal &amp; as Ol will give you all the news I won't repeat.<br/>Iwrote to her two days ago &amp; nothing has happened since then. I am quite well and  hope all   at Cairnleith are also. Love to all from the youngest in the family.<br/>Rid<br/>Glad to get letters from you at various times. I think all must have arrived by now.</p>
