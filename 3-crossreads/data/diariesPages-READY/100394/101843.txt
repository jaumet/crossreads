I was on F.O.O. again today and had a very quiet day. I picked and took a sack of pears up to the infantry headquarter’s men as they always treat us well when we go up. Sergeant Kennedy was hit by a machine gun bullet tonight at the Battery 3 inches from the spine so he was fairly lucky in some respects. Mail in today but none "pour moi".

I was down at waggon lines today and some of them reported having seen King George. Had a good feed of steak and fried onions there for dinner. We are going to try and send 3 at a time down for a week’s holiday. Called in at Engineers coming home to see Clive Elliott but he has been wounded by a bomb in the legs. Came back through Fleurbaix and had fried eggs and chipped potatoes On duty tonight so wrote home, and to Ada Jones from whom I had a pair of sox

Evidently our objective on this Sector when we advance will be Lille. At present I suppose we are about 5 miles from there and a fairly good ridge to cross in between which in my opinion will take some taking We are able to get papers delivered here every day published only the day before so we are just as well off as you all at home.
