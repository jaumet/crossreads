It was difficult to establish their identity, but one thing for sure was that behind that codename there was a team, a fast-acting, extremely talented team. Their statements and interviews always featured different names. <br />"

They knew what to aim for and they always hit their target. They bombarded mailing lists and got the media in a flap, like the Gauls among the Capitoline geese. They began with a series of thefts, and claimed responsibility for two colossal hoaxes, one attacking the art system, the other the Vatican. Their links with Luther Blissett, their accents and the geographic location of the Darko Maver project placed them in Italy, in Bologna to be precise, but their roots were as mobile as their cultural references, which ranged from the American pranksters to the Balkan avant-garde Neue Slowenische Kunst. In time the aura of mystery gradually lifted, not least thanks to the total transparency of later works, Life_Sharing (2000 – 2003) and Vopos (2002). Then they themselves decided to clear up the identity question once and for all, or rather, flesh out two of their many fictitious identities, presenting themselves as Eva and Franco Mattes.<br />"

Hell.com was a private platform for artistic experimentation, like an online workshop closed to the public. Entrance was invitation-only, on a private basis, or on rare public occasions, such as the exhibition Surface, which opened in February 1999 and was reserved to the community of Rhizome. Which 0100101110101101.ORG just happened to be members of. In June 1999 it was the turn of Art.Teleportacia, the newly opened web gallery belonging to Russian artist Olia Lialina; then in September Jodi.org, one of the acknowledged masterpieces of net.art, was cloned.<br />"

Having been invited to participate in the Korea Web Art Festival in Seoul, 0100101110101101.ORG uploaded its files on the show’s FTP server as requested, but the night before the opening the collective changed the names of all the directories, thus dissociating the names of the artists (linked from the homepage) from their works. <br />"

Between learned quotes from the holy scriptures, the Pope and other high prelates they appropriated pop songs, and exalted free love, \"brotherly intolerance\" between religions, the oblivion of the senses and \"international friendships\".

The latter, meanwhile, was in the form of a marketing campaign to promote a non-existent film. While in the first media impact was sought, and achieved, thanks also to the reaction from Nike (who reported the artists for breach of copyright), in the second this dimension disappears, so much so that the project was exhibited in galleries (first in Bologna then in New York), as a work substantially in line with the public performance. <br />"

In their works identity can be built from scratch using a few narrative stereotypes (artist maudit Darko Maver), or a corporate image (Nike, the Vatican) which is both highly distinctive and powerfully conditioning, to be subverted and rewritten. <br />"
