<p>for a first experience of battle, it was a pretty warm time &ndash; in fact I never thought to come out of that night alive &ndash; several of our company were wounded &amp; 2 I think killed. This was known as the 'night of the charge', &amp; the days following we were drafted <strike>into</strike> off into units different trenches in the firing line, &amp; a few more of our crowd were killed &amp;  several wounded, but really it is rather difficult now to remember what happened each day, the first was the most fierce fighting; since then an intermittent bombardment has been going on, occasionally a man near you is killed or wounded. Personally I have only been stunned by about 20 sand bags hitting me with much precision &amp; over the right eye to necessitating my going to the field dresser for a time. I turned out that it wasn't the sand bags fault, for they in their turn had been in collision with the deadly 75 &amp;  had in fact saved me from being shelled to smithereens &ndash; that little incident &amp; a bullet choosing a part of my cap for a target</p>
