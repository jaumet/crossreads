<p>got the baggage off &amp; moved to a prepared billett to rest. Throwing ourselves on the floor we tried to get some sleep but the intense cold defeated our object. By this time it was growing daylight so I decided to get up &amp; have a wash.</p>
<p>27.10.16  Friday</p>
<p>After washing in bitterly cold water I had a bit of breakfast &amp; took a walk round the village. One place of interest was the Cathedral Ancient writings on the wall showed it to have been started in the year 600 by a monk named Saint Ruquiet. It is a marvellous piece of archicteture &amp; the inside built on modern principles was wonderful to look at. I left this place at 10am per foot for Ailly a distance of 6 miles. Arrived there very tired &amp; commenced issuing. The rain again poured down &amp; I am now perfectly satisfied that fine weather is a thing of the past. My section is now quartered in a barn which although rough will be warm.</p>
<p>Ailly is an old place of a few thousand inhabitants and in the Department of the Somme, but a good way behind the  Line. Our future movements area unknown as yet, but it is presumed that we will rest for a while.</p>
<p>28.10.16  Saturday <br/> &amp; 29/10 16  Sunday<br/>Both days were mainly taken up in</p>
