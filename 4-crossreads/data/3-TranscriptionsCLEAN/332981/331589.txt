When I awoke I found that we were in the depot at Mons, as the engine tubes was leaking badly my relief driver could not go any further and had given up his train & brought the engine in for repairs.

Friday 24th. After breakfast it being a fine day although cold, all hands went into the town of Mons for a walk. This is another very large town and well populated and has its usual quota of soldiers moving about.
