Friday 11thFritz started shelling at 6 p.m. & kept it up until 6 a.m. on 12th, in all, a 12 hour bombardment.The Huns evidently intended making an attack but our division (5th) took the job out of their hands, hopped over the top at 4 a.m., succeeded after 3 attempts to take trenches & over 300 prisoners.  We stood by our gun all night despite the heavy shell fire & only I got a crack on my tin hat.
