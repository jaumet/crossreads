 Tuesday 17 October 1916 Another beautifully clear &amp; enjoyable morning with an overcast afternoon during which some rain fell. After breakfast went to the A.M.C. to try &amp; get relief for a neuralgic complaint that was worrying me &amp; by them was sent in to the English stationary hospital at St. Omer for examination &amp; preferred to come back to camp rather than go into hospital, which seemed a very nice place, situated in an old spacious building. Had some lunch in town &amp; then went inside the adjacent grand church in which were some 13th century statues &amp; an inscription on the wall stating that in 1553 Chas. XV had entered that particular portal. The stained glass windows were exquisite. Came out again in an ambulance &amp; lay down for the rest of the afternoon.
