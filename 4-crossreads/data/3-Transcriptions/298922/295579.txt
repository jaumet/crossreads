<p>Tuesday 25th September</p>
<p>Telephone &ndash; affords a lot of amusement when used by the Foreigners in the Hotel &ndash; they must gesticulate all the time, &amp; this is difficult with one hand engaged.</p>
<p>Today I'm told I'll get a boat on Thursday but I do not build on anything till I actually embark. Went to the sporting Club &amp; had Tea etc. The Greek &amp; Italian &amp; French women all dress very daintily but one should not see them eat. No mail from Australia for 6 weeks now.</p>
