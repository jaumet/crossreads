Monday 14 April 1919Rained all day. Went to Naps tomb but it was closed. Then to Panthion de la Geurre. Gee it is some picture. It represents the war from the frogs point of view. Had lunch at Poccardio & then as it was raining we went to a picture show for an hour. Went into Au Printemps huge shop & bought some face cream. Had tea at the Hotel & then got the train & arrived at Havre at 9.30 pm. Gee it was cold & windy. Got the train home & had supper & then to bed.
