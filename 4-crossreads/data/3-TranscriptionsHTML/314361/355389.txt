<p>Raineville Nov. 9th 16<br/>Left Ridemont yesterday midday, marched about four miles then boarded busses which took us about fifteen miles &amp; dropped about 1 &frac12; miles outside this one. Do not think much of this village, seems to be all barns, the houses are built behind the barns.<br/>As usual we had trouble over finding a billet, last night we found the one intended for us, but also found that A. Coy had jumped the claim, however we discovered another in a hay loft, we had all climbed up the ladder when Madame of the farmer came running out very excited trying to tell us that, that was not a billet &amp; that we could not sleep there. We took no notice, so she took the ladder away. After a while one of the sigs, climbed down &amp; found the billeting officer, explained the situation, &amp; found us another place, this time on the ground floor. We are about seven miles from Amiens, but we are not allowed to enter that town.<br/>Sunday Nov. 12 16 Raineville<br/>Still in billet, the rain has kept off these last few days, &amp; it is not quite so cold. Yesterday afternoon I had leave to visit Amiens.</p>
