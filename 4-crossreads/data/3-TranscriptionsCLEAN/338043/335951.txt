ful spot yet visited during two & a half years in France - and it has captivated me for all times - After our tour of the past month I now have visions of some future return to France  - One cannot realise it is the same country that contains the many old dirty villages where we have at times been billeted. -The Yanks - yesterday & todays have just been "brothers" to us all - They are indeed champions! - Splendid in every way -
