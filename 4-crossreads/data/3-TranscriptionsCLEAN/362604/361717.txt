  
 & as I eventually found out an A.M.C. man Himself, asked me if I knew a certain chap & it happens that He came away with our Unit.  I do not remember the officer but His name is Gibson & He lived in Lauderdale Avenue & is a Manly Chap.  It is just a wonder to meet these fellows & it makes one remember that He is still a bit of Australian Goods.  Well, Dad, Mum & George, I have not another scrap of news & I want to try & get a few other letters away also. 
 Kind Regards to all the neighbours, to Elsie & May Miles & the other younger one, Lily & Her Mother, Dobboes, Mrs. Stephen & Bunting. 
 Love to Bess & Etta Fond Love to you all, Harry.
