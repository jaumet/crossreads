<p>Dear Mrs Robertson</p>
<p>I thought that possibly you might like to know how things were in this part of the world so will give you some idea.  When I first came to this country in April the river Tigris was in flood &amp; the banks for miles round were covered with water.  It is as flat as a billiard table so the water spreads for 40-50 miles in parts.  Beautiful country if irrigated, all alluvial soil, &amp; would grow anything if irrigated.  Basra is surrounded by date palms &amp; it is topping to pick ripe dates off the trees, they melt in your mouth.  After you leave Basra you see no trees for 100 miles, then a few more at another town &amp; then no more right up to here, 10 miles from Kut.</p>
