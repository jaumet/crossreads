 time and be a very expensive process I had little doubt, but I thought 
 that a start had been made.&nbsp; I am forced to think now that I was a bit 
 premature in my hopes.&nbsp; Possibly our next Spring&#39;s offensive will mark 
 the beginning of the end and I am confident that this end will be brought 
 about not by shortage of money, food or munitions, but solely by wastage 
 of men until the enemy has insufficient soldiers to hold her fronts. 
 When that time comes she will sky the towel.&nbsp; Germany will never let 
 herself be driven back to the Rhine and so allow our big guns to get to 
 work on her towns.&nbsp; The end will come suddenly and with the line - at 
 least on the Western Front, and I am assuming that the battle fields on 
 this front will decide the future of Europe - very much where it stands

 and we are going to lose a lot in the killing.&nbsp; The next Allied push

 and have made the best use of it in a way that only feeble dishonesty 
 can deny.&nbsp; At every front is being felt the influence of the National 
 reorganisation of Germany under the master management of Hindenburg and 
 Ludendorff.&nbsp; Under them the army is working night and day with fresh 
 heart and everybody who has been on the Somme can give the lie direct 
 to the facile trash about the supposed demoralization and broken spirit 
 of the foe.&nbsp; Behind the army all Germany is working.&nbsp; In ruthless 
 fashion the population of the occupied territories of Belgium, France 
 Poland, Servia and (soon) Roumania are being driven into workshops or on 
 to the land partly to swell the output of munitions and partly to 
 release more Germans for Military service.&nbsp; Most important the military
