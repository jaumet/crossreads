<p>Tuesday, 2 January 1917</p>
<p>Big Khamsin last night &amp; sand dunes are formed &amp; others blown away.<br/>Some Scotchmen I knew in the King's own Scottish Borderers came over &amp; gave me a bottle of Whiskey for New Year celebrations. We sat on the edge of our bunkers and drank it with sand. Sand better than mud tho'.</p>
<p>[This paragraph crossed through.]  I note dear old Day is sending me new Bed Soks &ndash; I am still wearing the ones she made me last year, quite good. Big mail in &ndash; Letters from Mother, Joe &amp; Day., redirected from England &amp; also one to catch me here. Many people wrote, some sent Xmas cards!! a silly idea, to a man in the Desert in the Wet. I hope Mother you will go to Melbourne soon &amp; get out of the heat, with Day.</p>
