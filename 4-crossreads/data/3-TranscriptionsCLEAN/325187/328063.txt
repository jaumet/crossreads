  
 [Thursday 16 November 1916] 
  Goodbye to the great grey frowning turretted & crenellated fortress rock.   As the tugs whistled the echos sounded for minutes after & the French blue jackets stood at the salute - & cheered -  The Officers of the French submarine were most kind in showing me all over their boats & we drank "vive la France" & entente cordiale in French vermouth- I would like to describe the submarine but must not do so. Beautifully calm & sea a lovely blue-  We are again dressed up in our Lifebelts-  but one of H. M. Navy Torpedoe Boat Destroyers is acting as escort (so we are not worrying)
