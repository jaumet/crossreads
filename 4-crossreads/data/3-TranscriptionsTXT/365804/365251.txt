 My dear Judge I have your note of July 10th with the enclosures. I consider the photograph of Arthur quite a good one and, as you said, can share your pride in General Holmes letter as I do share your grief. I heard from my mother that you had been unwell. I hope the trip to Cairns did you good and that time , the great healer, and your great pride in the whole of Arthur's military work are helping to alleviate your great sorrow. 
 I lost, a few weeks ago, one of my very best friends, in France. He had been through most of Gallipoli and had written me several cheery letters from France where he went as a machine gunner in April. That all helps to make my position more unpleasant than ever. After doing ,my course in Kite Balloon observation and specialising in the telephone communication work connected with it, I have been put on the instructional staff of a new K.B. training school which we have formed at Lydd. We started on July 17, nearly two months ago and now with luck I may be relieved and get away to France about the beginning of November. We are I suppose doing good work here, but it is not the kind I want to do just now. There is no particular news. The position on all the fronts is very favorable but I do not think the end will come till next spring or summer. 
 Kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson and Dorothy 
 Yours most sincerely and affectionately L.O.E. Whitfeld
