<p>the bosch was driven back from the Somme front in July.<br/>The country is open undulating with villages &amp; pretty woods here &amp; there &amp; is very pleasant. We are a considerable distance behind the lines but the rumble of guns can be distinctly heard and that has been particularly noticeable today &amp; yesterday in the direction of Leus &amp; Arras I am fairly comfortable in a tin shanty the rain comes in &amp; flows in a stream across the mud floor but my bed is dry &amp; my batman has made things fairly decent for active service<br/>Today there was another Brigade parade &amp; though a bit cold it was a good parade Jessep gave the address a Standfast Hold the traditions of your Fathers etc I read the lesson It was too wintry for open service</p>
