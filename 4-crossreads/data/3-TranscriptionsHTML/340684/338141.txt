<p>463<br/>3<br/>live in Walton and another chap and I went to tea there last Sunday  - they have a lovely place and Mr Spofforth was delighted to meet Black and myself as we came from Sydney  - He is a fine looking man and as keen on cricket as ever. He was with the first Australian team that came to England &ndash; He afterwards played for England against Australia &ndash; Iredale was captain that year of the Australians and was a great friend of Spofforth &ndash; Iredale was bowled first ball in the first innings and he said to Spoffort he he wished he had been bowling instead of the man who bowled him &ndash; Spofforth said he might be in the second innings and when Iredale came in Spofforth was on to bowl and sang out now see what you can do Frank!  and bowled him middle stump first ball &ndash; Spofforth</p>
