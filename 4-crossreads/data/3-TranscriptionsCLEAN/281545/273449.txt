  
 me to finish, so I brought the engine in & put her away signing off at 1 am.   I was not required for duty again until Saturday at 2.30 Pm when I did a shift on the yard shunter until 10 Pm when I again signed off at 11 Pm & remained off duty until  today Tuesday April 30th when I signed on at 12.30 Pm on a Banking Engine & up to 4 Pm was not required so remained in the siding.   After a period of nearly three weeks of quietness, there being nothing of interest to report, as I had been dong Local Banking Work & had a good time, working 8 to 10 hours at a time, I now start to relate an another somewhat startling experience.   On Friday May 17th 1918, I was booked on a run to shunt the Balloon Siding near a village called Campain & left the Depot at 1.30 & arrived there at 2.30 Pm & as there were no work to do, we made ourselves comfortable in a shady spot as it was fairly warm.    At about 4 Pm we went over to see an Observation Balloon brought out of a Hanger, which is really a very high shed to be tested in the Air.   The O.C. went around examining the Balloon & then the boys in charge of the ropes allowed it to rise & the O.C. climbed into the Basket & the Balloon which was also attached to a cable on a Motor Car was let up  in the  higher & the O.C. was testing the rope gear, after satisfying himself all was correct the Balloon was returned to the hanger
