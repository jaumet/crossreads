 (Plogstreet Wood) 
 [16th May contd] me of Edward Ellis descriptions of Indian life &amp; warfare.  The wood was teeming with sandbag barricades breastworks miniature railways hutments covered with sandbags etc.  On arrival at Dead Horse Corner found it fairly well protected &ndash; not sufficiently well though.  It consisted of a half circular galvanized iron structure covered with 2 layers of sand bags.  Water procured from shell holes which are numerous.  Grave of unknown British soldier nearby.  This wood was captured by Glostershires in 1914. 
 On looking round I was surprised to see enemys front line just on the ridge in front of me seemly about 100 yds away but probably three times as far and the Germans were on the slopes on other side of ridge.  However we hadn't been there long with over came some Minnies and I clambered up on our dugout to see them burst &ndash; enormous explosions.  Some heavy 5.9s also came over so I sought refuge in the dugout.  Was kept awake at post by the bombardment we gave him but slept soundly afterwards. 
 Thursday 17th Raining constantly all morning but our guns worried him all day.
