 The notice winds up "Urgent cases only will be treated between these hours".  Despite this notice we generally have a few coming round at all hours more particularly at meal times, and unless the matter is really urgent or unless they are cooks we give them a warm reception. The cooks and men in the Quarter Master's Store are always privileged and treated with the greatest consideration. We were all innoculated against typhoid for the second time last Saturday and it makes one feel off colour for a couple of days. 
 I would be glad to receive a local paper now and again if you would post one - it doesn't matter if it is a couple of days old before posting as it will be very ancient by the time it reaches here and a few days more or less will make very little difference. With best love to all Your loving son, Eugene.
