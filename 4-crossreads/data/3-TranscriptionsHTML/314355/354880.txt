<p>July 4, 5<br/>A good play reviewed, "The Liberators" by Srguan Tucic, from The Shakespeare Head Press, 8/6.  Will write to Paris for it, Siegfried Sassoon's "Counter-Attack" circled in Heinemann's list 2/6.</p>
<p>George today, "The Oxford Book of English Verse" and in it are a number of William Blake's.  Just a glance through it, and I brought away,</p>

John Donne and Ben Johnson, Wordsworth and all the "Minors", Crashaw, Herrick, and Crabbe, and Alice Meynell and Davies, and de la Mare and Johnson and Middleton, all only just tasted, with Flecker and Stephens and Yeats and the minor Irishmen.</p>
<p>Looking forward greatly to Turner's "The Dark Fire" and [indecipherable] Cross's new book with Lindsay's Illustrations.</p>
<p>Basil ringing up tonight tells of Basil Mac being made L/Cpl. at the 2nd, must write and gratulate him, he's to be inundated with notes.</p>
