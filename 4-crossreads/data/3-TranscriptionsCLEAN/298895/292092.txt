  
 Thursday 26th July    As some dastard has stolen my new fountain pen I am forced to use the best available, an old broad nib.  Had a busy time packing up & completed the majority of it so that I could move into a smaller tent to carry on for the remaining days  Things going very smoothly as we had plenty of notice for the move.  Had a night with Capt. Mc.  Being rather lonely he often comes down for a yarn, this particular evening we made a late sitting with the help of some champayne.  One of our chaps down with Dipth. & I took a number of swabs from contacts. Friday 27th.. My partner home again after a splendid time in Paris, was quite envious after hearing an account of his doings.  More packing up during the day also some games at Badminton, my arm being almost better for the exercise.
