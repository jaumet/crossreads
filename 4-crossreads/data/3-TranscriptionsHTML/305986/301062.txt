<p>again today, but they were not too bad at all, all I did was walk about 100 yds and light a flare, which consisted of a sandbag rolled up and dipped in kerosene, it took a while to get the darn thing to light and the C.O. was swearing some but when she finally got going, a mighty cheer went up and I sat down and warmed my feet while the rest cantered over the snow. Got a parcel from Griff today, also a letter. 21.1.17 Sunday</p>
