 March 1917 17 continued   At about tea time, battery after battery of 18 pounder guns passed by us &amp; have established positions just in front of us near Rose Trench &amp; the infantry parties going into the line went down in large bodies instead of small parties of half a dozen or so &amp; better cheer was never seen amongst the lads since we have been on this front.   To-night is still quiet, but on the horizon towards the enemy, can be seen five enormous fires from the burning villages as left by the Germans.   The machine guns seem very active but shell fire is quiet in comparison to what it has been of late.
