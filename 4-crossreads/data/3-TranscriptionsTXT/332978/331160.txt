He is the only officer that I have been unable to trace, & the officer I have been longing to see - It is indeed a grand thing to have a talk of old times. He is one of the best subs I have has, & one whom we all adore. He was hit in the left leg, below the knee, the bone was broken but has set again. He has 3 lovely wounds at least 12 inches long -
