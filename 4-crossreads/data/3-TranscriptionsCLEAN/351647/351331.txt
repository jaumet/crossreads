Well anyhow I shall endeavour to be less frivolous.  We have had some gorgeous weather but alas it ended last night when we had rain & wind & cold.  Today has been very rough & it is still blowing.
I have acquired a rather comfy domicile & this afternoon I was reduced to impotent swears at hearing we were moving tout suite.  However we didn't thank heaven, moving this weather would be plain hell.  I have been looking for Duncan who is handy, he is in charge of a B.A.C. so is getting on.  We had a stunt today most successful, 'tis rumoured, but we won't know much about it until we get the daily papers day after tomorrow.  You'll really know as soon as I will, quaint thought & I'm up against it.  I can see the illuminations from here but we are quite blase these days.  The old 'bat' is handy & I go over often but so few of the old crowd
