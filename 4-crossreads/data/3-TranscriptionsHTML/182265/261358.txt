<p>Entry <u>21/8/17</u> - <u>2.30</u> pm&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Owl Trench - X or Reserve Line between Messines &amp; Gapard Farm. Arrived here last night about 9.30 from resting at Drouancourt near Belgian Border. Coming up we had hot cocoa &amp; milk at Bde Hqrs. Met Gen Brand here.</p>
<p>McKillop, Cleland, Westwood Merifield &amp; myself. Sniped at coming in but no casualties. Trench fairly dry, but sloppy in places.</p>
<p>In charge carrying parties last night carrying from Mule Dump to Reserve &amp; Front Lines beyond Gapaard&nbsp;Farm. A quiet night comparatively here but tremendous straffing on either side, especially North.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several aeroplanes overhead - our &amp; enemy. One enemy plane came repeatedly over us this morning - Very gamely indeed</p>
