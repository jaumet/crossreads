<p>Tuesday 11 December 1917</p>
<p><strike>Malta</strike> just heard that Jerusalem has been taken am sorry I was not there <strike>but perhaps it is just as well.</strike>  The real reason why we are delayed is "subs" outside. However at 4 p.m. we left with our usual escort after a week at Malta.</p>
<p>Last night a <strike>British W. Indies</strike> Boat was wrecked by the gale &amp; 30 lives lost &ndash; it is a game of hide &amp; seek to get away from Malta but we dodged the subs by going all round.</p>
