  
 in Egypt - 3 oclock would see me again  going into the sea. Afternoon tea at 5. Shop, stroll around or read until about 7.30 then another excellent meal at the Cafe du Nil - where they have a French chef -  &  so to bed generally not later than 10.That was my usual programme for the day - and very nice too. There seems to be a scheme for an attack on a large Turkish Outpost camp near El Arish shortly. A risky proceeding I think
