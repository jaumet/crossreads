<p>7-7-15<br/>This evening the enemy fired some more 11.2" shells blowing some of our trenches about badly &amp; burying a good many but as far as I know no one killed.</p>
<p>8th<br/>There was some heavy Artillery firing today chiefly from our guns &amp; the Monitor.  During the afternoon a rather amusing incident occured although it may easily have serious consequences.

Today we put a mine into the tunnel we lost to the Turks yesterday but again the Turk rushed across the open ground &amp; occupied the Crater.  While in this crater the Turks are safe from our fire while they command the tunnel whence as if our boys were to occupy it they would come directly under the Enemy's fire.  About 6.30 p.m. Cpl Gough was shot through the head just above our camp &amp; died almost instantly.</p>
