<p>to their homes in England on furlough. The interior of this building, which was very spacious, reminded me very much of a disturbed ant heap for every one was busy in different occupations such as rolling up &amp; stacking bed &amp; bedding, dressing, cleaning boots, washing &amp; making themselves as spick &amp; span as possible. After breakfast the troops were compelled to remain in the billet which was extremely monotonous &amp; trying for the was absolutely nothing to do, so the time dragged on until 9.30AM when orders were issued to prepare to move. The move took place half an hour later when the troops were marched down on to the wharf in fours where we had a further wait of about two hours. We were eventually put aboard the channel troopship "Victoria" and once all were aboard did not have long to wait for the ship soon steamed out of the harbour accompanied by six similar vessels with a big destroyer &amp; an airship as escort. Once outside the harbour the whole convoy put on full speed, it not being long before the shores of Frances began to grow dim in the distance; thus bidding adieu to the country, which all had cause to remember for a period, the length of which would only be known in the light of further events.<br/>  <u>England</u><br/>With France out of sight everybody on board was looking for their first glimpse of the coast of England &amp; when it appeared the excitement immediately became very intense. The Imperial troops aboard were indulged in talking about their homes &amp; people towards whom they were being hurried, on the other hand the Colonial Troops were discussing the Home land which to the most of them was the first sight of that great country which they had heard so much about from the time they had been able to understand its importance. As we approached the coast the convoy had entered in a race for the first ship to enter the harbour &amp; although we had been the last to leave Boulougne we now held the first place. After one hour &amp; twenty five minutes run our ship was tied up along side the wharf in Folkestone thus really seeing England for the first time in my life on the 9th of May 1917. It was great to know that I had arrived in a country which was so much like the Native Land for having lived so long under uncivilized conditions on one hand &amp; among people who did not speak your own tongue on the other made the place all the more acceptable. When the ship had tied up &amp; the gangways were swung the Australian troops were ordered aboard a waiting train on the wharf, occupying first class carriages. The train soon steamed out of Folkestone on that never to be forgotten trip, for being the first time in England the thoughts of it filled me to the brim with excitement for each fleeting mile brought something new &amp; interesting to the eye. After two &amp; a half hours ride the train pulled into Victoria Station London where we disentrained &amp; was lined up in fours being taken to A.I.F. Headquarters at Horseferry Road. Here our party was given a pay then told we could have leave until 2 P.M. the next day but at that time (2P.M. on 10.5.17) all were to be at Waterloo station to catch the 2.10PM train for Salisbury for the Training Battalion.</p>
