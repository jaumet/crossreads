fine today, put the morning in on Battalion drill, am going on Guard tonight.Got a letter today from Aunt Carrie the first one for a long time.Carswell & I have put most of the afternoon in printing & we have got some good results from a new mixture we are using.2nd. On Guard today but things are very quiet, with the exception of a madman whom I am looking after he is in the clink for his own safety, tomorrow they are sending him to an asylum. I have another peculiar case too an ex Sergt. he is a bad egg but has a good little wife, every day she comes & see's him. & the Sergt of the Guard lets them go into a little room for privacy's sake
