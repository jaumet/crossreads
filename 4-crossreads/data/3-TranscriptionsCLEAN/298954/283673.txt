There were three acts, the 1st, a hotel terrace, was exceptionally well staged.
The chorus, cadets in fawn sailor costumes with red collars & fluffy underthings made from Red Cross bandaging (Limb is a genius at devising costumes, to give the little bounder his due.), were smiling stiffly and even the premier danseur (a Scotch music 'all hartist) could not liven them up till after poor Harry (looking as presentable as possible in a an abortion of a red costume & toque to match) had done his poor best with "Don't say I ever made you love me", a touching thing in rag time.   The dressing room was a palpitating mass of grease paint, haggard dressers, & frantic stage "females" clawing at their clothes.
