 Last night Dr. Shahbender &amp; I had a very interesting discussion, lasting till far into the night, &amp; embracing Sociology, Ethics, Religion &amp; diseases. It was a perfect brain stimulant.

He had powerful friends in Bierut but powerful only on the Turkish side. Once he was invited to see the execution of a brigand.
