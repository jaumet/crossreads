The weather was quite beastly. In the morning with Audrey Sheila Craig walked (or rather slid) along the frozen icy roads and did some shopping round the town ? a typical Scotch dull grey and eminently respectable place. To Lady Mary's Walk a pleasant path beside a stony rushing stream. This in fine weather would be a lovely spot but now is bleak and cold. Still we very much enjoyed our walk. Afternoon we sat round the fire talking and some local people came in to tea. The Revd Hunter Smith was there and his curious wife. After dinner the happy circle again sat round and we talked on every subject imaginable. To get into a home like this with a motherly woman like Mrs Craig and dear honest girls like these is a very true joy. I did enjoy it so much and we talked on until late.
