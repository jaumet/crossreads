<p>1918<br/>26 Aug<br/>for the line going over the same ground past Morcourt. (I was heartily sick of the sight of it). We did not march on the E.W. road, - I think the idea was to leave it to the transport, but about 500 yards to the north of it through the ploughed land. it played up Old Harry with my feet, which were still tender underneath. We stopped about 5 pm at some old trenches past Morcourt about one kilo from Proyart which was straight ahead. I amused myself with the remains of an old French paper I found &ndash; "La Rire Rouge". At 9 pm when it was almost dark we moved through Proyart to a chalk pit. As events moved rather suddenly here, I am not too sure whether the pit was on the North or South side of the East West road. At all events it was near it. Battn HQ stayed in a wood close handy and we were met by guides who took D Company forward to some old French dugouts about half a kilo from Foucancourt. This place had been part of the old French trench system early in the war, and was scored by wide tranches, now</p>
