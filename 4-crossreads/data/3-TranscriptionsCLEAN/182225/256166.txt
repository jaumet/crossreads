"Forget It"
If you see a tall fellow ahead of a crowd
A leader of men marching fearless & proud
And you know of a tale whose mere telling aloud
Would cause his proud head ^to in anguish be bowed
Its a pretty good plan to forget it.
 
If you know of a thing that would darken the joy
Of a man or a woman, a girl or a boy
That will wipe out a smile or the least way annoy
A fellow or cause any gladness to cloy
Its a pretty good plan to forget it.
 
The easiest & best way to expand the chest is to have a large heart in it.
 
Success don't konsist in never makin' blunders, but in never making the same one twice. -
Josh Billings
