<p>this evening and to night.</p>
<p>Thursday May 17.1917<br/>A cloudy wet morning.  There is a decided change in the weather, &amp; it has all appearance of continuing showery for some time.<br/>There was some artillery activity last night on the right of Ploegsteert.<br/>The German Chancellor has delivered his speech in the R.  There is very little in it, but many high sounding words and phrases, and offers a separate peace to Russia on German terms couched in vague language.  He declares Germany's peace terms to France &amp; England remain the same as usual.</p>
