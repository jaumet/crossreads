28.6.17
Dear Mrs. Ferguson,
I have parcel containing this letter card.  Thank you so much.  The Butter Scotch was particularly welcome.
I got a letter from Keith dated 20.6.17.  He appeared to be doing well & had just been informed that he was labelled "Australia".  He was complaining I, of course, was delighted to hear it.  I should not think there was a ship strong enough to bring him away again once you get him well into your clutches.
I had a note from Blue Hunter from a hospital in Egypt.  I had hopes that he might put in an appearance at our field ambulance here.
Walter Macallum seems to be doing very good work on the staff.  I saw him tearing through the village here in a car a day or two ago, but could not speak to  him.
We are having quite a good time here & the best of health.
Best LoveAffectionately yoursC.R. Lucas
