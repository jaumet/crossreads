<p>February 1917<br/>Appreciating them.</p>
<p>Febry 7th<br/>Enemy planes bombed El Arish.</p>
<p>[Febry] 8th<br/>Marched out of Mazar at 9 am.  We did an easy march of 15 miles &amp; arrived at Bardawil at 4 pm, getting fresh water for our horses which they appreciated after poor well water at Mazar.  Bivouacked at Bardawil for the night &ndash; got a good rum issue.</p>
<p>Febry 9th<br/>Left Bardawil at 9.30 am &amp; travelled about 7 miles along the coast: passed the aerodrome.  Nearly any time there are 3 or 4 planes continually "up" &amp; the aerodrome is busy place  We reached Masaid, our destination, about 4 miles on the canal side of El Arish  Masaid is a large palm grove (Hod) of about 750 acres in extent, by far the largest palm grove I have seen on the desert.  There is beautiful water in the wells also fresh water laid on.  The New Zealanders, 3rd Light Horse Brigade &amp; Camelry are also camped here.  There are also canteens &amp; a big YMCA.  It gives promise of being the best camp we have been in this side of the canal.  The Anzac Mounted Division has been broken up &amp;</p>
