everyone having enjoyed the outing very much.

April 18th 19th Mond.

Went out shooting quail this afternoon along with D & S. We got the loan of two guns and cartridges from Abdul the restaurant keeper and in peace times, guide to tourists. He was a fine type of Arab, could speak several languages, and was very intelligent. Along with Mahammed who went with us to raise the game we wandered over Abduls crops. A few birds were raised but the excitement of the moment and the fact we had not handled a gun for a long time we aimed blindly, or the bird was out of range before we had time to fire. We had almost given up hope of bringing down any game when S. by a chance shot hit one a short distance away.

In our endeavour to secure the bind we wandered into somebody else’s ground and a native woman came out and shouted all sorts of things in her native tongue at us. Mohammed know what she said we did’nt, but one could gather from her gesticulations and excited manner that their was trouble brewing for us if we went much further. We got the bird and returned home.

The birds are very small and so that their would be enough for us all we decided that Abdul should provide us with two birds each, cook them, and we then had a delightful tea on quails very nicely done up.

We had our photos taken. The solitary
