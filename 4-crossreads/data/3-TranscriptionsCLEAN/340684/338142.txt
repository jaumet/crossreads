  
 465 4 Chuckles all over when he tells the story - His daughter who nurses here is a fine girl and very nearly the champion Lady tennis player of England - I called on a friend of the White Wallis' today a charming old spinster who fed me up and asked me to call again to be introduced to a niece - I got a letter from Aunt Maria today, she is going to be in London about the 17th so hope to see something of her. 
 I hope to have more interesting news next week - it is hard to find anything to write about while in hospital - my fondest love to the Mater, Billy and yourself. Hoping you are all well and cheerful Your affectionate son Gibson
