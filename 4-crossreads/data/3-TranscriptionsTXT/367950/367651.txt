survivors of both  crews please note the date! Will they ever forget it?Had to trace a map - a panorama sketch of the position at Romani have also been doing some other sketching work which I have not been able to complete before on account of being down at Zeitoun for 6 weeks and then a week at Port Said and then the  march out here.About 12 noon a Taube was sighted making for our position , We got the horses clear off the line and got away very prompt but there were too many guns sending shells after him and I think he was scared to come in any closer for  fear of meeting any of our own machines which may have been hovering about and so thinking discretion the better part of valour he turned and flew back towards El Arish. He dropped 4 bombs however on some of the troops who are holding the line away ahead of us, I do not know with what result. These Taube's don't like to meet our airmen up in the blue but if suddenly faced with that danger they are not averse to having a go for their money so to speak although they very often make off before danger threatens "We don't want to fight but by jingo if we do,sort of feeling. We were very glad to see him disappearing in the clouds
