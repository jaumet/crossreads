 this morn , you would be surpris at the amount of stuff the men are short of these "requisit " are divid into 3 distinct part viz . A.B.C. , the first coloumn A is for articl that never have been issu , the next , B. for articl that have been lost by shell fire or through action of the enemi , this coloumn practic cover all defici , it is a good loop hole for stuff that has been lost by them or thrown away owe to some of them be too lazi to carri the gear . I might say that near all shortag fall under this coloumn , otherwis they would be made to pay for the stuff the next coloumn C is for exchang , that is to say that whatev you have under this head , you have to put an articl in return , all old worn out dirti cloth equip etc are exchang for new stuff through the Quarter Master in this way , I do n't know what the troop would do if we did not go near the fire line sometim
