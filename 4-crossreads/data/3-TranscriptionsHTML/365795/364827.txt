<p>on the subject &#147;The Versailles Conference and the Peace Treaty" which was a much more topical subject then than It is to-day. Then in the following year LI eutenant&#151;Col oriel T.B.W. James joined the ranks of these visiting lecturers when, on 22 May 1926, he addressed the Staff Cadets on the subject "An Empire Strong Point". Mo record of this lecture has been found but it was probably a lecture on Gibraltar where the lecturer had recently served. This lecturer must have been a succcess for in the College year 1927-28 he was again invited to address the Staff Cadets and this time, on a date now unknown, his subject was &#147;Some Irnpresson of Two Years Attachment to the British Army."<br/>On the 21 July 1927 the 1st Coast Artillery Brigade, R.A.6.A was redesignated the 1st Heavy Brigade, R.A.G.A with location unchanged. It was later in that year, in November 1927, that I first met Tristram James. The occasion was my attendance at a course of instruction at George's Heights Barracks, Mosmen, N.S.W. This occasion was described in my article "The Royal Military College of Australia: Its Golden Jubilee" which was published in The United Service Quarterly. Sydney, dated October 1961.<br/>At this time in late 1927 at George's Heights Barracks, Tristram James' regimental officers included Major (later Brigadier) G.E. Manchester (1885- 1957), who served in the War of 1914-18 with the Australian Siege Artillery Brigade, and who later became the author of an unpublished manuscript of this war-time unit10; Major (later Brigadier R.M. "Wirigy" Thompson (1895-1967) who was widely known for his cheerful and friendly disposition and for his ability to make military training not only instructive but also entertaining; and Captain (later Brigidier) L.E.S. "Les" Barker (1895-1981) who was the Adjutant of the 1st Heavy Brigade, R.A.G.A. Ultimately, he bacame the Commander of Central Commnd with headquarters at Keswick Barracks, Adelaide, S.A.</p>
