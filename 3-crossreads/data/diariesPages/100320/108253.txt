A wet miserable day of drizzle. The 5th Bde marched out in it and looked very bad. Colonel Miles came around and mentioned points for us to avoid tomorrow. Went round to Matthews billet & had a yarn with him. The people were very agreeable and find it hard to realise that they are free. The woman of the house said they were down in the cellar when allied troops entered the village. She went up to get some water and saw an English soldier coming warily scouting along the street and realised that the Huns had gone for good. This morning in the streets there were many people returning to their houses pushing along little hand carts holding all their poor belongings – a few mattresses, blankets & chairs.
