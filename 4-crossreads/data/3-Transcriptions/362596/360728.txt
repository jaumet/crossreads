<p>night to sleep as their tents were flooded but one will have to get used to being in trenches and being flooded out and the bullets singing round, it will be a bit of a change. It is a great pity that the Riverina is not getting a share of these rains but still it could rain there before you get this. I am glad you have so much work on hand, as I think you are lucky considering the bad season and the War together and I hope you are kept going as there is time yet for worse times.<br/>Well Tom the night is creeping on and I have only got a few minutes to go and make my bed and if I am not pretty quick I will have to turn in in the dark as if one lights a candle after 10.15 he will be put in the Guards tent and I think it is flooded tonight and then be fined a dollar in the morning is not too nice.<br/>So hoping this scrawl finds you all enjoying the best of health as the departure of this leaves Billy and I.</p>
