<p>village station of Candas in the Dept. of Somme. Marching about eight miles we reached the reserve billets at Domart-en-Ponthieu a little village nestling in a most beautiful little valley. Small copses of larch, beech  &amp;  spruce in full leaf were scattered over the gently sloping hillsides down which the road with its avenue of line trees twined. Fields of wheat  &amp;  oats interspersed with blaze's of poppies rose in terraces from the clear brook which ran through the valley.</p>
<p>Domart-en-Ponthieu is a rather ancient village with a queer church commanding a view of the valley perched on the hill-side. This edifice is some 900 years old,  &amp;  of an architecture quite unique though it probably is of the Roman type.</p>
<p>Leaving Domart at 9 oclock12th July we marched some 7 miles southward</p>
