 Now John, do be faithful to us, why are you keeping back such a lot &ndash; tell us what you had told to Doug, that 'he quietly left the table &ndash; and remained away a quarter of an hour &ndash; in his office, quite alone'.  And, you 'were alone with him for some time before lunch', and you tell us 'we understand each other'. 
 JOHN!  DID HE TELL YOU? Why must you " not  tell us", "the date at which, and the circumstances in which, in the opinion of Sir Douglas Haig, the war will end" &ndash; and did he really pass around the vegetables just like any footman or waiter:"?  How sweet of him!....  What a day you had John, lunching at Headquarters, and a day in the Trenches. 
 "Ah! but it was worth while" you say, "to have seen the boys fighting:  to have sat with them, and shared their steak and chips in the dug-outs".

 71. A rainy cold dull day&hellip; and a heavy bombardment this morning and now.. the Boche has hardly counterattacked.. No word of its effects yet here. 
 72.  October 20 This morning early a long and terrible bombardment.. shells going over us to Poperinghe&hellip; and a raid somewhere near Pop. that dropped bombs of some terrible size. 
 The morning fatigue again to horse lines, and an early finish.  Then with Ridge to Y.M.C.A. Hut, a letter written to Bet, dated yesterday, &amp; tea and biscuits.  Back to huts, the section had been paid..Dinner&hellip;  Paid then with the Transport:  drew 40 F. &ndash; which will make me overdrawn at the end of the month, and posted to T.B.C. 30 F. &ndash; and reminded them of "Certain Noh Plays of Japan".
