1917 Sunday 25 March
A beautiful bright sunny day. Such a welcome change to the cold bleak ones we've had. One could almost imagine himself back in dear old sunny N.S.W. Tiny finches are appearing in the brakes hedges chirping of the advent of Spring the sky-larks are actually carolling high up out of sight in the clear air of the morning as I write. Is the grim struggle going on in all its intensity but a few miles away? Yes! one can hear the dull boom of guns, that can only bear one interpretation, the tireless air scouts are buzzing overhead in their bright aluminium cages. 
Purposed visiting Tony this afternoon but find it is pay day also there is to be a memorial service in memory of poor Bill Parsons tonight.
