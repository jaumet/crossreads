Via Arques, & over the Ranges through Devores & Samer. This was the best road of the lot for sight seeing. We made a good run to Lumbres passing through Arques, Blendeques, Wizernes to Lumbres over fairly level Country but after passing Lumbres one begins to climb the Hills up through Neilles to Lottingham, the Line winds around a number of Hills & away down in the Valley & up over other hilly country the Panorama View was magnificient, everywhere as far as the eye could see was land under cultivation, beautiful crops of Waving Corn glittering in the Sunlight, Plots of all kinds of vegetables & here & there could be seen Dark moving objects being Peasants busy in the fields, it is marvellous the amount of ground these people manage to attend to with their old fashioned implements of Agriculture, here & there could be seen Old Men cutting Oats & women following them up stacking them & so on, We still continued to climb until Deveres was reached which is the top of the Hills & then we started to go down hill passing through Samer where
