<p>the day will come &amp; the Huns will get their deserts. What Military achievement is gained by these dastardly actions, it is cold blooded murder.</p>
<p>Sunday 12th November 1916.<br/>No rest for the weary 8th Field Ambulance. Bearers paraded 9 o'clock, more fatigues. Communion Service conducted by Chaplain Ward &amp; Beverage. I have attended quite a number of these services since landing in France. I like them extremely. Prayers are always given for our loves ones at home. I naturally thought that we would have the rest of the day off, but it was not the case more work after church &amp; another parade at 1:30 p.m.  This is called a rest after having a very strenuous time in the trenches. Believe we will shortly be back there again a few days time.</p>
<p>Monday 13th November 16.<br/>On Ward duty, 12 months since I was on nursing duties, the last time was on board the Beltana. 42 patients in ward, the rush of wounded so heavy that a great number of the sick fellows are neglected. However I put all my patients in a good humour.</p>
<p>Wednesday 15th November 16.<br/>Startling news today, the weary 8th Bearers proceeded in the direction of the Straffe again. It was a bitterly cold day &amp; we all felt rather miserable. At 5 p.m. we arrive at our destination, &amp; start work immediately &amp; unload the Red Cross Cars, &amp; put the patients into the train. A good job better</p>
