no casualties occurred. We all thank God that this was so.  Reached No 4 Post about5 p.m. & immediately started to make the dug-outs comfortable as this will be our home for at least 5 days. We had ten squads (stretcher squad 4 men) altogether & of course my usual luck if any drawing is to be done, I drew No 1 squad. This means that we ill be the first squad out. Tom Ross, Will Macdonald, George Simister, &  myself made up the first squad. About 1 a.m. the first stretcher case came along & of course we had to turn out   "My word it was cold", & it was very hard carrying along the slippery duck boards, we fell over numerous times.
January 25th.
The Kaiser's birthday, our batteries kept up a continual bombardment just a small birthday present for old Bill. A very quiet day not one squad being called out. But the cold weather it was severe. It is stated in the paper I believe, that the temperature is 13" of frost. The severest frost they have had in France for the last 20 years.
