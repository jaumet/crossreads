 Prison Life At St . Stefano . by A.E. Nichol who put in near two year there until be releas in Nov 1918 . St Stefano taken on the whole was about the best prison camp in Turkey , although it , too , had a good mani hard time , but situat within easi distanc of Constantinopl , and surround as we were by mani good friend , who could convey news of our treatment to the Dutch Embassi , we usual manag to get a consider amount of freedom , but still , I must start from the begin , and give as near as possibl a true account of the do of prison and their guardian whilst there . About the first week in Januari 1917 news came through to Afion-Kara-Hissar where I was then intern that a number of prison were to be transfer to Constantinopl to work for the govern . I was suffer from fever and dysenteri at the time , but determin , if possibl to get away with the parti , as the prison were die at the rate of two or three a day with fever ; I manag to get my name on the list , but had littl chanc of get away , owe to ill . Howev , I manag to secur a larg raw opium pill , which I swallow a few minut previous to the doctor inspect , and so manag to get away . It was veri cold and miser when we set out for the railway station , but our miseri were doubl after we arriv there . We were pack like cattl into good truck without sleep accommod , and no sanitari arrang whatev . The journey from Afion-Kara-Hissar to Constantinopl occupi three day , and I do not think one of us felt our toe for the whole of that period . The cold was intens , and mani of the men suffer untold agoni from the effect of it , but all journey must come to an end some day , and we eventu arriv at Hydaaidar Pasaha station .
