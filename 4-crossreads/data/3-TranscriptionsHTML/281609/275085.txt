<p>a great pest and combined with the intense heat our lives are not to be envied.<br/>April 3rd Marched around to 13th Bde but were informed that no transport men were needed so we accordingly marched back and adjourned to a big Square Sap, where we built ourselves a "home". Several photos were taken, with a sign board up to the effect, "Homeless but happy," and though we were happy, we cursed everyone who had anything to do with the reorganisation of the Army &ndash; Div Head Quarters term us "the 36 men living in a hole".<br/>11th At 7 am we reported to the adjutant of the 4th Pioneer Battalion and were taken on the strength as Drivers. There was no N.C.O. in charge of us, so I was put in charge and made acting Cpl. I don't know how long this will last however.<br/>12th Very windy &amp; dusty. Tents &amp; mess</p>
