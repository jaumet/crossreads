Took wagons around to the Billet & reloaded tools etc returning to the yard when completed. 15th July Misty & cool. No move yet. At 4 pm the Colonel called a parade and spoke of the unruly way in which the battalion behaved last night. He stated that they were a disgrace to the Division and that the inhabitants of this little village had already summed them up as "a lot of beastly drunkards." He was right.
