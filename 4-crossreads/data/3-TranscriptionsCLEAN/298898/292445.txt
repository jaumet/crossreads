  
 but now frozen hard enough to make an ointment with. 
 Friday 26th Jan Still busy arranging dispensary making stuff & issuing drugs to battalions etc. Whale oil ointment turning out well & have to make more as supplies have not yet come to hand. Still very cold, snow everywhere several accidents from fellows playing on the ice. Bombardment very heavy & has lasted for some days. 
 Saturday 27th Jan. Saw Morris today with one star up. He was on his way to 'Amiens' but I could not manage to go with him. Guess he will do well as an officer. Work a little easier today but supplies still not to hand. Cold as ever, 20 &percent; of frost being registered. The cold snap also covers England from what the papers say. Aerial activity today & a taube came down nearby.
