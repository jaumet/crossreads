<p>Saturday 23 March<br/>On fatigue work building dugouts at Spoil bank, on the Ypres-Comines canal.  Everything very quiet, except that Fritz shelled St. Eloi. Glorious spring day.  Rumours still rife as to German offensive.  No reliable information.</p>
<p>Sunday 24 March<br/>Beautiful day.<br/>The Ludinoff Offensive has developed &amp; rumour has it that he has advanced to a depth of two to fourteen miles into the Somme area attacking from Arras to La Fere, against the English &amp; French. Apparently some Australians are going down &amp; to-day we are preparing to take over more front to the right of our last sector, relieving the 5th Div. We moved to a place on the Wycheate-Kemmel road &amp; to-morrow we go up to the line on our new sector just to North of Messines.</p>
