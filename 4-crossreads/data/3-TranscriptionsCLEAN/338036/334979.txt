It was one of the most evenly contested games I have seen - the Fifths forwards being particularly heavy fast & strong.  Our backs played well also the forwards with one or two exceptions.  In the backs Wagstaff played safe at full back.  Swinnerton Brown Burdon Williams all distinguished themselves whilst Zocchi mc Bean Campbell Astbury were pick of forwards.
