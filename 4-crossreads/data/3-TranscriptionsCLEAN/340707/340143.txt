17a very good seat compartment all to myself & stretch out. A sleeper would have cost me 25 fr. & this is as good, I spend all the night travelling
8-6-19Arrived in Paris Gare du Nord & set out for Hotel Windsor & have a bath & breakfast - meet Miss Andrews from Leura & Miss Wilson who is in charge
I take room & go for a walk down city to fill in time as I have made arrangements to go with this party to on the river up as far as the Maine to down as far as St Cloud. The river is not pretty being spurned by numerous bridges & lined on the bank by historic buildings. However near St Cloud its forest clad hill in which scarcely a house can be see is beautiful.
We land at St Cloud & take refreshment, & then return to Hotel where after dinner I help Miss Wilson to make Orangeade.
9-6-19I get up too late to have breakfast - & all the ringing in the world seems unable to rouse the girl so I miss my bath. I report in accordance with my orders & find no one there as this is Whitsunday
