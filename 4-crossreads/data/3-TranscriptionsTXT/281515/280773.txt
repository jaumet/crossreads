Oct 2ndstill at Rabaul although we have nothing to do with the Garrison, as we are quite a separate lot called the Flying Column guards & Parades are the order of the day now, we Parade from 7.30 am until 9.30 & from 4 until 5 pm in the afternoon  the weather here is Hot & sultry & plenty of mosquitoes at night time, it is a good job we have mosquito curtains along with us.
Oct 3rdThings are quiet now, some of the boys are getting up a concert, we are close to the sea here & have 2 dips a day several of the men have cut feet through broken glass being thrown just at the place where we go in, Germans are blamed for the dirty work  they have to be in their own houses at 6.30 pm each evening, they seem very sullen & scowl at you when they pass, they have to report to the Provost Marshall every day & are well watched
Oct 4Went to a native village called Matupi about 3 miles from here it is an Island at high tide, the place where you cross is about up to ones knees at high tide but dries up at low tide  very interesting to see the natives at home  good place for swimming but very deep about a yard out you can't get bottom
