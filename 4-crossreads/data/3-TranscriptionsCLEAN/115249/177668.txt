      (5-40pm)
With reference to signal of 6.45 from Commander Beresford. I suppose you are dealing with the matter as I am not doing so. I do not understand why party at W/T Station have been delayed so long or the reference to motor lorry; do you? A guard has been posted at the pier head; please relieve it as soon as convenient.
