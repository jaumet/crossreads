  
 We then walked & inspected a very fine coco nut palm grove & then to a Japanese ship building yard on a small scale  -  I gathered a few plants by the way side but its too dry for anything to thrive  -  A little Japanese lady - very finely Kimonoed gave us a gracious bow  -  Then we came off to our ship  -  A guest at dinner nicknamed 'the Admiral' - told us a good deal about the island & island life  -  Tales of plantation life - gold mining on New Guinea. The gold mining on Woodlark island & the main land of N Guinea is all alluvial  -  Not a single quartz reef has been found on N.G.  -  However N.G.  is not yet fully known - mining is a pure gamble  -  You get niggers  -  Pay them 6 per annum  -  Feed them & they do as you say  -  Your claim under a miners right is 100 x 50  yards  I take it  -  This doesn't seem to me very much  -  A plantation of coco nuts pays well but you want 5-7 years before its in full going order  -  It seems this is valuable property & very very hard to buy  -  100 acres will return anything up to 800 per annum  -
