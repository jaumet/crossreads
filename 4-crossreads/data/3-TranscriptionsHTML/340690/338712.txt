<p>Out at 9 and parties late as usual.  Two parties went ahead with wrong men as we found afterwards.  Heavy shelling started on right as centre but a lot of shells fell on our support line and near estaminet and battalion.  Robb told us to meet our party who were waiting at Estaminet &amp; Sidman to meet his waiting near Linton's job but he refused to take party through barrage.  I went out to Estaminet with Sparks &amp; Robb &amp; though no shells fell near plenty of splinters.  Party disappeared but found officer on Linton's 12th Battn. job so waited until all was quiet &amp; then on to job.  Rest of evening quiet usual few shells &amp; M.G.  Party very slow working and kept them going till 1.45 and job fairly respectably done.  Home quietly to bed.  Fine.</p>

All available men on A.M.C. job &amp; Battn. headquarters' job and all to work to complete before day after to-morrow evening ready for stunt.  Battalions very weary.  To work from 10 to 3.

Saw Major of R.A.P. who told us he had been shelled out of estaminet possy by 8" shells so we told Major &amp; he went back to R.A.P. to investigate 8" shells still dropping near estaminet and we waited in trench.
