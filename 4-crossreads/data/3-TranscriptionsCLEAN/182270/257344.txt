 SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1919. 
 Fine, but cold with an odd 
 snowflake dropping now & 
 then. Went out to the Bank 
 in the morning. Alan came 
 down & we both had lunch 
 with Jack Bridges at the Bath 
 club. Went to "Oh Joy" at the 
 Kingsway theatre after & it 
 was the best show I have 
 seen over this side. I enjoyed 
 every minute of it.
