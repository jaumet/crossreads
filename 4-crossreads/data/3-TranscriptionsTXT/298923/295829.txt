12 June 1918 Wednesday (X to X crossed out)Like much Trench life, the front line is the Easiest on the men when not fighting but anyone in responsible positions has a good deal of worry.  However alls well-X Just posted you some of Dolly & her Mothers letters as I know will interest you X-  Jacko is using a new shell to try & reach us - bursts in the air & then on reaching ground bursts again- so getting behind our Rocks but "Malesh" as Gyppy says, he is doing no harm-  Very hot about 115 in shade.
