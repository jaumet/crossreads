<p>Thursday 22 June 1916<br/>A simply glorious day, clear &amp; sunny with a slight breeze from the enemy lines. In the early morning an enemy "plane" flew very low over our lines but made off on the approach of one of our machines. The morning was very quiet but in the afternoon a fairly heavy artillery duel took place. After it had died away the scene was so lovely &amp; so still that it was well-nigh impossible to imagine that the war was really going on. Enjoyed an open-air bath in my half biscuit tin. Aust'n. mail of 30 Apl. received.</p>
