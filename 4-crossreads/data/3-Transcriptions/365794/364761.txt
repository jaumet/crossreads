Watson (on duty once again poor girl).<br/>Very cold day &amp; fine dust or mist in the air giveing a gray hazy appearance even as short a distance as the tents.<br/>Regret not having sent a cable home but what could one say?, for 1918 shall send one.<br/>Quiet in Connaught, 38 pts.  All well save Adams, N.Z., shot in chest &amp; lung.  R. Op. 30.32, T.103 etc., P.120 &amp; cond. not improving.<br/>No fighting up the line for some days so convoys are less heavy.<br/>No home letters since the first batch.</p>
