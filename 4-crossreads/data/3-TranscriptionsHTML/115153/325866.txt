<p>The pilot exclaimed in good English that the gunners were good shots, and that he regretted he did not get back to his aerodrome to advise them that we were concentrating in front of Bullecourt with the intention of pushing them      ( the Germans) out of the village.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 3rd 1917 at 1o'clock we were warned to be in readiness to move out into no-man's land, at a few minutes' notice to take up our pre-planned positions. In the meantime we were issued with extra sand-bags, bombs, cartridges, and rations.<br/> At 2o'clock we moved out into no-man's land and arranged ourselves quietly  into 8 successive rows, one behind the other. Everything was well until a few stray shells dropped between us and a few were wounded and cried out in pain, when the Germans got to know what was going on. If the Germans did not know what was doing, they had a good idea, for the artillery woke up to the occasion and bombarded our section intensely, with the result that many more were wounded and killed, and we got partially disorganised owing to the necessity of our getting into shell-holes where we could, to provide cover to a small degree. We waited in anxiety in this place for nearly two hours until it was 3-45a.m. when we went "over the top"</p>
<p>We went "over the top" and the consequences were more than awful. After scrambling over a railway embankment which was kept constantly razed by machine guns on the German side, and where scores of men were shot in the attempt to get over the embankment, we reached a thick belt of barbed wire entanglements which were anything from 50 yards to 100 deep in places. The artillery had played on these entanglements for days before the stunt and even then there were thick patches left which were so dense that they could not possibly be penetrated. With the occasional bursts of lights from the flares and shrapnel overhead, we could take a momentary glance at the dense barrier in front, and in places we could hear the moans of the dying and perhaps the screaming and crying of the wounded, who were at the mercy of the German machine guns that were playing thickly into the wire. I was very fortunate in this case, I struck a fair track through the entanglements and emerged to the further side with not even a scratch on my legs. It was only a matter of a few dozen yards and we were on the</p>
