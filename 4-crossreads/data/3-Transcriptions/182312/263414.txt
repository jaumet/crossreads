<p>wayside stations, particularly the larger towns like Orange, Valence</p>
<p>etc.&nbsp; where girls sprang up from nowhere with baskets of oranges,</p>
<p>cakes, sweets etc.&nbsp; French soldiers are everywhere.&nbsp; Down in the</p>
<p>South they are mainly on guard duty and are dressed just like the</p>
<p>French soldiers we see in&nbsp; the old Comic Operas - bright red trouser</p>
<p>very loose and tucked into their boots, blue coats and a blue cap</p>
<p>with a red band.&nbsp; The fighting French soldier is dressed in a sky</p>
<p>blue uniform which is certainly an improvement on the old Comic</p>
<p>Opera affair but is still very conspicuous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way the French</p>
<p>railway people handle the traffic is an eye-opener.&nbsp; The Railways</p>
<p>are privately owned but at present of course, are under national</p>
<p>control.&nbsp; All the Companies interchange their rolling stock so that</p>
<p>no delays occur in changing over from one Company&#39;s Lines to another</p>
<p>Our journey was 650 miles and with the train of 350 yards they did</p>
<p>the journey in 48 hours which for a troop train is very good travel-</p>
<p>ling.&nbsp; They use the lines to the utmost; ahead of us was always a</p>
<p>train 2 miles away and the same astern, and yet with all this traffic</p>
<p>we were never blocked for longer than a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Their</p>
<p>expresses fly, everything gets out of their way.&nbsp; We passed through</p>
<p>Lyon, Dijon, Tonnerre, and other big places south of Paris, but</p>
<p>Paris itself was not touched at, the train making a detour which took</p>
<p>us round the outskirts of the city.&nbsp; North of Paris we began to see</p>
<p>places which came under our notice during the Germans dash on Paris</p>
<p>back in August 1914, St. Denis, Beauwaix, also Amiens, Abbeville, etc</p>
<p>We crossed the Seine, the Marne, the Oise, the Somme rivers whose</p>
<p>names we laboriously learnt in our school days, little dreaming that</p>
