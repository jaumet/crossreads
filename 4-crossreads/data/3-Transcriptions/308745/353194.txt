<p>on, almost immediately after, he was hit by a heavy bullet in downward direction &ndash; alas! a mortal wound &ndash; as Bryan would be bending forward, and from what his orderly told me, I am confident that a native did not cause the injury, but from the Germans who had occupied the first trench &amp; intended to cut off Bowen who was pressing on to the second line.  Bryan mercifully became unconscious  as well.  Poor Elwell, a fine man indeed, fell with several men in near vicinity when later sent in support.  Col Howse &amp; Capt Maguire will no doubt tell you that Bryan partially regained consciousness &amp; passed away very gently on board the Berrima.<br/>The vessel was ordered to Herbertshohe, a few miles nearer Rabaul in the afternoon early.  Maguire &amp; I had the sad arrangements to make for burial for Bryan &amp; Williams, who died shortly afterwards, a funeral boat was sent ashore with the bodies wrapped in the loved union flag &ndash; as boat moved off all the men on Berrima &amp; Sydney paid tribute to gallant men who died in battle. &ndash; we were all completely overcome.<br/>I would like you to know that Bryan was buried with every honour due his rank &amp; gallantry.  The A.M.C. acted as bearers for our dear man &amp; Naval recruits for Williams.  The White cemetery is almost a mile from the shore in a peaceful spot, surrounded by giant palms and just as dusk was closing in, with a company of infantry men reversed arms A.M.C. Naval party, [indecipherable] a dozen officers, gathered round decent Christian graves, &amp; we saw a most deeply loved comrade buried with head towards Sydney &ndash; any one who attended will not forget the quiet scene when the last post was sounded.<br/>We were all so proud of Bryan &ndash; a charming gentleman, &amp; gallant soldier, who gave up his life to alleviate pain of his comrade, a manly man to the last ounce, &amp; died nobly in action &ndash; no man can  be capable of more</p>
