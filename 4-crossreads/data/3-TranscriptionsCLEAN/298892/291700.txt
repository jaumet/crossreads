France,22nd March 1917.
My dear Parents,You will be surprised to know that I received a sprig of shamrock for St. Patrick's Day. Francis Sullivan sent it to me. I received another letter from Mrs. Healy too, and also a very nice cake. She requests me to let her know of any little wants and she will be delighted to get them for me and at the same time she suggests sending a winter vest. I am writing to-night to inform her I am well equipped in that particular.I am writing this while on sentry as gas picket. All along the trenches at regular intervals and at important centres are bells and trombos horns and conchs or empty shell cases.  When cloud gas is detected by one of the sentries the trombos horn is sounded; In the case of shell gas the bell or shell case is rung. My shift to-night is from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. It gives me a good opportunity of getting off some letters.We have discovered a new method of replenishing the larder: Shooting hares. Myself and Ellis borrow one of the patient's rifles and at dusk we take up position commanding a good view of the paddock in our rear. We have knocked four so far and they make a great dish.Wouldn't old Fran like to be here ?There is a rumour in the air that we are to receive Blighty leave shortly. If it proves to be correct I will visit the Healy's.Trusting all at home are wellYour loving sonEugene.
