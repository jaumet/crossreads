<p>[Xmas Day contd]<br/>7 pm I went ahead with the dressing.  After a long time we succeeded in doing up &amp; the Show was a great success.  Alf Moss won the ladies prize as a girl &amp; Perryman the gents as a Roman.  My outfit was considered very good also Dicks &amp; reflected much credit on him for his work in making.  Felt like bed after the Show.</p>
