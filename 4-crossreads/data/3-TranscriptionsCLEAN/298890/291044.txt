  
 3 Sunday Went down to dinner with Maud & back to tea at Smith family party.  First helped Ethel. She was so sick.  Poured all day.  Started work at 7.30 a.m. & got Sam bound & corrected 
 4 Monday Took Sam to Watt & Son.  Trudged to bank & various places in pouring rain.  Got home & cleared up various odds & ends. Very tired afterwards hard struggle trying to type & earn living 
 5 Tuesday Lovely early morning like yesterday.  Stanley's suggestion of  "Down Under" came. Kept an hour late so got home too tired to sleep. 
 6 Wednesday Twilight day.  Sat in the hopeless muddle & did a little shorthand.  Searchlight wonderful glory at night
