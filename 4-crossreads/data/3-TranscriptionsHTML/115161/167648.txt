<p>between three to four miles an hour, when it suddenly stopped, the exertion had been too great, it must have a spell for a time.&nbsp; We offer to get out and push, but this upsets the driver to such an extent that we fear he will &quot;chuck&quot; a fit.&nbsp; He throws his arms about and gets apparently very excited, while he is - we imagine - trying to explain the situation to us.</p>
