 My dear mother, father &amp;  Dorothy, 
 The day before yesterday I received you cables  learnt for the first time of Arthur's death. They brought home to me fully how much more terrible is this war for you than for me; but I could not hope to have received a finer message than you sent, &amp; it bucked me up wonderfully. 
 There is a proud old army tradition, that whatever befall men of the field of battle, the flag must not be lowered from the topmost point. It is very hard to keep a tight upper lip when everything goes wrong, but this is a job that we must go through with, cost what it may. 
 I am going up to London to-morrow &amp;   will make enquiries at A.I.F. Headquarters to see if I can find out how he died, &amp;  if I do, will write immediately.
