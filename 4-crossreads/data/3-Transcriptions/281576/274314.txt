<p>Wed. Jan. 2.  After Break. I went all over Stone in search of a horse &amp; trap, so that we could go for a Drive, but there was not one in the Town.  We went into Hanley to see the Pantomime "Tommy Tucker."  It was rotten.  We sat in the Orchestra Stalls, &amp; it was awfully cold.  To make matters worse I sat near the Trombone Player, &amp; every time he played a loud note he nearly blew me out of my seat.  We returned to Stone about 5.30.  Called in at Pat Astbury's &amp; had Tea.  Then we got the Phonograph going &amp; stayed on &amp; yarned till about 9.  Then we had Supper &amp; returned to St Michael's Lodge.  I was jolly tired &amp; glad to get to Bed.  Bywe I mean Mrs Ibbs, Harry &amp; I.  This for B.E's information.  No doubt I'll hear about it later.</p>
<p>Thur. JAN. 3.  Went to the Potteries to Harry Ibbs' place.  Meat was unprocurable in the Town so we had a "makeshift" dinner, a thing I enjoy more than a set meal.  Said "Goodbye" to Mrs Ibbs, Harry &amp; Fanny &amp; returned to Stone.  Met Ern Harvey &amp; went Home with him.  Mrs Harvey was very nice &amp; made me feel quite at Home.  Slept in a big double Bed with only a Hot water bag for company.</p>
<p>FRI. 4.  Paid a visit to "Crown &amp; Anchor"  Saw Fred Collier &amp; his wife; &amp; of course many other identities. Harry Jones &amp; his wife among them.  While Ibby was in Stone, we had our photos taken together but they turned out failures.  There's no doubt about it, I take a rotten photo.  At night had a Game Cribbage &amp; a Sing-Song up at Ern's place.</p>
