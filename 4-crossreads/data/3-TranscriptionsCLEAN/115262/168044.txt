Thursday 4 October 1917.
Jacko never put in an appearance today until late. (As he comes every day now I've decided not to note every time he comes.)
Australian mail 6th since arriving in Egypt. Small mail which closed in Australia on July 19th week later that previous mail but took 7 weeks longer to reach here. 
(One letter that I expected never arrived.) 
Received 6 letters and packet of local papers.
