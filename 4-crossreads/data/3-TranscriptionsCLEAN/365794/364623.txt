  
 Friday 9th August 1917 [1918] No. of pts. 44.  Most of them Aust., dear boys all.  9 p.m., one nice boy lays a box of chocolates (such a sweet box) in my lap from the wild section.  How I like the hour 8 to 9 p.m. when they crowd round for medicines & daily laughing hide the quinine bottle, hold the glass so high that I can scarcely reach it, etc. Lt. Drummond known as "Insommnia", Lt. Macauch known as "Burly" evidently because he is so thin, Lt. Jones, Capt. Evans & Lt. W.D. Jarrett are all up & assemble on the balcony to yarn & call me out to join in.  Capt. Bigg, J.T., is another nice man.  Today 2 Williams went, one is a 1st Lieu. & not 21 until 17/8/18 - a sweet boy truly. Town 5.30 p.m., Girty unable to come.  Bought pr. white shoes, Pt. 110.  Cairo & did tiny bit of shopping then back & late for 7 p.m. dinner.
