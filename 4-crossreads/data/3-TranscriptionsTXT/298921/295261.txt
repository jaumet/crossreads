 October, 1915 Sunday 17  Arranged to go to dinner with Mrs Fletcher Mataria Railway today You see above appointment where I dined today.  It strikes me as a coincidence that in my year for Matric in Literature, we had a lot about Greece &amp; the narrows &amp; the windy plains of Troy I never anticipated I should be fighting there. I have my Bear Skin Cape from Canada, Rubber boots, Sheepskin Waistcoat &amp; muffs galore so shall be quite warm &amp; conditions must be better now. Taking a tiny Portable Primus Lamp as no wood will be left now.
