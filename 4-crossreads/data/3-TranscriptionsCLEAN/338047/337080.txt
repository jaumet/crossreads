1919Aug 16recognition of his work amongst us.
Aug 17Aug 18On 17th August we passed Kangaroo Island  about dark & on 18 August  about 3.30 am anchored off the Semaphore.  We moved up to the outer harbour at Port Adelaide about 9 am & pulled in to the wharf.  There was great excitement on shore.  The crowds of relatives were kept back from the main wharf by big barricades 7 or 8 feet high, so as to make it easier for the troops to land.  The boys were all very quiet, partly because a certain proportion were getting off,  & partly, I think, because they felt too full for words.  There was one old wit on the wharf "Sammy Lunn, his name was, as I discovered afterwards who ran up & down the wharf yelling, "I collected 500 (or 5,000) for you boys",  "Oh you beauties" "You beauties" etc etc.  We all thought that he was a bit touched.  It appeared that he was a great war worker in South Australia [Photograph of wharf at Port Adelaide]
