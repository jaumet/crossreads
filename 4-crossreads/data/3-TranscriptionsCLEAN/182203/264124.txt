  
 which had been sent to me to Heliopolis, Egypt, arrived in a very dilapidated condition, mostly in crumbs & powder. They would have been lovely too. I think they were sent by a Mrs Anderson, a great friend of the Swinburns - she wrote about last February saying she was sending them. I shall write & tell her. I'm very ashamed not writing to the Swinburns, they have written so often    & some how I have not had time to answer them for months. I find it very hard to settle down to write, suppose I'm getting old & lazy. Everybody remarks how well I'm looking & am also eating everything that is going.
