Of the Four of us that left Singleton together I am the only one remaining.  I wonder if I shall ever get back.</p>
<p>By Monday night the strain was beginning to tell.  No sleep &amp; hardly any food does not tend to strengthen one's nerves, but there was nothing to do but stick it.  On Wednesday night after 4 days solid fighting we were relieved by the Naval Division, but although we now had a choice to have a good sleep, I found it impossible to do so, my nerves were all on the jump &amp; every little while I would wake with a start;  nor was I the only one, fully 80 per cent of the men were the same.  Well Bertha I am afraid I will have to close as time is short to catch the mail.  So I will say good-bye for the present, with my very best wishes to all Goorangoola friends.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>very<br/>Sincerely Yours<br/>Arch. K. Jamieson<br/>61</p>
<p>P.S.  Please excuse the envelope, but the others are all to small.<br/>Arch.</p>
