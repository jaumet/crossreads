<p>Museum</p>
<p>The Museum is a big building near the Kasrenie Barracks. In front are numbers of statues &amp; carvings in blocks of stone gathered from ruins in Egypt. On entering one has to pay a piastre to get inside. The inside is of beautiful stone &amp; marble flooring with numerous galleries &amp; columns each branch of the museum is in a separate room &amp; each article is numbered so that one may obtain a description of it by buying a catalogue at the entrance.</p>
<p>Officials walk about &amp; keep a sharp eye on the visitors &amp; always examine the cases after one has inspected them. Some cases have priceless treasures in them. Every Friday afternoon an American takes soldiers through a part &amp; explains the origin &amp; history  of articles in detail, Which makes it very interesting. Ramesis lies in a coffin in a glass case &amp; is watched by an official very carefully. The museum is by far too great to see in one day, as it abounds in marvellous works of art &amp;ancient relics.</p>
