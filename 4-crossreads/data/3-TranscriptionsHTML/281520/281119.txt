<p>Paris<br/>4/3/17<br/>hundreds of old and tattered flags depend from the roof.  Over the door is a fine picture of French dead.  "Nos Martyrs pour la Droit &amp; Patrie".  Round the back came on what is really the front of the place.  A big dome and large building. Inside is a circular arrangement and you look over the rail on to an immense red granite sarcophagus where lies the body of the Napoleon Bonaparte.  The paving round the tomb is done in coloured tiles.  Twelve big statues circle the tomb (each a victory) and captured flags are placed in between them.</p>
<p>On the other level are tombs of Jerome &amp; Joseph and also some of the Marshalls.  There is an altar here and windows nearby are off coloured glass and give it the appearance of being bathed in flame.  Went from here across the Alexander III bridge and then on to the Champs Elysees &amp; home.  Some big palaces being used for exhibition purposes.  Near Invalides public latrine only has narrow covering about 3' in width.  Shocking our notions.  In each of these places are doctor circulars about VD.
