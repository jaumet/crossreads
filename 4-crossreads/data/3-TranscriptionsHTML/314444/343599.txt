<p>Mudros West (Rest Camp)<br/>Lemnos Island<br/>28th Septr 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>After an uneventful voyage we arrived here last Wednesday afternoon and are at present enjoying a very welcome spell.<br/>We left the Battery about 8 o'clock on Tuesday night and were transported by lighters on board the Khedivial Mail Line S.S. "Osmanieh". It was a most novel experience to sleep in a bunk again between <u>sheets</u>. Leaving at 8 a.m. Wednesday morning, we had a very pleasant run down through the Islands bringing up in Lemnos Harbour (Mudros) about 4 hours later.<br/>We left the ship at 4 p.m. and after a march of 2 &frac12; miles found our camp on a hillside overlooking the Harbour. An advance party had been sent on and they had tents erected  and a jolly good feed waiting for us. We were dog tired and turned in immediately after tea, and the music of the rifles was not needed to put us off to sleep. There are 6 officers and about 150 men here from the two Artillery Brigades.</p>
