<p>a spell &amp; no one else seemed anxious to take it on.</p>
<p>Tuesday 5th</p>
<p>This cooking stunt is fairly strenious.  About 40 or 50 Galls. of tea or Coffee are used between 11 &amp; 12 in the morning &amp; 70 to 90 Gals. at night from about 5.30 to 9.  The coal is very bad &amp; the wood the same only for using the boxes would never keep the supply up.  There are 8 of us to cook for besides the tea making</p>
