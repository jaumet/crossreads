<p>3.  will be doing so regularly with him too, dear Boy!  Just in case I haven't been clear about dates, let me repeat them.  Le left on March 21st, Rid 22nd, and Wal 29th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost think you would get one of the wires on Harry's birthday, poor old Harry I wrote to him the other day &amp; Lawry too.  I have such a lot of writing to do now-a-days that my brain &amp; thoughts go flat &amp; stale, &amp; though I have plenty of time for it, I can't seem to get any inspiration for it like a born correspondent would do.  I have Rid's Melbourne folk to keep in touch with too, to say nothing of him himself, and it all gets rather bewildering at times in spite of the strict account I keep of dates, &amp; I wouldn't like to have to read my own letters for a good deal.<br/>I have put off telling you about Rid till last, but I have only one thing to tell you &amp; it is that early on March 30th (our fourth anniversary wedding day that we were going to spend somehow together if it were at all possible to squeeze in) I had a cable from him from Marseilles saying "Splendid, love."  It really was sent on 29th so that it seems to have taken them a week to get there, unless he found it difficult to get a cable through.  In that case if it took a week then it will be a few days more before I can expect a letter, supposing that mails are fairly numerous &amp; that letters are allowed, which it is possible they may not be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The week since Wal went has seemed at least a fortnight, &amp; the fortnight since Rid &amp; Le went quite a month or more, so I can dimly guess at what your poor feelings must be like over there, &amp; my sympathies rush across to you.<br/>I am helping four days a week now at the Esbekiah Gardens' Y.M.C.A. Cafe &amp; it is good to be able to do even that much.  As for any</p>
