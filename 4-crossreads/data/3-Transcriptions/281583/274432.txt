<p>have been of them &amp; many incidents have come to my memory of the last days in Australia &amp; I am wondering if I will be home for the next one. I have been day dreaming most of the day only coming out of my reveries when the hiss of a shell passing over would send ones heart into ones mouth.</p>
<p>The intense cold is playing up with us all &amp; I can assure you that the hardships are both great &amp; numerous. I have given up washing &amp;  shaving as one suffers for too many hour after each time. The ice this morning averaged 9 to 12 inches thick it is still laying on the ground. Needless to say my chilblains are very sore.</p>
<p>There was the finest display of Aeroplanes to-day that I have ever seen. I counted as many as 40 planes in one place. There were many duels &amp; we saw one fall from a great height. Another one fell on the top of a hill which the Germans could see &amp; not one of us was game to go &amp; have a look at it, as Fritz was putting in shell after shell in an endeavour to smash it up before night fell. It is a prize worth going for as the pilots &amp; observers always have beautiful coats on, made of long fur. Several of our boys have already booked some.</p>
<p>Fritz has been putting over a few occasional shots. He pestered the very life out of us</p>
