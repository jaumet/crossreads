<p>THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; cold. Went down to H.Q.</p>
<p>&amp; found my papers were all</p>
<p>ready to be signed. I got another</p>
<p>week&#39;s leave. Kieth &amp; Barry</p>
<p>got word to get everything</p>
<p>ready to go in the morning,</p>
<p>so they were bustling round</p>
<p>all day. I went to the pictures</p>
<p>again in the afternoon &amp; stayed</p>
<p>at home at night.</p>
