<p>We returned via Steinforde, a pretty village consisting of a Kurhaus of about the same size as our lager, and a few cottages.  In a field near the mill (Steinmuhlhavel) grazed a herd of about 20 really good Holstein cattle, the first I saw in Germany.  In the whole of Scheswig-Holstein I did not see a single specimen of this famous breed.</p>

<p>Vaccinated in the afternoon,</p>
