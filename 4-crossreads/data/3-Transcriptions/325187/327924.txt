<p>Do not open letter.<br/>Posted Notes yesterday hope you get them-<br/>Very hot &amp; many Fatigues  More Aeroplanes but no more air fights, it was a great exhibition &amp; once the two great Battle planes appeared over, 100 yards apart-  Ours was shot &amp; so was the enemy &ndash; but he got away.  Our men blame our own Machine Gunners, as the planes were flying so close together it was madness to fire at all- Like Duck shooting hard to judge how far in front when travelling at the rate of 1 mile a minute.<br/>At Gallipoli it was heads down here its "Heads up" to see what brand of Plane it is.<br/>O Circles on Wings of ours<br/>+ Cross on enemies.</p>
