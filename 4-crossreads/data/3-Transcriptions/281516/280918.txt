<p>8/6/16</p>
<p>All men again out in fatigue and for the officers the day was in consequence a slack one. Heard of Lord Kitchener's death. During the afternoon went down to Sparrows battery and saw the Stokes guns there. Fired a couple of bombs from them &ndash; such amazingly simple things that one wonders at their very simplicity.</p>
<p>The other day a big stack of bombs was stored near some guns and an officer accidentally kicked one. A Sergt Major noticed this and said quickly, "Gentlemen, there is a bomb smoking run for your lives"! All ran except one and got over a little crest before the big explosion. One man stayed on unable to grasp the meaning and was killed.</p>
<p>Had a painful scene with Coltman tonight when telling him his transfer was refused. He cried pitifully poor chap. The dog is a good deal used locally for the purpose of hauling loads and is usually strapped into small harnesses affixed to the axle and thus pushes the cart ahead.</p>
<p>9/6/16</p>
<p>Furphy going round that 20,000 Germans have surrendered at Verdun. Despatched Skene Smith 4 Sgts &amp; 16 men as advance party to our new place. I am to be in charge of Lille Post, a dugout post about 1200' behind the firing line and there will be a reserve to the firing line. The remainder of the battalion are further are further back in billets. 1100 shells are said recently to have landed in this section.</p>
<p>All men being out on fatigue the day has been a quiet one. It is unfortunate that we have to leave behind us here trees full of fruit which will not ripen for some weeks yet.</p>
<p>Mackay &amp; Bazeley went into Armentieres and Skenes having gone down to the reserve line to take over our billets I was alone for tea. Mounted as Orderly Officer at 5 pm. After tea the antiaircraft gun in the next paddock started heavy shelling at a Taube flecking the sky with white one shell burst within feet of the plane. Very rapid fire maintained the voice of the range taker keeping up a shrill babble. Four of our aeroplanes were up together. The Germans are far more economical with their air shooting latterly.</p>
