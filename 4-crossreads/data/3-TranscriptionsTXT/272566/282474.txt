 Wednesday 31 January 
 Icy again today and a heavy day for stretcher-bearers.  The wounded came through in a continuous stream.  When relieved at about 4 p.m. we had to carry a patient out in addition to our equipment and my word it was a lively trip.  High Explosive shrapnel burst above us all the way.  On returning to Bernafay Wood I was disappointed to learn that all leave has been stopped indefinitely.  Should have gone today.
