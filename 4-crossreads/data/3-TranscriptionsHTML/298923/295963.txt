<p>24 October 1918 Thursday<br/>Cairo<br/>Not much to write you now as I sent you a long letter re Dolly going Home &amp; my arrival I hope early in the New Year but one can never be sure in the Army what is going to happen.<br/>Had afternoon tea with Stewart Brown who was at Mrs Batemans with me in Warrnambool how many years ago.</p>
