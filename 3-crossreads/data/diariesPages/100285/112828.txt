while, then feeling hungry thirsty we asked an old woman who was cleaning the church out if there was any place where we could get a drink, she said if we went across to the big Manor House we could probably get something, so over we went, it was a lovely old place I rang the old bell hanging outside a lady came to the door I asked her if she could do anything for us, come into the drawing room she said, we wondered what on earth we had struck as we followed her she led us into a beautiful room full of bonza easy chairs sofa's. she asked us if we would like to see the old library which was very ancient we saw it, then the garden, after this we had our tea then walked home for tea
