<p>Sunday 11 February 1917</p>
<p>Mazar<br/>On our way back to "Beyond", the first time our Reg. has ever been behind. Now a new Hospital train runs along the road. We pioneered fresh water at different spots, but our men would sooner be going on to Palestine.</p>
<p>Wet last night &amp; I was Field Officer, but NO enemy near us now. We are on a 60 mile Trek &amp; find much work has been done behind, later on it would be a good spec: to open a first class Hotel &amp; Casino at El Arish for those Cooks tourists who will go this way to Palestine. TIMMS came &amp; spoke to me today, he's doing well.</p>
