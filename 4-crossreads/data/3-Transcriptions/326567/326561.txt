<p>from a variety show in Poperinghe which we enjoyed very much we decided to go Bandicooting for Potatoes as there are any amount growing about, &amp; as the supply of Potatoes from the Supply Depot is very erratic, we decided to cook our own, Bandicooting means digging down under the plants &amp; pulling out the Potatoes, we filled nearly 2 Sand Bags in about 40" &amp; they are very nice &amp; we boil &amp; fry them &amp; we can obtain now &amp; again a Tin of Bully Beef &amp; make a stew for Tea also we have now toast for Breakfast &amp; buy Cocoa which is very dear at 1 Franc 20 cent for &frac14; lb, Sugar 2 franc 20 Cent per Kilo Condensed Milk 1 Franc 60 Centimes, Sauce at 1fr-20ct so we have cocoa for Supper. Last Monday Night 17/9/17 we knocked up a Tea from our Surplus food in our Cupboard with Potatoes, Onions &amp; Bully Beef &amp; had it at 4 Pm &amp; left here at about 4.30 Pm &amp; got a lift in by Motor Wagon &amp; when we arrived at the Soldiers Theatre at 5 Pm. I now conclude No 2 Diary &amp; continue on No 3.</p>
