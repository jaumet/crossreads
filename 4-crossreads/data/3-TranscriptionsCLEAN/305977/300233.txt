July 1915Monday 5thThe Turks gave us a good reveille at 4am with about 50 shells.  Our guns opened up & they knocked off.  One of our men was wounded.  Was on pick & shovel work all day.  There was great activity in the bay.  Seem to be searching for the submarine which sank a French troopship yesterday.  The enemy started a big 11 inch going quite close to our lines but quite a number of their shells overreached & fell into the sea.  Got a letter from mother in the mail tonight dated June 1st.
Tuesday 6thWas on a gun dragging fatigue in the morning.  Had nothing else to do all day, wrote a letter to mother.
Wednesday 7thWas mess orderly & had an easy day.  Went down on to the beach at night drawing rations & didn't have to stand to in the morning.
