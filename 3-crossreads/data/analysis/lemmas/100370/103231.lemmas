 16th The bad weather still continu . The wind has not been so boister today as yesterday , but it is quit as cold , with more rain . The continu wet and cold is tell on men and hors alik . The sick parad from the Regiment are larger everi day . What this cruel weather must mean to those poor fellow who , after be wound may have to spend some hour befor the Ambulanc can pick them up , is beyond concept and yet this doe sometim occur , and through no fault of the Ambulanc engag . As for instanc , in the attack on the hill in the west of the Jordan on the 20th Feb. the countri was absolut impass for vehicl transport of ani kind , and most of the carri of wound had to be done by parti of stretcher bearer , and these had to carri their burden a long way , the consequ be that there were some they were their progress was slow , and some were not brought in till the morn . The other night , while we were in Beitin , after a veri cold , wet , and windi day , I was just settl down to sleep when I heard an Ambulanc waggon jolt by on the rough road . They stop opposit our Camp , and I could hear the moan of a wound man insid . He was evid an Officer , for in answer to an inquiri of his , the order repli , " It 's not much further now , Sir" . Then evid the wound man ask them if they could find a smoother path for I heard the driver say it was imposs to go off the road ; and so , inde , it was . In repli to an inquiri from outsid , the driver said this man had been lie out all day . Endure intens physic tortur from his wound , he had been lie expos to the bitter weather for mani hour , and the probabl without food or water , and then had a rough ride of mani mile that must have been Hell to him . He still had more than a mile to do , to Ram-Allah where the clear station was . The road was made of stone vari from the size of one 's fist to the size of one 's head . After a few minut rest , they move off veri slowli , and right away in the distanc I could hear him moan , and implor them to stop again . This , of cours , they could not do . He had to be taken to Hospit and that as quick as possibl .
