Head Quarters2nd Australian DivisionSeptember 25th 1918
My Dear Mr GarlingI have received your two letters dated 20th and 24th June.  While very much sympathising with your elder son because of his enforced resignation from military service I can but say that I think he has done the right thing.  Your family has done its share.Perhaps I may be able to throw a little light on the question of decorations.  Artillery officers and men have nothing like the same opportunities for winning decorations as have the Infantry, while the Artillery work is nevertheless very important, and in reality makes Infantry success possible - Decorations are awarded in two ways, firstly as immediate rewards for specific acts of gallantry, and here there is no restriction of the number of awards made - Secondly in half yearly lists awarded for General good service.  This latter class is however is very limited in point of numbers.  For instance I am at present moment making recommendations for my Division for the next half yearly honours list, but I am only allowed honour for 24 officers for the whole Division over 1000 officers.  You will realise
