<p>&amp; after this a yarn to the girls &amp; then we went out to have a look round the town &amp; book a room for the night, after this we went &amp; saw the "Better Ole" at the only so called theatre here, well it was the most rotten &amp; stale thing that I have ever seen whatever the people could see to laugh &amp; applaud beat me, I was yawning nearly the whole time &amp; I was mighty glad when the show was over.  I then went back to these people had supper &amp; 2 other chaps &amp; I rode back on our bikes Len having decided to stop the night, it was a glorious night &amp; I really enjoyed our midnight trip, but half way I got a puncture which we soon fixed up, I eventually arrived home at 1.30 as I was coming across the parade</p>
