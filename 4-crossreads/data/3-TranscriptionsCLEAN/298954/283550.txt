1917Sat. Dec 1st.
Leave hospital.   Beautiful clear smooth weather with a heavy ground swell.
The new prize, a barque, is lying off the "Wolf" with most sail set.
We are only 100 miles from Pt Elizabeth.   The ship is the old wool-clipper "Avenger", re-commissioned after being salved from an American beach and re-named "John H. Kirby".   Captain A. Blom, crew 16.   New York to Port Elizabeth with general cargo including 270 automobiles.   At noon two bombs exploded on her starboard hull;  she immediately listed heavily and sank in 2 mins. 15 secs.
Sun 2nd Dec."Wolf" has abandoned the passenger-ship chase and is rounding the Cape in perfectly clear smooth weather.   Sandy caused a mild sensation by vowing that he had sighted a patrolling sea-plane while lying on deck.
A cautious rush to the deck followed, but the 'plane was not seen any more.
