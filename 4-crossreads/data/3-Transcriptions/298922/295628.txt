<p>Sunday 25th November 1917</p>
<p>Too rough for any one to know it is Sunday.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]<br/>I was ill for the first time in many years, the result of attending the wife, who hopes the boat will be torpedoed etc:-  As a matter of fact one of the Convoy nearly ran us down in the afternoon, we could almost step on board each other, through careless steering.</p>
<p>Moon is quite good now, but we hope we are miles from any subs.</p>
