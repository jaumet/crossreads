Bapaume 26/3/17After lunch a two storey building next to the ruins of the Town Hall  collapsed like a pack of cards.  A wet afternoon.  Coming down from the tent camp last night five men fell out under a Corporal.  Being a short march I said rather scornfully "New men, Corporal?"  Then one sprang up re. shouldered an extra load of rations and made off at a great pace after the column "New man!  I'm an old hand just out of hospital"  Deeply insulted.  The new man less heavily laden still hung back until prodded on by Corporal.  Wonderful thing 'esprit de corps'.
General Smith in to tea.  Hot brazier made us fairly comfortable after tea but the early rising was conducive to turning in early.  Colonel & myself slept in valises laid out on the floor and were comfortable except for cold wind whistling round every corner.  Definite information obtained from prisoner that local mines were detonated by means of electric clocks.  We expected to "go up" any time but nothing happened!  Our working parties on all night
