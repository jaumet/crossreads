Douglas took. I have not heard anything of the parcel you had sent although I have made repeated enquiries at the Post Office. Other chaps have received parcels from Australia safely so I have no doubt it will turn up in the end.I am enclosing with the snaps one of an aerial observation balloon. It is a very poor snap but will give you some idea of the peculiar shape of these gas bags. On our recent route marches we have passed the station from which this balloon ascends. It is held to the ground by a fine steel wire which is controlled by a specially constructed motor car. The four dots hanging near the stern are  kinds of parachutes which I imagine are for steadying the balloon. I hope to be able to get a better snap of it on some subsequent occasion. It is used when the artillery are at practice  to observe where the shells are lobbing and communicates with them.  Only two men go up in it.Your account of Vesey's shooting expedition is most amusing. Poor Cap must be very hard up for exercise when he accompanies a shooting party which is out to raid on King-fishers. I can't imagine a more harmless and ornamental bird. Surely he did not shoot them sitting. It is certainly a dreadful pass for a member of Lismore's Home Defence Corps to come to. It must be rather amusing to see Vesey marching round the street with Winterton's Corps although I must admire his spirit in joining.When I was in London I saw what must be a similar corps drilling  in the grounds of the Tower
