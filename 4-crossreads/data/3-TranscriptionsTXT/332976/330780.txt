December 191631st   New Years Eve- Sunday is a free day here, & it is the first free Sunday we have had for a long while.  We only had one parade at 9 a.m. at which rifles & gas helmets were inspected & after that, the day was our own.  The estaminets are open on Sunday & by bedtime the boys were rather merry.  There are a great number of Australians in the town & the streets were crowded with them although they were considerably quiet.The shops & Estaminets close at 8 P.M. & by 10 o'clock everything was quiet & the majority in bed.  We were informed today that leave to Amiens would be granted in a few days.
