Y.M.C.A. or canteen: I forget which, the show does not last very long, but helps to pass an hour, I had a letter from Overstrand, last week.  = 27th =  All were well when it was written.  Mrs. H. sent me a parcel for Xmas.   some fruit nuts etc.   The weather has not altered very much since Xmas day, except that on Xmas night snow fell. and has been falling since at intervals, and is falling just at present, the place is all white and the roads are frozen hard, and whereever there is any traffic they are very slippery, horses have a hard time .. when trying to pull a load along, but it is good for the motor lorries, except when they have any steep hills to climb, then the wheels are very apt to skid,   Now that the snow has started, the place seems warmer, when the frost started it was very cold. and miserable but we are fairly comfortable. so there is no need to worry.   The guns have been very much quieter for the last couple of days.   Last night they did a little Straffing for awhile
