 1916 &nbsp; WEDNESDAY 18 &nbsp; OCTOBER 
 Fine &amp; fairly warm for this place &nbsp;Cleaning harness all day for an inspection by the C.O. &amp; he passed it all right. Warren &amp; Self &amp; Roy Alworth &amp; Clive Murray pinched some horses &amp; went for a ride down to Figledean for tea. It was good to get out on your own with a horse again. Got letters (2) from Linda &amp; M rs &nbsp;Lloyd today. We were paid at night but missed mine by going for the ride. The Battery went on duty at night.
