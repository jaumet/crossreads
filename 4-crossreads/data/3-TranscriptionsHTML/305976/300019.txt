<p>tough job getting Jacko out of the hills. It is such a natural defensive position &amp; he has had plenty of time to prepare his defences<br/>Sunday June 30<br/>Artillery fire heavy through night. Usually in the middle of the day in the Jordan valley there is not a sign of life. It is too hot for anything. The flies would drive one mad &amp; every night one needs to make an inspection of his bivvy for scorpions etc. The life here is one long monotony. We would welcome anything for a change<br/>Monday July 1<br/>Jacko gave 1ST Brigade who are down near bridgehead a fairly lively time to day. The Batterys</p>
