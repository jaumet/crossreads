 Monday 3 January, 1916 
 Went out to Pieta&nbsp;in the afternoon &amp; had a good time. Left early &amp; went to the Olympia&nbsp;Club &amp;&nbsp;met a Marine Corporal named Baseby. We had a good few drinks &amp; a game of billiards. After that they asked me to stay out of camp overnight so we went across the grand harbour in a dicer but I could not get a bed so I had to make my way back to camp, about 6 miles &amp; across two harbours. I eventually arrived home safely at about 12.30.
