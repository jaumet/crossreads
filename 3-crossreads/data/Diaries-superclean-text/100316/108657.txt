14/5/18 Montigny
Up at about 11. Madame is an old woman full of the cry of hard times damage to crops and the misery of War. These poor people see the fruit of the labour swept away in a night by marauding troops and carelessness - of which evils a certain amount is not avoidable. Madame has a son who is a Francisian friar and lives at Jerusalem. His photograph shows a bearded and comfortable looking Monk. Walked round the street to where our mess is established and there saw all the officers Smith Gorman King Braithwaite Hunter and Anderson are here and Sutherland Miles and Bourke remain at the wagon lines. After lunch went out for a walk rambling over green ploughed fields. It is a lovely green restful land this France. There are little copses full of yellow leaf and wildflowers. All the woods are trim and neat and a joy to the eye. The "Chateaux" nestle in among the woods. Tommies of artillery lines, R.A.M.C. orderlies and M.P.s make up the crowd seen. On the main roads plenty of lorries pass and repass. I rested awhile on a grassy bank and enjoyed looking round. Last night I got rather shaken in the nerve by the shelling and to rest back here away from it all was splendid. We hear today that Kennedy and others are wounded in a patrol encounter or something else
