[Transcriberâ€™s note. This is the first diary of James McKenzie, an Ambulance Assistant with the Army Medical Corps. The diary begins as he enlists in Sydney and describes his boat journey to Cairo via the Suez Canal. He describes visiting the Pyramids and his delight in visiting the bazaars and mosques in Cairo. His account of what happens in the hospital wards is not very expansive, but relates how amount of wounded or sick in the wards fluctuated.]
