Bugles sounded lights out when there was a rush in the air & Bang about 20 yds behind my Tent. One of fritzs Bombs from a Taube. Got 5 wounded one of them being one of my mates a Bugler there were 3 of us in the Tent at the time & what a scatter it was laughable to see them going for their lives away from the Tents however he only dropped one more & that about 400 yds away.Had it landed amongst the Tents a lot would have gone out as the charge seemed to open out on the ground like a fan & would have caught you even if you were lying down.The Sergeants had a narrow escape 10 of them were standing up in their mess & the Tarpauline was riddled. A lot of Taubes were up & the guns were blazing at them. I hear they got one at Bapaume.
