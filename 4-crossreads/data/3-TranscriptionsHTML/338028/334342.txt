<p>I then went around for drugs and got them, that finished I started to enjoy my short holiday in this pretty town, but such was not to be, as I became ill and at three I had such a raging fever I had to go to bed at an hotel, I shivered so much that I got up and went down to the lake and got into the water still shivering. This did me good, then a good dose of Quinine pulled me to-gether, it spoiled my holiday for after a sleepless night I caught the next train in the morning to Serapeum.</p>
<p>Monday 30th</p>
<p>Arrived Serapeum about mid-day in awful heat, got right as far as rail head where had to wait until five for ration waggons, arrived back at camp. Dr awfully pleased with my success.</p>
<p>Found 12 letters awaiting me, went to bed tired but happy.</p>
<p>Tuesday 1st Aug<br/>Saddled the mare before breaky and rode to rail head then train to the Canal where I had an enjoyable swim. Then met the hospital boat and took off my goods, I had to leave them and arrange for transport to the light railway, it was Hell, trying to make these thick headed English Yokels understand. I eventually persuaded a band of niggers to do the work, the Arabic is a blessing, after much cursing and swearing I arrived home after over 20 loads and unloads. The mare is in splendid condition.</p>
<p>Wednesday 2nd</p>
<p>Opened up all my stuff, Dr delighted. I furnished my hosp complete, it looms lovely, everything from toothbrushes to books, I am proud of it, then I put the day in dispensary, dispensed 30lbs prescripts.</p>
