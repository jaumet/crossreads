 what damage Fritz had done to Hazebrouck with all his shelling & bombing. it was pretty knocked about especially near the railway & station - I went to Pictures in the evening with Burnie & Scotty & afterwards for a feed of eggs & chips. it snowed all evening - 
   
 Dec 29  th    We went to Steenwerck as usual for supplies - When we got back to Park we had to paint out our shamrock sign ( [  shamrock symbol]  signifying supplies) & paint shells on instead in red & blue as we are forming the amunition section, much to my satisfaction - fine day but pretty cold. Frank & Beachy had an argument which ended in blows & then not till Beachy threw in the sponge (which I should say he was in need of at that stage in the region of his face)  the weather got warmer in the evening 
   
 Dec 30  th    We have finished drawing supplies for the Brigade now, their G.S. Waggons will do it from now on - We moved our five lorries to Steenwerck & parked with 3  rd   D.S.C. in the square  - The 12  th   bgd loories took our place with the 1  st   D.S.C. & the 12  th   Bgd lorries & also 3  rd   bgd finished drawing supplies for their respective brigades -
