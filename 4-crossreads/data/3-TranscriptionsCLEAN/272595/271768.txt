  
 by a swell margin, I have very little time for this game now after learning to play Rugby, the latter in my opinion is a far better game & I have no further interest in my old game  after this was finished I hurried back to our billiard room to see the final in the billiard tournament which Ruston won after a pretty close finish from Clancy. 26th.  Everything seems working against me now I am trying my hardest to get my teeth finished, my dentist has been shifted to another Camp this morning so no treatment for me today, in one way I am pleased for I was dreading this morning on account of having 2 nerves taken out or they were to have been, but its only a couple of days grace I suppose for I shall have to go through the torture
