We have all been out drilling this morning for the ground has dried fast, I reckon it is the maddest thing I know of, just asking for trouble with the German machines watching every movement if we don't get bombed tonight I'll eat my hat.
Another issue of winter clothing, we are getting plenty of it at any rate so far this year 
28th Digby I went down to Reinelhurst yesterday evening to see the Field Cashier over money matters. Digby is going to Paris on leave I am advancing him the money off my pay book for the purpose, on account of him not having enough on his own, we got a lift down in a motor from Dickebusch but hanged if the cashier was at Reinelhurst so we had to go to Scottish Lines 3 kilo's away, he was not there either but luckily the 5th Div fixed us up, we then walked to Ouderdom, got a motor back to Dickebusch walked the rest.
Just what I expected happened last night old Fritz bombed the Camp caught the 2nd Battn. properly killed 11 wounded 30 more, 1 bomb wiped a whole tent out
