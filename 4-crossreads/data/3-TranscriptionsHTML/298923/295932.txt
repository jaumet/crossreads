<p>23 September 1918 Monday<br/>Fusail<br/>21 000 prisoners 190 guns now-  Jacko clearing out as usual we rode all night &amp; all day &amp; now expect to go Es Salt way again-  <strike>Handley Page</strike> [plane] flew over us &amp; must put the wind up Jacko.  Prisoners are a poor lot, not many Germans-   Nights &amp; days merge into one-   it is hard to keep count- in one square acre  I saw a British West Indian  Sikh  NZder  Australian, Tommy  Frenchman  Cavalry &amp; a Tartar &amp; a German so I think &amp; hope we have left the Jordan forever, now marching in Judean Hills on Es Salt.</p>
