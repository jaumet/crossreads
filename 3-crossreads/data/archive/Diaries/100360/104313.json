Apr. 28.  Dodson, Bayliss &amp; Nash went away on Leave this morning, which makes me 8th on the List now.  After Dinner we found that no wagon was obtainable to take us to Mametz; so rang up Major Bond who promised to send along some  vehicles.  About 3 p.m. Normy Adams, Jack Edgar &amp; Stan Wilson left, with our \"Props\" in a Tip dray.  At 6 p.m. the remainder of the \"N.B.s\" left some in a Limber &amp; the others in a Maltese Cart, both from the 59th Batt.  <br> \r\n The Y.M.C.A. Hut was crowded &amp; our Show went off tip-top.  Maj. Bond greeted us on our arrival.  Maj. Clayton &amp; Capt. Riley were also there.  After the Show, Mr King of the Y.M.C.A. &amp; the Padre gave us a slap up Feed, Fried Sausages  Bread &amp; Butter, Cakes &amp; Cocoa.  After that Maj. Bond took us up to the officers? Mess &amp; produced some Fire Water.  The officers of the 59th are a jolly decent crowd &amp; they gave us a good time.  Plenty of Whisky &amp; actually Schweppes Soda.  I'm glad to say that our Crowd played the Game &amp; arrived back Home at midnight quite alright.</p> \r\n <p>Sun. Apr. 29th  Glorious, sunshining day.  Our crowd are football mad.

Plenty of planes about.  After Tea we had a rehearsal to prepare for our Show at the Y.M.C.A. Hut in Albert.  Staff Kitson returned from Blighty.  He says he had a glorious time &amp; that he failed to notice any Food Shortage in England.</p> \r\n <p>Tues. May 1st   Typical May Day.  Nice warm &amp; sunny.  Our Show in Albert was almost a dud.  First of all the Gas Pipe Burst &amp; set fire to the stage; then half way through the 1st half the lights went out &amp; we had to use candles.  Eric Herford forgot his words in \"Who killed Kaiser\" &amp; I did the same.  Payney &amp; Bill May were in good form &amp; Bill Gamble was quite brilliant.  The 2nd Part went well &amp; the Sketch went screamingly .   The Y.M.C.A. people gave us a Good Supper after the Show.</p> \r\n <p>Wed. May 2nd  Another glorious day.  Our Tug o? War Team pulled against the 15th to see who should pull in the Div. Sports on Friday  on Sat Bricky, Bill Williams &amp; I went into Albert after Tea.  It was quite a treat to be among civilians again.</p> \r\n <p>Thurs. May 3    Finished my letter to M.S.  <br> \r\n This morning our figures for the Con Camp were incorrect, so we spent the morning fixing them up.  After the 2 o'clock parade we got busy &amp; scrubbed our Hut out.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300063\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 63]<br> \r\n Fri. May 4.  It's about time another mail was in.  After Dinner, Bill Williams, Nick Coxon &amp; I walked out to Mametz to the Div Sports.  It was a very warm day &amp; I actually raised a sweat, the first one since I came back from the Line.  There was big crowd there &amp; the events went off very well.  \"Billgy\" May &amp; \"Shag\" Shearer came 2nd in the Stretcher Bearer's race, they should have got first, but failed to do some little item &amp; lost points.  Our Q.M. McFadyon won the Officer's Race ? flying  &amp; Tommy Ross &amp; Les Foote won the 3 legged Race.  We came away at about 4, got a lift in a Motor Lorry part of the way, &amp; had a glass of Beer &amp; a good Bath when we arrived back at Bellvue Farm.<br> \r\n .<br> \r\n Sat. MAY 5.  Capt. Riley fixed up my Tooth.  Last night we had a meeting in the Mess Hut to decide about giving a Show at the Reinf. Camp.  Fred Winter, Charley Hall &amp; Capt Marshall went on leave.</p> \r\n <p>Sun. May 6.  Glorious day.  The Trees are bursting into bloom &amp; look very pretty.  The news from then front continues good, but the slaughter must be terrible on both sides.  After Tea Bill Williams &amp; I went for a stroll along the Becordel Road &amp; came across a big crowd of Reinf. On their way to the Front Line.  They looked in the Pink of Condition.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300064\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 64]<br> \r\n Mon. May 7.  Last night we had quite settled down to Bunk when Sgt Thomson came &amp; sung out the names of 100  Bearers to be ready to move off at a moments notice &amp; my name was among ?em.  It appears that the casualties among stretcher Bearers is very high &amp; we have to go out to relieve them.  After Tea we had a run through our Programme for tomorrow night at the Reinf Camp.</p> \r\n <p>Tues. May 8.  Our Concert is knocked on the Head.  The 15th F. Amb is coming to relieve us tonight &amp; our crowd are taking over the Main &amp; Advanced Dressing Stations.<br> \r\n Later.  Busy Day packing up &amp; handing over.  Payney, Nick Coxon Jack Edgar &amp; I had a Farewell Gathering in the Mess Hut.</p> \r\n <p>Wed. May 9.  Got up bright &amp; early &amp; fell in at 8.30.  Packed up &amp; fossicked around for Rations.  Had Dinner at 11.30.  Payney, Bricky &amp; I dined in the Canteen.  Fell in at 12.30, boarded motor Lorries &amp; came out to this Main dressing Station, through Poziers &amp; Bapaume.  The country looks much better than it did on my last visit as the grass has grown &amp; covered up the shell holes to a certain extent.  We got a drink of Tea &amp; are to bivouac in the open for tonight &amp; move up to the Line tomorrow.  There are plenty of planes about &amp; its good fun watching ?em.<br> \r\n Glory Halleluyah!  Got 3 Letters 2 from M.S. &amp; 1 from Nell  Good old Blue Eyes.  Your Letters bucked me up fine.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300065\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 65]<br> \r\n Thur. May 10.  Last night was quite exciting.  We had quite settled down to sleep when bang! came about a dozen Fritz shells.  Just got settled down again when the Serg. rushed in &amp; told us to put on our Gas Helmets as the wind was favourable for Fritz.  I was sleeping between Bricky Howard &amp; Prescott.  Bricky slept peacefully through it all.  Prescott suffered from nightmare &amp; sung out in his sleep \"Oh, this war, this awful war!\"  Altogether it was a most eventful night. 18 of our chaps, Billy May, Snowy Atherton Towney, Ross, Stan Wright among them went out to the A.D.S. about 8 o'clock.  This morning we pitched Tents &amp; unloaded waggons.  It is quite hot &amp; the crowd are getting quite tanned.</p> \r\n <p>Fritz had a Balloon up &amp; soon sent a number of shells around our Camp.  Several motor Lorries were coming along the road &amp; the way they broke the speed limit was real amusing.  About 20 men got knocked &amp; we had a busy time for a few hours.  A 2nd Division Transport sergeant was killed.  Hippersly was at work in the Cookhouse when a lump of shrapnel came through &amp; hit him on the Leg.  Three motor Amb. were smashed up &amp; had to be towed to the workshop.  We fell in at 5 o'clock for Gas Helmet inspection &amp; after fooling around  till nearly 8, we set off for the Line.  Stan Wright, Billgy May &amp; party at the A.D.S. made us some cocoa which we greatly appreciated.<br> \r\n [Paper with the word Bullecourt obscuring part of page] </p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300066\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 66]<br> \r\n [Duplicate of page 65 with paper obscuring part of page]<br>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p>[Page 58]<br><br />\n Sun.
