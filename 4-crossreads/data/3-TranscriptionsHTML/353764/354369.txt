<p>Looking across the Valley of the Nile you can see the old Egyptian Cemetery &amp; on the Hill the hole where the Lions used to come out of &amp; devour the people.<br/>Lots of people went in but we did not go as it was a bit too far.<br/>We next drove back to the Nile &amp; had a look round there &amp; finally returned to Camp after a very enjoyable time.  I might also mention that we had Camel &amp; donkey rides, &amp; had our photos taken</p>
