<p>Wednesday 7 June 1916<br/>Fine again, but a good deal of wind, dying down in the afternoon when the aeroplanes again appeared. Physical drill in early morning &amp; lectures &amp; throwing during the day. Much excitement over the news of the loss of Lord Kitchener. After tea started to walk into Sailly to hear Gipsy Smith when I met Leo coming out to meet me. Together we went to the village hall to find that the meeting had started with the singing of hymns, a good crowd of men being present. A solo "He died of a broken heart" was sung by one of the men &amp; was the basis of the talk  given, very straight &amp; good &amp; well received. From the start he got the attention of the men &amp; held them right through. The whole meeting was a treat. Afterwards we walked out towards home together, the view with the sun just setting at 10 past 8 being glorious. One little peep of 2 men hoeing in a field &amp; a church spire standing out on the horizon against the setting sun, reminding us both of Oll's pictures of "The Angelus", was very lovely &amp; the whole sunset glorious.</p>
