  
 9 - only 19 years old very young isn't it - almost a child. But a fine soldier all the same. Sunday afternoon. Geof Street had asked us to tea with him at the Continental but was called away and we had tea with Lady & Capt Graham and then took them to the Nurses Club. They are coming to tea with me here in our home on Friday. He's a very nice boy - very musical - plays the organ very well. Private Welsh met us at the club he is a boy who is an orderly in our hospital - a gentleman only 19 years. A very charming boy. Seems very out of place as orderly - and naturally feels lonely. Sister Dowe has been very kind to him and has asked him to play tennis with her at the club and I try to have him with me as escort sometimes. His cousin is a Captain Stewart in the hospital but much older - an Edinburgh degree man. Pte Welsh commonly known as "The General"
