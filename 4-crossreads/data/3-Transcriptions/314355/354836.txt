<p>June 10<br/>195.<br/>In Cassel yesterday bought Phillpott's "Old Delabole", now its finished, a well written tale and of the manner following Thomas Hardy's, it is a tale of &ndash; as Jake would call them, 'cousin Jacks', a tale of a slate quarrying district of Northern Cornwall and of the villiage leaders and followers, but the perfection of drawing comes with the detailling of their religion and their life.</p>
<p>Salute to the Dead<br/>If any ponder in their bitterness,<br/>Doubting the struggle is of little worth<br/>That robbed them of the dearest thing on earth,<br/>Brooding in desolation and distress<br/>Upon a sorrow no man can assess &ndash;<br/>A flaming hope may lighten all their dearth:<br/>That through these throes shall rise to glorious birth<br/>A ransomed world the centuries shall bless.</p>
<p>Salute the dead!  the dead who died so young<br/>(Let each mind lay aside its private pain!),<br/>Who put adventure to the touch, and flung<br/>Their opening lives abundant life to gain.<br/>Salute the dead!  From such seed shall be sprung<br/>Rich harvests from the armies of the slain!</p>

Thank God it will have no strong standing at home "Apres la Guerre".</p>
<p>In future I'll dodge the Commonwealth Bank in the matter of cables, the Military there, "for our convenience" have taken a hand, and forbidden the posting of registered letters to France!</p>
<p>June 11<br/>198.<br/>All the afternoon till evening making great semi-prints of the Strazeele Map for the 2nd Brigade.  Frank brought across to me at the C.R.E. receipt from T.B.C. and from Beaumonts the third book of his press &ndash; "Deux Raptures", the book a disappointment:  "Tides" the</p>
