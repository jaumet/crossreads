1045 Seaplane flew across and went very low across our trenches and the Turks. Their shells bursting remarkably close to her and following her right along leaving delicious looking cream white puffs of smoke cloud. Shot after shot just missed and the trail could be traced by the slowly dissolving puffs of smoke which took a long time to disperse. Got out my telescope and had splendid views of machine - a beauty. Propeller racing in the sun like golden wheel. Could not spot aviator. As soon a seaplane disappeared could hear sounds of another aircraft and biplane passed over in opposite direction but very high up. Artillery also going fairly close to her. Both of them a beautiful sight on this lovely sunny morning 
Noticed 3 or 4 heads and shoulders and some limbs sticking out of side of hill and put the pioneers on covering them up. Am much afraid that when rains occur the sides of this steep hill will slip as there are now very few bushes left ? that natural revetment being gradually taken for fire wood. God knows what ghastly sights stench we shall have to put up with when these land slides do occur. 
A quiet afternoon but busy with odds and ends. Trenches spotlessly clean
