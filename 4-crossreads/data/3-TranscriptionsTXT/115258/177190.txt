space appears between the top of them and the bottom of the coat. A photograph of me would make a great advertisement for "Why dont they use Lux". i was just comparing that photo of Hal in his Uni rig out you sent me and the one of him that Dudley took just before I left. My Word there is a difference! I wonder if I have changed as much - but I dont think so. May have got a bit streekier but I was pretty much that way before. I'm glad Mother wrote to Mrs West. She sent me a card at Xmas time and I think she must be an awfully nice lady. I heard that Chris is on his way home. He has "headed 'em" pretty quick alright I'm not going back to AIF HQ again if I can help it but I ought to know how the cat is going to jump by about the end of this week, so I'll stop now.
Love to Mother & Hal & Fred
I am
Your loving son Robert C Wilson
