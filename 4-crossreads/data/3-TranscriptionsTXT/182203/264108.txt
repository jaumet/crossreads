 I almost wish that I had volunteered for transport duty to Aust. now &ndash; If I get a chance again I shall but am afraid, now the Imperial Folk have commandeered us, we shall simply have to do just as they like. I wonder when this wretched work will be finished &ndash; some folk think very soon, other say  years . We hear very little war news and absolutely nothing about our own brave boys. Think they are nearly all in Belgium. My friends must forgive me not writing but it is very hard to do so here but tell them that  letters  are all we get here. No social life whatever, which I'm sure is very depressing. Ah-me. I should not complain but it is awfully dull after the life I've had &ndash; Shall make up for it when I return to Aust. Hope you are all well &amp; happy. Has Lucy called to see you &ndash; I have not heard for some weeks from her. Hope she is alright. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. From                                            Your loving daughter.                                                                                                                       Edith.
