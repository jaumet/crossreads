<p>NOV. THURSDAY &nbsp;16 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine, but very dull &amp; bleak. The coldest day we have had yet. I was on the manure waggon driving it about a mile to the other side of Fargo Hospital &nbsp;Poss &amp; Bill &amp; self went over to a concert at the YMCA at night &amp; it was very good. My word its a treat to hear good voices singing good songs after the trash we have given us at the shows round the camp. Was issued with two sets of colours&nbsp;for the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Division Artillary</p>
