<p>Went down to Beach again this morning &amp; saw McLaren Lowlands. On way down arranged for Mules to take cases away from Beach. Waited till they arrived &amp; got wet through again. It was bitterly cold. Had long journey back up ridges top escape view of enemy as we were attempting to mislead the Turks that we were evacuating the positions we held. I found 2 cases were missing after everything was checked over but where they had gone it was hard to say.</p>
<p>Sunday 28th Nov<br/>What a big surprise to-day. On waking up found it was snowing heavily. What a picture of whiteness everywhere it was lovely to</p>
