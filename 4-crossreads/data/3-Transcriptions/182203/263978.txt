<p>I am quite clever with the coinage here, have to help my friends often.<br/>Well, we all went to The Palace  but Matron Bell, could not see us until 5. p.m. so did a little shopping  First of all looked down the list of wounded &amp; to my great surprise saw dear old Charlie's name but it was a blessing &ndash; he is doing well. I went to see him to-day but he was out, had to go to Bank to see about his money. I left some of the papers for him.<br/>Saturday afternoon Sister Martin Watts, Craig &amp; self went into Cairo &amp; enjoyed every minute  It is a very dirty place but most fasinating. All speak french, it was great trying to make them understand what we wanted. Sister Watts &amp;  Craig had to leave us because they were on night-duty, so we had dinner    &amp;  then returned to our digging, tired out. Up early &amp; at the Hospital Palace before 7 a.m. Had meals</p>
