7.  I could write for hours on their ways & their goodness to me & to all wounded Soldiers.  They spend every minute that they can in entertaining Soldiers, & visit Hospitals & take Parties all over London.  Thank Mrs Rogers very very much for Her Kindness in giving me Mrs Harberts address.  I told them what she said about being Careful not to fall in Love & bring one of them back to Australia.  They were very highly amused.  I do not think that it will happen though so tell Mrs Rogers I unfortunately will have to disappoint Her.
