<p>France<br/>3rd September</p>
<p>Dear old Mac,</p>
<p>This letter if it ever gets to the size of a letter will be a thing of shreds &amp; patches, I'm reduced to scraps these days (paper rendered useless by my making silly bloomers, mostly &amp; I hear you sarcastically murmur, "You won't need to buy any more").  However I don't suppose it matters much.  I find a chap really doesn't know what he is &amp; what he can do.  If you had told me even 12 months ago that I'd do what I do where I am &amp; live under the same circumstances, I wouldn't have believed you.  When I was in the D.A.C. [Divisional Ammunition Column] <strike>only a</strike> &amp; they asked me if I was open for this job &amp; because I was sick of the damned D.A.C. &amp; wanted to get back to the Brigade here</p>
