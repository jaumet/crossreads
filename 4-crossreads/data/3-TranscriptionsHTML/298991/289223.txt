<p>Friday Oct 5th<br/>No 4, 5 &amp; 6 Military Districts (South, West Australia &amp; Tasmania) were paid today. 10/- only being paid. A shilling per man is being deducted for breakages etc caused during the voyage, It is an enormous amount to deduct,  &amp; the mob are kicking up a row about it. The Officer explained the reason for deduction &amp; said a committee would be appointed to decide what would be done with the suppluc cash after the fee had been paid. We are given a lot of liberty on the ship, one can go &amp; do nearly just as he likes.</p>
<p>Saturday Oct 6th<br/>We have got into the land (or sea rather) of the flying fish. Very big schools of them were observed nearly all day. They are mavellous, &amp; some can fly a long distance out of the water. They are very small. Also saw a couple of sharks go by. A concert was held on No 3 hatchway this afternoon, we haven't very good talent on board. A few of the items were very funny though.</p>
