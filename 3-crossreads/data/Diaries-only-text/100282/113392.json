are classed amongst the greatest fighters in the world, we have a name sure enough, may we never do anything to disgrace our splendid reputation, the Yanks think a lot of the Colonials too, they have told us so themselves, they say that if they can do as well as our chaps have done they will be satisfied I don't think they can pay us a bigger compliment than that, they are sincere. Paris is full of them but strange to say in spite of all you read to the contrary in the papers they are not popular with the French I can't understand this but I have spoken to dozens of French of all classes shades all are of the one opinion, Angleterre or England they all speak well of for they say she is Frances greatest friend she will never forsake her "La vie Angleterre" as they say, all the one time bitter feeling has practically vanished from both sides France England will never fight no more, they all seem sure of that they are pretty well certain to be right.
