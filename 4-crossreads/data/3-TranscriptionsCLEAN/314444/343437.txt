  
 a lot of loafers here always before the Doctor when a man is sick in reality he doesn't get a chance one thing he gets plenty of pills I have only been before him once since I left Sydney and that was to get a tooth out but he would not pull it so it is still there just as well I suppose. the horses are all looking well and fat it is wonderful how they stand the cold of course we put rugs on them in the night you ought to watch them when they get loose they really run mad just like a dog after being tied up for six months. one kicked me in the hand while he was loose but it only knocked some skin off it is alright again kept bathing it. well Aunty I will finish here as I have a lot of letter to write hoping you are in the best of health. from your loving Nephew Doddie
