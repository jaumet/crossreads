<p>May 1st (saturday)<br/>Had to get up very early this morning on account of the noise.  The Prince of Wales right against us started firing her 12 inch guns &amp; anyone who sleeps through that is suspected of not being alive.  I think the Turks must have made an attack, as a terrible lot of shrapnel burst over our positions. There was also 14 shells burst in the water just in front of the Prince of Wales &amp; as they were pretty big ones they are evidently from the Goeben.  This happens nearly every morning early &amp; she (the Goeben) then gets back out of range.  Almost as soon as these shells sink a Trawler goes &amp; rakes them up, so as to find out whether they are from a field gun, fort or Warship &amp; to get the range if possible.  The boys on shore are rattling away merrily.</p>
<p>10 p.m.  The battle is still going strong &amp; seven Launches have been running backwards &amp; forwards the whole day.  They pass quite close to us &amp; you can see the wounded quite plainly.  Some are able to sit up having received scalp wounds &amp; some have their arms in slings, whilst a lot are laying down on stretchers.  The Malda has now been turned into a hospital ship for them too.</p>
<p>May 2nd (Sunday)  The Lieut in charge of a Naval Tug has breakfast with us this morning &amp; he told us that our men made a determined attack at two oclock this morning &amp; occupied another ridge &amp; also that the position is very satisfactory.  There are heaps of dead Turks on the hills &amp; they are piled up one on top of another &amp; as they have been in the sun for a few days, it is rather unpleasant.</p>
