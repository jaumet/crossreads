<p>Wednesday, 24 January 1917</p>
<p>Fine weather at last &amp; we move on to <strike>El Burj, Col. Meredith</strike> has been given 4th Brigade &amp; he wants me to go as Staff Captain - <strike>My chance of a majority here is possibly good but</strike>  I'll go if sent for but it means leaving the old 1st L.H. Near here the Syrians are starving &amp; the Bedouins are out to robb &amp; kill friend or foe, I mean Turk or English. Poor Armenians have been killed &amp; starved to death in 1000s.</p>
<p>2 enemy planes bombed us but our Archies bombed them, one horse hit by empty shell from Archie. These fall all around us from above <strike>after missing the enemy</strike>.</p>
