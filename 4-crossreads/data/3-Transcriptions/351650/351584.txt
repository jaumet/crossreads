<p>I haven't got very much extra news to tell you about our doings &ndash; when I last wrote we had gone to rest and were detailed to instruct the 2nd Army in gunnery and battery work, a very comfortable job I may mention, with warm billets and so on &ndash; also I was to go on leave.</p>
<p>And now &ndash; alas!</p>
<p>We once more have been sent to the big battle, and shall be in action once more in 2 or 3 days, sitting in shell holes and living in some slight discomfort.  What I mean to say is that <strike>whe</strike> we shall not be able to have six course dinners really well cooked.</p>
<p>The mud really is something that even surprises an Australian who has seen it consistantly for the last year &ndash; it is hard to get guns up, and you have to be careful they don't sink.  In one place that I know of several mules and men carrying ammunition were drowned in a mud hole having lost the track at night, and got into a large shell hole, or crater or something of that sort.</p>
