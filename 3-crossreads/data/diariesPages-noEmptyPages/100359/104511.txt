Received long looked for "parcel from Lill, also Christmas Card, and letter from Mother. Hooray, Lollies were much appreciated and so was the pudding, which we made hot and ate for tea, but what appealed to us most was the insecticide. If the big game are as numerous in our next camp as they are here, it will be very handy. All the crowd paraded at Dinner time and complained about having nothing to eat. After a deal of "barney" we got Jam and water, great feed for men to train on. "Longy" took our photos wearing our sheepskin vests. Quite an exciting day. Got orders to pack all our gear and prepare to move to Tel-e-Kebir, all the mob delighted. To finish the daywe were issued with Red Cross goods. I was lucky and got a suit of pyjamas from Miss.Ball, Colac. Vic. Others received socks and shirts.
