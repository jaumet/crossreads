 May 24 May 24 went again to the British Museum &amp; looked over the Chinese &amp; Japanese section.  After dinner went to St Albans with Mrs McKenzie, a nurse, &amp; a Women's Legion girl.  We had tea at Bobbies.  I carried Mrs McK's attach&eacute; case.  Mrs McKenzie had to leave us to see a sick soldier so we walked down the streets to the Abbey.  We went over part of the Abbey, &amp; I was struck with the mixture of early Norman &amp; Gothic architecture in the Nave.  On one side Norman &amp; the other Gothic.
