Without the slightest doubt with the exception of a very few tactful persons amongst them, they are very very discontented lot & when they get & spend some time in the European war zone they will understand & realise what this war has done.  Anyhow since the Imperial Government are running the Transport & not the Company for all their complaints they will never obtain any satisfaction.  We have 6 Indian delegates from India going to London re the recent riots & of the Indian people's greavances to put before the British Parliament. 
 May 12, Monday Fine weather prevails very hot Temperature 87.  Passengers 1st Saloon very discontented civilians.  The Troops appear to be well satisfied.  Civilian passengers still asking for unreasonable requirements & even complaining of the troops being aboard taking up so much deck room.  This is the character of the British Anglo Indians that have never suffered so far through this great war of ours.  Good news this night re the annexation of Ex German New Gunue to Australia
