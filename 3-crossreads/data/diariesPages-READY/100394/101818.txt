Today has been one of the worst in my experience so far. I suppose I felt it more being on guard. We do 24 hours 2 hours on and 4 hours off. It is most trying. Finished at 1800. Went round and saw Russ and Ross. They had some mail a couple of days ago. I wish I could get some myself as I need something to buck me up. A good change away from this place will do us all the world of good.

Another scorcher. They have made the 49th Battery into a Mobile Battery, and they are moving out to the trenches tomorrow. They are taking all our Directors, and signalling instruments &c so I donâ€™t know what we will be doing. Have raised a fine blister on my foot. Went round and saw Bob tonight and got some photos from him. The nights here are glorious fortunately in fact cold. Got word of a big advance in France yesterday by the Allies and only hope it is true.

Watched a Brigade of Infanty and Battery of Artillery move off this morning towards [indecipherable]. Had 6 letters tonight and by jove I must say I was glad to get them, one from Mother Feby 27th, Pater 13th Feby, Lou 16th Feby Moll Man 5th, Mill 28th Feby and Ethel 2nd Mar. I spent a good deal of time reading and rereading them. It is evidently only one mail as all the dates are within a week of one another practically

We got a Corporal in charge of us today from details. Went down for a swim this afternoon with Jack Burke and saw Russ for a few minutes. A good many were inoculated today. Tonight I went round to the opening of the Y.M.C.A. by General McCay in charge of our Division. They gave a very good concert, and the General stated his opinion that we would all be in France very soon.
