<p>August, 1915<br/>Friday 13<br/>My wound is a little more serious than I thought.  101 Temp today &ndash;<br/>Xrayed &amp; a bit of bone out latest instructions to irrigated &amp; dressed 3 times a day [indecipherable] back for a week but I have [indecipherable] not writing too thankful to be here &ndash;<br/>Just heard that Col Stodard of 2 reg &ndash; L.H. was killed Col Rowall 3rd L.H. died in boat. Our Brigade is "Mafish" X but we all feel now that we did our bit.<br/>My 2 Louse Bags are hanging on a nail &amp; my Yass Helmet like a big Balaclava with [indecipherable] window I shall try to keep for future use.</p>
