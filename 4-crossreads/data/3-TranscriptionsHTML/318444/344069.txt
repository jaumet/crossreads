<p>Wed Dec 24th:-<br/>Arrived at Port Adelaide. Left in a few hours after dropping the SA's so we are to have our Xmas day on the water after all our hopes.</p>
<p>Xmas DAY 1919<br/>The only difference in our dinner today that we were saved the labour of peeling the "spuds" on our plates.<br/>The cooks must be after a tip as they stripped the outer casings off. My 5th Xmas Day away from home</p>
