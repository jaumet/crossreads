<p>here that we used to get in the other place &amp; I am not sorry either.  I am sending you another photo of the officers &amp; N.C.O. of reinfor. in case the other does not reach you.  I expect it won't be long before Bob has his 3 stars, there are officers here, with three that arn't as smart as he is.  Ken fears getting into the Juveniles here &amp; if he does he will not get to France for a good while yet.  I believe reinforcements are wanted pretty badly from this Batt.  Give my love &amp; kisses to all &amp; much to yourself.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your loving son<br/>Douglas</p>
