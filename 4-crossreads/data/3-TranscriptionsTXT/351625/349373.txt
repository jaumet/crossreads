next draft from home, they only pay us 3/6 a week while in hospital.  I sent you a photo of the hospital and a view of the town a few days ago.  I am glad to hear the children are all getting well & strong & that Bruce is looking much better.  I would like to see him take on the land.  Altogether there is more money in it than in the city.  He seems to be having stiff luck with the foxes, but doubtless when once he starts he will get a few in quick succession.  I am glad your furs are a comfort to you.
