<p>good to see the old faces again and recall old times.</p>
<p>Wednesday 21st Aug.<br/>About our hottest day. Walked down to the river for a swim during the morning and wrote letters during the afternoon &amp; evening. Received a parcel from N.F. also Australian mail yesterday so all is well. We are moving again but only down to the river as yet &amp; will probably hand over to the 3rd tomorrow. The application for a spell to England was sent through today.</p>
<p>Thursday 22nd Aug.<br/>An extremely hot day being over 90 in my tent. Packed up again today, being once more on the move and I was not in the mood for it being very down and out. Towards evening I felt better &amp; finished packing making an inventory &amp; handing over after tea to the 3rd Fld Amb. Walked down to the river after tea &amp; had a swim. Apparently we are once more about to push the hun, Byng attacking on the Ancre &amp; Mangin round Soissons</p>
