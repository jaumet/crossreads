  
 What's up? We don't know  -  A good deal of feeling at the German flag still flying & one or two inquiries if we might fire on the flag & what wd  -  happen to the chap who fired  -  What wd happen to him? I wonder  - Two boat loads of men have gone off from the Parramatta to the shore & that's all I know & I know as much as most  -  They came round last night to find out who cd handle a rifle & I put my name down as I am a bally  marksman at any rate I can handle a rife intelligently  -  Munn's boy is on the Berrima I fancy & if I get a chance I shall look up any Glen Innes chaps & have a talk  - There is one thing I do hope will happen & it is this - that we stick to all German New Guinea & to all these German Islands  -  This is a superb harbor & a 300 mile island & lots of real good land  -  Let Australia have it  -  never yield save to force  -  All this side of the Pacific should be ours & our flag should fly  -
