<p>Friday Nov 2nd<br/>The ship made its record run for 24 hours today, 320 miles. It will be O.K. if that can be kept up.</p>
<p>Saturday No 3rd<br/>Today was the best day we have had since leaving Capetown. The wind had practically died down.</p>
<p>Sunday Nov 4th<br/>Raining nearly all day. Sea is very choppy today. We still have the flock of birds following us. It is marvellous the distance they follow a boat. They seem to go all the time without a spell. They <strike>seem to</strike> glide through the air for miles, flapping their wings occasionly.</p>
