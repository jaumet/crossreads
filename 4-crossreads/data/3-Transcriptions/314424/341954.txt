<p>over our camp and the surrounding batteries. There is a battery on each side of us &amp; one in front of us.</p>
<p>About an hour &amp; a half later the battery in front of us was repeatedly shelled. Evidently the plane was one of ours that was captured by the enemy.</p>
<p>Valentine, Ferguson &amp; Cliff Thomson returned from leave this evening.</p>
<p>Friday April 5. 1918. 1341.<br/>A dull cloudy morning.</p>
<p>At breakfast time between 7.30 and 8.30 the enemy started to shell a brick wall &amp; house on the side of a hill, a few chains away from us. Later he started searching and came very close to the cook house, when we thought it was time to go. The shells came over thick &amp; fast mud &amp; dirt &amp; fragments scattering among us. But some did not get away fast enough, and Trevena who was going to have a shave was severely wounded, having one leg badly fractured and the other foot broken, also a head wound. Four others were also wounded the cook, Price, and Ferguson</p>
