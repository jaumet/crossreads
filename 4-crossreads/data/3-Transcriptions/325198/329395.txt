<p>22 Nov, 1916<br/>Hill 70<br/>We had a very rude awakening this morning  Was on leave in Port Said, I went down in spite of my assets being low as 30/-, thought the spell in the rest camp would go alright any way, &amp; so it did.  I had all my meals in camp &amp; slept there every night, so did it cheap, pictures, concerts, Y.Ms etc putting in the time in a mild way.  Was sweetly slumbering at six this morning when the S.S.m. came along, roused us out &amp; told us we had to imshie to our Reg by the 7.30 am train so here I am.  Been packing up as we move off to the old desert &amp; closer to Abdul to morrow.</p>
