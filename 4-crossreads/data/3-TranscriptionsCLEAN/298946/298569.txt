  
 we became "in the soup".  I soon ended the situation by putting my foot through the door in an energetic attempt to force the lock.  The panel came away almost whole, so that, as soon as the door was opened it was an easy matter to replace the splinters & camouflage the door as untouched.  If it is found out. the German of 1914 will have to be blamed I fear. 
 To show how exact a horse shoe is formed by these rooms, at the present moment some water seeker is fiddling with the taps in the other small room & through two windows I can see him a few feet away from me.  I hope he turns the tap off properly: the room is half flooded already. Thank goodness I chose the duller but prettier toned paper in place of bright blue & the risk of floods.
