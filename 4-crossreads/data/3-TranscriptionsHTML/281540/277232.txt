<p>23/10/15<br/>Abdul put out some wire and pulled in his firing line a bit in one place last night.  Rumours of big moves on mainland and in the West.  Quiet day but busy with returns. It has been cold.  Up to present I have worn shorts and bear knees but nevermore while this snap continues.</p>
<p>During after noon with Curnow went to B8 secret m g post and searched the Turks trenches with telescope.  Really their work is</p>
<p>wonderful, the trenches are fortifications we will never shift them from with anything but the bayonet and a force about doubled.  Trenches covering the hills and in some cases going back hundreds &amp; hundreds of yards.  Through telescope could see them moving about one chap walking along trench quietly dressed in grey overcoat, two others chatting and some more using a crosscut saw.</p>
<p>Thurlow, the Kings prizeman lying in his snipers nest with telescopic rifle, telescope &amp;c watching them waiting his chance for a kill.  Tried a shot or two at 1500 yards but the strong wind spoilt his shooting.  He roams round all day waiting a chance and generally gets a couple of "kills" at least per day.  Nothing doing in evening.  Abdul has some fine entanglements out, trestles facing Lone Pine &ndash; a very real obstacle to an advance.  All the A Co lads growing beards making it very hard to recognise them.  Lovely sunset.  Bed 2053.  A wintry icy day</p>
