<p>Friday 23 April 1915</p>
<p>More preparations to-day and several departures of troopships from Port Mudros to the outer harbour, Lemnos Bay.  And needless to say, the Australians instead of paying the usual compliments to passing troopships by standing at attention, wildly cheered their comrades in this Gallipoli expedition.  We expect to be right in it within at least twenty-four hours, provided, of course, if the first landing parties have left us anything to do.</p>
<p>To-day General Hamilton received a message from the King which appeared in a special order from General Headquarters, "The King wishes you and your Army every success, and you are all constantly in His Majesty's thoughts and prayers".  Neat and effective but not inspired glorious close.  "Remember", said Lord Kitchener, when bidding adieu to your commander, Remember that once you set foot on the Gallipoli Peninsula, you must fight the thing through to a finish.  The whole world will be watching your progress.  Let us prove ourselves worthy of the great feat of arms entrusted to us.  Inspired words, soldierly and worthy of a Ceasar, which made a profound impression on our minds.</p>
