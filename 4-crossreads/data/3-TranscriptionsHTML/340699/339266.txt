<p>It's over an hour since the guns ceased grunting, but as soon as it's dark, no doubt they'll begin again. Presently I'll make my way round to old "Remus" tent and hear the yarns told.</p>
<p>June 20, 1918<br/>This morning not feeling well, and the weather gusty and rainy I stayed in bed; that is, on the loft floor with two blankets and an overcoat. In any event I could not have worked, as my materials were not dry. I was very stiff from my drenching of yesterday, so I welcomed the chance of getting a rest and snoozed until about half past three; then got up, shaved and washed and to a little farmhouse for a glass of milk. Then I hied me to an amiable blanchisseuse and after some friendly debate regarding change, got it and my washing. Then back to the billet and lay down till tea-time - five o'clock. I felt better then and was on the point of going out to sketch when, down came the rain, so a little earlier than usual I began my letter. There has been almost complete quiet to-day and I have no news but heard indirectly that the Italians have disappointed the Austrians; I hope it's true. Last night f---- was requested by the General to show him his work and was much pleased at the appreciation shown it. The General in private life is an architect and a man of taste and he congratulated f. on both the quantity and quality of his work, and said that he must have a competent and responsible officer to show him things of interest. So, on every favourable occasion he will be whisked off to the scene of something significant. It pleases me to know this, as f. is a dear old boy and his work has charm and is far removal from the banal.</p>
<p>ST. GRATIEN, June 21, 1918.<br/>L. McC--- paid me a visit to-day. He looked well but complained that as yet he had not received his materials and was making out with scraps of paper. I gave him my water colour box to help him out and when his arrives he will hand it over to me.</p>
