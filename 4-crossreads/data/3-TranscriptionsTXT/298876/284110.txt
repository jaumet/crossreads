L.H.F.A.
Twas on a bright January dayThe Good ship Wandilla sailed awayFrom Pinkenba that place that smellsAway they went to the DardanellesThe last of the 14th L.H.F.A.
A little band of 8 were theyWith a motto of P.O. each dayAnd a happy day it will beWhen they reach the shore of Gallipoli
The last of the 14th 2nd L.H.F.A.A soft spot they had for their officers fineAs well as for comrades left behind in the lineAnd respect they are held by each of the 8Will be stronger than even when they reach Berlin 'Gates"By the last of the 14th L.H.F.A.
Left home for Alarayt
