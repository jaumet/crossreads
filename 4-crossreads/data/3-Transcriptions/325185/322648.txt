<p>The whole journey was very pretty. I wouldent have missed it for anything. We are only about a mile from the railway station (Zeitoun) I haven't been across there yet. Have been across to Heliopolis &amp; Cairo. There is no doubt there are some very fine buildings here. Sydney wouldent get a look in at one corner even. I can't describe what they are like. Will get some card's &amp; send across to you. I am going to take a run out to the Pyramids on Saturday evening. We are about eight miles from Cairo.

The Australians have certainly educated the niggers here. They certainly can swear some &amp; don't forget to use it at all times. It is nothing to be passing one he will want to clean your boot's or something &amp; refuse him he will promptly call you a (bloody bastard) or some other choice expression. They brought a kangaroo across on the boat. I believe when he was put on the wharf. I believe there wasent a nigger to  see. I dident see it but I believe there was a scatter</p>
