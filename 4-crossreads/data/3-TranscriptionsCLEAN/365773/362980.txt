  
 touch with Aussie girls again. I met the nurses whilst trying to find Sister Herbert at our 3rd A.G.H. near here, she wasnt there & a very nice sister asked me into their mess gave me tea, introduced me to other sisters - now we blow along & see them any old time. The Australian officer is inclined to cut loose when out of the line & these girls know it & for our own good they get as many as possible to go & see them & I suppose trust to the restraining influence have some affect on us. Hoping you are keeping well my dearest sister Your loving brother Ken Niddrie Marischal Craigmillar Midlothian
