  
 Saturday 27th October 1917 
 Wrote letters, breakfast in bed every morning. At Midland Hotel, every Room had Telephone alongside bed, Clock illuminated over door & fresh fish kept in a pond to chose as you liked. Luxury if you like. Went St. Annes & saw the Church where we were married. Evening went to the Theatre, rain all day & all night cold as anything. 
 Getting Dolly to pack gradually. Laura is at [indecipherable]. My cold much better.
