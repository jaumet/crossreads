 NOTICE This message book is to be carefully preserved for actual messages in the field, otherwise you may be without the means of writing a clear message at a critical moment. Messages should be addressed to the abbreviated designation of the unit which the addressee commands, and should be similarly signed, unless special circumstances make it important that names should be given. See pages 58 and 58 FSPB 1913 with regard to the writing of messages. Sender's number is only required for messages of which it is desirable to keep a copy. WRITE CLEARLY BE CONCISE AND DEFINITE
