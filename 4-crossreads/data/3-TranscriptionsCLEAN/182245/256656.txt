 MAY 1917 
 21 MONDAY 
 Fine & warm. Cleaning harness in 
 morning & I went out to load 
 amunition at L'Epinette dump 
 in afternoon & was there all afternoon 
 We juggled about 5000 18 inch 
 shells & it was no holiday either 
 Heard Fritz was strafing our 
 positions. Went up with the 
 waggons at night & found Fritz 
 had knocked thing about a 
 bit & set fire to the dump which 
 was still burning with 2000 
 rounds ammunition in it. He 
 put a few more over while we were 
 there. D & F sub guns were outed 
 & had to go to ordinance, & a 
 couple (Serg. Kill & Bom Dowling) 
 got slight shrapnell wounds. 
 Gunners lost all personel 
 equiipment ect except what 
 they stood up in.
