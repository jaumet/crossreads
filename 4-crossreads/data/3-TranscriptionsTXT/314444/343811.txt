[If] that should be I do hope my little chaps will grow up with a strong sense of patriotism and that they may shew it to the full if ever need be.
Mrs Larkin, in her last letter to hand said she might come to Egypt. How delighted I should be to see her, but for her own comfort I hope she will not make the trip. I might be in France or any where when she arrived here and possibly not have an opportunity of seeing her at all.
Ta ta for the present,Yours very sincerely,E. R. Larkin
