<p>15.11.17<br/>Dear George, Just a P.C. in answer to your letter of 11.9.17 . It was too cold to stay in the Room writing, to I'll  go for a walk &amp; then come back &amp; turn into bed. Ellis has gone to Salisbury. Glad that you are learning to drive a Motor. It is handy to  know how. My old Motor Bike is O.K. if it has a new maggie. Don't sell it until you have had a good trial. With a new maggie.  she ought to be good for all we want her for.  Every other part is as good as new, is new in fact. With a new maggie she is worth &pound; 20. Use her yourself. It will be handy to have her, but a new maggie &amp; perhaps Carburetter &amp; fittings maybe necessary. I have not very much news because I have not been out lately. I am too restless to stay in to-night. A walk around the block may put me right. I just had some photos of Manly sent me by an old Friend who lives at Inverell. I get parcels from Her &amp; also from LOTTIE Watman who works at D.J's &amp; Mip Robson also. I have never met them and don't know what they are like. I am careful how I write to them but they are good to send me the parcels,  Harry</p>
