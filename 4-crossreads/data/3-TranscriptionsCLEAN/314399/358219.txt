  
 Sunday 10 August 1919 A big storm early this morning. A lot of hammocks. blankets & clothing got washed overboard. Had a muster parade in case we had lost a digger but everything was correct. Am on guard again. My hours are 9 to 1 twice. Not at all bad. Bonny breeze all day. Played my tournament game of quoits with my partner. We won fairly easily. I played poorly tho. 
 Monday 11 August 1919 Nothing to do all day. Fairly windy all day. Played patience & 3 handed bridge. Supposed to be opposite Sierra Leone this afternoon. Am going to bed early 10 pm.
