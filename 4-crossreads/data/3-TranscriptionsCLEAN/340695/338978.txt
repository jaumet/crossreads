  
 trees were all shattered & in some cases only stumps were left. German shells of huge calibre ("duds" & abandoned) were scattered all over the country as were small crosses marking the place where fell a soldier whose life was given for his country. One of our chaps was buried near the roadside & for a cross his rifle was stuck in the ground & a pick handle placed through the trigger guard on top was placed his steel helmet through which a bullet had passed. This was near Le Gars & it was near this spot I met Arch Hobden marching back with a section of stretcher bearers I got a shock to see him thought he was in England in one of the hospitals. He was in this great advance & his experiences will be worth hearing.
