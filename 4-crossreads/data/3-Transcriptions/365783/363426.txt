In the innermost chamber of each tomb was placed the sarcophagus containing the mummy of the departed monarch.   Close to the tombs of the Queens are the Colossi of Memnon two huge seated figures of King Amenophis III.   These are in the middle of a field of wheat, while we were there the fellahin (peasants) were engaged in the interesting operation of threshing the wheat, using the same implements as were used thousands of years ago.  A number of the poorer peasants live in some of the tombs it looks queer to see them climbing out of their eerie holes as one passes by.    Arriving back at the hotel in the late afternoon I felt pretty sore after the long donkey ride &amp; made arrangements with the dragoman to provide me on the morrow when we had to do another big ride with a nice soft sheepskin cover for the saddle.   The donkey boys that run along with you to hold the beast when you get off have a nasty habit of whacking the donkey when he slows down, the donkey resents this &amp; slews over to one side.   On several occasions I very nearly got a capsize during this slewing movement</p>
