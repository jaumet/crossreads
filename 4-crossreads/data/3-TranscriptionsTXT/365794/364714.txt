C. arrives 9.30 a.m. & says may go down to meals.Lunch 12.30 p.m. an ordeal, all strangers & oh how out of things I feel.  4 p.m. tea in sitting room the same.  All talk is of past experiences Mudros, Gallipoli, Salonica, etc. - shall I ever I wonder have any experiences to relate?  Weighed 133 lbs = 9 stone 7 lbs, feel about 2 stone as regards strength.My room is a little bit of home with its sweet smelling roses.  Gave most to Home sister for our sitting room.
