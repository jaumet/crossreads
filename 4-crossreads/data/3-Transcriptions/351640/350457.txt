<p>When I opened my tin trunk this morning it was found that water had got amongst the books and papers and that many of them were wet.  A nuisance.  Jerome is now drying them by exposure &amp; later will put them in the pantry in a heating apparatus.

<p>Our clergyman is Colonel Ney [Nye], a <strike>Bapt</strike> Methodist from Victoria.  He told me that he is a Chaplain of the first class, &amp; while holding no substantive rank is entitled to be saluted and addressed as Colonel.  He is of the "fancy" religions, according to the Sgt. Major, who formed up his battalion on a church parade &amp; said:  "Anglicans to the right, Romans to the left, Presbyterians to the front, and fancy religions to the rear."  It was common belief that there were but the <strike>first</strike> three first in the Army, others just have been added to the Commonwealth forces.</p>

<p>When shall I have another opportunity for communicating with you I do not know, but when it offers some sort of a letter will be sent on</p>
