the leave Train pass through afterwards I went out & into the Church Army Hut in the little enclosure to have a rest until the Train arrived from Calais.    As I was sitting inside I heard Tommies laughing & I went out side & saw a number throwing Snowballs at the W.A.A.C. Girls as they passed & when some returned they had some Snowballs ready & they retalaited on the boys, both enjoying the fun, several of the Girls came in side & bought Tea & Biscuits & sat down at the Tables & enjoyed a few minutes rest.  At  2.30 Pm I left the Hut & again went into the Station & in a few minutes the Passenger Train arrived & after taking my seat the Train left at 2.50 Pm for Hazebruick arriving there at 3.45 Pm where I had to change into the Poperinghe Train which left at 4.30 Pm & after a good run we arrived in Poperinghe at 5.45 Pm.   I then went out & along to my Belgian friends & had a cup of Coffee & some biscuits, as there were a light Engine leaving for Regersberg at 7.30 Pm I said Good bye to my friends & left again for the Station arriving there at 7.20 & found that the Eng had left only a few minutes, so there was nothing left for me but to go along the road in the hope of getting a lift.   I only proceeded a short distance when along came a Motor Cyclist with a Carette attached
