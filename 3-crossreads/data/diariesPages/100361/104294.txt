Wed Dec 25. Xmas Day.
Started the day well by having Stew for Breakfast. It is a very cold dismal sort of day. During the morning we took our seats, tables and mess gear down to the Dry Canteen where we having Dinner. At 1 we "fell in" and filled into the Canteen. It was gaily decorated with Holly and mistletoe, and the Tables were laid with nuts and other good things. We had Turkey and Pork and Vegetables and Jolly good Plum Pudding, and Beer. It was quite a good Xmas Dinner. 
After that we filed out of the door and each man was issued with 2 pkts cigs, 1 cigar and some chocolate. The cigars were quite decent, and I exchanged my cigs for cigars.
During the afternoon each of us was issued with a Red X Xmas Parcel, which contained cigs, tobacco, and various other good things. At 7.30 there was a Concert which was one of the best shows I've seen for some time.
Taking it all round, it was quite a Good Xmas Day, but I hope it will be the last I shall spend away from my B.E.
Thurs 26. Boxing Day.
There were Sports on today at Westham, and many of our chaps attended. I would have gone myself but the boots I'm wearing nearly cripple me. They are only issuing second-hand Boots now and I'm hanged if I can get a pair to fit me.
Fri 27.
On Monday I put in for 4 days Leave from Jan 3 to 7. I hope it comes thro? as I?d like to see a bit more of London before I sail away to the "Land of Sunshine" again.
Sat 28. 
Walked out to Westham after Dinner, but everybody I wanted to see was away on leave. Jack Cox, Perce Taylor and the Q.M. Serg; so my long walk was all for nothing. Had Tea at Y.M. and returned to Camp about 8.30. There are a no. of Boat Rolls to come out shortly, so my name ought to appear among ?em.
Bert Berry is in this Camp, like myself awaiting a Boat. Saw Maj. Irving this morning who gave me an order for a pair of Light Boots, which are quite decent.
