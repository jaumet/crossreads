Save your money
8 When tempted with a sandy thirst7 When the risk in the deserts done8 Just slake your thirst with waterA can of boys beer's piastre oneSave your Money.
When eating stew for seven daysMultiplied by seven without end,And you feel you'd like something solid boys
Just buckle your belt to the end.Save your money
