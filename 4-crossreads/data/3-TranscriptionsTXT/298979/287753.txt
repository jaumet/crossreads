 or the shells would burst close enough to cause the men to go "over the top" to "fill in" holes in the parapet that would otherwise render it unsafe. 
 Whenever shell fire bursts close "in front" a watch must be kept to see that none of the shell holes are near enough to render the parapet dangerous even to rifle fire. If a shell hole is made in the parapet within three feet of the trench this width of earth would not be sufficient to stop a Rifle bullet let alone any thing heavier hence a constant inspection of the parapet must be made when shells are bursting "close". 
 The work of "making" the dug out was very hard indeed on account of the anxiety to have the work finished in the shortest time possible. Three shifts working night &amp; day were kept very busy for weeks 
 The "Dug out" was forty feet deep and was entered by means of four sloping shafts with steps Upon these steps only four men were posted and as each man had to throw sand bags, three quarters filled with dirt, at least ten feet &amp; keep going for eight hours it was no wonder the men perspired although the cold was so intense in the middle of this exceptionally cold winter. 
 An idea of the intense cold could be imagined when it is known that when each Company moved back from the line &amp; camped in properly lined huts (holding about sixty or 70 men sleeping close together in two rows) with a "Brazier" at each end the fires in which would be kept burning till at least midnight &amp; yet by 6 O'clock in the morning the boots of the men (having been taken off before "turning in") would all be frozen so hard &amp; solid that it would be quite impossible to put them on, even if placed under the blanket at either the head of foot of the bed. In consequence of this two orderlies had to be appointed to provide
