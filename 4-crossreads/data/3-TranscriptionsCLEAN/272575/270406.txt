  
 one of the men who was with him was wounded and sent over here but I do not know which hospital he was sent to and do not know his number so cant write to him to find out.   I may hear before I leave for France.   There is very little news of any sort here, the place is very dull except on Payday.    then some of the crowd make things lively for awhile.   must stop now.   Give my Love to the Relations when you see them and thank Aunt Nellie for her letter   I will write to her as soon as possible.   Heaps of love to Mother and Father and yourself. From your Loving Bro. Chas. G.P.
