<p>5/2/17 Beaucamps. Le. Vieux, Amiens <br/>we found a whole regiment drawn up en masse in our honour and standing like blue statues at the present, - the officers with sword hilts to lips. At a loud command they came down as one man to attention and remained rigid. Their steadiness under arms was admirable. Their officers told us they are untrained men equivalent to our Base Details. Back to the Mairie where we found tea and cake set out for us and the British &amp; French flags intertwined. Returned to Amiens via Poix &ndash; a large village and we had a clear run right to Cape Godbert where we dined. After that I separated from the others as they were returning home and after going to Gare du Nord made for Gare St Roch. Must be making some progress in French as we managed (a French soldier &amp; I) an animated conversation and he could speak no England. He had been called up from the Congo where he is a Civil servant, to join A.S.C. and has family &amp;c here. A good chap and ready to give information. He showed me Gare St Roch and then returned to Hotel Belfort which was full. Same tale also at another but Hotel de Rhin came to rescue. Secured a bed and asked to be called at 4.30 a.m. to catch the early train to Rouen. Not quite so cold tonight. Practically no bed clothes but had blanket in pack</p>
