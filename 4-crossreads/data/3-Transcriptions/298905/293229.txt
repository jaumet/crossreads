<p>old trenches &amp; ditches are everywhere &amp; they can so easily hide in them.<br/>We are going to follow a new rule as far as we can in the future as regards fatigues each party will be given so much to do &amp; when they are finished they can do a get it is much more satisfactory than the old way of working on till knock off time for then they never know when they are finished &amp; naturally loaf as much as possible, the aim of all men under the old system was to do as little as possible , talk about the Goverment stroke" its not in it with the boys on fatigue under the old style &amp; you couldn't blame them for the more you done the more you might.<br/>I saw Len &amp; his party of snipers this morning going up the trenches.<br/>This afternoon myself &amp; 2 men went down to Fleurbeaux to get some things</p>
