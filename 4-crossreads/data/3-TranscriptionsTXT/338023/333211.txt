You must be having a darned rotten time in the office - but stick to it; I've got a 'kinder hunch' you'll get out on top in the end.
Tell old Jim I'm sorry to hear that Resch's have gone off & hope they'll recover their quality by the time I get back to Maroubra. Had a letter from Brookie's cobber - you'll know who I mean - but no parcel has arrived yet. Brook sent his kind regards etc, so don't forget to return same from me next time you see him.
I hope to have more news before long - when we get on the guns in earnest, in the meantime must ring off as its nearly near to Last Post & I'm afraid to go home in the dark on a/c of the flood.
By Gum, if old Noah was here in Seymour, he'd have a lively time sending out doves!
Yrs to a 'D.A.'Harry
