The Little flower that was in your letter, I got just after Easter Monday in a ruined garden.  there were a few violets there but they would not press.   also Daffodils, we did not hunt Fritz out of that village, one of the other lots had that job.   a little before we went up to that part, I like your verses that you sent and I am putting them with my collection,   I had several rather pretty poems that I culled from home papers, but I managed to lose them, sometime ago.   Then I had to start afresh,   Some of M. [indecipherable], verses are very pretty, I had some of them, in the book.   Sometime when you write would you send me your Lines, "Children of Empire",   Bett would copy it out, now I must close as there is no more news.   heaps of Love to all, at Ben Eden St. also to Uncle Billy & Aunt C. when you see them, also Hilda & the Youngsters,Heaps of Love for Yourself fromYour Loving son Chas.
