<p>Thursday 20 September 1917</p>
<p>Alex:<br/>Went to the BOURSE or Cotton Exchange to see Cotton sold not unlike our WOOL SALES. The row that is made in foreign languages. Cotton prices are booming &amp; Egyptian Cotton is the best grown in the world.</p>
<p>Last night a dance was given at the Hotel &amp; I joined in, the foreign girls all dance beautifully, wear nice frocks but a bit overdressed when they undress for a Ball. Usual English dances Waltz, One Step &amp; Fox Trot - <strike>men in boots &amp; no gloves</strike>.</p>
