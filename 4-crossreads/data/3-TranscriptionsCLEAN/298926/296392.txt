  
 I heard a gentle whisper - It was the voice of God. 
 I saw the spirit of my past so happy and so free                                          The spirit of the future held it's claw-like hand to me                                                And with a courage sent by him I staved the awful grip                                 The shackels burst asunder by the prayer which left my lip. 
 I looked back on the life I left and dearly paid the toll                                             Twas not the body that counted most but the cry of a tortured soul                                                  And the death of a noble self-respect that once had been my pride                         They were the things which counted most and what is Life beside
