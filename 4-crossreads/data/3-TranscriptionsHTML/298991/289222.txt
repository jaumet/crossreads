<p>Tuesday Oct 2nd<br/>The weather is getting very much warmer now, I suppose we will be getting it very hot soon. The crew thinks it will take us about 8 weeks to reach Sydney, something to look forward too. The food is keeping very decent on board. Rained fairly heavy this evening. We just had our beds made on the hatchway, when the rain started to come down, of course we had to go below then to sleep. It was terrible hot &amp; stuffy down there.</p>
<p>Wednesday Oct 3rd<br/>This is a very good life. All the fatigues are permanent, so I haven't had anything to do &amp; by appearances I wont have anything to do, not if I can help it. We play cards all day to pass away the time, generally Bridge.</p>
<p>Thursday Oct 4th<br/>The sea here is very blue, about the bluest I have seen it. Awnings have been but over nearly all the hatchway, &amp; ventilators put down into the lower decks. One can now raise a perspiration, without doing anything.</p>
