<p>Wish this dreadful war was ended.</p>
<p>Received a nice letter from Annie Howard  written about the beginning of Nov. &ndash; it has been to Egypt. Shall try to write soon to my friends but tell then it is freezing &ndash; so please excuse.</p>
<p>Hope the darling little pet is quite well again. Heaps of love   &amp;  kisses. Shall try to get a P.C. for him.</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  hope you are all well.</p>
<p>From</p>
<p>Yours lovingly</p>
<p>Edith.</p>
