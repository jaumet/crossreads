 The Arabic word for 'The Night' you see Girlie wrote to me aying she did not like Esm&egrave; as name so I send this new name 'AL-LEIL'  which is a present from Egypt if she cares for it. 
 Of course I dont wish her to take it if distasteful to her, but it sees rather a good name if people refrain from converting it into ALLY SLOPER 
 Just think how grand it will be to see a new fairy story in every bookstall someday by 'ALLEIL' illustrated with [goggliewouk?] kind of pictures by sister Shiel and then to read the reviews in a magazine and an article on her methods and her parents with a portrait of a mute inglorious milton and an unheard Melba.
