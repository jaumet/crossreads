 Fine but cold morning. The whole Battalion marched out at 9.15 am to the high ground near Quesques. The Band represented the barrage and the attack was not badly carried out. Groves sent up a good smoke S.O.S. Complications were caused by a supposed failure of the battalion on the right and a defensive flank had to be formed. This had to be done in a gas attack represented by smoke. At the same time Dooley had to exploit success on the left flank and a counter attack from supposed enemy was to develope behind him. After the show had a conference of the officers and discussed the faults. Rode to Quesques after lunch to the Bde. horse show

 where we had stiff luck throughout getting three seconds. Our cooker was undoubtedly the best and our other entries were well up to the standard. Our men were splendidly turned out and smart. The whole brigade (except the 21st) put up a very good show. Colonel Durrant was a judge and there was much gorgeous Staff there. Jack rode the winner in the officer's packs. Went home about 5 and brought Jack along to Mess. Afterwards the family gave us a cup of coffee and we yarned with them for a while. Then spent the evening talking about things in general. Plans and details now to arrange for a Bde. stunt on Saturday.
