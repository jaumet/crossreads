chips, fried bread, bacon, etc not bad you know, but the night before the rats pinched our meet we done a skinner, after breakfast, Starkey handed over his ammunition stores to the incoming Corporal, while I handed over the whole concern to the Sergt. then set out to find the Battalion. On the way down I had to report to Div Hqrs the officer in charge of Ammunition said he was very pleased at the way we carried out our duties, he hoped the next lot would be somewhere the mark.
There was a false gas alarm just as the Battalions were relieving I believe it was dead funny the antics some of them were cutting.
