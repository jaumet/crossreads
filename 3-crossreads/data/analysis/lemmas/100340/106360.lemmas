 everybodi was well oil well you can imagin the scene . Everyon tri to rag on the grass fall all over each other . It was inde a veri merri even . Do not know what to think about the past parcel it may have been your . At ani rate there were two book two bottl of home made jam tin of salmon two tin of sugar a pair of sox . It was most welcom but I do wish they would put a slip of paper in it so as I will know who it is from . Do not be at all surpris if you do n't hear from me for a month as we are go up the line tonight I have no envelop left cannot buy ani for love nor money
