Fine & warm. Shore leave was
granted. We got into the wharf
at 6.30 AM and started coaling
right away. Got off at 10.30 AM
and went up town with Lt Morcombe
met Lts Jeffries & Smith & went out
to Haupt Bay & back round
Table Mountain & Groote Shuur.
Called in to get a feed of grapes
on the way home and struck
some jolly fine prople - the Betrams
& spent the afternoon with them.
Had dinner at the Grand Hotel
& went to "The French Maid" after
but could only sit out the first
act & then came home to bed.
