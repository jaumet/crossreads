Small supplementary diary to finish year 1916.
14-12-16No parade this morning so after breakfast prepared for a good sleep. However, about 10 were called out to go and get wood from [Berngsoy] for cooks &ndash; (all section). Couldn't get any axes or saws so it was postponed until 10 o'clock when we fell in. Carter &amp; Tompkins came back last night &amp; Tennison 3 days ago. Section sergeants and officers gone to the line to-day to mark out our work which is I believe second line work. Got plenty of wood in the pontoon wagon and rested in the evening. Wrote one letter to Melv. Cloudy.
15-12-16Nothing to do so fixed my future diary Kernot went to trenches this morning. Cloudy raining [indecipherable]
