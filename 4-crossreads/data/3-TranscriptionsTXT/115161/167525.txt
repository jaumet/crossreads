  A BIT ABOUT MYSELF  
 My name I need not mention, let it suffice that my friends call me Gill, while I am known as Gillie by some of my friends of the sweeter sex. I am not related to the makers of the famous razor-blades, bearing a name similar to my own. 
 I enlisted in March 1916. Left Australia for the front in September of the same year. Returned to Australia in July 1920.

Ah, well! 
 I am only just a dark very undersized, insignificant, sober-minded being, of a most selfish disposition, and as the case with small men, conceited and quarrelsome, and mean to a degree,
