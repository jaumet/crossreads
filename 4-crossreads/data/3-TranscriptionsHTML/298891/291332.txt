<p>6 Thursday</p>
<p>Busy day as Brown came down sick from Scotchevin &amp; a new tent had to be set up. Dear Guys said goodbye at 7.30 &amp; then sat at station all day so we had him back for a second farewell at 8 p.m. He was crestfallen &amp; disheartened so I cheered him by drinking out of large jug.</p>
