 doing very fine & solid work. From the date he went up into the line, the Pad says he never saw Myrton without a smile on his face. He & Fergie used to keep the show going, & keep every man in good heart. They never got flurried, & always smiled & joked. He mentioned particularly the terrible bombardment of May 5th. Myrton had to run his show just as Fergie was doing on his left. The Pad came up next morning, & he said it was a terrible sight, & getting things fixed up, & in the next trench Fergie was doing the same thing. The men told him that all through the bombardment they had been going up & down quite coolly & cheerfully, & that they had put great heart into the men themselves." 
 The foregoing, I think you will agree with me, is a very fine recoed for our sons to have left behind. 
 I am Yours faithfully
