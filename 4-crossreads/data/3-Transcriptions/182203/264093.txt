Had a Miss Nicholson to show &amp; guide us around, an awfully charming woman, who has lived there all her life &ndash; her father was one of the Governors. &ndash; she gives all her time to give the Colonial men, officers &amp; sisters a good time &amp; show them around Windsor so we were very lucky.<br/><u>Wednesday</u>, went into London early, saw Miss Conyers, enquired after my friends    &amp;  relations fighting but could not get any news of them.<br/>Then we had lunch afterwards &ndash; went to Constitution Hill, to Queen Victoria Monument in front of Buckingham Palace. It is a wonderful monument &amp; adds very much to the beauty of the Palace, in fact it makes the Palace.<br/>It was a perfect afternoon &amp; the Park looked beautiful, went to Hyde Park but not through, because we were on our way to St. Paul's. Well, so far St Paul's is the most cheerful &amp; bright Cathedral I have seen in England. The Statues are very grand</p>
