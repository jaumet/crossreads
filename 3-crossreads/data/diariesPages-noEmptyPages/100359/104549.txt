some tinned fruit with us in the waggon and had tea before we started out. We "tore" into it and got finished just on 8 o'clock. Capt. Nance gave Trousdale 50 disasters to buy beer with for the crowd, but when we got to the Canteen they were sold out, so we had to fall back on the Y.MC.A. where we got a drink of Lime Juice. We got back in camp about 9.30.

Last night A Section got orders to prepare for a Field Day with the 5th Division, but it was cancelled during the night. McDougall and I on Sanitary Police, another hot day. 115 degrees in the shade, and the water has been off nearly all the bloomin? day. Nuggett Bennett returned from Alexandra.
Friday 19th
McDougall and I on Sanitary Police. It is not such a good job here as it was in Serapeum, as have no niggers to do the work, but have to "turn to" ourselves. Snowy Hargreaves gave me some gaslight papers and we printed a few good copies, which will be very nice to send home.
