  
 December 1916 22 continued   afternoon, Pritchard & I went down & found Smith's grave near Bernafay Wood (in the Bernafay Cemetary) took a couple of photo's & intend sending them to his mother whos address is in the back of this book.  Fritz has been shelling "Lone Pine" very heavily to-day & has caused a fair number of casualties. We received orders to-day to have our kits packed, ready for an early move on Sunday morning.
