<p>26.12.15<br/>Sun 26th.<br/>Arrived at Alexandria about 10.30 this morning &amp; had to wait anchored out till 5 oclock as all the wharves have ships alongside. It is very interesting watching the sea-gulls of which there are thousands fighting for the food thrown overboard it is also amusing to see the police boats hunting away any boats that make our way after Baksheesh but the police themselves are as bad as the others so long as their Officers are not looking;  Filed off the Hororata onto the train about sundown &amp;  were soon on our way to Cairo</p>
