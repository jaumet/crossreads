<p><strike> I seem to have lost Railway Map which I take out of Railway ride so am not  enclosing it. Fred </strike><br/>1st Field Amb<br/>1 Aus Brigade<br/>1 Aus Division<br/>Aus Intermediate Base<br/>Egypt 24/2/16<br/>My own dear Sister Irene,<br/>I am today acting as guard over a water cart - &amp; am taking advantage of the spell to write to you. I wrote to Mrs Carter &amp; thanked her for the sox she was so good as to send me. I enclose herein a map from a Railway Time Table &amp; have marked on it where we are camped &ndash; so if you call to mind <strike>w</strike> your last journey to Australia you will very likely be able to picture me as I sit on the sand of the Desert &amp; write this. The water cart guard is a priviledged person, is not made stand up all the time, so I am not neglecting my duty by writing to you.<br/>There are some miserable little gnats here like flying</p>
