 Monday 25/12/16 Xmas day Blowing your whiskers off. Rained early but cleared a bit Promises to be a flat Xmas no parcels no letters for a month & very little from comfort funds. Also great disatisfaction with our know all sergeant last night & the night before kept us out about 31/2 hrs instead of two as we are supposed to do will make it hot for him if he is not careful, drunk whilst on duty is not the sort of thing for a sergeant to be found out in, its just spite & nothing else He's an apology for a man anyhow. Never does a tap, marches round cookers all day or else sits round a brazier & comes out at 9 PM to put lights out. Pay 2-3-5 18.7-0 finished up again at 10 P.M.
