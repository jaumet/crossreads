 Tin Dish 7.12.14 Dear Guy, I am writing a sort of a diary so&acute;s to save writing big letters at mail times &#151; Lord knows when our next mail day will be! -- and so&acute;s to save trouble am making a carbon copy. One goes home and you get the other &#151; I hope &#151; so if you come across anything superfluous or meaningless to you you&acute;ll guess it&acute;s meant for home consumption. The small pistol is a great success &amp; gives excellent direction up to 100 yards &amp; a bit; the elevation at that distance is of course a bit uncertain as it means a full foresight and thats almost enough to hide a small target. I am still far from a good shot but having got through 3-400 rounds (with some assisstance of course) notice considerable improvement. The motor engine is not too bad: had an hours job getting her to go nicely the other day but now she seems alright tho&acute; I fear the consumption is pretty solid. We&acute;ve had no real trial but I should say she gets about 12 miles/gall out of a heavy dingy 18 ft. long &amp; about 5 ft. beam -- a seagoing boat &#151; &amp; pushes her along at about 7-8 knots with four people in her. So long my son: we may have some luck before long. I wish to the Lord you were here: it&acute;s a most interesting country: would like to explore it with you. Don&acute;t forget to make plenty use of my gear if you get the chance &amp; keep it till I come back for it too &#151; it&acute;s yours till then. If I could see a chance I&acute;d get you to send me another 1,000 rounds of .22 long but don&acute;t just now. Let&acute;s know if you get my scrip for Caldwell shares and hang tight to &acute;em if you do, they are going to be worth a fortune: it&acute;s better than the ponies anyhow. Well: Happy Xmas &amp; New Year in case I don&acute;t get another mail. Love to Nell &amp; Johnny. Yrs A.B.D.
