 [Sunday 10 September 1916] 
 (Gum Ck) !!!  Went to Ealing &amp; saw Cotton family had Tea &amp; got back by 5 all were well &amp; old Coles full of Munitions work. No sun today.  Mrs L. showed me your last letter dear little Mother I never "commanded 2 Brigades" this would be an Army Cols or General's command. I was Camp Commandant at SOHAG, but that is different altogether, only discipline Sanitation &amp; Licenses etc etc.
