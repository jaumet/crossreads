 JUNE &nbsp; THURSDAY 15 &nbsp; 1916 
 A fairly decent day. Some of the officers got ashore but none of the men. I did not get an answer to my cable but may get one tomorrow. Had a physical drill parade in morning after our full marching order parade. And had a lecture on harness from Far Searg. Armstrong in afternoon. The roumer going round that we leave in morning, so wrote &amp; posted a couple of letters (Linda &amp; Mother) They got most of the 9 th &nbsp;Brigade on board at last.
