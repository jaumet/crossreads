13/8/17 Rouen
view is to be had of the crowded and the surrounding green plains of Normandy. Up here there is a church perched in the height. Inside it is all blue and meant to represent the sky. Came back to town and dined tete a tete at my hotel and spent a long time talking. Then ran them home by taxi and came back myself. Several times today little French carelessness in customs re latrines etc caused me some apprehension and made me fear the worst but these girls resident here so long look the other way. They remark also on what strikes me the prevalence of over eating among these people one sees here. The saluting in these streets is a terrible nuisance and over the odds. Their looseness in morals and grossness are French habits that are objectionable give me our own good honest Australian girls like these nurses. Met also this afternoon ? a straight out piece of goods.
