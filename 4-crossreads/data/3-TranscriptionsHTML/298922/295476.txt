<p>Saturday 9 June 1917</p>
<p>Well we've had our Field day &amp; took the positions. Two of our Officers were decorated with Croix de GUERRE etc. &amp; when the French General presented them, he <u>kissed</u> our hard faced officers who stonily stared in front of them.</p>
<p>After, we marched past in clouds of dust &amp; returned to Camp very thirsty.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  No cable from Dolly think there must be some mistake &ndash; or I would have heard re Father's death. I have written her, that some of the Officers have been Kissed by more than a French General in Egypt!!</p>
