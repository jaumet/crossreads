Sometimes I feel sorry that I didn't give Laurel her wish but still Sis I'm not home yet one never knows. Give little Miss Noni a heap of kisses for me tell her, her silly old uncle is playing soldiers again somewhere on the map. Give kindest regards to Vol's people tons of love kisses for yourself. You ought to have had quite a number of letters cards from me by now because if I don't feel in the humor to write letters I send cards. Once again good-bye good luck best wishes for all your welfare happiness from your Brother Hal.
