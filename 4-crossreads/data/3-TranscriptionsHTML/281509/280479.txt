<p>13 September 1916<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>Duties. Cloudy dull days. Nothing doing much. Tug o3' War. Stroll across to Y. M. C. A with Bob &amp; Mac. After writing several field postcards to friends. Coffee &amp; biscuits &amp; yarn to members of 47th Batt. To bed. Luckow &amp; his doings in London. Ugh! That such could boast of such</p>
