O.C.s Squadron keeping one horse only.Wet & cold & I cannot shake my cold off.Polo team in Cairo doing well, winning all before them, against the pick of the English players & the pick of all the Ponies in Egypt.Stilling living in uncertainty in regards to embarking but I do think the end of the month will see us away.
