<p>mostly gassed I think as their were many more sick.    The guns were firing with their teams fully harnessed standing to ready to more at any moment.   Fixed C. Section up with dressings, from my stock now getting very low.   Packed up again before dark as I guessed we would be moving in the morning.</p>
<p>Sunday 7th April<br/>    Orders out to move back to "Daours" &amp; take over from the 15th Field Amb.   Went down in Car with my gear at 9 A.M. &amp; took over the Dressing station which they had established there in the school.   Spent most of the day arranging this place to deal with sick &amp; wounded my section running the place.   Made up a requisition for drugs &amp; dressings which the [indecipherable] collected for me from "Namps".   Went round the village with the Major to choose another place to fall back on should our dressing station be shelled as we expect to be at anytime.   It was a sad sight, most of the places had been vacated by the owners without notice &amp; the soldiers had systematically looted everything.   Not a nook or corner had been missed &amp; clothing etc was strewn</p>
