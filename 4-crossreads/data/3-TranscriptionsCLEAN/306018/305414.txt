March 1917camel on the way.  Drew rations for the natives & the camels & it was past 7 when I got the camels fed & barracked for the night.
Friday 30thThe Brigade came back in the morning to camp & I followed with the camels, filled up at the wells & distributed the water.  After dinner sent all the camels to the Lake & watered them.
Saturday 31stHad an easy time distributed the camels among the Bgde. drew the rations & then shifted camp.  All the Divisional water & Hospital camels are being put together, so I handed my camels over to Lieut Fisher.
Sunday 1st AprilAustralian mail arrived today.  I got 2 letters.  There is artillery & rifle fire every day, but there has been no infantry attack on either side.  We get good surfing every day & the water & weather is just right for it.
Monday 2nd AprilManaged to buy a good supply of cigarettes, oranges & eggs.  They are nearly impossible to obtain here just now & are very dear.  We got an issue of bread first for over a week, but are still on the bully beef.  8 "Tanks"
