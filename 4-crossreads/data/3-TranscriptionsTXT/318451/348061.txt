 Demonstration in the Cinema (26th Jan. Australia Day).  Capts. McCook &amp; Mills gave addresses.  I read &amp; prayed, Cutriss gave out the Hymns. Mills came back with us to tea. 
 Saturday 27th I went to A &amp; B Billets &amp; arranged for Church parade tomorrow at 2 oclock.  The weather continues very cold, the coldest snap residents say for many years.  Today's Times says that in Paris people are dying with the cold &amp; I can well believe it if they are at all exposed.  All the ponds are frozen over &amp; our men are having some skating.  The ice is quite 6 inches thick &amp; snow has been lying on the ground for nearly a fortnight &amp; is powdered like sand &amp; the ground frozen hard.  At the Cemetry today they had to use picks &amp; chisels to a depth of over 1 foot in order to dig the graves, the ground here is usually saturated with water &amp; can easily be dug with a spade.  There were 17 degrees of frost, the Thermometer registered 10 degrees Farenheit &amp; 7 to 8&deg; below zero Centigrade.
