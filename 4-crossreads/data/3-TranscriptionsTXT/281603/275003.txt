 March 1917 April 
 Battery football &amp; won by 13 points to nil.  After about ten days hard training we had to pack up &amp; moved again towards the line &amp; marched about twelve miles &amp; stayed at Montouban for the night.  Our next move came next morning &amp; went as far as Fremicourt &amp; throughout the whole of the march it snowed very heavy and we were wet through when we reached our destination but we soon had a big fire going &amp; dried ourselves.  During the afternoon of the next day the 5th we again moved off &amp; releived the 53rd Battn. in the firing line &amp; I took charge of a post situated on a big railway bank the far side of Velu but I only had charge of this post for a few hours for I was releived by another platoon 
 36 &amp; at dusk I had to make another post further out.  During this time the Coy had sent out patrols &amp; found that the enemy had evacuated for some hundreds of yards so before daylight our platoon advanced about 3,000 yds and dug in, in a big bank.  As soon as we reached the bank I was again sent forward about two hundred yards &amp; with four men &amp; had to dig an outpost &amp; came in at daylight then had to dig ourselves a "posy" &amp; then had a good rest.  Next night two more platoons came forward &amp; dug in in supports to us.  On the night of the 7th one platoon again went forward about three hundred yards &amp; dug in in a sunken road
