<p>2<br/>a bit showery here lately &amp; the crops look A.1. &ndash; I milked a cow yesterday out in one of the paddocks not far from here, much to the amusement of some French people who owned the Farm. &ndash; They just take a three legged stool to wherever the cows happen to be &amp; proceed to milk - &amp; the cows just stand quietly &ndash; But probably you saw this often on your trip in the Car through France, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Belgium or Holland. &ndash; Are your sweet peas flowering yet? &amp; has Will started getting men to prepare the paddock next the House for the planting of Fruit trees? &ndash; Some people say that June, July, Aug are the best months for planting fruit trees. &ndash; Alister Stobo was here several times lately, &amp; sent me such a nice new Suit of pyjamas I wore them last night. It was quite a treat, for they are the first pair of Pyjamas I have worn for about eight months. &ndash; How are Will, yourself &amp; all the children? By the way</p>
