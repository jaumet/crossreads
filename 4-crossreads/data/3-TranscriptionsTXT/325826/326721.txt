Sunday Feb 27th. 1916.My very dear Father & Mother,Yesterday afternoon Rid received word that he was to report at Tel-el-Keber and to-morrow morning he sets off there.  It has been so delightful to be together again that it seems harder than ever to think of settling down alone again.  In Alexandria I had got more or less used to living by myself and should not have felt it quite so much perhaps, as after being together again but still it has been so lovely to have this unexpected little time that one could not wish it different.  Rid's throat seems quite strong again & he himself fit for duty I am thankful to say.  I think the change of work will probably be good for him though of course it will be a much rougher life in many ways.  The camp at Tel-el-Keber is better than the make-shifts at the Front but it is decidedly rougher than those close to Cairo, from what we hear, like Zeitoun where Wal is now.This afternoon we went out to see Wal & had a couple of hours with him & Rid said his good-byes for the present: Wal himself may go to Tel-el-Keber later, & as I have mentioned Leo seems to be there now.  Rid is going to hunt him up & chum up with him on every available occasion: it may not be as simple a matter as it sounds for it is a huge camp there & the artillery may be miles from Le's company.  In case you are in any doubt
