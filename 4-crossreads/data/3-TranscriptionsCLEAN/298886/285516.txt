  
 hard biscuits and water can be called breakfast. In a few minutes the 1st Light Horse Regiment were on the boat and away they went. We stood against the rail and as thought we were never to see them again we said "goodbye boys Good luck!" not seeming to realize that as soon as they were emptied out and the boat returned our turn would come. We stood fascinated watching the shells of all calibres plonk into the water having overshot their mark or were aiming at the boats which were bringing reinforcements. We also watched with much interest a field gun planting shells all along the place known as Anzac Beach. It was our old friend Beachy Bill who now has a world wide reputation. His place of abode was Gaba Tepe or somewhere in the neighbourhood Anyway wherever he resided all the Ships of the King's Navee and all our shore batteries and our aeroplanes and in fact every device known to us could not shift nor knock out Beachy Bill.
