<p>Am very fit &amp; well really but I want to come home.</p>
<p>Well there is nothing more to say, we are all out of the line resting but we hear the guns rumbling at times, suppose we'll go back some day.  Longest day today.  Now it will be looking forward to autumn &amp; winter, Ugh.</p>
<p>Love to Mac &amp; the Boss &amp; Grahame &amp; yourself.</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Jim</p>
