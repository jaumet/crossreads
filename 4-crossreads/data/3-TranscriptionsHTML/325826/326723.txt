<p>3.  Since I last wrote to you Rid has been putting in most of the time with photography, taking the pictures in the later part of the morning &amp; earlier part of afternoon, developing them &amp; fixing in the evening.  He has only taken off prints of a very few it used to take rather much time doing them one at a time.  He wants very much if possible to get up a lecture with lantern slides at the end of the war on Ancient Egypt, he thinks that everybody will be talking about the war and modern Egypt and when everybody is tired of hearing &amp; seeing about those perhaps his "Ancient Egypt" will be useful.  Not immediately after the war of course, for I think for some time people will be interested in nothing much else because it has come so close home to most, but his idea is that if he can get it up properly his lecture would be good always, the ten years ahead or more.<br/>He is not neglecting to take street scenes &amp; typical people &amp; things because of course he will want to have a talk on that too, but a great deal of time has gone this last week in taking photos of mummies &amp; tombs &amp; inscriptions &amp; things in the Museum.  We were doubtful whether it would be possible to get photos in the Museum, whether the light would be strong enough, but they have been a wonderful success.  He just had to guess at the time exposures for the first film and was as happy as a school boy to find that they were just right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    If only we had had any idea that we should be so long in Cairo there were several trips that we should have taken that would have given some splendid photos, but you see we were afraid to go anywhere fo more than half a day in case of peremptory orders coming any time.  However it is possible</p>
