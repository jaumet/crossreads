<p>Bulford<br/>16.3.17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>Your letters of 15.1.17 &amp; 21.1.17 to hand &amp; I will write as much as I can in answer to them.  I suppose You found Burwood a little strange after being away for so many years.  If I had to move away from Manly, Burwood would be my next move.  I like old Burwood.<br/>We have had various reports about the Venetian Carnival.  It seems to have been very nice despite the hard times.  Poor old North Steyne only got second in the Relay, still one can't always win.  The days are lengthening &amp; the Birds noticeable the skylarks are chirping away every morning   My, the skylarks are lovely &amp; seem like Canaries when whistling.  I will send the Souvenir to Marie.  She is a great collector of things in that Line.  I'll remember Your advice about the DSO.  We are always glad to hear that You have visitors, especially Bess.  She is not one of the lazy ones &amp; is always so bright &amp; cheerful for everyones company.  What has happened to Victor Davies, our Windsor Cousin.  We have not heard of Him anywhere.  Yes, I was very surprised to hear of the change in things at Marlborough St.  The Blighter had to put lifts in after all at a cost I suppose half as much again as it would have cost</p>
