Mena Camp8 miles from Cairo31st Jan 15My own dear SisterAs I write, I am on night duty in one of our Hospital tents situated about 1/4 of a mile from the great pyramid. We are camped on the sand of the Desert & as you may judge are not too comfortable. We hope we wont be kept here very long, but of course must put up with conditions such as they are.Poor old Will feels very homesick I think as & I myself do also. How are you all? I must thank Irene for the nice Xmas Card she sent me. Hope you both think my left-handed writing is improving.How very lovely it will be when we all come together once more after this awful war is overTonight I went round to the Infantry camp & saw Stan Meek. I am trying to get him a Transfer into our unit & Will is helping me. Will is Major in Charge of the whole Camp, our part I mean. There are about 20,000 Twenty thousand Australian Troops camped here. It is a wonderful sight. Sister Stobo has been very kind indeed to me. She is a very fine woman. It is now 1.30 AM & our hours are from 9.P.M till 6.30 AM. Very much love to you allEver your loving brotherFred
