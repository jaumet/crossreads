16/7/18LondonF. Dickens K.C. try Curzon & Lawson on a charge of financial conspiracy. Back via Trafalgar Square to the R.A.C in Pall Mall to read the evening papers. Noticed little girls dressed in pages clothes calling taxis &c. For dinner to the Cheshire Cheese in Fleet Street and had a good dinner. This old quaint place is my favourite resort for dinner but you have to pay for its oddness. Took a 'bus down to Trafalgar Sq which seems to be a concentration point for all the stray Tabbies Anzacs and others about. It keeps dark light until well after 10.30 and remained so until long after. I had packed up for my trip tomorrow and had changed back into uniform. An aeroplane flying over the city seems to attract a lot of attention.
