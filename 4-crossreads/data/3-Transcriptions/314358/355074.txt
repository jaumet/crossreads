<p>The Arabic word for 'The Night' you see Girlie wrote to me aying she did not like Esm&egrave; as name so I send this new name 'AL-LEIL'  which is a present from Egypt if she cares for it.</p>
<p>Of course I dont wish her to take it if distasteful to her, but it sees rather a good name if people refrain from converting it into ALLY SLOPER</p>
<p>Just think how grand it will be to see a new fairy story in every bookstall someday by 'ALLEIL' illustrated with [goggliewouk?] kind of pictures by sister Shiel and then to read the reviews in a magazine and an article on her methods and her parents with a portrait of a mute inglorious milton and an unheard Melba.</p>
<p>I am sorry for dear Ethel losses which seem to our poor intelligence to be for ever, are indeed hard to bear, are they not dear Beatrice.</p>
<p>But there is large hope beyond our understanding leading to greater and grander stats.</p>
<p>Think dear how this bitter war has brought heavy loss to many</p>
<p>Keep well and jolly and do sing right out to Egypt for I may hear. Theres only distance between<br/>love to my Mother and all<br/>love to our children and ever and always your loving Geoff</p>
