<p>These Divisional Baths are godsends. &nbsp;You can get a complete change of underclothing there. Hot water is always on tap in sprays. You can&#39;t go there any old time, but there are bath parades. &nbsp;It is amusing to see the thousands of pairs of socks of all sizes, colours, @c, shirts @c hung&nbsp;out to dry. The labour is generally by Belgian or French peasant folk.</p>
