<p>Larkhill<br/>Wednesday 16th August 1916.</p>
<p>My Dear Parents/.<br/>An Australian mail has just arrived and I was delighted to receive two letters from Mother, and also a Lismore paper with news of G.T. Hindmarsh's death.<br/>I am still leading a life of luxurious ease at Larkhill although all around are toiling harder than ever preparing for the front. Our picnic will come when we get there. The weather has been too wet lately to go on our usual rambles round the district as we have had to be content with indoor recreation during our spare time.<br/>The infantry are kept hard at work lately. They are now going through their musketry and trench work. Each Company spend three days and nights in the trenches digging fresh ones and practicing attacks &amp;c. under real active service conditions. My word they are a picture when they return, especially during this rainy weather, - covered in mud from head to foot. I took a snap of a party just back and will be able to send it with my next letter.<br/>They practice in the trenches too with live bombs. Those they are using now are only small about the size</p>
