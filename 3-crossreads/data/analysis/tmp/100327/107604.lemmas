 30/9/15 1045 Seaplan flew across and went veri low across our trench and the Turk . Their shell burst remark close to her and follow her right along leav delici look cream white puff of smoke cloud . Shot after shot just miss and the trail could be trace by the slowli dissolv puff of smoke which took a long time to dispers . Got out my telescop and had splendid view of machin - a beauti . Propel race in the sun like golden wheel . Could not spot aviat . As soon a seaplan disappear could hear sound of anoth aircraft and biplan pass over in opposit direct but veri high up . Artilleri also go fair close to her . Both of them a beauti sight on this love sunni morn Notic 3 or 4 head and shoulder and some limb stick out of side of hill and put the pioneer on cover them up . Am much afraid that when rain occur the side of this steep hill will slip as there are now veri few bush left ? that natur revet be gradual taken for fire wood . God know what ghast sight stench we shall have to put up with when these land slide do occur . A quiet afternoon but busi with odd and end . Trench spotless clean
