<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>We got back alright I met Noel and Jim and we went along together. On Milson's Pt. Station Jim met Dr. &amp; Mrs Beatty who had a large bottle of trifle which we showed to the men in my tent, then out and ate. It was 12.30 then and before day break &ndash; well you know, and all the next day. Well on Monday I fixed up my transfer and now repose at nights with Jim in the A.M.C. I was lucky enough to get onto a ward straight away. Last night a married chap died, and I'm afraid he was not too well attended to. He was in dreadful pain all night and I don't believe they quite knew what it was but roumour says meningitis. The men are great: as cheerful as larks, and they pinch away as often as they can. They all curse the lying in and many seem as if home nursing would be good enough.</p>
