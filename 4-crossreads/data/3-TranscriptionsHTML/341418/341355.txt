<p>As I declared I would, I managed to carry all my clothes etc with me to Kantara, but now I am really travelling light as I left everything there except one blanket, one shirt,  &amp;  3 prs of socks.<br/>Last night I had a severe shock, I dined off some boiled meat, both cold  &amp;  greasy,  &amp;  found to me horror  &amp;  astonishment that I was enjoying it immensely! Truly its time I returned to civilisation.</p>
