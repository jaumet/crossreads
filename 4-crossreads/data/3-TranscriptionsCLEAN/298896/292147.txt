  
 good to see the old faces again and recall old times. 
 Wednesday 21st Aug. About our hottest day. Walked down to the river for a swim during the morning and wrote letters during the afternoon & evening. Received a parcel from N.F. also Australian mail yesterday so all is well. We are moving again but only down to the river as yet & will probably hand over to the 3rd tomorrow. The application for a spell to England was sent through today. 
 Thursday 22nd Aug. An extremely hot day being over 90 in my tent. Packed up again today, being once more on the move and I was not in the mood for it being very down and out. Towards evening I felt better & finished packing making an inventory & handing over after tea to the 3rd Fld Amb. Walked down to the river after tea & had a swim. Apparently we are once more about to push the hun, Byng attacking on the Ancre & Mangin round Soissons
