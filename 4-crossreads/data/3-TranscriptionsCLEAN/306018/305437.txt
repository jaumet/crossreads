  
 June 1917 bad order & could hardly eat anything  Everybody was busy cleaning saddlery, bits & irons today as the G.O.C. Desert Column is inspecting tomorrow. 
 Sunday 10th The GOC inspected us at 10.30 am  Everybody hates inspections & he was freely cursed everywhere for all the trouble everybody had to go to. However, everything passed off alright.  He said that B Sqdn. horses were the best he had seen & that the men also were looking splendid & fit.  Our bits & stirrup iron got an adverse comment, so I suppose we are in for some hard rubbing in the future.  More beer was issued out, 1 bottle per man.  Was feeling much fitter today.  Heard that the Tommies advanced last night & did good work near Gaza.  Don't know if it is true.  Good news also came from France where the British & French have both advanced. 
 Monday 11th to 18th The weather has been getting hotter.  We get an issue of beer now, a little more than a bottle per man per day. I had my 29th birthday during the week.  It turned out as expected very dull with nothing to celebrate it
