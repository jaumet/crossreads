15/5/17 Mametz
A day of Court Martials. After making an inspection of the huts went to 21st H.Q. and there sat with Colonel Watson Maddrell of the 23rd Battn. There were about 14 cases and during the day we finished 2 and partly finished a third. Awarded two sentences of 10 years penal servitude. Some tall swearing in the third case ? one of theft against a Sergt Cook. A piece of the evidence. "I sez there's fishy work ?ere, the Sargints run the rule over Jerry!" which being interpreted is that the sergeant had stolen things of one Withington dubbed "Jerry" as a nickname. In the evening presided at a meeting of ptes. N.C.Os officers regarding a sports meeting. Orders are now out for our move to Bouzaincourt but were cancelled late today by Division. Today it is rumoured that the Huns have retaken Bullecourt. Work today ? Specialists, rifle shooting on the miniature range and some general bombing. General Gough was round.
