Shortly after breakfast a new monitor was towed into the docks & tied alongside a quay.  The 2nd & self walked across and had a look at her.  She was almost finished but many workmen were employed putting the finishing touches to her.  She carries only 3 guns, 1 9.2, 1 18lber & 1 aircraft gun.  The huge 9.2 is nearly half as long
