If I have to cable for money (which is most unlikely) especially in these reagens I will try & use the word you mentioned.In your letter you put "Another think I want to say" Am afraid you are falling horribly from grace while I am away & I will have to do a lot of correcting when I get back. Arnt I a bumpious young prig?2 days later.  Have not had time to finish this before, but every thing in the garden has been lovely the last few days. First of all there was the big mail then a backseech issue of tinned fruit, sardines, milk & lime juice from the War Chest, then Dawson got a parcel with tons of chocolate in it and yesterday West & I got off and rode over to the sea for a swim & had a real picnic.We bought sardines and managed to get some soda water & a tin of condensed milk each; which we mixed up together & drank and it made us both feel very bad for a bit after it.We have also had a good concert in the YMCA. There is a jolly nice piano there; it looks funny to see it under the shot torn roof but it never got touched itself.I was making inquiries about Leycesters wound yesterday. It seems to be only what is called a "Tourist" one here. That is one that does not do you any harm but is good for a trip some where -That parcel has not come yet but am still expecting it unless somebody has thought he needed shirts more that I did. Must stop now. Love to FatherYour loving sonRob.
