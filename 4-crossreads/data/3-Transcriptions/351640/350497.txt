<p>6.1-15. Epiphany or as my dear Mother taught me 12th Day, i.e., Little Christmas Day.  Mother M. Pius &amp; M. M. Bertrand probably had the same instruction in the days of youth.</p>
<p>A.M.  The Arabian coast is in sight.  We are due at Aden about 2 p.m., about 8 p.m. on Wednesday with you.  Advices say that our stay will be but for one hour, that a letter bag will be sent on shore, that no stamps are available, that orders are expected directing to our next destination.  Would it not be awful were we sent South to Zanzibar?  From such fate:  good Lord deliver us.  'Twould be worse than New Guinea or Rabaul.</p>
<p>You each day have news of what is happening by land and sea throughout the earth we know nothing from port to port.  However we must be content and try to perform a worthy part in the great game.</p>
<p>Good bye now my dear.</p>
<p>To M. M. Joseph &amp; her worthy Sisters my best wishes and a request for a membrance in their prayers.</p>
<p>To you, heaps of love, loads of kisses, and desires that your life may be useful  long and happy.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving &amp; affctnt Faree<br/>John B. Nash</p>
