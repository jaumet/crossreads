<p>Sunday 9 January, 1916</p>
<p>The weather was dirty early in the morning but during the afternoon it has been lovely, even the birds, we have some canaries on board seem happy &amp; all singing away.</p>
<p>The air is warm &amp; the sea is a lovely blue, it is a delight to be on it even if you are in an old tub of a transport.</p>
<p>We came in sight of land towards evening but did not go into harbour.</p>
