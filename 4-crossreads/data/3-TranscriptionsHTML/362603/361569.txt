<p>Bulford<br/>X'mas Night<br/>1917<br/>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,<br/>Just a few lines on this lovely night to shew that we thought of You all.  It has been a lovely day &amp; is now a perfect moonlight night &amp; not a cloud in the sky.  I had a real good dinner &amp; Ellis is away having His now.  I am going now to Dave after I finish this short note.  I went for a long walk this afternoon &amp; Ellis came part of the way with me.  He won't walk anywhere &amp; I prefer walking the Downs to sitting in my Room.  We had a small present from the Y.M.C.A. &amp; smokes from the Red X.  Marie sent me a box of sweets &amp; I had about 6 or 8 X'mas cards from various English Friends.  I hope that you all had a nice Time we had Roast Duck &amp; plenty of everything so we fared as usual, well.<br/>Well, Dad &amp; Mum &amp; George, I've nothing of note to tell You.  We are both well &amp; living as comfy &amp; happy as possible.  We have no end of Friends &amp; cannot want for anything except our Manly Home.<br/>Best of Fond Love to You all<br/>Be Merry &amp; Bright.  We have to be &amp; are always.  We live to return Home soon &amp; that keeps us Buoyant<br/>Yours always<br/>Harry</p>
