[Wednesday 2 August 1916]
Night outpost tonight very quiet & very weird.  This Desert is fine Sand different to LIBYAN Desert which is stony & you could hear any one approaching.Here Camels are absolutely silent- while our horses neigh & rattle bits & irons.  MONITORS shelled enemy lines from Mediteranean today.I said yesterday the Devils dropped no darts but in another part of the Camp they threw out 1000s especially over the poor CAMELS, Little 6 inch steel arrows like they dropped on the Peninsular & capable of going clean through a man-  I believe the [indecipherable] setting Flags stick Pins in one too !!!!
