<p>A couple also alighted about the same time. On arriving in the town I rode into the Place Victor Hugo &amp; seeing a small restaurant went in &amp; took a seat between two French soldiers where I soon set to work on a good feed. Then went round to Base Headquarters (old French barracks) &amp; had a wash &amp; a brush-up. From here I proceeded to the Grande Place, past the Town Hall into the pretty Public Gardens which presented quite an animated appearance &ndash; British, French &amp; Australian soldiers as well as civilians. I ran up against a couple of French Scouts here &amp; after introducing myself to them went for a stroll with them through the Gardens. My time being extremely limited  I soon had to say "au revoir" &amp; after buying a supply of postcards set out about 4 30 pm on the 33 mile run back to camp. St. Omer has</p>
