<p>Sunday 18th November 1917</p>
<p>Went &amp; saw Laura who is getting on well. Then I went &amp; had lunch with the Cottons, the wife going to some friends Capt. Riddles. Laura will be up tomorrow, she gave me your letter of Sept. 9th &amp; JOES, a long interesting letter of Home news. We are off tomorrow so post this.</p>
<p>With love from both to you dear little Mother.</p>
<p>We go by all sea route &ndash; P. &amp; O. from Tilbury Docks Tomorrow.</p>
