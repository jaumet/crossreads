<p>October, 1915<br/>Wednesday 27<br/>Heavy bombardment by Howitzer Naval guns &amp; Field guns &ndash; 2 of our men wounded, most of us have good dugouts, but Fleas are bad, the men recommend changing the shirt &amp; then the Fleas die of a broken heart walking around &ndash; too cold for <u>Bugs</u> but some [indecipherable] of Scotch Greys may be met. Have not had my clothes off yet, too busy getting under ground &ndash;</p>
<p>We get messages heliographed from the War ships who get it by wireless, the principle events in the <u>world</u> each day.<br/>Among the above pests may be added the odd centipede &amp; scorpion.</p>
