13th Oct 1917 - Near Caestre & Fl&ecirc;tre resting, or rather supposed to be, as there is not much rest in a muddy place like this in wet weather. Leaving Kruisstraat near Ypres on evening of 11th. we rejoined Bn. at Montreal Camp. The next morning 12/10/17 the Bn. moved up the line, but myself & party came back here in motor 'buses. Very damp ground even inside the tents.
