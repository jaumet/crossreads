<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>Just a line to let you know we have joined the 2nd Batt.  Except for bits of colds we are both very well &amp; not feeling the effects of the winter at all yet.  In a few days we will be on the move so will be having a pretty rough time from then onwards.  So far the ground has not frozen about here but we may expect it to do so any time now.  By Christmas</p>
