<p>about 6 p.m. &amp; join my squad. Pts. Short, Sheer, &amp; my old pal Fred Wiggins were in the squad. All round the Loading Post were crowds of German prisoners &amp; German wounded. I saw very few of our own wounded. Our squad had to report to the R.A.P. arrived there at 7 p.m. We had a few carries during the night, but of course the conditions are excellent, when compared with those, during the months of August, September, &amp; October of last year. No shell strewn ground to carry over, but beautiful country, &amp; good roads. The Infantry etc. in our division drove Fritz back, &amp; grabbed a big haul of Prisoners.</p>
<p>26th. April 1918. &ndash; 1st. May 1918.<br/>Twenty four hours at the R.A.P. &amp; they were relieved &amp; reported back to the loading post. The idea is a good one &ndash; every third day our squad proceeds to the Regimental Aid Post, which means that two days are spent at the Loading Post, placing the wounded in the Ambulance cars. We do our own cooking at this post &amp; some good meals we have had "believe me". Some of the items on the menu were, pancakes, custard &amp; rice-puddings. The cooking utensils &amp; food were obtained from a village nearby.  It is far better to collar these stores than to allow them to lie in the village to be destroyed by shells.  I look after my comfort also, found a mattress in good order in a deserted cottage &amp; carried, or rather struggled with it for about half a mile back to our Post. The sweat poured out of me, and you should have heard the roar of laughter,</p>
