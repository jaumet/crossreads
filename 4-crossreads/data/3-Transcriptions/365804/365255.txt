<p>France<br/>September 7th 1916</p>
<p>Dear Mrs.Richards,<br/>Being orderly for your son Captain Richards E.S. I have a duty to do which is painful to me, as it is to you, it is dealing with the last few days of Mr.Richards On August 22nd 11 am. Mr.Richards went over towards the enemy trenches to gain some information, but on returning to our line was shot through both  legs by a machine gun bullet, he was immediately brought to the dressing station, he was then transferred to here (3rd C.C.S.) arriving here 9 o'clock the same evening. On August 23rd your son had his right leg amputated above the knee, the same evening he was in good spirits and slept, but next day complained of pain in his left leg. he was then operated on which eased him of pain for a few days. Captain bore his pain and trouble without a complaint, always thankful for what little could be done. On the night of September 5th 1916, 11.30 pm he passed away without pain and looked calm and contented. Mrs.Richards, I feel now, while I am writing, I have gone too much into detail, but I would like you to know all.</p>
<p>Mr  Richards was buried here in the officers graveyard, he had the Union Jack on his coffin and a bunch of flowers which the matron brought for him. I was personally at the service and grieved to think you were so far away. May I say a few words in favour of Matron Davies and Sister Strawen who devoted nearly all their time on your son, night and day, they saw to all the comfort and ease he could possibly obtain while undergoing his painful struggle. Your son also had many learned surgeions, and Sir Anthony Bowlby and Colonel Smith made several visits. Well, Mrs Richards I am going to take a few flowers to your son's grave tonight, before I rejoin the Battalion. Mr Richards asked me to let you know all, and I must say he is a credit to all, he was liked by all, and was a leader of men, cool and calm in action, and is missed by his fellow officers. He has alway been a good master to me, and I miss him more than I ever missed anyone before. All his personal belongings I have seen them forwarded on to you, which I trust you will receive as soon as this letter. Now Mrs Richards I must close trusting in God some day to be able by mouth to comfort you for your great loss, and let you know about his army career.</p>
<p>Well again, I must close<br/>Remaining your obedient servant<br/>(Sgd) E Bigsshel  (326)</p>
