6/10/18 Beaurevoir Nauroy
Our time was today put back an hour. A raw day and dull. Marched to trenches and bivouacs near Hervilly. Just near the Canal passed a terribly congested waterpoint with a thousand horses at least. We marched over deserted country for miles and ended up at L22 where were dugouts shelters. At 5 pm rode to Hesbecourt Church where all the CO.s of the Division were assembled and met General Rosenthal who told us G.H.Q said there was talk of Germany Austria wanting an armistice. He also discussed the matter of the 21st disbanding and ordered that it be proceeded with at once. Returned to BnH.Q. and held a conference of O.C.s discussing the recent battles that we took part in. All were tired out and glad to turn in.
