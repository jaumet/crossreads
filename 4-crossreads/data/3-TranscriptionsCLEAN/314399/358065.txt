  
 Sunday 9 March 1919 No parades still on account of the rain. Wrote 4 letters. Went out to Bill's cousins & had a great old time. Kept them full of laughter. We told their fortunes by cards etc. Sang quite a lot. Had a very pleasant day. Just managed to get our train. 
 Monday 10 March 1919 Wrote letters all day & went in late to bring out a team. Everything was goodo. Very quiet. Had parade today.
