My castle in the air is to get through as much work as possible between August and March next as I intend going to Australia about that time either with or without the family, I hope with.
If we could rent Palmer's place even at a stiff rent it would be worth it and we could maintain perfect upkeep & even improve if he met us fairly.
I don't know what Maurice is like as regards his work or intentions but if I can carry out all my various programmes I shall need an assistant.
This will probably be the last of my long letters & I shall just send you short notes to keep you in touch so that my wire asking you or Maurice or both to meet the Crock will not come as a surprise.
My very best love to (Conky Weedle) Constant.
Yours EverG.W. Lambert
