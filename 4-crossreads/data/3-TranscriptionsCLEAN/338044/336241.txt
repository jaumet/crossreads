14th August: MondayArrived on duty, tired as usual & the same droll work in anticipation  During the morning the rain came down in torrents, but only in showers    & again, but not no hard, in the afternoon. We had our lunch as usual at soldiers club, but if am to eat any more eggs will soon grow feathers. This place has nothing but eggs, day after day & they become more than monotonous. We go down down & pay a good price at a decent restaurant & really enjoy it, but of course, the French habits will never do us. Impossible to obtain tea & sweets  After dinner get home early &  keep indoors. (2 francs 50 centimes for dinner). Bed early.
