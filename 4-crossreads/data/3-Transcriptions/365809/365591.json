<p>We are expecting several visits from the Boche during the next 10 days, unless the weather continues as bad as it is at present.</p>
<p>On Saturday I attended the investiture  and received my C.M.G.  H.M. was most gracious, and talked to me for quite a long time. I was beastly nervous, and gripped him by the hand hard, and what with my gammy leg etc, made generally a very inglorious exit.</p>
<p>I spent the weekend at Eton &ndash; my old school &ndash; and had a very happy time seing relations now at the school, and renewing old acquaintances in the masters &ndash; Please remember me to Mrs. Ferguson and to to Keith.<br/>Yours  sincerely<br/>Charles.M.Macnaghten</p>
