<p>10.9.15<br/>Fri 10th<br/>Last night at nine oclock a good deal of rifle &amp; machine gun fire was exchanged, &amp; one of the warboats threw a few shells into the Turkish lines, but it proved to be only a demonstration &amp; there was no attack made; The men here are in the  trenches during the day till 6 oclock when they are relieved, they then have to fall in at 7.30 &amp; do six-hours fatigue during the night; While having a swim at 4 oclock this afternoon, the Artillery opened fire on the extreme left, the warboats also took active part &amp; the bombardment lasted for over half an hour. I cannot hear if we attacked but it looked very much as though one was in progress. The sun went down behind a heavy bank of clouds tonight.</p>
