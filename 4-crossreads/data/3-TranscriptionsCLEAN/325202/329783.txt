  
 April 25/16 A year ago today, since the landing at Anzac. 
 We were informed today that reveille is to be in future at 1.30 a.m.! So that the waggons will leave here at 2.30 reach the railhead at 3.30 a.m. and pick up their loads & carry them on to near where our Division is billetted unload at the Supply Depot & reload the various supplies in small lots as requisitioned & deliver them to their units. 
 We have got to be early birds because for the last few days the German Planes have been very active overhead & they must have seen & noted the daily gathering of the Supply Column & our "Heads"
