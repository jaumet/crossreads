One man appeared without box respirator, one man without steel helmet, and three without Arms.  About half appeared without equipment.  The importance of speed in turning out was impressed on the men,  and the mistakes made pointed out.  Owing to the unsatisfactory performance of No. 1 Section, this Section was detailed to carry out double guard.  The alarm was repeated with "B" Battery.
