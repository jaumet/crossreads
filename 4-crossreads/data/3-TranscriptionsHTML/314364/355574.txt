<p>Thur. Mar.29.<br/>It was a bit of a "thud" to come from sleeping in a Saloon Cabin on the "Lancashire", to have to sleep in a wooden floor with just a blanket under me, but I enjoyed it. I can't stand a soft bed. There were only four in our Tent so we slept with plenty of Room between us. We "turned out" at about 7 a.m. had a wash &amp; then strolled down to Breakfast. There was lovely white Bread, plenty of Real Butter &amp; mutton chops. It's a long time since I enjoyed a Feed so well. Before Breakfast we had Coffee Biscuits, which went down well.<br/>The crowd from the "City of Cairo" are also in Quarantine. They are Munition Workers. At about 10 a.m. I sent an Urgent Reply Paid wire to B.E. to know how they all were. I haven't heard any news of her for ages &amp; I'm feeling anxious.<br/>Thurs.Mar. 2 (cont)<br/>It is about 7 p.m. now &amp; I've received no reply, so I don't suppose I shall hear now till tomorrow. I'm hoping to get a Letter then, so I must just grin &amp; bear it. It's very nice to know that B.E. is so near, but it's mighty<br/>hard to be "so near &amp; yet so far." I wrote B.E. &amp; Nell &amp; Mother during the day. We are quarantined for seven days so the sooner next Wed. comes the better. During the afternoon "Gil" &amp; I went for a stroll &amp; tried to pick out some of the Local spots with his Telescope. Seeing the Manly Boat go by made me wish I was aboard one of 'em with a certain Little Lady with Blue Eyes. Ah well, all that's to come.<br/>Fri Mar 28.<br/>This morning I got a wire from B.E. saying they were all well. That has made me feel a bit more satisfied, as I was beginning to wonder what was wrong. The wire was handed in at 2.15 p.m. so it's not B.E.'s fault that</p>
