<p>Owing to lack of accommodation, a few of us had to sleep in the open, with only two blankets &amp; a waterproof.</p>
<p>25: Bitterly cold &amp; raining heavily.  The boys had not received their parcels or billies, so we had bully &amp; rice for lunch.  Had not been paid for a month &amp; everyone else was bankrupt.  Worst Xmas I have ever spent &amp; had to turn in under wet blankets.  Goodness knows when we will get away from here, as all troops from Gallipoli are going daily.</p>
<p>31st:  Camp fire concert;  Gen. Forsyth presiding &amp; some of the nurses in the audience.  Boys had a fine days football &amp; sports, ending up with a huge log fire at night.  Stayed up to welcome in the new year.</p>
