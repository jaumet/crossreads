<p>(2)<br/>During the evening of 30th Oct I reported at the orderly room of the Ninth and was soon accommodated with quarters amongst a fine group of fellows of A Section in Hut 5. Here we spent a very enjoyable few weeks and for my own part I found the moral and social atmosphere a great improvement on that at Camp 17. Hut no 5 was my home in Camp 3 till our departure on active service.</p>
<p>On the day following that on which I joined the ambulance I participated in a distribution of goodies sent by the same comforts fund. Each man received a considerable share of preserved fruit and milk, sweets,  biscuit, cocoa, etc and all were very pleased and appreciative of the kindness of their well wishers at home.</p>
