Rain! Rain! Rain! We got some rum this morning, that is one bright spot in the day. My home collapsed on top of me last night. Spend a wet miserable day. Was attached to Brigade Head Quarters this evening. Went down and reported and set to and made myself a "doss" on a pile of "Stokes" mortar bombs; it is dry; but I guess I will go up if a shell hits this pile tonight. I shall make myself a home tomorrow.

Spent the day contructing a nice new home. Succeeded in stealing much good material for same and I am very pleased with the result. Also pinched a pair of gum thigh boots; I need them
