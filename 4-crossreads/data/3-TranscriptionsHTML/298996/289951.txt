<p>Men coming into hospital wholesale I must say that I can see our camp or rather where our boys are camped opposite us, across a narrow strip of water. Back very sore.</p>
<p>25-9-15<br/>Terrible the cold this morning wind blowing nearly a gale. I am told that our battalion was paid a beautiful sum of &pound;1-0-0  Rumour that Greece has declared or rather has given Bulycort 24 hour to know what she is going to do. Things very tame here other than war arguatment I was issued with a pair of trousers &amp; shirt to go to the base.</p>
<p>26-9-15<br/>Still in hospital, nothing doing, other &amp; to eat &amp; sleep.</p>
<p>27-9-15<br/>Another Rumour to hand to day Re the French have advanced 80 miles &amp; captured 20 000 prisoners, Germans. Looks like rain here. Terribly sky.</p>
<p>28-9-15<br/>I noticed a big number of men returning to camp I am told that they have returned from England. Talk about war rumour being spun they are manufactured here by the dozens (Latrine Wires as they are called)<br/>Back very sore still. I think it is more serious than I thought at first.</p>
<p>29-9-15<br/>Things are just a quiet as ever, men still streaming in sick. Hospitals full up with sick.</p>
<p>30-9-15<br/>Beautiful mornings I bought a little Butter mind you I dodged out of the Hospital to do so. It was just the thing. I also went over to the camp to see if there were any letters there were none. Well they were paying the men of our Brigade I asked them would they pay me. But I got the answer no shoved down my neck. As I was coming back towards camp I saw which I thought was smoke coming from a southerly directions but by by five oclock I knew what it was. A Beautiful fog  One could not see fifty yards away.</p>
<p>1-10-15<br/>It was a beautiful morning Re the Fog talk</p>
