While were fighting for the nation, in our Present situation,Weve example in the good old common mud,For it sticks with desperation, and makes quite a decorationTill a soldier man looks something like a spudWhen you meet an old relation, and he starts the conversation,It's the same - unless you nip it in the bud -For we curse the whole creation for its slimy old foundation,Drives a man to Aviation - does the mud -When with frantic jubilation, we shall hail the fermentationOf the war, then e'en forgetting.
