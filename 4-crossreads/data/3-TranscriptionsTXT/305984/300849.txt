7/12/17Miserable day drizzling rain.  the Black Prince went to the barracks & inspected same then came to II ours Sgt Majs & played up about same it was a regular picnic.  his display of yelling the only thing that keeps us alive or rather up to dick.  We have been strafed inasmuch that our lights have been cut off for 3 nights.
Germans hoisted the red white & black flag today.  persistent rumours about an armistice on the whole Russian front. ?  we will soon see.  also [indecipherable]8/12/17Raining of & on during the day  Plenty of talk in German papers Re Russian armistice.  I really think things will turn out trumps for the Allies (ours).Germans claims of the Cambri Battle up to the 7 inst to have taken 9000 Pris British 175 machine guns & 60 F. guns.  there must be heavy fighting there.
