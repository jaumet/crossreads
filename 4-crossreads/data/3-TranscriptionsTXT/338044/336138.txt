 1915 Dec 26th Sunday A quiet Sunday. Very tired &amp;  after church rest until afternoon, then taking a trip to the Pyramids 
 Last night we had tea with Madame Alice &amp;  the girls &amp;  some music    &amp;  entertainment afterwards. It was indeed a pleasant change. 
 Dec 27th Monday Again night duty from 12 midnight to 7 am. As the weather is very cold it is not only unpleasant but miserable trying to work all night wrapped up in our greatcoats. 
 Dec 28th to Dec 30th Plenty of work &amp; no amusement. Nothing but sleep &amp; work so not very interesting.
