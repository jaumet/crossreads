<p>Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Fry<br/>Permit me, as a member of the staff of the Museum, to express, on behalf of my wife, sons, &amp; self, our deep sympathy with you &amp; yours in your bereavement.</p>
<p>We who have lost, &amp; suffered, as a result of this cruel war, can quite enter into the sufferings &amp; heart-aches through which you are now going. Personally, having worked with your late son, I know not only his personal worth &ndash; which was great, but his marvellous ability &ndash; Your son, like mine, has laid down his life upon the shrine of freedom</p>
