<p>time but things are beginning to get a bit monotonous now that we have almost completed our first week aboard.</p>
<p>Tues. 17th. Aug.<br/>Sighted land for first time after leaving Port Phillip &amp; incidentally had our last glimpse of  Aust. for some time to come &ndash; That is the ones lucky enough to come back. I think that the old band at the Sydney wharf ought to cut out their "This is the Life" tune &amp; substitute the old "Kathleen M."<br/>"It may be for years &ndash; It may be for <u>keeps</u>"<br/>Our sight of the "Land of Promise" is just a faint outline of Cape Lewin on the horizon at 6. A.M.<br/>Believe ship has been keeping out of the trade route (some say 100 miles) "Goodbye Australia for a while!"</p>
<p>Thurs. 19th: -<br/>Still on our monotonous trip &amp; <u>still weeks</u> to go. Ship has got a big list to starboard &amp; they say it is the coal causing it. Getting mean with the food &amp; water. Most of us are buying tinned fish to eat &amp; our money does not go very far as they only pay us a shilling a day aboard ship.<br/>Experienced our roughest weather as yet yesterday.</p>
<p>Sat. 21st .Aug.<br/>Starting to get hot; could not sleep below last night went on deck. Will have it proper</p>
