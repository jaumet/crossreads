 on Juli 31st Fritz retreat it was not necessari to blow up the Tunnel . To go down the Tunnel you have to walk down two flight of stair to about 40 ft then along a few yard when you come to open which is the Engine Room where the Electric Light is generat . The Engine is work by boy from an Australian Technic corp , who live underground as you walk along you pass recess which are use for sever purpos , one recess is the boy quarter have sever bunk built along the side anoth is their Cookhous so on , further on these recess are us as AMC Dress station Officer quarter , it is veri wet damp the water run along both side of the floor board , even where the boy live it is alway wet underfoot they alway wear their Gum Boot . I do n't intend go down again as I caught a chill was laid up for a few day . The Atmospher is to damp for my like . I onli stay down there for about an hour then I came up after a while the Troop arriv off we went as far as Regersberg when I left the Train stabl my Engine for the night . One can walk along the Tunnel for about 1 mile ahead a good distanc along branch on each side .
