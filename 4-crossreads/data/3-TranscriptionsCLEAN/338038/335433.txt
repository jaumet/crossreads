IIthat we always have to undertake in the line - I have a completely new set of Officers except Greene my senior subaltern who was with me before I went away - The others are Capt F McAdam, Lieuts Smith, Mossman & Bussell.  My old Battery Captain, Syd Walker has got his majority & command of another Battery, while the other old hands are still away -Am surprised Col Lucas didn't ring you up before - I don't hold any great brief for him, and think were I in his place I should try and discharge these little duties as soon as possible -
