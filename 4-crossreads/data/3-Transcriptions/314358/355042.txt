<p>4<br/>This loss has been one of my worries dear Teddie, rather would I have lost all things else for your dear sake</p>
<p>Yet although your mention of the little crumpled up green image brings the concern of its loss back to me with strange regret and sadness let me try to imagine there is some wise reason in it all. Perhaps some soldier with less luck than I possess, has found it and thus the little man may fulfil his mission for anothers good, which may be best in the end.</p>
<p>This loss has done one thing dear, it has made me resolve to have a photography taken for you darling and the may have been the green mans cunning little plan after all with nothing more important.</p>
<p>I am very tired after a heavy day of duty but must write, for today is a chapter in this book of my life made bright by [indecipherable] of your letters, the first news from you since I left Australia</p>
<p>There is so much to tell but so little time.<br/>Why is it some people have no time in this world, others seem to weary of that particular thing</p>
<p>[Emmas?] letter is splendid, she will write someday, Oh my dear girl you and I have had our hopes and desires but it is left to our children to fulfil them, so be it dear, and we shall have the pleasure through them, and a nobler one through it being free from vanity. What I have not written will always be the largest part of my letter. The deepest of love to you all and all the others</p>
