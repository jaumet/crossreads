 &nbsp;&nbsp; We have been working very strenuously at organization since landing, losing very little time in eating and sleeping, accomplishing in four days what has taken the other battalions about two weeks.&nbsp; Now we are to have four days disembarkation leave, starting tomorrow (Monday) until midnight on Thursday. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m going first to Plymouth, staying perhaps one night, then up to London to look at the King, or rather to buy a few articles, then back to camp nice and early and ready for a really strenuous time in training. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; My love to you all, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.
