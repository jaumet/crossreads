<p>2.  I had my Australian mail to-day and was so thankful for it for there has been such a long gap this time.  I shall have to wait for your general letter Father till Rid gets it re-addressed to him down at Tel-el-Keber and then re-posts it to me here.  So Mother you will see how glad I was to have quite a long one from you though I was glad of the little notes from my Daddy &amp; can contain myself in patience now &amp; wait for the general letter.  Of course I quite understand that there could not be a copy for each of us.<br/>Have not heard from Le since I last wrote but then that is only four or five days ago.  I fairly often drop him notes, the dear child.  I do wish it were possible to see him and would go myself to Serapeum for the purpose if ladies were allowed there but they are not.  Still he may get leave yet &amp; run up to Cairo.<br/>Of course I have not seen my husband since I last wrote you and have only had one note from him since, letters take such an age to come from these military places.  He is liking his work very much down there &amp; finds his colonel very nice &amp; brotherly &amp; the officers of the mess very easy to get on with.  One of the men from Tel-el-Keber whom we used to know out at Toronto called in for a few minutes to-day to see if there were anything he could take back to Rid for me, he was just up for the day, and he said that Rid had a splendid time last night at service.  For some reason or other there had been no parade service in the morning &amp; my little Padre was awfully disappointed, but the man said that to the evening service (though it was not a parade) every officer from the Colonel down turned up.  I am waiting for Rid to tell me of it himself, but I know how glad he would be.</p>
