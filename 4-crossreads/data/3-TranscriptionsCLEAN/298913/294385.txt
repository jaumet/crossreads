  
 Zeitoun at last, filthy dirty & tired. Ate tin of officer's biscuits oranges & apples & even cucumbers. Down to the railway we tore & emptied the lorry & then I struck guard. Craige was left at the camp. I was feeling hungry too, but could not get relieved, so I got on another transport & went back to camp, to find everything in chaos. Men were everywhere, & nothing could be found. I had lost my gear and could not find anybody Well, in a case like this, there is but one thing to do & that is to look to one's self & hang the gear. I got two biscuits & a cup of tea after a lot of begging & then turned into bed before more trouble came. My eyes were bloodshot & so sore that I could not close them, & my hands were cut about a lot. Our beds were thrown out any where at all. Mine in the stables. I slept more soundly than I ever did before & awoke at 5 am' 
 4/3/16 To start work again. after breakfast of the eternal bully beef & biscuits  we marched down to Zeitoun siding & began loading trucks. The amount of gear was enormous & filled two train loads whilst we were there. Naturally the officers must have their pot palms & lounges  & these made a big heap. We had to burn our gear that was not absolutely necessary. 5 inch howitzers & field ambulances wagons galore. 
 At 11.30 we tore out of Zeitoun bound for Tel - el- Kebir. There was no stop all the way except at Zag-a-Zig for water. Cattle trucks were our apartments & were fairly rough too but one does not object to these things when there is some object in doing so. At 2pm arrive at Tel-el-Kebir & begin to unload. Have a row with Ryan over  guard, Take guard from 8pm to 10pm. Clouds of dust flying about, no bread no tea, in fact, nothing to eat & not even a drop of water. Feel dirty & hungry. After 10pm I crawl under some old tents & boxes & go to sleep, as I find late on a stack of  picks  & shovels. 
 5/4/16 Awake 6am & find nothing to eat again. Flies crawl over us in thousands & torment us
