<p>bullets all around. I jumped up &amp; got under the Overcoats hanging on the Tent Pole but luckily none struck the Tent, the second shell bursted a few minutes later when I was outside &amp; the bullets were whizzing around like large Hailstones, I took shelter behind a Wooden Hut &amp; several Bullets struck the hut &amp; the nose cap of the shell came whizzing down making a sound like an ordinary skyrocket when it goes up in the Air, only a few yds away in the thick bush. It is marvellous the number of Camps &amp; Men about &amp; nobody was struck, again at 9 Pm another <strike>shell</strike> High Explosive Shell burst some distance off &amp; a piece about 1 &frac12; x &frac12; dropped on the tent next to ours but the force was spent &amp; instead of it penetrating the Tent it was stuck in the Canvas. Anyhow that was the last &amp; things were very quiet all night &amp; the Camp was not disturbed. We all saw a strange Sight just before Tea away up high in the distance could be seen 4 Aeroplanes 3 on Top &amp; 1 underneath, I watched the movements &amp; it turned out</p>
