  
 21 April, 1916 Salhia I went accross to the New Zealanders to have a kick with them at Football - Young Foster who is in their lot & whom I knew on the tramway was over there, he was packing his kit bag - he & I listened to the band for a while, then went for a walk. This morning we got orders to have out kit bags in by 4 oclock this afternoon.  We are to move off shortly & by the talk we are to see a little active Service again.  We take our horses with us this time.
