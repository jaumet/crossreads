<p>JUNE &nbsp; THURSDAY 1 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine &amp; fairly sunny but a strong head wind. We saw more sun than we have seen since we left Australia. The sea too looks a lighter green as if the water was a lot shallower. We had a full dress parade in the morning; and I found the rats had been at my tunic and eaten great&nbsp;pieces out of it. We went on duty in evening &nbsp;I was on bosuns fatigue so did nothing tonight</p>
