<p>not feeling it so much as last year, have more comforts here. Have gone in for bathing &amp; am getting on famously with my swimming. Our medical officers are all very good to us &ndash; they swim over to our part &amp; take us out. Some of them are very strong swimmers. I'm well cared for, our O.C. always takes me out &amp; I do a little more each time. Shall try &amp; send you a snap-shot of us, one of the Sisters photographed us. I've got a new bathing-suit &amp; cap. Came from Port Said &amp; it looks just the thing. We bath in the lake. Last Friday Sister Bell &amp; I had our last sail with Lieut. Wylde &ndash; it was a beautiful afternoon &amp; we three agree so well, quite sad he had to go back to duty on Saturday-morn. We returned after 6.30 p.m. We two sisters just got back in time for dinner &ndash; then at 9 p.m. the N.C.O's &amp; Orderlies gave a Concert &amp; the Sisters</p>
