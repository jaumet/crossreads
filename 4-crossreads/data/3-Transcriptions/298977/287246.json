<p>Horse.  He's right out of his element there.  Even if he can't get into anything in the Motor line, the Machine Gun Section is a good catch, though its jolly hard work at times.  Also had a letter from Mother written at Katoomba dated the 29th May, and am glad to hear the trip has done her good.  I hope she has not been worrying at all, because no letters have been coming through.  Goodness knows you all have enough to worry about with four of us away, though I know you both would sooner have us over here than have us stay behind and join the ranks of the "deep thinkers".</p>

<p>Love to all at home.<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Roy.</p>
