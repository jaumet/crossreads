Firing Line Grinchy
16/1/17 on our left put up the S.O.S. and all our heavies and howitzers got to work and sent over heavy and intense curtains on to Fritz. Such a big stir does one little stunt create in this touchy spot. All was normal and retired to bunk at 8.30 but could not sleep. Patrols out as usual but elicited little information beyond hearing usual coughing c in their lines. Our chaps shot 3 Germans in Finch and had the satisfaction seeing their stretcherbearers come out. Also claim to have killed another who was firing flares. He was seen to fall. A German carrying a Red Cross flag came out of Finch and collected some effects off their dead in front later returning to the rear carrying two small bundles. Our men have put in some good work today with pick and shovel digging a small new trench and a new T head. They have also done some new latrines and cleared out all the mud from 100 yards of trench, previously 3? deep therein and made it habitable
