However at 8 we had tea & turned in shortly after 10 catching the 9.10 train in the morning back to London. I was very pleased I ran up as Will D. was there & I was glad of the opportunity of seeing them again.
Monday 15th Jan.Spent Monday returning to London a trip I enjoyed altho. it was rather tiring. The whole country was covered deeply in snow & was indeed a very pretty sight & one quite new to me. Had lunch on the train, rather good. Returned to Hotel & we went to the 9 oclock house of the Palladium rather poor on the whole. Supper on our return.
Tuesday 16th Jan.Went round flat hunting with friends, rather a quiet day. Went to see L.M. & Co. & saw Mr. Brown & Thoroughgoods, very decent to me. Would do all they could. At night went to see "Theodore & Co."
