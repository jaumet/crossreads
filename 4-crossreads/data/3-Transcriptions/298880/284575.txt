<p>The Perfect Day<br/>-<br/>When you come to the end of a perfect day<br/>And you sit alone with your thoughts<br/>While the chimes ring out with a carol gay<br/>For the joy that the day has brought<br/>Do you think what the end of a perfect day<br/>Can mean to a tired heart<br/>When the sun goes down with a flaming ray<br/>And the dear friends have to part.</p>
