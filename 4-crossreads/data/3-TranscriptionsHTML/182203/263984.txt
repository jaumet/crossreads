Have been rather fortunate in remaining in same Ward all the time. One morning I was told to go to Ward 4a. where Charlie is &amp; thought it a bit of luck but was only there about one hour when ordered to Officers Ward again. I'm very happy there but oh, the time goes too quickly, the poor brave fellows do not get much attention. We are much too short handed but expect more sisters to arrive to-morrow. This is a fearfully big place with over 1,000 rooms I beleive. Our poor feet ache, the floors are so hard &amp; of course have plenty of trotting about. I am sending Eddy some</p>
