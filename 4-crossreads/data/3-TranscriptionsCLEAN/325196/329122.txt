22-2-16Tue 22ndWent down to B Troop today as escort to the transport & had a very interesting time; brought a mail down from the station with us on our way back; The Col. Adj. & all the Officers went away for dinner today & had a troop as escort; The Col. & Officers all got rather merry & after dinner 4 or 5 natives were showing our men how the Senoussi's fight galloping on ponies & firing as they went ; The Col. told the Adj to show them one better so he ordered the troop to mount & fix bayonets & charge mounted, They say they had a fine days sport, & there are always plenty of volunteers to go on any of these trips
