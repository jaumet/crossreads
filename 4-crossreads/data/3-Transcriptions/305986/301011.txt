<p>A Soldiers Philosophy</p>
<p>One or two things will happen either you will be called as a soldier or not.</p>
<p>If you are not there is no need to worry. If you are, one or two things will happen. Either you will be sent to the front or to a place of safety behind the line.</p>
<p>If you are in a place of safety there is no need to worry, if you are sent to the front one or two things will happen. Either you will be wounded or you wont.</p>
