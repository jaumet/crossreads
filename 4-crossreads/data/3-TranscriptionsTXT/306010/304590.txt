Never have I seen such an enthusiastic demonstration &ndash; the streets, shops, balconies &amp; windows were packed with people shouting &amp; clapping (a few crying) waving flags as well as throwing flowers &amp; distributing cakes, postcards (&amp; kisses) to the Officers &amp; Men. The only Australians that took part were 200 from the Base Details, Moussot  and  4 Officers &amp; 100 N.C.Os &amp; men from No. 2 G.H. We moved off from Moussot together with 100 New Zealanders at 1.15 pm on our 5 mile march into the city to Place Castellane (the place of assembly for the route march)
