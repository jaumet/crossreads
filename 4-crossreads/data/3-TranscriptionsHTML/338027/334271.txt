<p>Sunday, 15th November, 1914<br/>Sighted the pretty isle of Ceylon at daybreak, view magnificent.  Palm trees &amp; wonderful buildings.  We left the fleet &amp; went right into Colombo at noon, we anchored alongside Sydney who is a little knocked about.  The N.Z. are here and all kinds of warships from friendly countries.  We are not allowed ashore but the natives are alongside us all day long coaling and selling goods.  The Devils ask absurd prices but can be beaten down 500&percnt; I bought a box of 100 cigars, good cheroots for 5/- as well as innumerable presents to send home.</p>
<p>Monday, 16th November, 1914<br/>Coaling in the busy &amp; picturesque harbour of Colombo.  The coaling being done by natives who talk more than work, they are a dirty lot, but keen for a bargain.  I vowed to buy no more from them but the result is I am now nearly broke.  We should leave to-day but judging by the way they are coaling it will be some time to-morrow.  The Euripides &amp; the Argyllshire came in for water.  The men are very jealous of the N.Z. being allowed ashore, as we are not.  Bought presents for E. &amp; M.</p>
