Things can never be the same again'History repeats itself'  you will say.Yes the same scene is laid & the play is played over & over again, but with the same cast, never. But the world advances steadily civilization grows, man improves his status . True, but the individual regrets always his youth, the golden years when he was so happy & - did not know itThe Thread is spun, woven & cut, cut, woven, & spun & still Time remains inexorable, unrelenting, transient.
