 My dear Father, I have not received any letters from you yet so it is a bit  hard to know what to write about; I think I will be going back on Monday and I will be glad to get there and get my mail. Is not the war news good the last few days, if it goes on like this I will miss the war altogether which would be pretty rotton after coming all this way. The paper here had a report of the Sydney ram sales and said the highest price was 50 gins. I suppose they meant 500; any way I sent you a copy just to let you see it. I got a "Telegraph" here with a photograph of the High School, Mudgee, it in it; I saw them building that at Show time and was wondering what it was; it is funny to find out about it over this side of the world - I also saw that Crossings & Cox had sold some of Patta Bucca at 14 per acre. There is a chap here 6 ft. 6 in. high who is a pretty "big" wheat grower in the Rivererena and I have been learning all I could from him about wheat growing: his brother is working the place for him while he is away and has got 800 acres  in this year.
