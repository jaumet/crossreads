Bulford16.3.17Dear George,I was very glad when I learned that Young Tom Porman is so far alive & well although a Prisoner in Germany.  Let us hope that He has got in with some decent Germans, & there are decent ones, & that He will be returned to us all safe & Sound apres la Guerre.  I don't think I'll write to Him just now.  I may later on.  Who the blazes put you on Scratch in the 100 yds H'cap.  I could have understood in the 1/2 Mile but not the other.  It is to be hoped that the H'capper will wake up & put You up on about 5 or 6 in the sprint race.  Fitz is a great powerful runner.  He aught to give You a few Yards I think, but if You train well, You aught to make a go of it.  Don't box without bandages on Your hands & wrists.  You will only break all the small bones in Your hands & wrists & they will become like mine, as weak as a childs.  Dave Ellis & I went to the Theatre last night.  We go regularly once a week & we see some bonzer shows.  Bulford has a bad name but we have a Theatre, & a picture show & vaudeville, & about 6 or 8 shops where we can purchase almost anything & then Y.M.C.A. & Salvation & Church army Huts too.  The whole of our Unit has been classified to-day for Field Work.  I was too busy to go over
