30/10/17 Rome
One was increasingly reminded of Egypt when going along this road by the appearance of the houses all stuccoed and with washed walls, by the bamboos and other vegetation, the smells, the little canals, and even by the many bullock carts driven by drowsy peasants. Some of the human habitations were not much better than pigstyes. We passed on this Appian Way many tombs one was of a brother of Caracalla who died by his hand. On top of another some workman has built his house. At last we came out on to a little place out on the Campagna and a monk gave me a taper and led me downstairs to the little underworld of catacombs. All the sides of the passages had been tombs but the bodies of most were taken away to the Churches about 900
