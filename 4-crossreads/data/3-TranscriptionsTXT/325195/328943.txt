 20.9.15 Monday 20th It turned very cold last night &amp; this morning is a "freezer" &amp; clouds hanging around threaten to give us a ducking as well: Clouds cleared off early &amp; had a fine day A sailing vessel came on the scene this morning early with divers on board they are here to dive for the shells that were sunk a few days ago, The Turks soons got the range of the boat &amp; succeeded in hitting her twice below the water line, &amp; she sank slowly the water was very shallow, but she is resting on the bottom; a good deal of artillery fire has come over the last few days  but it is seldom any damage is done, &amp; most of the shells fall far out to sea.  A good deal of shooting goes on at the boats but it is very rarely they score a hit; Went down for a swim again this afternoon &amp; had a  cold  swim. Bought 4 doz eggs today at 2/9 per doz.
