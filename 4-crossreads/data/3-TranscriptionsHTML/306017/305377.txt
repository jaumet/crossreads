<p>November 1916<br/>line, marched to Hassaniya where we watered.  We got to Bayoud about 1 oclock put down our horse lines &amp; made ourselves as comfortable as possible.  We relieved an English Yeomanry Regt &amp; they left the camp in a dirty state.  Flies are very numerous here while at Hill 70 we hardly had one.  The days are very cool &amp; the nights cold.  There is plenty of work here, patrols outposts, escorts etc.</p>
<p>On the 26th I took the patrol &amp; joined up with a patrol of C Squadron.  I picked up a fine length of Manilla Rope. It will just do for picketing B Troop, being about 25 yds long.  Also found 2 Scotties of the Scottish Horse Cavalry who were lost.  They had got a couple of miles off their track.  Every second night we get outpost here &amp; the nights are very cold on top of the sand hills.  A few days after we got here an enemy aeroplane dropped 5 bombs but the aim was very bad, the machine being very high up &amp;</p>
