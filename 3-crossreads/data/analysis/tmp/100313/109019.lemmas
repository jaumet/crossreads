 1/1/18 Boulogn Had dinner at the hotel and then went up to the offic Club up the street . It seem to be a veri good and well kept place and I am sorri not to have gone there in the first place . The leav boat pull out at 10.30 a.m. in the morn . The town is pitch dark and one cannot see more than a few pace ahead . All along the street one get flash of electr torch from ship that pass in the night . An intens bite cold wind that seem to cut through all overcoat cloth . Shade light at the busi railway station where crowd of troop ( leav , detail draft c ) are march in and out all the time . English is the languag most heard in the street , a few loud brawl voic come from out of the dark but otherwis the whole place is most dead quiet and there is noth do . A number of nurs ( most Canadian ) are stay at this hotel . In the Officer Club and elsewher are the W.A.A.C?S ? a tremend risk parent take in permit their girl to take on work in an atmospher like this .
