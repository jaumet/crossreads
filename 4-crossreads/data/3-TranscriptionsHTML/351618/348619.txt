<p>Thursday 23rd Sept<br/>Went again to Ordnance. Had busy day getting goods and etc and later on when mules brought parcels up I issued to those required</p>
<p>Friday 24th<br/>Weather still keen. There is an absence of the short Pants now. Everyone is commencing to cover themselves up a little more. The wind is the worst part of the weather &ndash; it is so cutting just now. I made an appeal to Supply O.C. about bread &amp; in future our Battery is to be treated similar to the Infantry Brigades etc.</p>
<p>Saturday 25th<br/>A nice day. Just a little cool Zephyr blowing. We have a demonstration against the Turkish positions late in the evening. There was a tremendous fusilade of bullets &amp; shells for about 2 hours etc.</p>
