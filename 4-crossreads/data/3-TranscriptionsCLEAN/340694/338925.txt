 19/8/16 Still raining & it looks like setting in. Felt pretty weary last night after 25 miles ride & slept like a top. 
 24/8/16. Went for a lovely spin in the Napier last night to Senlis it was great. Called at our old billet in Rubempre coming back & had a wine. The Driver (J Lean) let her out coming home from there, gee, she did travel. Boiled the billy had a good cup of tea & turned in.
