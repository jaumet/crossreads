<p>has happened.  I don't see the Quarter-Master until to-morrow.  Gee! If He doesn't go mad to-morrow when I stand like a silly sheep &amp; reply to all His questions I don't know, Sir.  Gee! it will be fun 'cos I don't give a d___ if the whole show goes up in the air.  Ellis does all the worryin' still.  As long as I get 3 meals &amp; a bed, well!  What more does anyone want.</p>
<p>Good-night Au Revoir, I expect to be in Salisbury on Saturday</p>
<p>Best Love Harry</p>
