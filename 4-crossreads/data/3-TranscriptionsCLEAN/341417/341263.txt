  
 Articles contributed to augment those used & supplied by the Govrmt. This section would include, sandbags, bandages & dressings, first field dressings, socks, Balaclava caps, mittens etc. crutches, splints, Invalids clothing. 
 All these should be delivered to & only handled by the Army Ordnance Dept. Even though sandbags can be made cheaply in India from jute on the spot I consider all used commercial sacks should be made up into sandbags. If new hessian is used I would think that after duty, freight etc. is paid on it, that the Goverment could manage better, by getting them made in India by machines,  cheaper .  Labour is cheaper there too. 
 Now as regards knitted work.  Men are supplied with caps & socks by the Ordnance Dept. on a regular scale. If they have just had socks from issue & a comforts lot arrives    will  men will waste them when they are plentiful as you know. The Dept. could use all knitted work by issuing it, where a check is kept on a man's kit.
