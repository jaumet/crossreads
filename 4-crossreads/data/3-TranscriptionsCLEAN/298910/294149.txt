my chance of swinging it, I am sorry now I didn't, when I see the fellows that are going thro swinging the lead. About 6 of our fellows got slight wounds and all went off duty. 58th Battalion had a very successful hop over at daylight & brought in nearly 300 prisoners - some say they have Fritz pushed out of the Hindenburg line & once again in the shell holes on the flat below Bullecourt. About 9 pm we were recalled back to another post and we had to go through absolutely the fiercest barrage we have yet been in, we were forced nearly 3/4 of a mile out of our way, for a while I lost my pal Bert Trail, but I was so pleased when he caught me up again in a trench which we had to shelter in for about half an hour. Had no tucker and very little water all day. 3rd London Division came in to relieve us but only half of them got through the barrage & they were badly cut up. The Tommys were very sore when they saw our position
