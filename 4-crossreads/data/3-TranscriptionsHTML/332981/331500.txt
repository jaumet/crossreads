<p>At 5 am yesterday morning November 11, the German delegates at Marshal Foch's Headquarters, in the presence of Marshal Foch and Admiral Sir Rosslyn Weuyss, First Lord of the Admiralty, signed on behalf of the German Government the armistice terms dictated by the Allied Powers. Histilities came to an end at 11 am. This armistice is not peace. In that sense the War is not over, but the Terms of the Armistice are so drastic that Germany is robbed of any power, even if she had the wish, to recommence hostilies.</p>
<p>German Plenipotentiaries to the German High command.</p>
