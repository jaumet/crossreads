This little incident has just come to my memory, it was a 3rd Battalion officer, who when his dearest friend was killed alongside him, took an oath that he would chop every Germans head off he came across, the tool he selected to do this with was one of their own heavy steel bayonets, he carried out his oath to some purpose nothing was to hot for him he was everywhere when last I saw him he was covered with blood going strong, he must have killed scores
There are scores of transport waggons rumbling through the quiet little village this morning, most of them loaded with hay bully beef, biscuits, oats tarpaulins meat etc all bound
