In the Field - 11.10.17 - Beechambarrage guns had moved forward to take up a defensive position covering Infantry holding the line, these guns were relieved by C.O. 11th Aust. Machine Gun Co.  Our guns therefore remained at Levi.  Steps for ammunition supply were immediately put in hand - 4 Limbers accompanied by 8 Pack animals drew ammunition at 6 a.m. and moved along Ypres-Zonnebeke road to where it crosses railway at D.26.b.90.40.  Here a dump was formed, and the ammunition transferred to pack animals, which moved along the northern side of the railway embankment as far as Zonnebeke Station, from where they followed the road to Van Isackere Farm, and established a dump at about D.21.a.50.45., this being as far as it was then possible for pack animals to move.  This pack train worked till dark, and was able to establish a large dump of well over 200,000 rounds at this point, drawn from small dumps that had been left on the Ypres-Zonnebeke road from the last two operations.  A second attempt was made later in the day to send more ammunition by limber from Coy. Headquarters at Hussar Farm - these limbers failed
