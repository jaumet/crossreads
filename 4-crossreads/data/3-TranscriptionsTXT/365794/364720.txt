Monday 12 November 1917Now 15 days off duty but tomorrow I go on in office.Sewed all morning - 2 p.m. went to Cairo with S. Watson, did quantity of shopping & visited Headquarters & paid in 10-0-0 instead of banking it, then drew Pt. 6000 leaving balance.5 p.m. tea at Groppi's, 3 p.m. took a garry to Ordinance stores & drove over the beautiful Kasurel nil [Kasr El nil] bridge & saw the old Nile rolling along & gardens green & lovely.  Took a snap of the bridge.Very tired & so lonely, this latter feeling is the worst part of my life just now.  Sitting at table with V.A.D's who talk shop & no friend to exchange a few gay words with.  Never mind, things will change some day I know & meanwhile patience.
