<p>close by played up during the night.</p>
<p>Monday 10.7.16<br/>Arose 7.30 feeling much better for the nights rest, although we were disturbed during the night by a gas alarm.  Received parcel from home, but received instructions to move off to the trenches about an hour after receiving it.  Moved away with a party of 20 others &amp; marched single file through Flaubaix, at an interval of 100 yards, till we reached the saps.  Wended out way for about &frac34; of a mile through saps.  Four [?] of us were stationed at the R.A.P. &amp; remainder taken to various other positions.  Now about 250 yds behind front line &amp; settled down for work.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11.7.16<br/>Went to Btn H qrs to draw rations.  Rather difficult to find way about various saps &amp; trenches.  Spent an hour &amp; a half in the front trenches &amp; had the opportunity</p>
