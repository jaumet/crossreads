<p>drawers in the cabinet would be opened &amp; two or three shillings would be quietly dropped in to be "discovered" next morning by the surprised patient who wondered how ever they could have got there!</p>
<p>This ward in particular was more like a Dormitory at a boarding school than a ward, and some joke or fun was always "under weigh". A "Jock" &amp; a "Tommy" were the comedians of the "Show" &amp; they kept things pretty amusing.</p>
