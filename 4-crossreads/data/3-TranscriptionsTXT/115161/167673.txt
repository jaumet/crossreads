 the 20th. September, for dear old England. 
 CHAPTER XXX111. 
 &quot; BLIGHTY&quot; LEAVE . 
 A coincidence.&nbsp; At about noon on the 20th. September &#39;17, I step on board the boat which is to convey me to England on ten day&#39;s leave.&nbsp; At about noon on the 20th September, &#39;16 I also stepped on board a boat which was to convey me to England.&nbsp; Exactly twelve months between, but with very different feelings and under very different circumstances.&nbsp; Twelve months ago I was not so lively as to-day.&nbsp; Twelve months ago I bid farewell to those I loved, to-day I bid farewel to the land which has caused me much misery.&nbsp; How different.&nbsp; Twelve months ago I start on a journey which leads to trouble, to-day I start on a journey which I intend shall lead to a bit of pleasure.
