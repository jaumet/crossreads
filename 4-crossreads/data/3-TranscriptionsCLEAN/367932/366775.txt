The moon did not rise till 9 - & it was cloudy darkness seemed to take possession of everything.  Turning a sharp bend in the track - a pungent odour made its presence known.  Lying along the track, all facing the same way were six dead Turks.  Their bones showing white in the fast fading light.  Their uniforms tattered bits of rag.  Here the track seemed to end.  It was too dark to proceed farther, we had to crouch down near this ghastly company.  We had to stop there 2 hours, till the moonlight helped us on our way.  It is wonderful how many noises we heard there, various little night creatures, were scratching away in the dead leaves, once one made a visit to a dead Turk, and took sudden fright at my boot.  At another time, we heard something coming up, from the creek - swish - swish - just like a man brushing against the leaves - my safety catch went forward - & I slipped the "cut off" out of my rifle, ready to bail up Abdul should he appear - But it must have been a jackal jumping through the bushes
As soon as the light, began to show - we pushed forward - & arrived at last, at the foot of the Turkish outpost
