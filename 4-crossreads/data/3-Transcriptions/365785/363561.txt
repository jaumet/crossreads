<p>6 weeks on business and will be pretty busy all the time.<br/>I am losing all my hair, tis falling out in waste paper baskets full and the Hairdresser says it will cost &amp;pound;5.5.0 to restore it to its usual beauty.  It is either that or a toupe &ndash; which do you recommend?<br/>And how are the infants?  I suppose my little man is in trousers and has applied for a commission by now and is Tingsy still irrepressible and Margaret tinier than ever?<br/>Tell Trix I got her letter and enclosures which I gave to one of the Hospital days which recur twice a day in London.<br/>Goodnight old girl and take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Yrs. plainer than ever<br/>Nan.</p>
