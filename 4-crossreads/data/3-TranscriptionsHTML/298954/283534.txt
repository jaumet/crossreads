<p>Sat 6th Oct (cont.)<br/>The "Wolf" was examing a neutral (without revealing her identity) when what was taken to be a British auxiliary cruiser was sighted.</p>
<p>The hatches were closed on us, our one exit was covered with an iron grating which was further held down by huge sacks of dried peas!</p>
<p>There were to be no prisoner-survivors if "Wolf" went to the bottom, that was evident!</p>
<p>The vessel was not an auxiliary, merely the usual armed merchantman.   "Wolf" chased her hard all night, but when morning broke she was too far off to be caught.</p>
<p>She was clearly visible on our port beam &ndash; looked like a big Blue Funnel Liner.</p>
<p>When she was out of sight "Wolf" turned on his tracks and made straight for the base.</p>
