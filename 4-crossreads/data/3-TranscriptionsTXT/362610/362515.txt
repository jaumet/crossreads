Thursday 26 October 1916Rain during the night & miserable during the day, the mud being even worse if that were possible. Took a walk round in the morning & in the afternoon went up on to a hill close by whence one obtained a fine view of the heavy artillery, a very impressive sight, the whole slope being speckled with it. Clear for a short time about nightfall, but then rain came on again later.
