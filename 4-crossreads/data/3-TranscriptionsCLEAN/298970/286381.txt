  
 In evening went to Picture Show in Sailly.  Scotch on their way to Armentieres from the Somme.  Gas School in the paddock near by - experimenting today.  Thunder storm tonight. 
 23rd August (Wednesday) 
 A.D.M.S. came and expressed his satisfaction with the progress we are making.  Cutting out roof plates all day.  In the evening huge guns on caterpillar wheels and drawn by two tractors arrived to strafe La Bassee.  Aeroplanes report the presence of civilians in the German trenches so the Tommies are going over the bags tonight.  Gas Alert.  Terrific bombardment opened late at night.  Poor Fritz must be getting on rather badly. 
 24th August (Thursday) 
 A lovely day.  Four cart
