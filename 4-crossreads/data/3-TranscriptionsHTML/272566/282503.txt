<p>Thursday 1 March</p>
<p>Left for trip to Heilly at 12 o'clock to take dirty clothes from our baths to be washed.  Heilly is 11 Kilometres from Albert.  Passed the Detention Camp where defaulters are imprisoned.  Saw the posts to which men are chained daily for No. 1 Field Punishment.  This is true, and a disgrace to any Nation professing to fight for liberty.</p>
