 has happened again.  When the 15 th  Australian Brigade entered this village where I am writing these notes. "Hamelet" they found five thousand yards of the Line vacant, but for the presence of seven British Cavalry men who were prepared to hold this place to the death.  They had four machine guns.  Just fancy seven brave men resisting an army.  It is epic.
