Raining heavily today,ground very boggy.
Dec 9th:- Weather cleared up. Nothing unusual doing.
Dec10th:- Heavy artillery& rifle fire on our right today, but have not heard exactly what was doing. Witnessed some fine air fighting today. (small Turkish attack followed by counter by us positions finally unchanged).
Dec 14th:- Was recommended by Colonel Granville for a Commision in the Regt., but was informed by the Brigade Major that I was too old, at the age of 28 years & two months, 28 being the extreme limit. Less said the better perhaps so "malish".
