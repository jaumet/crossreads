<p>I am going to leave this with our Q Master Freddie Turner he is a good sort of chap &amp; will see that it is sent home if the worst happens &amp; he is spared.<br/>23rd. Well thank God I have been spared to come through another fierce charge safely &amp; with scarcely a scratch I think Providence must watch over me, for my luck seems unatural.<br/>After I passed my diary in last night, we sent all our <strike>b</strike> overcoats &amp; blankets into a big dugout. at 10.30 we moved out, &amp; all the way we had to run the gauntlet of a pretty heavy shell fire for the Germans were very suspicious &amp; evidently were expecting an attack, they were slinging their rockets about all over the place lighting the country almost like day, we reached the firing line at 11 oclock, &amp; took up our positions &amp; waited for the time to come for us to hop over, while in the trenches</p>
