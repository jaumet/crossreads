1917 APRIL
18 WEDNESDAY
Snowing in morning &
raining the rest of the day. We
left Longuenesse at 10 AM
& after passing through
"Lumbres" we arrived at
Quesques [(Kirk)?] about 7 pm
& camped in a barn again
The country has altered
a lot here, has a lot of hills
& is not very thickly populated
You cannot buy things
either like you can near
the line.
