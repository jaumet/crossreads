 January 26 42. All day faint circling blowing snow. 
 Preparations for a dinner tomorrow night - Mac, George, Arthur, Blinc, and company. 
 January 27 43. Evening:  tonight for a Dinner of 9, already half the crowd are mellow and Rhine wines and Punch stand for drinks. 
 No mail and a cold day. 
 January 28 44. Clearing out pack and sorting old gear about 'Maps', re-discovered 'The Imitation of Christ", found at Becordel just after the Factory Corner stunt.  Opening it, the first read verse - 
 It is not lawful to cast them all away, for nature must be supported;  but to require superflueties, and such things as are most delightful, Thy holy law forbids:  for otherwise the flesh would grow insolent against the Spirit. 
 - just as kit was cut down to a minimum to provide easy space for souvenir Maps and Keats and "Today"!
