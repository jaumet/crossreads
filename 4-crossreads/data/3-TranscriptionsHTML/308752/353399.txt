<p><u>"Welcome to Bearers"</u>.   Christmas Dinner was a huge success, 5 courses, Soup, Rissoles, Vegetables, Plum Pudding &amp; Custard, Fruit &amp; nuts.  We all made beasts of ourselves. The Colonel made a fine speech &amp; welcomes the Bearers home again. The tea was also good, jelly, custard &amp; preserved fruits. In the evening a splendid concert was given in the mess tent. All our Officers were present.  Some of the skits, mentioning different fellows &amp; Officers in the Unit, wee very clever &amp; funny. A very pleasant day.</p>
<p>Tuesday 26th December 1916.<br/>Boxing Day. No parades or fatigues today. All enjoying a rest. Attended a Vaudiville Concert at the village in the evening. A splendid show, our silvery tenor Bob Roberts is one of the artists. He has been transferred to the Company for a few days. I think he will find it a better job than Stretcher Bearing.</p>
<p>29th December 1916. Had leave to one of the biggest towns in France. The car leaves every morning &amp; returns to the Chateau</p>
