 A man sells his wife or child as he likes. 
 The wife does not care. 
 The wife goes home to her own people if she is turned out. 
 A woman who wants to get away gives to him whatever he gave to her father mother or brothers for her. 
 The husband has no obligation to keep the woman. 
 While she is with him he feeds her&nbsp;&amp; keeps her in a hut. The huts are well raised from the gro und as protection against wild animals. The woman grows no corn the man does no work.
