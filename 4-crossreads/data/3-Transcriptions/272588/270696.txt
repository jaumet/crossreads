<p>Thursday 25 April<br/>Anzac Day, &amp; the troops were liberally supplied with<br/>1 pair socks<br/>1 pkt. chewing gum<br/>1 pkt. cigarettes<br/>Generous, eh.<br/>Very quiet on the front all day but we hear rumours that the Boche has taken Kemmel Hill.  Ye Gods it is marvellous.  No doubt, the bombardments on the left for the last two nights were preliminary to the attack.</p>
<p>Friday 26 April<br/>Quiet to-day.</p>
