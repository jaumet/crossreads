The Melbourne pilot flew over the gun that fired at the French Cruiser &amp; killed 36 men &amp; put her out of commission. She is laying here at Port Said at present. We hear of a British monotor &amp; a torpedo destroyer having moored for the night inside of submarine proof nets. The both were torpedoed whilst at anchor.A French oil steamer passed within a few feet of us &amp; when about 400 ft. away a terrible explosion occured on board. The oiler caught fire &amp; she burnt close to the shipping for 2 days. Several explosions occured. The magazine blew up &amp; a piece of iron was blown from her on top of the Exchange Hotel a matter of 500 yards away. All the windows within a radius of &frac14; of a mile were all shattered.My self &amp; other officers being at the Navy house having a lecture on gunnery &amp; on submarines when we heard a terrible explosion the windows of the building fell out &amp; the Lieut. Commander in Charge remarked that the Huns were at it again. Meaning enemy airoplanes.Well we all rushed out &amp; found it to be a French oil tank steamer on fire. Several of the crew was burnt to death &amp; several injured. The captain &amp; pilot jumped overboard were burnt badly but saved. Whilst on fire some of us officers passed her within a few yards in a boat &amp; saw one of the crew with his head &amp; arm out of one of the forcastle ports. Burnt to death. A horrible sight.
