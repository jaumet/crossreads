 Monday 5th November 1917 
 Posted notes yesterday &amp; left London at 4 p.m. for Southampton.  Did not  leave London &amp; am likely to be blocked for several days. Laura arrived &amp; had dinner with us so I at least saw her but am anxious to get away now that all arrangements are made. 
 Cold pretty rotten still so a few days won't be amiss here, Australasians arrived safely.
