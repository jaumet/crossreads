<p>JANUARY 1917</p>
<p>15 MONDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny the early part of the</p>
<p>day. The first sun pretty well</p>
<p>since we have been in France.</p>
<p>I was stableman for the</p>
<p>day, so did not get out</p>
<p>anywhere. Got seven letters</p>
<p>from Australia &amp; a parcel</p>
<p>from [Lisheen?]</p>
<p>Got my first parcel of tobacco</p>
<p>from the Civil Service Stores.</p>
