  
 Today is the 23rd Oct 1917, just a year since I said goodbye to my loved ones and I am still whole! 
 We stayed at Cornwall Camp till the 25th Oct 1917. I went to a picture show a couple of miles away last night and saw Chaplin in "Shanghaied" Quite a welcome change! 
 At 4.30 on the morning of the 25th Oct 1917 we left our camp and proceeded to Brandhoek Station The wind was biting cold! We were on the move again, no one seemed to know where! 
 About 9.30 we entrained and finally reached Arques about 2 in the afternoon There we were motored in lorries to a new town and it was Lugy again! I renewed my acquaintance with my old French friends again! They were pleased to see me again! 
 Winter seemed to have set in properly although we had no snow yet! 
 I received 40 francs today (27th Oct 1917) had a gay old time in Fruges.
