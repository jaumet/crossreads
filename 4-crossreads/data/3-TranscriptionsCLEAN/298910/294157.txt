  
 "Australians" 
 Written by Miss Ethel Campbell (of Durban) after hearing a wealthy Durban Merchant speak disparagingly of Ausies. 
 We are not cotton spinners all, but some love England & her honor yet 
 We stand on the shores of Durban And watch the transports go To England from Australia Hurrying to & fro, Bearing the men of a Nation Who are heroes to the core - To stand or fall by the Motherland, And they are sending thousands more. We've watched the ships returning With the cripple & the maim With limbs that trail & falter
