<p>Monday 11 June</p>
<p>Heavy thunderstorm broke upon us just after midnight and the rain seemed to come straight through our tent.  Everything was wet through.  About mid-day the weather cleared.  Our Division, the 5th, are due to take Bapaume over again, so that the moving picture men can exhibit the move before the Aust. Public.  This was to have been done today.<br/>Capt. Riley &amp; Les Townsend mentioned in despatches.  The former is a dentist and deserves <u>no</u> distinction.</p>
