<p>12th.  Another trip to the dentist this morning but happily not for long.  He just raked one of my back teeth clean &amp; put some chemical stuff in to kill the nerve.  Its just beginning to give me fits now but its much better than having them out straight off the bat.  I had enough of that sort of thing in Birmingham.</p>
<p>13th.  A lucky day for me, this afternoon as I was sitting at my table the Orderly Sgt. rushed in &amp; shouted out my name &amp; sung out that I was to report to No. 10 Camp immediately to go to Australia.  I was writing a letter home at the time so you can guess how pleased I was.  I packed up my things at once &amp; took them over to the Camp.  There I met a few of the lads I had not seen for years including Bob Modrell of the 5th Division.<br/>In the afternoon Charlie Tonkin came across &amp; we went for a walk it was a glorious afternoon &amp; the countryside looked simply splendid, everything looked so <strike>clam</strike> calm &amp; beautiful, &amp; the leaves</p>
