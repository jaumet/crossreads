<p>Sunday, 27th December, 1914<br/>Being sick &amp; having to see the doctor every morning I did not go to Church Parade in the afternoon.  I wrote a long letter to E. and at night went for a stroll through Maadi.  When we returned we had a great joke with our tent mates, we pretended we had met two English girls and gone for a walk, we got them really mad about it as English girls are as rare as diamonds here and now the whole camp is teasing us about them.  So far we have not received any Aust mail from the time we left Albany.  There are 3 mails now due.</p>
<p>Monday, 28th December, 1914<br/>All heard fearful rumour of the big engagement in the North Sea, but only a rumour.  At night on picquet &amp; got guard patrol, not going on my shift until 10.30 so I walked across to the recreation tent where a concert was being held after it was over I walked back to the lines and a corporal came up to me &amp; told me I was under arrest &amp; had to report to S. M.  I did so &amp; found that the guard had been turned out  &amp; four of us were missing including the Corp of the [indecipherable].  We were all remanded to orderly room the following morning.  During the night on picquet an A. section mare presented us with a foal but it was premature.</p>
