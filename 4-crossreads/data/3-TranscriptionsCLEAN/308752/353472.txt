Mr Hooper who was very pleased to see me, he said I looked very well, it was over two years since I bid him farewell in Sydney.  It is marvelleous how the time ,flew  passes by. In the afternoon I visited Albert Colley-Priest, the paters brother at East Sheen. He is the image of you father.  We had a good old yarn of course, then I bade him farewell & boarded the train for Worthing on the south coast near Brighton. It was a most enjoyable trip, the country was looking very fine, & the scenery was magnificent.  It was dark when I eventually arrived at my destination. I found my cousin Daisy Colley-Priest waiting for me, I knew her before she even spoke to me, she's a Colley-Priest all right. We are a fine looking lot you know.   Stopped the night at Aunt Rose's home. In the morning I went for a walk before breakfast along the sea beach. It was indeed a very pretty sight. The promenade & sea beach resembles that of St Kilda very much. Worthing is indeed a fine seaside resort, it possesses fine streets & numerous fine buildings. Returned to London by the 9.15 train in the morning. Left London for Fairford by the 3.15 train in the afternoon.  A very pleasant trip, the country looking at its best. Changed at Oxford & having an hour to wait for the train, I took a stroll
