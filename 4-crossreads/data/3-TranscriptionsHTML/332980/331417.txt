<p>the Road between St Omer &amp; Berguette. I caught the Passenger leaving here at 8.35 &amp; passed through Arques &amp; then the line branches away to the left towards the Fireing line, passing through Wardreques, Aire, Icebergs &amp; then into Berguette, as one leaves Wardresques behind, one soon notices a difference, the Civil Population is less &amp; more Empty houses, a large number of Trenches are made &amp; others in course of making by the Chinese Labour Coy, also post's &amp; Barb Wire in front of the Trenches This is all necessary in case the German's make a big attack any tine, as the Train approaches Berguette, the large Iron Works on your left look very desolate, &amp; some of the Works have been hit by Shells &amp; Bombs, These works are closed &amp; all the Civil Population of the Town has departed for other parts except a few people with their Estaminets, the Town itself is deserted &amp; several houses have been hit &amp; knocked about, &amp; shell holes are here &amp; there, all the Windows are broken also all glass</p>
