<p>We now have a new O.C.  Our Colonel handed over the command to Major Thompson on Friday a special parade being held at which he inspected the unit &amp; was introduced to all the N. C. O's.  On Saturday the Colonel said good bye &amp; left the same night on his way to Australia.  Good luck be with him, a man I have great respect for, St. Col A. H. Tebbutt D.S.O.<br/>Tuesday 18th Sept.<br/>  On the wallaby once more.  We started off at 9.30 again passing through Abeeli &amp; so to "Reninghelst" crossing the border into Belgium at 11.50 A.M. finishing the journey about 3 oclock a distance of about 8 miles.  We were all fairly tired but only one man dropped out.  On arrival I had a sponge over &amp; clean change of underclothes &amp; felt a new man.  Heavy traffic on the roads large numbers of motor lorries being in evidence also a lot of Chinese Coolies</p>
