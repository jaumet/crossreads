As we passed the forts stationed near the entrance, searchlights were played continuously on us. The water was quite smooth here &amp; the air "nipping".</p>
<p>When about half a mile from the town the engine room telegraph rang "STOP" &amp; gradually we slowed down until the pilot yelled out "Let go", and with a rattle of machinery &amp; ringing of the ships bell, the A13 was anchored in about 100 feet of water. At every 15 fathoms of anchor cable there is a shackle &amp; as each shackle passes over the windlass, a ring is given on the bell &amp; this way lets the pilot know when enough cable is out, when he calls to "stop". The town of Hobart could be seen alight with electric lights at the foot of snow capped Mt Wellington. It looked a very small town &amp; there was no noise or bustle such as is heard in Sydney on a Friday night. Nine o'clock was just chiming on the Hobart Post Office &amp; the first difference I noticed was between our cracked Town Hall chimes &amp; the sweet tones</p>
