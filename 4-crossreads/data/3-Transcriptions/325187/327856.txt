<p>April 21st Court Adjourned-  Mosquitoes bad very hot- I am to report to Divisional Head Quarters near Ismailia as soon as Court Martial is over, on Staff job up there for about a month- hope to be in Cairo, but must return to Sohag for my horses &amp; kit, but one never knows now I am on Staff job when it will end.</p>
<p>April 22- Assuit- Adjourned Court for Easter   Am living in comfort now.  We have a true saying "No lice, no Typhus No fleas no Plague," as these animals are the carriers-  Armoured Train is stationed here, the same sort we used in Africa</p>
