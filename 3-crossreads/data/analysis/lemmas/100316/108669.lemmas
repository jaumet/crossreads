The Hun offic are said to have remark on the poor qualiti and youth of their men and also say that they were on the point of attack us . A request came down for more offic to be sent up but I was not have ani . With a loss of almost 2 compani and onli 6 offic casualti the request was not a reason one . So I decid to send up Lanyon and King into action and onli to be use as necessari . Set off on horseback to arrang thing with Sutherland when I met King hand all order to him and then return to my billet . The other battalion seem to have suffer light compar with our and the 24th talk of onli 20 casualti . The villag by Vill sur Ancre is definit in our hand . Fair number of Hun have been seen move down the road toward the villag and tonight there ought to be a heavi counter attack . My theori re our stand barrag caus us loss 1 .
