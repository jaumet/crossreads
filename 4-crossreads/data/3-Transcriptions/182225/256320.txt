<p>Another nice warm day. Helio signalling all day. I got a couple of letters from Mother to say she would come down to Salisbury if I wanted her too, but as I get leave on Monday I <s>did not as </s>wired her not to come. The 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery went on duty. I was detailed as incinerator man.</p>
