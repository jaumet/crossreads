22/5/19LondonWearing mufti today. Went to Berkleys at Victoria St and left my tunic etc. went up to Covent Garden. The Opera is situated in a slum - how unlike Paris! Looking in a side door could see all the scenery - a science in itself is the provision and management of this. Porters running everywhere carrying boxes of fruit. The scene not unlike Les Halles in Paris. From here tubed to the Strand and up towards Drury Lane. Wandered round among the many second hand bookshops of this funny old quarter. Lunched in a Lyons cafe for 1shilling  - quite a good meal. Then walked up toward St. Pauls and did some more shopping before returning to Hotel. A pity that they let Australia House be as placarded with posters and surrounded by huts and sheds of YMCA etc.
