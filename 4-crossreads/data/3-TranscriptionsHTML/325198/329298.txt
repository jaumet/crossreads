<p>7 May, 1916<br/>Katia<br/>We left camp to day at 1.30 too feed [indecipherable] horse &amp; man, gosh it was hot too.  We camped at Katia &amp; every one started to boil quarts for tea after watering horses.  I had just taken one sip of boiling hot tea when we got the order to saddle up, so there was a cramming of bully  beef &amp; bread &amp; a gulping of hot tea for 30 sec &amp; we shoved on the old saddles &amp; off once more,  We had to go on out post until the two regiments were ready to move off  The sand flies nearly ate me &amp; my horse</p>
