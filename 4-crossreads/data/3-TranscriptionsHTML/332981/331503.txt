<p>"The German flag will be hauled down at Sunset."</p>
<p>The German High Sea Fleet surrendered yesterday Nov 21st 1918 to the Grand Fleet. Down a long lane formed by the Ships of the Royal Navy, and led by one of ours, 5 Battle Cruisers, 9 Battle Ships, 7 light cruisers, and 49 destroyers passed to internment.</p>
<p>Admiral Beatty's historic signal after the German Fleet had been moored was:-</p>
<p>"The German Flag is to be hauled down at 3.57 (Sunset) today, and is not to be hoisted again without permission".</p>
<p>The Great Surrender.</p>
<p>Cheers for Admiral Beatty.</p>
