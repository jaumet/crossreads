 Saturday 15 April 1916 A dull grey day, cold in the wind. A full parade on the Training Ground was held in the morning but after we had been there a short time several of our companies were sent back because the heads were not ready for us. Reached camp just in time to escape a heavy storm during which some very light snow fell. Until 3 in the afternoon busy at the fence, erecting marquee &amp; similar work, &amp; then with 3 other officers walked round the beach to Etaples where, after &frac12; hrs wait we caught the narrow gauge electric train out to Paris-Plage, a fashionable little watering place on the Channel, the train line taking us through a "forest" nearly all the way. Saw the "Socotra" in the process of being salved on the beach, the bow being quite apart from the remainder. Looked round the promenade, fashionable but deserted houses, bathing machines now idle, &amp; streets full of officers, then had tea of ham &amp; eggs, another walk round &amp; train back, reaching camp abt. 9 o'clock in the moonlight.
