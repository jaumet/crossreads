<p>9 &ndash; He has a bad eye at present. I have been to see him twice. He liked hearing all the Lemnos news.<br/>I got two nice letters from Co Jamieson. I think he will soon be back with us.<br/>I have not seen any of the "sights" yet &ndash; but have bought a Cairo guide book and two small books of Egypt in the Peeps &amp; Many lands series &amp; a guidebook to the pyramids "written for the Australian exp Force in camp beneath them" &ndash; which I've read &amp; will post out to you. It's very good. There was a slight riot in Cairo today &ndash; but the light horse were called in and nothing happened.<br/>I will stop writing not. This is not a very interesting letter. I will have more to tell in the next.<br/>Devoted love to you all<br/>I hear there are heaps of parcels awaiting me at our new home where I go tomorrow.<br/>Your loving daughter &amp; sister<br/>Betha McMillan</p>
