  
 Monday 1 January 1917 [1918] The New Year!  Went H.C. [holy communion] 6.30 a.m. & church room full of brave wounded men waiting patiently to be healed & sent back to the front again.  Such a bright sharp morning & pretty clouds.  Hymn 73 & I wonder how many of us are to tread that awful road in this coming year! At lunch 3 sisters & 9 V.A.D's from the "Arragon" [Aragon] sat with us & their accts. are most depressing.  1200 men gone & some sisters.  3.30 p.m. we went to the Residency, shook hands with L. & L. Wingate rec'd gift & walked in lovely grounds & watched the old Nile flowing by as peacefully as ever.  Concert in Connaught 7 p.m.  A R.F.C. [Royal Flying Corps] man (N.Z.) flew over at 10 a.m. & dropped greetings for 1918, then when over "Aotea" a wing broke & he was killed & the other man injured.  Altogether a full & sad day in some ways.
