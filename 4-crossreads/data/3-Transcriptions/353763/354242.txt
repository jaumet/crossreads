<p>Indian coolies were there by the score as well as Fijians &amp; Samoans  -  men women children  -  They had never seen such a sight as England's War ships &amp; fighting men  -  The coolies come from Calcutta &amp; are used on the extensive sugar plantations of Fiji  -  Almost everyone, including the natives, on that pier had an umbrella  -  We did nothing that eveng  but smoke cigarettes &amp; talk  -  The war news is most interesting  -  We cant but notice that in spite of the Allies driving the enemy back <u>for miles</u> each day yet that Lille Ghent Antwerp are all in German hands  -  I also notice that the English bombs from aeroplanes caused <u>great destruction</u> but not the German ones curiously enough!!! No naval news whatever is another marked feature  -<br/>This morng  -  was fine though rain fell heavily in the aftn  -  We posted our letters thro a petty officer  -  Went out to our anchorage &amp; here we are &ndash; waiting for orders  -  Reading  -  Writing &amp; making the best of Suva  -</p>
