  
 [Saturday 17 June 1916] We have been turning night into Day so much lately I've rather lost the thread of things anyway we are back in Camp once more very tired & very sleepy  Letter from May dated April 30th telling me of the Insurance work, poor old girl I'm sorry can't help her more.   Among some Tobacco & Cigarettes issued to me I found a Card from W Kilpatrick  Cornallas  Peter Pan Cigarettes No doubt about it the folk at home are good to Thomas Atkins & it is appreciated-
