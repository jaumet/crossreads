  
 the tents had been pulled down & packed on waggons but being tired I put on a little sleep. Sunday being the next day, we had a easy day as the horses wanted a day or so spell after their climbing hills & trotting over deserts. 
 Monday I got on boat fatigue but we were not allowed to touch anything. It was Gift stuff we had to unload & as the ASC. & Supply officers had not looked at things & helped themselves we had to leave them untouched so I strolled back to camp
