Saturday August 25thThe wind died off a little during last night. "G" boat roll left about 6.30 this morning, the rumor is, they are to embark at Plymouth. "I" Boat-roll was called out today, I was not on it. Between 800 & 900  were picked, 900 more are expected to be picked for "J" boat roll tomorrow, I hope I am on it. It is very cold tonight.
Sunday August 26thNo boat roll today. These boat rolls are the typical talk of the camp just at present, everybody seems anxious to get on one, we are all tied with the one brush I think, all anxious to get home. The food isn't very good here, & there isn't much either. The wind has risen again, & by the look of things rain is going to set in.
Monday August 27thWas put on fatigue duty today. Had to carry fat from the cook house to the boiler down. There was only about half an hours work. No fatigue lasts long here owing to so many being put on the jobs. Raining nearly all day & the wind is still blowing. Went to a concert in the Gym. The party was from Bournemouth, & not up to much.
