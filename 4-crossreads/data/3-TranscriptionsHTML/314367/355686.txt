<p>This Friday aftn Fitz &amp; I took the skiff &amp; went dynamiting fish on our own &ndash; We pulled pair oar alternately &ndash; Fitz got the cartridges &amp; fuse ready &ndash; Then he found he had forgot the matches &ndash; I said &ndash; Let's go to that German's house &amp; get some &ndash; He said &ndash; Wd you mind going &amp; asking? I had but my pyjamas on &amp; said &ndash; certainly &ndash; but you must lend me your shoes &ndash; off I went - Saw German got matches &amp; talked to him 3 very nice flaxen haired children &ndash; I told him I was a Doctor &amp; out fishing &ndash; The two little ones took each a hand &amp; back we went to our boat &ndash; I kissed both of them &ndash; Charming little things &ndash; no shyness. They spoke English &ndash; It was Fitz &amp; my first time dynamiting on our own &ndash; Fitz said if one exploded near me what wd happen? I said your head wd probably be blown off badly &ndash; He was a bit nervous &ndash; The great idea I said is not to hang on when once the fuse is lit but to get rid of the thing in the middle of a shoal of fish &ndash; Well I pulled &amp; we saw a shoal &amp; Fitz dipped in &ndash; Two blanky matches failed but the 3rd time the fuse lit &amp; Fitz chucked it.</p>
