 The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and Me When we are absent and the World seems drear Though many miles may part us, land or sea His arms enfolding us, will draw us near. 
 The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and Me We miss each other so, He knows it well And, in His love, will make our love to be Our joy and stay wherever we may dwell. 
 The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and Me, And guard and shield us both from harm &amp; pain And grant that soon together we may be Together, nevermore to part again.
