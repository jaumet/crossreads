  
 Tuesday 17 August, 1915 
 Yesterday & today have been days of missery spent amongst the most apalling state of filth & grime conceivable. 
 It turns out that the transport originally intended for us broke down & we were sent off on this boat. On her last voyage she carried a cargo of coal, everything you touch is black. 
 Our rations have for the most part been dry biscuits & bully beef with water. Anything would be an improvement on this.
