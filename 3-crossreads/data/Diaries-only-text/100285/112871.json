had gone to sleep in his bed, you should have seen the look on Possy's face when he pulled the blankets off the supposed drunks face, laugh I nearly died!! in fact we all did. Lindsay I paid Len a visit over at the OTB. last night, we played "bridge" till fairly late then came home in the moonlight. I hear just after we left there was a big row there, Len threw a couple of them out by the scruff of the neck, he went on his final leave today before going to France.
Have not long finished a big Dental roll for tomorrow, it is raining drearily though not very heavy. Lindsay I have just come in from the canteen where we have just had our usual supper
