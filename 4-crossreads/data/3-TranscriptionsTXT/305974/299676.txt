 25 Monday A cold, bleak, windy day.  Rained during the evening.  Everything quiet during the day except for a few getting drunk.  Received boxes of gifts from Colonel Beaston of Newcastle (original O.C. of this unit) in the morning.  The boxes contained sweets, tinned goods, playing cards, tobacco, pipes, etc.  We spent a very enjoyable time in the evening at a large room in an "Estaminet".  There was a splendid spread including Roast stuffed Geese, Baked &amp; boiled potatoes, Cabbage, Tarts, cakes, Xmas pudding Soft drinks.  Wine &amp; beer. The room was very well decorated. A concert was indulged in after. 
 26 Tuesday Got up about 7 am &amp; walked to Canaples (2&frac12; miles) where we caught the 8.30 am train for Longpre &amp; after waiting close on three hours we caught another train for Amiens.  Had a very enjoyable time in Amiens.  Had a good bit of shopping to do.  Made myself a present of an "Onoto' Fountain pen for Xmas 1916.  We came the same way home  Arrived home about 10 pm very tired. 
 27 Wednesday Rather a fine day.  Went on dental parade &amp; after examining my teeth (I have two to be filled) the Dentist gave me an appointment at 10 am tomorrow.  Everyone seems to be getting rid of their colds now, there aren't hardly any crook now.  Writing letters all the afternoon.  The country round here is very hilly &amp; rather very pretty.  The French people very seldom build fences round their ground.  It is a very cold night.
