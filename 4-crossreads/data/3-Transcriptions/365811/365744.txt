<p>France<br/>10th April 1918</p>
<p>My dear Mr. Justice Ferguson,<br/>It is some considerable time I think since I last wrote and all sorts of things have happened since.</p>
<p>I suppose Caesar keeps pretty constantly in touch with you. I have not seen him for nearly twelve months but I think he is still going strong.</p>
<p>Just now of course we are at a critical stage in the war &ndash; I wish I could tell you all about it for I suppose you do not get many reliable facts on the situation away out there.</p>
<p>Needless to say the Australians are doing better than ever and we are all feeling quite cheerful. One thing that helps very much</p>
