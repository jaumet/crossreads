<p>touch with Aussie girls again. I met the nurses whilst trying to find Sister Herbert at our 3rd A.G.H. near here, she wasnt there &amp; a very nice sister asked me into their mess gave me tea, introduced me to other sisters - now we blow along &amp; see them any old time. The Australian officer is inclined to cut loose when out of the line &amp; these girls know it &amp; for our own good they get as many as possible to go &amp; see them &amp; I suppose trust to the restraining influence have some affect on us.<br/>Hoping you are keeping well my dearest sister Your loving brother<br/>Ken<br/>Niddrie Marischal Craigmillar Midlothian</p>
