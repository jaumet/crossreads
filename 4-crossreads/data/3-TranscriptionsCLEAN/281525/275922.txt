  
 29/10/17 Rome It was raining as we returned. Pulled up at the English cemetery and saw the graves of Shelley & Keats - the name of latter this wet afternoon was truly writ in water. To the Corso and there saw the enormous monument to Victor Emmanuel - a most imposing and enormous work. This quarter is very fine. Near here there is a fine fountain by MAngelo from which the waters of a very old spring issue. Near the Colloseum saw the triumphal arch of Constantine. Returned to hotel and then went out for a walk to do some shopping. Many altercations between cabdrivers. In the poorer parts both the houses the shops and the street crowds remind me very much of Cairo. The houses are ugly and the old bare wall type. Dined at hotel and feeling desperately tired, turned into bed early.
