Monday 1 AprilGlorious day.  Raid never came off. We were relieved this afternoon & are now back at the Brasserie. Of course there is no doubt as to our next move which in my opinion to the Somme, where still heavy fighting continues. This is the first time I have felt genuinely sorry to leave the line.  So quiet & happy we were. Easter Monday & April Fool's day, caught nicely. Rather curious to see an Australian saluting an English Colonel in sight of the enemy at R.A.P.
Tuesday 2 AprilGlorious day. Move from the Brasserie & joined up the unit at Reninghelst & move again on to Hoograf just on the outskirts of Poperinghe.  There are few troops in this area but much movement is in evidence presumably up & down to the Somme, where things have quietened a little. The propogander for saving food etc., has been extended to areas in France in occupation of British troops, in shapes of notices to "Eat Less & Save Shipping" & many others. A walk round some of our old haunts round in Poperinghe.  A very amusing incident to-day.  We bearers were [indecipherable].
