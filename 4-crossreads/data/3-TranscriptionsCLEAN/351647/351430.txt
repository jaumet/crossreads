Dear Mrs. John,
Its just ages & ages since I've had any word at all from anyone one.  Week by week goes by & nary a letter from Australia & everybody is pippy & anxious and scrappy.  I wonder if they have gone down.
The weather has been pretty heavy, not so frantically hot but very oppressive & I have felt absolutely dopey.  Haven't been able to work or write or even read.  Just doped about.  Its rotten to feel like that.
Really one won't be sorry to get up to the line for some things.
I haven't got much news, there's so little to tell these days, we get leave to go to Amiens a fairly large town not too far off.  Its a change, we get there about 10 & then have to prance about till 12 before we can go into cafes or anywhere.  Only British soldiers aren't allowed, you see French civilians & soldiers sitting down resting & feeding & drinking but except between 12 & 2 & 6 & 8 Britishers may not.  Of course you may go & see the Cathedral or sit in the parks on the seats but even in the latter
