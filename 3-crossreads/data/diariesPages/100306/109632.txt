Firing Line (Needle Tr) 
26/12/16 covered with papers and books whisky mugs, cigarette tins tobacco knives pencils candles electric torches enough rubbish to drive a good housewife mad. Artillery liason officer reported and as they put a few shells into us I asked for retaliation and our guns sent over beaucoup. On the left our artillery put up a four hours concentrated bombardment ?quite a good shoot. Only normal shelling round us. Yarned during evening in intervals of telephoning and fixing up ration difficulties, with Rodda McGregor. Talk turned on very few topics as War is our be-all and end all and absence so long from other interests leads all conversation into that of fights, past present, Gallipoli, trenches, Pozieres, mud, wounds death trench mortars, officers men, shells, our own Fritzs c. c. Toujours la guerre! They all turned in fairly early and I took up the night watch and sat up alone close to signal buzzers. A dark night flares not over frequent.
