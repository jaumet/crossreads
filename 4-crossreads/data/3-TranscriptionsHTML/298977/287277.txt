<p>3rd December 1916.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Richards,</p>
<p>I heard to-day from a Sgt Smith of the 5th Machine Gun Company of Roy's death.  He told me at the time Roy was wounded, how they had been going into the trenches and a shell burst over them and caught Roy in the right shoulder and that he was quite bright and cheery and every one believed he had only got a blighty, but it appears the shrapnel travelled from right to left and lodged some where under the neck.  He told Smith to tell me he was not badly hurt and would soon be about again, so you will understand what a great spirit he had and only for the fact that we were going into the trenches ourselves, I intended writing to tell you he was alright.  I have asked Smith, who by the way says he went to School with Roy, to send you full particulars of the funeral and where he is buried.</p>
<p>I trust you and his Mother will get some consolation from the fact that he died in England and received Christian burial, as many poor fellows are often just put in a shellhole and covered up with only a bit of boxwood stuck in the ground to mark the spot, and no word of prayer said over them.</p>
<p>Roy was a great favourite with all he came in contact with and as fearless as the day.  I saw him several times lately and he always had a smile and was looking the picture of health.</p>
<p>If there is anything I can do for you in regard to his grave, if you will let me know, I will of course do anything in power, Smith's relations are however on the spot and can probably do more than I could.  Roy's personal effects should be sent you from the D.A.A.G. 3rd Echelton, [Echelon] A.I.F. London, that is, his pay book, jewellery, private letters and papers etc., should these not come to hand within a reasonable time you should write to the above.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,<br/>(Sgd) E. Martin</p>
<p>Lieut colonel<br/>17th Batt.</p>
