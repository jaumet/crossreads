January 25, 16Posted away book of Memorials and old phamplet catalogue & the Benson book of Pater:  now to post old maps of the line and Moore's book.
January 2642.All day faint circling blowing snow.
Preparations for a dinner tomorrow night - Mac, George, Arthur, Blinc, and company.
January 2743.Evening:  tonight for a Dinner of 9, already half the crowd are mellow and Rhine wines and Punch stand for drinks.
No mail and a cold day.
January 2844.Clearing out pack and sorting old gear about 'Maps', re-discovered 'The Imitation of Christ", found at Becordel just after the Factory Corner stunt.  Opening it, the first read verse -
It is not lawful to cast them all away, for nature must be supported;  but to require superflueties, and such things as are most delightful, Thy holy law forbids:  for otherwise the flesh would grow insolent against the Spirit.
- just as kit was cut down to a minimum to provide easy space for souvenir Maps and Keats and "Today"!
