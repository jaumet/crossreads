  
 The responsibility & strain keen being keener on those on the navigation bridge. Every eye strained & every ripple of the sea investigated. Troops lined on boat deck both sides fore & aft on the lookout with loaded rifles in the event of periscopes being sighted. The troops conducting themselves splendid & very few seasick. Refering to the officers of the Brigade this day they are of the opinion that this war will not end this side of another 2 years neither will guns end it. Probably a patch up peace. 
 15th During the night passed the Islands of Linosa & St. Antioco. Lighthouses alight also the Island of Pantellarra south of Sicilly Italy during the early morning. This being a dangerous part, 2 of the destroyers scouting about 3' ahead throughout. Passed a fast Italian sub-motor chasers. A huge convoy of cargo boats going the opposite way probably bound for Suez and a decoy ship prowling about aimlessly. To noon today we have covered 1300 miles from Alexandria yet another 450 to go. The total distance in peace time being only 1500 miles from Alexandria to Marsailles. The route during war time being totally different on account of mines & subs reported.
