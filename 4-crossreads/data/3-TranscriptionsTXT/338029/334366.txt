our convoy was fired on, no damage, we are now right in the enemy country.  Bivouaced and fed for the night.  Zigi took to the brackish water splendidly, sent two men back sick.
Teusday 26th Sept.Away from camp again at 8 p.m., our next stage was over very heavy loose sand ridges some of them remarkable in shape, after 4 hrs. in saddle arrived at a well called Jeffiear where part of B Squad had dug some fine wells, we camped here but took long time to water, Zigi got in first and had a good feed but I went hungry, saddled up again in a scorching sun and commenced our last and worst stage of our 50 mile trek.  The country was deadly, passed S.E. of Dueidan and finally arrived at Megeibrah where the 11th beat the Turks, dead camels and Turks lent a pleasant odour to our welcome, watered at a fine well then I made tea for H.Qrs. Sgts. and camped for the night feeling quite fresh and well after a hard ride.  We relieve the Yeomanry to-morrow.  We are camped next to two camel corps, Imp. & Aust., they were in action three days ago, this country is only suitable for camels but the L.H. are finding and digging wells where even the Bedouins gave up hope.  A Bedouin spy was caught to-day, he had a lot of Turkish dispatches on him.  God knows where he got his water.
