<p>nervous   &amp;  sad. A sister  &amp;  orderly were killed at a C.C.S. close by. Don't worry about me because we are well cared for   &amp;  do not think we shall be put in such dangerous area again.</p>
<p>Dorothy   &amp;  I are very well. Some of our Battalions are camped near   &amp;  called a couple of our friends to see us, so we shall be out with then this afternoon. With our men could keep out of it altogether. This is a very pretty spot   &amp;  seems healthy for the camps. Major C . &ndash; is going to Aust. at the beginning of next months, so just address my letters C/O Aust Base Post Office &ndash; etc until you hear from me again.</p>
<p>I bought a new pair of boots this a.m. they are very difficult to get   &amp;  I'm very hard on boots now.</p>
<p>Cannot say much but should love to tell you heaps. Am very well   &amp;  happy. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Edith.</p>
