16/10/18 YzeuxBrigade from General Robertson who goes to Division. We are here in a fine Chateau. McColl B.M. Selleck S.C. Milligan Hislop & Jackson Mayer interpreter. The grounds full of lovely trees. After tea walked down to Bourlon getting on to high ground overlooking the Somme basin across on to the Picquigny side. Quiet and peaceful twilight here - no gun roar or flash. Had a good dinner with the Brigade Staff and sat yarning after it. Then went out for a while into the cold night air. Spent the rest of the evening writing a story for the "Echo" and signing a few papers. A case today of a Sergt M.M. receives a letter from his wife in Australia saying she has a youngster not his. Rather a knock for a chap fighting 3 years over here.
