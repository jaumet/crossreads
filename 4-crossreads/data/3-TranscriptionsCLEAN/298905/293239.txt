shoving it in.We are going to move out to supports tonight the 3rd Battalion are relieving us, we have had 16 days pretty constant going now & the Battalion has had nearly 70 casualties, so we have had it pretty warmThe storm is all over & the larks & other birds are singing gaily & everything smells nice & fresh after the rain.24th. As we were leaving the trenches last night the German's started to shell a part of the line pretty heavily, but fortunately kept off the communication trenches & "Convent Avenue", our chaps took up the challenge instantly, & they soon shut up, one of our chaps broke his leg he slipped on the clay & did the trick, you have no idea how slippery this Flanders mud is, it bangs all, I have never seen anything like it
