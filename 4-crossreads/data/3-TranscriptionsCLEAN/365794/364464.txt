  
 Sunday 3rd March 1917 [1918] A day off once more and a long quiet morning in bed with reading & letter writing.  Wrote Nell, Ida, & Mag. After lunch went with S. Talon & Capt. Chiel in garry to Citadel then walked to the top & took snaps, then back to Shepheards for tea 5 p.m. & after that All Saints & home in a garry.  A very enjoyable afternoon with two nice English people & no one could wish for anything more. For the first time since coming away I wished to be back when reading about surfing at Manly - not yet however.
