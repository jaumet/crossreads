 fine old chap, dressed in a Donegal tweed jacket, white flannel trousers,& a collar & tie. He spoke English well, & he was delighted to hear that Samoa was now British. His patriotism was intense, & to each drink we had he never omitted to say "Damn the Kaiser." He explained what preparations Suva had made to withstand any attack, & he was most emphatic in telling us that they would make things pretty hot for any Germans who had designs on Fiji. When I parted from him he wished us "good luck", and said he hoped that we should meet with the German cruisers & 'blow them up".  He also presented me with his walking stick. From what I could gather his position as King was more or less nominal, he being responsible to the Governor for practically nothing. He is a member of the Legislative Council & receives 200 a year, besides an annual stipend from the Government, with a house. His bearing was very dignified, & one could well imagine him sitting surrounded with Fijians in  solemn  conclave. The Fijian women are not such fine types as the men, & they age very early in life, & incline to be very portly & heavy. The Hindoo women were very picturesque with their bracelets on arms & ankles, & ornaments on their nostrils. The Fijian police are fine fellows, & apparently keep splendid order. Everybody seems highly contented, & it would be difficult to find a more patriotic race than the Fijians.
