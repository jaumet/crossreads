  
 Tuesday 11 January, 1916 
 Were towed up the harbour to 28 wharf, the Tommies got off in the morning but we had to wait till afternoon. 
 Were taken to "A" Camp Gabbari at Alexandria, our officers left us standing & went off. We had neither food nor bedding, we managed to get something to eat off some kind hearted Tommies & had us put on as many pieces of extra clothing as we could to bunk amongst some horse fodder in the Veterinary store. We were pretty cold & uncomfortable.
