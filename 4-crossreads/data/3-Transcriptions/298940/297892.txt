<p><u>Sunday 17th March</u><br/>Segt. Lucas of the 9th, in the next bed to me, heard today quite a number &ndash; about 19 &ndash; of the 9th died of the gas. Rather surprising, and significant, that. Those who had chronic vomiting, &amp; who probably got a bad concentrated whiff of the gas, are among names mentioned.<br/>Wimereux is a select village about five miles to the north of Bologne. Select, I judge it, because from this double marque in which I write , our ward , I can see through a side opening, the village perched on an opposing hill.</p>
