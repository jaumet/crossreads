 The S.S. "Kyarra" arrived in Sydney Harbour.  We were busy to-day getting our gear on to the ship.

 During the time we were in camp we were inoculated against Typhoid twice, and also vacinated once against smallpox. 
 After having scrupluously cleaned the camp, we left in train cars in the afternoon, getting of at the Orient Whaarf.  We were formed into messes of fourteen in number and then marched on to the ship. 
 There was a large number of people on the Quay, mostly ladies in gay attire.  It formed a very animated scene to see the Karki-clad soldiers on the ship holding many coloured streamers on the one side and the ladies holding them at the other.  We were well photographed by newspaper Photographers. 
 About 4 o'clock the gangway was lifted and the "Kyarra" slowly moved off from the quay. 
 The thought that occurred to me as we moved off was, "how many of us were likely to return"?  Would we all return or would there be many left behind. 
 After bidding W. Izalt farewell and requesting him to send a telegram to George for me stating I had left, I made my way down so as to become acquainted with our quarters of the ship.
