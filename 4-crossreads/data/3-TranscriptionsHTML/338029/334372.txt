<p>Monday 9th Oct.<br/>All excitement every man stuffing feed in to his horse as the task ahead is the severest test on horses yet called for in war.  We know very little save that we will trek to Bayud to-morrow and join C Squad.  Three days ago a man set off to ride to Negiliet, to procure canteen stores, he has not turned up yet, we surmise he got lost.</p>
<p>Teusday 10th Oct.<br/>No alarm this morning, set off at 9 a.m., poor Zigi heavily loaded with me in the saddle, she must have carried 14 stone.  It was pitiful to see the faces of the unfort. beggars who had to stay at home, it nearly broke their hearts, all well to Bayud, the country was very rough all sand drifts and loose hills.  Arrived at 2 p.m., met C squad.  Surprised at enormous preparations made here.  A Taube dropped bombs six miles from here, how he missed seeing us is a wonder.  Had a b &amp; b tea &amp; posted the picquet.  I am in charge of Headquarter Horse lines, slept in saddle blanket saturated with sweat, over 3000 camels arrived during the night.</p>
