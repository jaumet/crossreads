 Wednesday Nov 7th Still a very heavy swell on. This is a great old boat to roll. The wind is blowing behind us, we also have the current in our favour. 
 Thursday Nov 8th Deck billiards are all the go now. A good few matches have been played. Kept down below all day, as it was very windy &amp; cold up on top. 
 Friday Nov 9th Much better day. Sea much calmer. Expect to be in Fremantle on Monday morning. All the winches &amp; ropes have been got ready to start operations as soon as we arrive in port. 
 Saturday Nov 10th It was a very nice day today. The best we have had since leaving Capetown. Numerous comical posters have been put up, about different states. West Australia, Victoria &amp; N.S.W. have suffered most. We have an artist on board, &amp; he has contributed a good few very funny sketches.
