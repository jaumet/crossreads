  
 hard at work, getting almost no time to myself, many times I miss meals, and it is very seldom I get away to Cairo or out of the camp at all for duty must be done. My greatest anxiety just now is to get into Cairo to the head pay office to have my pay book attended and to make a fresh allotment so as you can draw twice as much as you are getting or more dear. You see write that is done I cannot get the pay which my rank entitles me to dear. I will try to do this tomorrow. You have no idea of the ever constant attention I have to put into my work The children would be proud of their old daddy now for if they could see me here the same Brown Belt just as the officers wear and the brass buttons (in fact all but the stars on sholder0 would take their fancy and they might take me for an officer as so many soldiers do. There is a good chance of me being promoted to Lieutenant in the near future I believe. All this I am telling you to let you know I am progressing dear Teddie for yours and the childrens sakes. We hear very little war news from the front at times about those who leave this camp I learn of men having been shot at the front and amongst them some of those poor fellows who were tent mates of mine at Beach Boy Hill
