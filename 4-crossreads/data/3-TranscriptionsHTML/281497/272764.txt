<p>All the Brigade men such as trench mortar &amp; machine gunners have gone into the trenches &amp; we follow them tomorrow so we will soon be in the thick of it again.</p>
<p>1st September.    Cool &amp; cloudy this morning &amp; the country is drying fast you can't beat a fair wind to dry the mud.   A lot of Tommies came into our camp last night they are taking the huts over from us &amp; we are going into the firing line sometime to day.   Got off parade again this morning I had a few stiches that wanted mending in</p>
