<p>Monday, 29 March, 1915<br/>Big review by Sir Ian Hamilton we had the morning off to polish up inspection at two, and we marched past the saluting base at 2.30 p.m.  The whole division passed ahead of us and there was a sudden halt right in front of us, causing our line to break a little, but the General was heard to say "very good" as we passed.</p>
<p>Sammy as usual went mad with excitement and just at the critical point, reared and plunged, and did not improve the dressing.</p>
<p>There was a raid in Cairo by a special picquet on all delinquents after 10-30 without passes and they arrested 55 including officers as well as three of our chaps and gaoled them for the night.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 30 March, 1915<br/>A section went out with the Bde we exercised in the morning &amp; did fatigue duties in p.m.  An immense number of French soldiers have arrived at Alexandria and are camped there.  Their destination is kept secret but can only be guessed.  We are all getting sick of Egypt and are praying to get away even if it is only to another camp.</p>
<p>There is a rumor current that we bearers may lose our horses and ride in ambulance waggons like the English cavalry ambulance.  Personally I think mounted bearers are a waste of horses and men, but is much preferable to walking like a field ambulance.</p>
