<p>There is an epidemic of mild influenza throughout the continent.  Spain was the first to experience it but now the sickness has spread through England, France &amp; Germany.  The quietness on the enemy front is attributed to this influenza.  We are evacuating large numbers of our own men daily who are down with it.  I have so far escaped an attack, although am only just getting rid of several weeks of hay fever followed by a touch of asthma.</p>
<p>Sund. 30th June<br/>The front still continues very quiet with occasional short bursts of shelling and raids by our Infantry.  Three days ago a daring "fritzer" plane brought down one of our observation balloons in flames in full view and then flew low over the A.D.S., firing his machine gun as he came.  We all ducked.  Rumour hath it</p>
