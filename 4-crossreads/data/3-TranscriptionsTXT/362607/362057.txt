 Bulford  7/7/18 
 Dear Mum, I rode to Southampton by Train yesterday &amp; Tommy Williams &amp; I attempted to get to Portsmouth but it was 18 miles &amp; a frightfully hot day &amp; we could not see the fun of it so we rode back &amp; sat on the Lovely Pier &amp; watched the Boats &amp; the Crowd. It is not like Manly Pier but a big one like that of Brighton which I sent to you. This archway is in the Main Street where all the Traffic has to go through. Imagine it stuck across From Jones to the G.P.O. but they manage the traffic all right. We got back to Sarum at 9.45 pm &amp; had supper at Mrs Edmonds &amp; arrived home at 11.30 after a lovely run on the Cycles Home. I met Les Whiffen a Lieutenant in 30 Btn on Salisbury Station. He &amp; His Father worked at D.J's. It is 3 years since I saw Him -  &amp;  yet we spoke to one another as casually as if we had only left D.J's  a week or had only just left Cronulla Beach. Well Mum I am writing another to Dad so I'll ring off for this P.C. We are at the Top    &amp; living on the part of the Land.  Fond Love.  Harry
