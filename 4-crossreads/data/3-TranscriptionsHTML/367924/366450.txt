<p>I am very sorry to hear about Mrs. Treasure being in such a bad state, I hope that she has the luck to get alright again. There seems to be a lot of bad luck around Kojonup since the war one way and another. I have had another letter from Helen Catt this last mail.</p>
<p>Yes I think that I have recieved all my parcels safely, any time you are sending a parcel, you can send me a tin of Eumenthols, do not send me any more clothing only a pair of sox occaisonally, do not bother to send any tin stuff, as it costs more than it is worth to send it. I do not get the papers to regular, but that does not matter <strike>two</strike> too much, the letters is what I want more than anything. Well we all hope that this year will end the war, I think that the air reprisals are the thing that will finish it, as America should be able to put a lot of aroplanes in, and I am sure that every body must he heartly sick of it, yes there must be a shortage of food in a lot of country's.</p>
<p>So you had a good crop of fruit this year. Have you heard how Guy Spencer is getting along. Nell tells me that Steve Blackmore is a Lance Coporel now, Steve is getting along alright good Luck to him. Yes I hope that I get a good price for my wool, I will want it all when I get back. I have only had the one letter from Dora and none from May but tell you the truth I am rather pleased, because one has none too much time for writing a lot of letters</p>
