 Tue. Aug 14th. The mountains on the East side of the bay are almost bare, with red earth outcrops showing here and there through the undergrowth. 
 Those on the Western side are covered with thick tropical growth to the tops.   The foreshores are a tangled mass of palms &amp; mangroves.   In a clearing on the beach just abreast of the "Wolf" is a village of the usual New Guinea houses on poles, but the appearance of the "Wolf" has caused the inhabitants to take to the hills. 
 At the far end of the bay a river apparently runs inland, two small islands guarding the entrance.   At the other end of the bay is the entrance through which we entered, which turns abruptly through the hills a few hundred yards from our anchorage.   The "Matunga" appeared at this entrance at 2 pm. and moved alongside. (The bay is Offak Bay.)
