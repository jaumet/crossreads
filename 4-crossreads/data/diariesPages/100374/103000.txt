A terrific bombardment has continued night and day. This gives me the idea that the push which was expected to take place up north has been commenced.

July 30th. Sat.
W. I. and myself went to Hazebrouck to have our eyes examined by the Eye Specialist there. Having suffered from severe headache of late I thought if I got my eyes tested and glasses fixed I might be a little better.

We had to remain in hospital for a night. Got permission to go out and we had a good look at Hazebrouck.

July 31st. Mon
Slight astigmatism in my eyes. No glasses advised. It appears to me that you must be almost blind before they will give you glasses in the army.

Unfortunately market had finished at 12 oâ€™clock so that we did not see the market in progress, but the square was lined with stalls selling every kind of household goods

Returned to the unit this afternoon. When we arrived we found the O.T. full of workers. Orders had been given to have the O.T. ready for the next morning, rather a big order when one sees that the roof is hardly on the hut Always the same in the army first things last
