Friday 28 December 1917"Connaught" gave its pts. a good & pretty 4 p.m. tea (all paid for by C. Grant) (5-0-0) then cigars & cigarettes & all pts. moved to Anzac & a concert given.  Such a sight of wonder.  Rows of beds, then pts. sitting or lying on pts. beds with legs, arms, heads, etc., all in bandages.
