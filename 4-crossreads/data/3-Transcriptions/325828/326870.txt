<p>about 8 O'clock.  We were anchored off the town &amp; round us were the boats with the Arabs in with all sorts of goods for sale.  It was a novel sight &amp; I was greatly interested.  Just at our stern was a British Cruiser of which I got a photograph.  By the way I developed all the photos that I have taken last night &amp; am sending you the negatives under separate cover<br/>We are due at Suez at 6 o'clock to-morrow morning (Wednesday 8th Decr) &amp; are all disembarking there.  We left Aden 12 o'clock the same day.  Coaled 1000 tons in 6 hours.<br/>We had a terrible scramble to get all our kit together &amp; I am very thankful to you Father dear for your marking my water bottle, haversack etc.  Our black kit backs which were in the hold were handed out to us yesterday.<br/>As soon as possible will send you a wire from Suez tomorrow.  We have been paid &pound;1 on board &amp; it will probably be the last for some time.<br/>It is now mail-time so must close.  With very best love to you all at home, &amp; I will look forward to hearing from you soon.<br/>Good-bye all my loved ones,<br/>Ever your own loving son<br/>Leo.</p>
