<p>I arrived here just as some of my pals were going for a tram ride to Uxbridge, a place I have not been to, so I went with them. We had a delightful ride, through very pretty country, with crops partly gathered in, orchards, &amp; vegetable gardens &ndash; quaint way-side Inns etc. When we returned to Southall about 9. p.m. found out a Caf&eacute;, so we all had hot coffee &amp; ham sandwiches for 4 &frac12; d each. We had great fun &ndash; people wondering what we were &ndash; Someone asked If we were the new "Aust. Lady Members of Parliament &ndash; What think you? Then If we were the new "Lady Policemen"? so goodness knows what we looked like. We have to wear our regulation uniform &amp; now  have Stars &amp; straps on our shoulders &ndash; It is very funny, we get the Salute now from the men, we can only bow, - but we get a lot of fun out of life.</p>
