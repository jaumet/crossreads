 Sunday 16 April 1916 A bright sunny morning, overcast later &amp; turning to rain at night. Parade at Training Ground in the morning, the officers going thro' a short machine gun course while the men were taken in hand by Imperial instructors. Was given a huge admiration for the Lewis gun by the young officer in charge of our party. Back to camp for lunch &amp; in the afternoon had to attend to a number of company crimes &amp; other urgent matters which took up to tea time, after which Prescott &amp; I went for a short stroll on the beach near the camp before settling down to letter-writing.
