<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother/.<br/>Has Kevin arrived home yet? I noticed his name in the paper amongst those who returned but unfortunately I did not get the paper till some days after or I could have met him on Armidale Station as he went through to Brisbane. I received father's letter giving his address in Brisbane and I intended to send him a telegram on his birthday but I  was on duty myself and could not get anyone to send it.<br/>The hospital is still full of mumps cases and to make matters worse measles has also broken out in the camp. There are now eighty three in hospital of whom about forty are suffering from mumps, thirty from measles, and the remainder are colds &amp;c.<br/>I have been on night duty all this week and as there are only two of us to attend to all the patients we are kept pretty busy hence my delay in writing.<br/>I had last Saturday and Sunday off and seven of us went up to Tamworth. It is about 60 miles by rail from here. The train left here at 7 O'clock in the evening and we arrived there at 10.30 pm. We then set about finding lodgings for the night and after trying several pubs whose prices staggered us we at length put up at the Commercial Hotel, our beds and three meals on Sunday to cost each of us 5/6d.<br/>Myself and a namesake of our friends Miss Wagner named Ted</p>
