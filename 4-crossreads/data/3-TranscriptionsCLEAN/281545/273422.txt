number of girls are employed cleaning Engines & various other duties about the yard also as Clerks in the Offices.   They are totally different to our Australian cleaners, they are so smart  & quick in their work & made a good impression.   I soon made myself known to the Driver of my return Engine & soon was quite at home.   As my knowledge of the Westinghouse Air Brake is very little the Driver explained the various parts to me & I was very much interested in the working of the Brake on the both journeys, we left Bethune on time which was 1.20 Pm & after an interesting run we arrived in Hazebruick also on time.  The country all along the line is looking very well & as it was another glorius day, it was a treat to be out in the sunshine, it was a real spring day & the French People all along were busy ploughing & sowing the seed, there is very little land about which is not under cultivation of some sort.   The French Peasants are a very industrious class of People & have very little land lying idle.   After leaving our train which continues on to Dunkirk we came back to Borre in good time signing off at 3.40 Pm, & receiving instructions to go over the road to Bethune again tomorrow Thursday at the same time.   After having an enjoyable tea I spent the evening in the Y.M.C.A. Hut at the rear of the Boys Huts, were a large number congregate for a game of Draughts etc.
