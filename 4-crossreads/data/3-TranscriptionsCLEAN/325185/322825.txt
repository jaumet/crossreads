  
 Up to the present have only received one of the parcels sent me one from the Miss Smiths Field & co Yes father Fritz was certainly getting a bit of a shaking up towards the start fo the winter but so were we. Oh he shook us up & no doubt about it.But the fighting at Ypres wasint to be compared to some of the scraps we had on the Somme. I don't know how we are going to get along now conscription has been turned down out there. They will never be abel to reinfce us. I think it will be a case of breaking some of the Divs up. Not that I am at all in favour of conscripts wouldent get the same class of men at all. Not that they shouldn't be just as good but the late reinforcmtnts are not to be relied on as the earlier ones were. Of coarse it is pretty tough having to go into some of the places we are put your first time under fire. There is no doubt we get the warmest work. If there is a tough job to be carried through. Oh the Australians will take it & they always have to we have the name & have to live up to it. It is a big strain on one though you get more shaky each time after a heavy shelling. Begin to think I cant last many more like that my turn must come. I don't know how they can clear out
