<p>fairly hard for we have been very busy.<br/>Had three evenings in town with two ladies, one of them the girl who gets my washing every week &amp; the other, her sister.<br/>The former, known to the boys as Rosey, has a young man at the front.  He was reported missing unofficially,<strike>abut</strike>  about a couple of months ago, but this week the report came through officially.<br/>She is a good girl &amp; as she was disposed to go out to cheer herself up, I saw no harm in taking her with her sister.<br/>Have also done some photography with fair success.</p>
