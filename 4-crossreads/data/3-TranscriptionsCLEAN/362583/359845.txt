 My dear Mother, 
 Here I am in Launceston after having spent a whole night in the train with a full grown man, & I have  not  had my money stolen. After breakfast I will go to the building right opposite the G.P.O., where ever that is, & find out what there is to find out. I think I will probably be going up to the Power Station this morning. 
 As the breakfast bell has just gone, & a feeling has come over me that I wouldn't be any the worse for a little nourishment, I will have to say good-bye. 
 Your loving son Arthur.
