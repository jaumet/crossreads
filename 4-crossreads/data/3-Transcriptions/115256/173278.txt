<p>Tuesday 19 January 1915</p>
<p>In spite of the inconveniences and unnecessary discomforts to which we are subjected on board, a feeling of good fellowship with the vessel which is your home for a month or so, seems to be present within you.  You no longer look on the steamer as so much steel and wood, all fitted together to form what we call a "liner".  It gradually acquires a personality.  Your whole interests, for the present, at any rate, are wrapped up in, and indeed are part and parcel of, the interests of the boat.  And after a time on board ship, there comes a time when you recognise this salient fact.</p>
<p>An almost exactly similar parallel is the case of the infantry soldier, and that powerful accurate weapon with which he is armed &ndash; the modern rifle.  After a time, there comes the day when he no longer looks on the daily cleaning of his rifle as a bore but as a natural duty to a friend, an almost live thing, a personality.  It is no longer so much steel and wood &ndash; the trained soldier knows that some day or other, his own life is going to depend on it and treats it accordingly.</p>
