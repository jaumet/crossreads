<p>Thursday August 16th<br/>Owing to yesterday C.B the hut had to be scrubbed out &amp; everything mad spick &amp; span this morning, then the Officer did not come round. took so photos this afternoon. I want to try the camera I bought in Parkhouse. Drizzling rain nearly all day. Pay Day today, I drew &pound;1, although I had more in my book.</p>
<p>Friday August 17th<br/>Went down to Weymouth for the evening. Took my film in to get deloped. There are still a good few holiday-makers in Weymouth. Owing to us being unable to get a motor or bus we had to walk in &amp; out, was very tired when I got back home, the distance is about 2 &frac12; miles.</p>
<p>Saturday August 18th<br/>Transferred to No 4 Coy, that is the second last company you get put in before going back to Australia, the last one is at Verne, from there you go on the boat. Was boarded again this afternoon by a Major &amp; Captain, they gave me a good examination. I think I am in the same class &amp; previous. Shifted into No 17 hut, the hut is in No 2 Coy's part of the camp. Went to Weymouth this evening. Photos turned out good. Got a supply of Films to take back with me.</p>
