Greene and his patrol were out and decided to cut across to another post and having got the direction they followed a path.  They were challenged in due course "Halt" and replied "Window" (the password).  The next query was "Valt?" and they answered "Window" again.  The next thing was a shower of bullets and one man was hit.  All withdrew safely and while bandaging the wounded man there was much laughing over the incident.  An uneventful passage back to Bn. H.Q.
