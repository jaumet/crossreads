September 1915
Thursday 16
Saturday 18
Up early & found we were still in mid stream anchored near a French warship.
Paraded & took a squad at physical drill.
Nothing else to do today. Still anchored when we came up from dinner.
Hospital ship just in.
Rumours of torpedoes outside.
Left at sundown just as a transport from England absolutely crammed with soldiers arrived.
Out of sight of land at dark.
