<p>10th April two or 3 shiploads went away early in the morning, taking Harold away. He got word the day before, so it was no secret &amp; Uncle Walter &amp; Isett &amp; others went to see him off, including Miss Meade! to everyone's surprise It almost looks a case of &ndash; to put it in the poet's words &ndash; "how blessings brighten as they take their flight!" Or, in plain prose, we prize things most when we lose 'em. I don't know whether Harold kissed her, or only said So long. He went as a sergeant.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday, Ida was up, &amp; in addition to Olly, Edgar &amp; Radford, who made a set with Dene, the three Bairds Jessie, Maggie &amp; Belle came for the afternoon &amp; evening. We told them all about you &amp; your adventures, &amp; they were most interested to look over all the photos they had not previously seen. They screamed at one of a Sydney B.C. picnic at Cabarita, here you &amp; Dene are visible in the front row, about the size of pumpkins, with little sailor hats on. "And now he has gone to the war!" Aunts Kate &amp; Edie came up too, so we had a good houseful.</p>
