[November 1916] [There are either a few pages missing or Crooks has not written anything for a month. It is now November (Sunday the 19th only occurs in November of 1916) and Crooks is in France]
(10) Sgt Major McIntyre and myself paid a visit to the Township of "Etaples" this afternoon, it is rather a dirty looking place and the smells reminds me very much of Egypt. Although it is situated close to the sea they have no sanitary arrangements. Just about 250 years behind time (more or less.)
(11) Paid a visit to the township of "Paris-Place" about 4 miles from "Etaples" on the coast, and in the Summertime it is a great Tourist Resort for the wealthy classes of France and England, it is just the opposite to "Etaples" in cleanliness.
(14) We re having some very cold weather here just at present, we have had several frosty nights lately. We are still waiting to be sent to our Battln. We are considered trained Soldiers again, a great joke. Ah well.
(19) Sunday Church Parade held. Several of my old Comrades came into camp yesterday, C.S.M. Young and Sgt Gadry of the 45th Bn.
[On 25 November 1916 Crooks "interfered with Provost Sergeant Bonnet in the execution of his duty who was at that time endeavouring to quell a disturbance". Crooks was found guilty, docked 8 days pay and reduced from the rank of W.O II to that of Sergeant. There is understandably no reference to this in the diary and a gap in the dates on which the diary was written]
