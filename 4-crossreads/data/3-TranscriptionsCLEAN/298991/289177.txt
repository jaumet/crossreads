Wednesday June 6thVery quiet all day. Rained fairly heavy last night, but turned out fine today. Doing both physical drill & route march before & after dinner. (Went to a free entertainment at the Pavilion Hall, It was both very good & comical, went for a walk round Weymouth Portland harbour, it is very pretty round there.) x.
Thursday June 7thx Should read today, nothing startling in camp. I don't notice the Adjutant knocking about so much since he was counted out. I heard he is to go back to Australia, then it is only those sort of sooners who can get back so easy.
Friday 8th June
Rather a dull bleak day. Marked from B1 A3 to A3 & transferred to B Group, No 56 hut, I suppose it means I will be back in France very soon now. Put on draft to go to Perham Downs tomorrow morning, in my opinion they are a bit sudden. Went out canoeing in Weymouth harbour, the water was very calm & we had a grand time. Another fellow & myself went out in a double canoe.
Saturday June 9thA lovely day. Owing to being on draft had to get up at 5.30, & have breakfast at 6 am, but when I went to fall in, the sergeant informed me that I had been cut off, of course I did not mind
