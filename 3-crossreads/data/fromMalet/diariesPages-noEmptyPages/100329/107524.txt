enemy etc. These observations are generally carried out either early morning or late afternoon. A report reached us this morning that Gen. Ian Hamilton & staff whose H.Qs. are at Imbros was bombed considerably by 3 Taubes. Ian had narrow escape from one bomb. I have noticed these Taubes lately. They have become very cheeky, fly low down, & they must know we are deficient in anti aircraft guns.

Castles absent from office. Col. Braithwaite goes off by "Metero". J. Armstrong called during afternoon, & we had a chat about old times. Tells me that Martin has joined. I gave him tobacco & matches.

A Turkish deserter, Ismail Mahomet Ali, 5th Co. 2 Bn. 24th Reg. was brought in today. He appeared to be in good health but complained of sore feet. He was only wearing thin shoes. He was dressed in a khaki cloth jacket & trousers with a soft cap. He I would say he was a middle aged man. Examined, he said he came from a vilayet of Sym Smyrna, but that he was fed up with fighting, like a lot more of the Turks in his Co. He said the Turks had heaps of food & water, brought up by mules & then into the trenches by fatigue parties. He had only seen one German officer during his month’s active service.

A great deal of sickness – dysentery, influenza, fever etc.

Gen Godley goes to Mudros two or three days inspection of troops.

Sgt Worth goes ill.
