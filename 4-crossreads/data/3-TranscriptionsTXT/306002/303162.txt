 26.5.15 Wed. 26th.  Snipers have been paying us marked attention all day;  early this morning I was hanging our blankets out on the bushes to air when a bullet hit the ground alongside of me &amp; knocked some dirt in my eye, it was close enough to make me take cover, about dinner time another one came our way &amp; went through one of the blankets &amp; Stan's overcoat.  10 men were tipped over by snipers soon after daylight, poor old Pope being shot dead.  McMaster who was also hit has only a sporting chance of surviving his wound which went through his liver.  The warships have kept up a continual bombardment all day otherwise things have been very quiet only for Turkish snipers &amp; they have accounted for a good many of our boys to-day.  The weather is perfect.  We have to stand to arms in the valley every morning at 3.30 a.m. but do nothing else;  of course the men have to do sapping but the signallers are exempt.
