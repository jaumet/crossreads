  
 me was formed. That went away & I was in the next one when an idiot in my hut caught mumps & now we are isolated for 24 days. Shall write home to see if Dad can come down for the week-end. The routine is drill, fatigues & route marches. 
 April 12th 17 Still in isolation.  Have continued so far with route marches every day. Every day we march from 9 till 11.30 & 2 till 3.30 or 4, with the exception of some fatigues.
