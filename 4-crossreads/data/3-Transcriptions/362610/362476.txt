<p>Sunday 17 Sept. 1916<br/>A beautiful day. Took things easy not attempting any helmet-fitting with units. Felt inclined to go out for a stroll but thought that Leo might come along during my absence &amp; so decided to remain in. Got a little letter-writing done but was not in the mood for much.</p>
