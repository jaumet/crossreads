I have been tonight how to play draughts - you would be amused if you saw me.I have read two of Masefield's books - Multitude & Solitude & Captain Margaret - I liked them both.Am reading the Price of Love by Arnold Bennet as usual he depresses [indecipherable] his sordidness.Dr Jekyl & Mr Hyde I read without much interest.I have the Higher Critisism of the Bible on board in case I fall short of mental stimulus.Devoted love to you my precious mother. Do rest and come home refreshed & strong.Devotedly your daughter Betha
