<p>[letter from John Butler's cousin Charles Bean to John's mother Amy]<br/>Jan. 2nd 1915</p>
<p>Dear Aunt Amy<br/>I'm scrawling this line from brother Jack's tent whilst he is examining a prisoner outside - &amp; several prisoners; who say they are ill. I saw your Jack the other day &ndash; Boxing Day. He is at Maadi Camp 10 miles from here</p>
<p>[Sketch showing Cairo, the Mena camp to the west of Cairo, a tramline connecting the camp with Cairo and the location of pyramids just south of the camp.  South of Cairo on the River Niles is depicted the Maadi camp]<br/>We are about 10 miles from Cairo at the Pyramids.</p>
<p>Your Jack seems to be in with a nice lot of felloes as far as I can see - &amp; he was looking very well &amp; fit, &amp; burnt fairly red; 20 odd of them have the one very big tent &amp; they seem to get on pretty well together. I have been kept going pretty constantly writing &amp; cabling or I should have written to you last week. We went into Cairo together. Jack had a shave or haircut whilst I went off &amp; interviewed some official people. We then went to the Grand Continental Hotel to dinner &ndash; it was very crowded but we found a corner &amp; had a good tuck in &ndash; then went out</p>
<p>[written in the margin]<br/>I am sending old Joan my box of chocolates from the Australians in London &ndash; (one piece I broke off &amp; eat myself to see what it was like. Chas.</p>
<p>I got her letter &ndash; many thanks for it &ndash; I'll write if I get time Love to her &amp; Nancy &amp; Claud. Chas.</p>
