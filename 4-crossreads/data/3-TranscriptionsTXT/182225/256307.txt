JULY   FRIDAY 7   1916
Fine some of the morning but rain & mist in afternoon & very cold. We had to clean up all our brass work & equipment in morning & do any washing we wanted done. A couple of the guard were sick and I took mess orderly for our part of it for the mid-day meal. We read all afternoon the finals for the boxing were to be held this afternoon, but owing to the wind they were postponed.
