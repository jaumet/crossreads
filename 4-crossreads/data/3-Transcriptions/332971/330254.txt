<p>Abbasia, Cairo<br/>23.9.1916</p>
<p>Dears</p>
<p>Since we have known definitely that we are really leaving Egypt I have had quite a little ache &ndash; Yes.  I'm truly sorry to say good-bye to all the interesting things here.  On the whole it has been a happy free time.  We'll miss the beautiful Nile.  For some weeks now the water has been flowing down from Abbysian hills somewhere away in Africa &amp; it is in full flood and such a sight to see from the Pyramid.  There is quite another river up there with feluccas &amp; boats sailing on it.  It seems strange to think all this water has come here after a long (M record) hot summer &amp; without a sprinkle of rain.  Then we'll miss the Niggers too with their fascinating ways &amp; picturesque dress &amp; colours.  The veiled women &ndash; The fine Egyptian Menfolk in their red Tarbouches &amp; their charming courteous manner &ndash; The persistent street sellers.  The gay funerals &amp; weddings which one never fails to see if you go into Cairo.  The domes &amp; Minarets &amp; Tombs &amp; to say nothing of the pleasure the donks gave us.  Then there's my little garden coming on so nicely with sweet peas &ndash; mignonette and pansies &amp;c and the seeds coming from Aus just made me love it.  But its farewell</p>
