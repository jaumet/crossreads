 Had a veri rough tea tonight . The stew was veri weak , and we had no veget . There were plenti of shell fli around today . Fritz is sweep the road with his machin gun , so we are hope we do n't have ani case tonight . It 's not healthi . Wrote a long letter to M.S. as it may be the last chanc for a time . Thursday , 12th Stan Wright and the rest of our parti went into De Niepper Bath , which we great enjoy . We had dinner at a cottag just behind Headquart . Eggs , toast and coffe , which was a pleasant chang after Trench Fare , They are busi pack up at H.Q . readi for a move . The Somm is favorit , but of cours we are go . On our way back to the trench . Mac I stay for a time and watch one of our batteri send a few souvenir over to Fritz . We also went up to the O.P. and watch them burst in the German Line . Just after tea word was sent around that everyman not on duti in the line , was to stay in his dugout as our gun were go to bombard veri heavili , prior to a Raid . A few minut of Sull and Murph arriv and inform us that 4 of us out of the 8th were to proceed to No. 2 post at onc . The air went blue for a time , but "order is order " and we had to go . We toss up to see which of us should go , , and our parti lost . So we grab our coat and start off . No sooner had we got outsid our dug-out than Bang , Bang . Whizz third Bun-er- , Bang the shell commenc to scream overhead , and stone and dirt were fli in all direct . The flash from the gun lit up the sky for mile around . Fritz had a searchlight go and what with this and the hundr of star shell it was as light as day , and made us feel decid uncomfort as we cross some of the open space . The machin gun and rifl were also veri busi and their hiss and pig scatter leav and bark off the tree .
