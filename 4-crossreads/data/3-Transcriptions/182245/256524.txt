<p>JANUARY&nbsp; 1917</p>
<p>9 TUESDAY&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dull &amp; misty rain all day &amp; very&nbsp;</p>
<p>cold. Took the horses out for</p>
<p>exercise in the morning and</p>
<p>grooming all the afternoon.</p>
<p>there was a big bombardment</p>
<p>going all day at the front.</p>
<p>Saw little bunches of wooden</p>
<p>crosses hanging on trees</p>
<p>along the road. The French</p>
<p>peasants make them &amp; anybody</p>
<p>killed near there they have</p>
<p>a cross handy to put on</p>
<p>his grave.</p>
