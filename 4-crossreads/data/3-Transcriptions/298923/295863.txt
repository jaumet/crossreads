<p>16 July 1918 Tuesday<br/>Thank goodness we are relieved tonight-  the men are fairly done, half dead with Malarial, they have HEARTS like LIONS.  The German prisoners said "You"<br/>"Australians are good fighters"<br/>"we thought we were "<br/>"attacking INDIANS"  the latter are good loyal Allies &amp; I don't want to detract from their gallant help.<br/>Since I wrote above a lot has happened the enemy got on to us with 4.2" &amp; blew H--- out of us-  Only 1 of my horses left-  62 killed 32 Horses wounded &amp; my 2 I/C Captain Badge killed.  However we leave tonight; for a spell of 2 weeks anyway in the HILLS.</p>
