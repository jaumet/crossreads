<p>24<br/>approaches to the wharf Read Parade. McLachlan St, Chambers Crescent, and Bynne Parade have been named after other "celebrities". We are rather proud of the street nomenclature &amp; are extremely anxious to acquaint John Sands in time for the new Directory.<br/>Sunday 4th : Church parade was held this morning at 8.30 for R.C.'s &amp; 9.30 for Protestants. Father Ricken (German missionary) officiated at the R.C. Parade &amp; Major Martin took charge of the Protestants. The men were afterwards allowed to spend the day as they pleased. I accompanied a party of officers &amp; the "D.T." war correspondent on a shooting excursion. We went up Gauta Ck. but had very poor luck. On our way back we called at a plantation hoping to obtain refreshments. The owner was away &ndash; so the natives informed us; we therefore took possession pro tem. We came across a gramophone and a large number of records; this proved a treat, &amp; after hearing no music for so long we thoroughly enjoyed it. Imagine our pleasure to find inter alia records of Tannhausen! Lohengrun!! Traumenei!!! One rather picturesque sight we came across was a group of four bush tribesmen who had tramped for miles to see "big fella Engleish soljer". They were decorated with necklets of dogs teeth, armlets of painted grass, nose rings &amp; bones, the hair decked with tufts of red &amp; yellow feathers. They were entirely naked except for the above articles &amp; a loin cloth made from some kind of leaf. They swaggered about smoking native cigarettes &amp; showed neither fear nor respect. As they passed through the cane brakes in single file they reminded one very much of what one reads of the N.A. Red Indians, their gaudy plumes nodding above the long grass. We returned to Madang at dusk</p>
