<p>You will think I am going a bit strong dear I know but the uncertainty of life here makes one live for today only &amp; let tomorrow look after itself.<br/>I am getting on O.K. in the regiment, have a good name with the heads &amp; being an old hand "one of the few left" I have a good time, my second star will be out shortly &amp; if I live through the next scrap will have hopes of a captaincy &amp; then I will be contented.<br/>Well my dear I will close now. Wishing you, R &amp; B the best of health &amp; fondest love,<br/>from your loving brother Ken.</p>
