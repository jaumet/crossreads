2I hope you  & Papa   & Family are all quite well  & that the war is not being felt too much in Sydney.  The Turks are, I think getting near the end of their tether as their communications are practically cut   & their supplies must be uncertain   & insufficient.  Malta is rather a pretty place although I have not seen much of it.  I went for a drive round in a sort of cab the other day which was very interesting.
Goodbye for the present love to all
Your affectionate son Charlie
