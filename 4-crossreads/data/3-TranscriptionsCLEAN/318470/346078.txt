19-7-16After much preparation including heavy bombardment by our Artillery the 5th Division at about 6 p.m. went over the parapet & attacked Enemy position.  Not much resistance was met with where our Brigade went over although our casualties were fairly heavy.  The 53rd & 54th Batt. were the attacking Battalions, supported by 55th & 56th.  Our troops charged magnificiently clearly [clearing] the enemy from their front Line & following up their advantage charged to the second line of Defense about 800 yards beyond & here again ran the enemy out of his Trench & took possession.  Here however we came under our own Artillery curtain fire & had to fall back to about four hundred yards of the enemy first line of Defense & here we dug in & consolidated during the night.  At daylight on the morning of 20th we found that that we were in an isolated position being about 400 yds. in advance of enemy first line & having no support on our right & left flanks.  At this juncture the enemy bombed along the trench - the firing line that we had taken the afternoon previously closing in from the right Flank & worked his way in behind the 53rd Batt. who then began to retire followed shortly afterward by the 54th with some of the 55th in support of each Batt.  Swinging slightly to our Left Flank we retired across the German Front Line across "No Mans land" & back to our own Line,
