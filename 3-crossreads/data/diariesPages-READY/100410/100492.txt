The weather has been rather disagreeable lately, very showery and slight fall of snow. everything is slushy and muddy and decidedly unpleasant. I am just one caked mass of mud from head to foot.
I am fairly fluent at French now and on my first arrival in France did not find it hard to understand. We did not go in the trenches at once but were billetted in Villages. Most of the lasses are very pretty and oh so nice. I made the acquaintance of a very nice family in one place stayed with them several days. There were 3 girls and didn't I make the pace a welter. My "uddy" as we say. I am going back there when I get the chance. Bet yer.
Well, dear, I suppose this poor little missive is better than nothing It will
