 Naval Signal 
 From - Flag 
 To - Brigadier 
 Date - 20.9.14 
 Time - 9.15 
 I should like Armourer Johnson now doing duty at Herbertshohe to rejoin his ship the Encounter. &nbsp;This rating is much needed in Encounter. &nbsp;An armourers crew could be sent to relieve him and is quite reliable to do the&nbsp;duty required of him onshore (2115)
