<p>January 1st.  New Year opens, finding us at Biesme some 16 kilos south of Charleroi awaiting our turn to go to Australia.<br/>To-day a party of us went to the Field of Waterloo by motor lorry, seeing Quatre Bras on our way.  The Lion &amp; other monuments &amp; the farms were seen, including the fine French "Dying Eagle Defends the Tricolour" Afternoon tea with some Australian nurses was very nice.</p>
