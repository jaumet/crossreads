<p>15<br/>Many mules<br/>Strange useful animals these</p>
<p>They seem to be without conscience, without sentiment or feeling without fear</p>
<p>Just mechanical things awarded with the miracle of life</p>
<p>They dont seem to care whether they eat or sleep, work or rest, live or die</p>
<p>They are like the uncared for discarded children of a false and nourished love, who have never known sympathy and seek it not.</p>
