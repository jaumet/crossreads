<p>Egypt<br/>March 23, 1916</p>
<p>Dear Ferg.,</p>
<p>We are still in Egypt and I in particular am very sore.  Our chance of getting to the front is very remote.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the war fizzled out before we get a chance to see some fighting.  There is no news.  Vick &amp; I are both well and bored stiff with inaction.  For weeks now we have been doing nothing at all, just waiting for something to turn up.</p>
<p>Kind regards to all from Vick and Greve, E.C. New</p>
