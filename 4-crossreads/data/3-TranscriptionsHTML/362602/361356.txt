<p>are at from A to Z &amp; are both Scotsman, one who has only been out 3 years.  The white shoes which I brought were too small so Ellis sold them to one of the cooks.  I always go barefooted.

<p>31st Day Out<br/>We have land on both sides now &amp; tomorrow we will be in Port thank goodness.  It was a glorious day again &amp; I had to put my sweater on as well as my tunic to-day to keep warm.  I have just written a short letter to Mrs. Dobson.  I would like you to call on them &amp; tell them any news because there was always an open welcome to any of us there &amp; they have done me many a good turn.  I had some jelly to-night &amp; with the exception of some peaches &amp; pineapples that we have bought from time to time</p>
