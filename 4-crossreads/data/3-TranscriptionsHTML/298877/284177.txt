<p>Reached Port Said 4.30 amidst great cheering. Just after we anchored two sea-planes rose from the water and flew around us. Grand sight to see them swim along the water and then rise like a great bird; they alight on the water too. They have two little boats on each side of them. One of our hospital boats is here and several Australian nurses.</p>
