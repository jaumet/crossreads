28th Sept. Thursday.
Incinerator.  Baths at Nieppe in afternoon.  Lucky to have gone there because shells fell on the road we would most likely have returned by.  It was a terrible evening.  20 killed & over 40 wounded.  Hideous sights were sickening.  Woman who was off her head.  Crowds watching cars unload.  Old man killed aged 72 & windows of every place in the street broken by 6 inch
