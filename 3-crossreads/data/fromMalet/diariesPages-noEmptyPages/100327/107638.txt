Dark very late so had to prolong the stand to arms. R.S.M. very unwell, with pain. Let him lie in and arranged breakfast to be taken to him. Swim spoiled by having to clamber out on barge covered with coal dust. Destroyers lying close in and firing for?d gun. New road taking devious course and being cut through old buried refuse stinks a good deal. Saw graves of whole platoon on hillside. At head, officer's with white large cross, and his feet about 40 small crosses of wood tin jambed close together ? his men. 
Normal day with cold bleak wind. At night fire or beacon on Imbros for about half an hour at 0730 which died out rapidly. Flash of cruiser's guns very rapid vivid. Caught sight of a shell from our Artillery Road gun in transit. Bed 0845

Canteen stores on beach, sent party down but they say boxes too heavy; tried to get mules. Andrew sent up Reynolds Newspaper London for 3rd so got some "dinkum oil". Rain squall blew over at 0500 from Buyuk Anafarta Suvla, could be seen coming from long distance Clouds very low almost touching Plugges Plateau of course being on a hill top, this is to be expected.
