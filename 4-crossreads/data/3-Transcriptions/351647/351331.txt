<p>Well anyhow I shall endeavour to be less frivolous.  We have had some gorgeous weather but alas it ended last night when we had rain &amp; wind &amp; cold.  Today has been very rough &amp; it is still blowing.</p>
<p>I have acquired a rather comfy domicile &amp; this afternoon I was reduced to impotent swears at hearing we were moving tout suite.  However we didn't thank heaven, moving this weather would be plain hell.  I have been looking for Duncan who is handy, he is in charge of a B.A.C. so is getting on.  We had a stunt today most successful, 'tis rumoured, but we won't know much about it until we get the daily papers day after tomorrow.  You'll really know as soon as I will, quaint thought &amp; I'm up against it.  I can see the illuminations from here but we are quite blas&eacute; these days.  The old 'bat' is handy &amp; I go over often but so few of the old crowd</p>
