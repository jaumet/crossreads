  
 Tuesday 5 January 1915 
 To-day, for the second time on board ship, I was a member of the Guard.  And now, we are beginning to realise that this is a serious business we have undertaken;  the picnic is slowly being transformed into an active service campaign. 
 Everything is worked now on a most cautious basis.  To-day, the fleet slowed down, then stopped, while the submarine, AE2, went on, full speed ahead;  result - wild rumours of German cruiser having been sighted.  Besides the AE2, nothing is seen of our other escorts, although their searchlights are occasionally seen at night.  For the last few nights we have been steaming with "lights out" after 8.30 p.m.  And all lights which are not put out, are masked by having the portholes blocked.  Last night, on guard, the only white lights visible was a single light on each successive masthead, and together with the red and green lights, it gave a most impressive, wierd, mysterious effect.
