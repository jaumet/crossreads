<p>Saturday 27 January</p>
<p>We were next for duty all night but luckily enough were not required to get out of bed.  At 5 o'clock this morning a terrific bombardment opened up, indicating that the Tommies had hopped over the bags to our right.  It seems that they have captured 2 lines of trenches and numerous prisoners.  As a birthday present to the Kaiser and also in reply to our success this morning the Germans fiercely bombarded all points very heavily.  The crest at our No. 3 post has been badly cut up.  Some of our guns have suffered.  German planes brought to earth in a fine sight.  The weather today has been a bit too clear for our liking.  Rather a large number of wounded came through.</p>
