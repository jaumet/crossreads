<p>5<br/>Looking across the bluest of blue water towards the west from Suez docks one can see mysterious mountains rising up gradually from the distant sharp edge of the blue which must be a least seven miles away. These mountains are quite bare and bald with age, and they are scared and [indecipherable] with the ruts and furrows of time.</p>
<p>Imagine a wild rough desert which suddenly becomes a vast mountain range and they are pictured in your mind. But that is not enough for you must see them through the Arab air.<br/>x x x x<br/>I have had to attend to an order from the Major to receive a truck of military property at railway station. Find I cannot get a transport waggon [wagon] till 3 o clock. Have arranged for 6 niggers to be ready by then so while waiting may as well continue this letter.<br/>x x x x</p>
<p>I said you must see the mountains through the Arab air. How can I help you to do that? It is difficult, but let us try. In Australia as you know one just looks through clear atmosphere so pure and crystal like that distant hills edge against the sky like cardboard scenery. But here in Egypt one must always look through a mysterious veil which hangs for ever somewhere before you and between you and beyond</p>
