<p>May 1916<br/>was the biggest strain for all, horses &amp; men.  C &amp; D Troops were the most fortunate as our horses were the stronger having had water in the morning.  At about 3.30 pm we reached Katia &amp; got water for  our horses.  You ought have seen the poor brutes drink &amp; there was a great deal of satisfaction in getting it for them.  I was feeling very weak, but got my horse several buckets &amp; a few more for some others.  A lot more men were vomiting here &amp; after I had another &frac12; a gall of water to drink, I felt the same way myself &amp; later on got rid of the overdose of water I had taken.</p>
<p>Still feeling all the time I could drink a few more gallons.  We helped one another as much as possible, stripped off our shirts &amp; threw buckets of water over each other &amp; tied wet clothes around our necks.  We boiled our quarts again but I could eat nothing; had eaten nothing all day.  I threw several buckets over my horse &amp; gave him a feed.  We rested for about an hour &amp; at 6 pm</p>
