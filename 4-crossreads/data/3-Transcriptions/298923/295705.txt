<p>8 February 1918 Friday<br/>Raining hard.  Last night an Egyptian Camel Driver had been left sick on the road-  Our Officers found him about 10 p.m. &amp; forced whisky down his throat &amp; dragged him up to our Picquet, covered him with Bks- this morning he was alive &amp; has gone to Native Hospital<br/>Very cold on these poor beggars they only wear a cotton overall, &amp; their lives are not of much value these times.  Brother thou art!</p>
