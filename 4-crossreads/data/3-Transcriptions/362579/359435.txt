<p>guess how cold it is already. How shall I get through this winter if I'm to remain here. I don't know. Anyhow shall hope for the best.</p>
<p>Have not heard any more about our Leave, but expect five more sisters   &amp;  then we may get it.</p>
<p>Received a very nice letter from Mrs. Copp. (Devon) this week   &amp;  she said they would be pleased to see me any time. She also said Charlie had been to see her a fortnight before   &amp; that he is at a Training Camp for the Air Service. Hope the War will be over before he is able to fly his machine. Another thing he will be out of this next awful Stunt that is to come off shortly. Did I tell you in my last letter that two of my dear old pals had been killed the beginning of this month. One dear old chap I had a jolly dinner with at St Omer on Aug. 23rd.</p>
