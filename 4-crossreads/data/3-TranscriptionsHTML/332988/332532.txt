Fourteen of the party. The rest camouflaged themselves there. "Wind up" and fatigue and cold are hard things to bear up against, but the Dinkums thought of their comrades in the line. But the camouflaged ones came up again the next night.

<p>Third "Stunt" Ypres. Oct 1917<br/>A few weeks later my unit was in supports to the Canadians. This attack of theirs in conjunction with the French &amp; some Australian took place to the left of Zonnebeke. It was called the third "stunt" of the Fourth Great Battle of Ypres. Many of us suffered from gas and trench feet, but I was not seriously wounded and so had to stick it as well as I could, not being able to get away for a spell. I will now refer to "notes" written at the time</p>
