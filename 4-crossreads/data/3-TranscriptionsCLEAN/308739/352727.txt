They inject a most liberal supply of 'Lord Knows what' into one's body, with the result that the individual so operated upon becomes a useless bundle of Bones & quivering Flesh.  They inject for all manner of diseases, Typhoid, Small Pox, Dysentry, Plussey & Pregnency.  Speaking personally all vitality is dried up & it is with difficulty I can pass water leave alone anything else of use.Posted Letters Home.Court Martials are frequently held these days & occupy a lot of time.

C.O.s of Regiments can also refuse to try a Case if He considers it serious enough & pass the offender on to the Higher Court.  Up till now the Sentences have been very light considering the seriousness of the Offences, but the Divisional Commander is demanding heavier Fines & penalties from those who sit on Judgment.
