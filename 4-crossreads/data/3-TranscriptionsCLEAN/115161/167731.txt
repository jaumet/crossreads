 It was hard, very hard to bid farewell to the people who had been so kind to me, they came down to the wharf and saw me off, and were rowed over to the boatside later.

My appreciation it is not possible for me to show, my gratitude too heartfelt to express, but they and their kind actions will ever be in my memory.
