Much warmer today. The frost still remains on the ground but the trees have shed their loads of white. The sun came out and was pleasingly warm. Supervised the work of the N.C.O's school and when they broke up addressed them and gave them a few words of advice and encouragement. This School has been a good institution and we shall keep the system going. Most men were away on fatigues. Saw our signallers at work and also our Lewis gunners ? the latter were practising the Vickers gun on the range. The afternoon was a half holiday and we played the renowned 24th ? losing, much to my chagrin. Our team has improved but we have no luck up to the present. The Band under Monaghan is coming on well and doing better work. Heavy continuous bombardment about dusk. No newspapers today in Bailleul. This is the second occasion we have had a miss. Our ?planes up and the usual observation balloons.
