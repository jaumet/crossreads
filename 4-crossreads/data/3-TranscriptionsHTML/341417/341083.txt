<p>Dear Albert<br/>Just a few lines to let you all know I am in "Blighty" again, but you will have to excuse the writing, as I can't get off my back.<br/>It is a lovely hospital, it's surroundings are lovely, &amp; the nurses very good &amp; gentle, which makes your wound feel much easier. I have tubes put in, about three times a day, &amp; that is the only part I don't like, but still it has to be done, on account of the swelling &amp; etc.<br/>I stopped a piece of a high explosive shell, it entering just below the knee &amp; coming out on the opposite side, down at the ankle, another inch further down, &amp;  I would have lost my lower portion of the leg, so I've got something to be thankful for.<br/>One thing beats me is, that where it entered, it made a hole the size of a dollar piece, but I suppose it struck a bone &amp; turned.<br/>My word it was some fight, we got told it would be easy, but fritz knew it was coming off, &amp; he had all his best divisions there, so the papers here say, but still that don't stop the boys. It was between Bullecourt &amp; Quaint, so if you read anything about that zone, you will see for yourself, it was <u>some</u> fight.<br/>I was on the left flank with my section, &amp; being in the eight wave, we had to take the furthest objective. Well didn't</p>
