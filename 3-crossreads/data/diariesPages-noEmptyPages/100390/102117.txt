their attendant germs. Also climatic conditions are against us all the time. 
I am praying for winter now the heat has exhausted us all. 
Australia seems to be backing up and by God men are needed but Im afraid you may overdo it. If you knew what is going on youd be sorry for the men. Still we must serve our time. Personally Im quite resigned very peaceful to a great extent content with my lot. Its all Fate Chance anyhow. I shall look forward to Margies first effort with great interest. She always appeared a bright kiddie. I expect when I come home she will be quite big.
