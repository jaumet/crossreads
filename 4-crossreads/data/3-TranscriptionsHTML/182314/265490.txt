<p>My dear Travers,</p>
<p>Before leaving Australia, I feel I must write again to thank you so much for all the trouble you have kindly taken in connection with the arrangements for my tour in New South Wales. I know from personal experience of such matters the great amount of extra work this has entailed- at a time, too, when you were so busy with the arrangements for the forthcoming visit of the Prince of Wales, and I feel you know how really grateful I am to you. It has made all the difference to my visit, of which I shall always retain the happiest memories.</p>
<p>With all kind regards and the best of good wishes to you for the future.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Signed] [W.R. Birdwood.?]</p>
