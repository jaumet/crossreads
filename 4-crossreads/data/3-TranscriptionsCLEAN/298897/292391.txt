  
 a fire at which time I became sleepy. 
 Friday Nov 17th. No rain for the last four days so the roads are beginning to dry up.  Heavy frost the last two nights & the ground is frozen hard.  Our olive oil is frozen & water in the tent had  water  ice thick on top of it.  Bitterly cold, the wind almost cutting one in half.  Have been visiting the German camp each morning & today inoculated 16 with Antitoxin having had two cases of diphtheria.  Good news going concerning the front the peculiar part being however that we have to wait for the London papers before we know what has happened altho' we are right on the spot.  'Tis of no use whatever to ask the wounded, they know nothing of results 9 times out of 10 & when they do know anything 'tis generally distorted.  German planes still fairly active but we have brought several down.  Today the German admitted our ascendency in the air, even going so far as to say he himself & well as infantry in general were dissatisfied with it.  Speaking of a case when they had bombed a hospital of ours, he said we were to blame as they were insufficiently marked.  In Germany he said large red crosses were used which were illuminated at night.  He spoke about our officers being so friendly to the men quite the opposite to their own who were so proud.  Asked whether this was not better so, he admitted it was so, if possible, but he thought that it did not tend to discipline & efficiency & put it down to ours being a young army.  Speaking of souvenirs again he said he could not understand our wanting them & mentioned that an officer had cut a button from his tunic, an awful thing in his eyes.
