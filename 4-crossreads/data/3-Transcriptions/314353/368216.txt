<p>October 25, 26<br/>84.<br/>Our Menin road post has been taken over by the Canadians:  so far our bearers have not yet gone up:  there hang a dozen rumours as to the work to be done when they do eventually start, most lean towards the stunt being in a new part of the sector &ndash; more to the left where the Tommies have been fighting.</p>
<p>All hangs in the air:  wether we are to fight with the Canadians or in support to, or supported by, nobody seems to know.</p>
<p>85.<br/>Finished and enveloped a letter of 8 pages to Mother, started on the morning of the 23rd.  Billy's and Mr. Whitlet's still remain to be posted.  No mail up today.</p>
<p>86.  October 26<br/>Entry 86 makes an entry necessary for inward calm&hellip;  An advanced area&hellip; men, camps innumerable and horse lines about all the close trafficked roads.  An area most especially favoured by the attention of the Boche &ndash; long distance shells, and bombs from planes.</p>
<p>Since we've been here each night has seen the dressing room, working on shell and bomb wounds, all local woundings.</p>
<p>The station is a collection of dugouts &ndash; arranged for staff generally, medical dugouts and personnel and stores and gear.</p>
<p>By the late heavy rain, the dugout of the Q.M., Capt. Ruddock became flooded&hellip;so the dressing dugout is commandeered by him, and a tent is erected from the dugout buildings for dressings&hellip; at night no lights are to be shewn,&hellip;and the tent for dressings is a single cover.</p>
<p>To Boche planes up the tent remains simply a glaring piece of light, an evidence of the men camped and bivouacked about.</p>
<p>Other dugouts of the personnel have long been flooded out, but the dressing room till now was simply a continuation of the officers quarters, screened off by a hanging of blankets&hellip;.  Now their quarters become spacious for lounging by the fire burning day and night in a dug in side grate.</p>
<p>And Capt. Humphreys, one of our new officers, instructs us in the dressing tent, that he strongly objects to cards being played here &ndash; shewing as it does a lamentable lack of keenness.</p>
<p>If refusing duty could in any way help the getting back of the dugout, I'd willingly stand the crowning to do it&hellip;.</p>
