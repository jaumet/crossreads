<p>Sunday.&nbsp; On guard again.&nbsp; Fifth time.&nbsp; New Year&#39;s Eve.&nbsp; Did duty on officers&#39; bar all through without changing position.&nbsp; N.C.O&#39;s had concert in Smoke Room in evening and all hands were mole-o.&nbsp; In fact, was not impressed with the way things went at all.&nbsp; There, drunken revels ceased towards 11 pm when I was relieved.&nbsp; Did not want to see the close of 1916.&nbsp; Thoughts are flooding me of home and friends and dear ones away back in dear old Aussie.&nbsp; Went to sleep with a countenance more in sorrow than Jest.</p>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">New Year&#39;s Day.&nbsp; Came off Guard feeling dopy.&nbsp; Slept on deck part of the day, and listened to lecture by Lt. Gray the other part.&nbsp; The fact of being in a new year does not trouble me much, but I am wondering what all are doing at home and wishing I was there with them.&nbsp; Turned in at 6.45 under deck as we were runnning into a big storm and feared rain through the night.&nbsp; Slept well.</td>
