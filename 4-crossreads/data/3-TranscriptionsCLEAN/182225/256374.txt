 1916   TUESDAY 12   SEPT. 
 Fine but cloudy. Out with battery headquarters all day, as a telephonist. Its not much of a job as there is nothing to do. Got letters from Linda, Father & Jo. We played the 26 th  Battery 2 nd  team & beat them by 9 to 8, after a hard even game. I enjoyed the game very much.
