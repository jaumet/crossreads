 "IN MEMORIAM": JULY 1. "GENTLEMEN, WHEN THE BARRAGE LIFTS" Saturday's London papers contained several hundred "In Memoriam" notices of officers and men who fell in action a year ago yesterday when the British Somme push began.  The affectionate remembrance in which a British officer can be held by his men is strikingly shown in the case of Major G. B. Bosanquet, the members of the Sergeant's mess having inserted the following:- 
 In proud and revered memory of a true soldier and gentleman, Major G. B. Bosanquet,  Gloucester Regiment, who fell in action on July 1, 1916.  The finest gentleman and bravest leader a soldier could serve under. 
 Among the regiments who publish "In Memoriam" notices to their officers, warrant officers and men are the Lincolnshires, Royal Sussex, Sherwood Foresters and the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, which adds the words "Gentlemen, when the Barrage lifts"
