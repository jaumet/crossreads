<p>To Colonel Courtney<br/>Commanding "Courtney's Post"<br/>No. 3 Section<br/>(14th Battalion</p>
<p>H.C.G.  445  19/5/15</p>
<p>I congratulate you and your Battalion and all the garrison of your post on your gallant and successful defence today.</p>
<p>Australia will be proud to hear of your fine performance. The testimony of prisoners and your own observation will tell you what great losses you have inflicted on the enemy. The Turks will probably attack again tonight but I have every confidence that you and your garrison will again repel them with even more loss to them than today.</p>
<p>(Signed) General Godley<br/>N.Z. &amp; A Division.</p>
<p>"Courtney's Post"<br/>Gallipoli Peninsula<br/>Turkey<br/>19/5/15</p>
<p>The C.O. is proud to pass to all ranks the message of appreciation which the General Officer Commanding (General Godley) came to personally deliver this afternoon.</p>
<p>The General congratulates the Battalion on their successful repelling of the attack this morning. He states that he and the whole Division are proud of the "Fourteenth" whose name will go down to history in connection with this determined fight.</p>
<p>The Turks opposed to us amounted to three Divisions and were led by a famous German General brought over specially to command the enemy.</p>
<p>We may expect a similar attack tonight. The G.O.C. confidently looks forward to our meeting it.</p>
<p>I replied that the 14th quietly did their best and will go on doing it.</p>
<p>(sd) R E Courtney. Lt. Col.<br/>Commanding 14th Battalion.</p>
