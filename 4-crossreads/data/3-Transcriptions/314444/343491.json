<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>a few lines to let you know that I am in England and I am getting fairly well now this is a very nice Hospital and we are treated very good indeed<br/>we had a very fine trip over from Egypt and didn't come across any of Kaiser Billums submarines to cause excitement<br/>I haven't had any mail from you or Ruby for a long time and I have'nt heard from Horace I sent him some writing material and I can't make out why he has not written to me have you heard from him? Are you receiving my letters alright?<br/>We disembarked at Devonpot and had a lovely trip up here in the train there is not much news to tell you. I hope you and all at home are quite well. I will write you in a few days time again<br/>Ted.</p>
