<p>Sonnets<br/>How fever'd is the man, who cannot look<br/>Upon his mortal days with temperate blood,<br/>Who vexes all the leaves of his life's book,<br/>And robs his fair name of its maidenhood;<br/>It is as if the rose should pluck herself,<br/>Or the ripe plum finger its misty bloom,<br/>As if a Naiad, like a middling elf,<br/>Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom;<br/>But the rose leaves herself upon the briar,<br/>For winds to kiss, and grateful bees to feed,<br/>And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire;<br/>Why then should man, teasing the world for grace,<br/>Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed?<br/>1819, John Keats.</p>
<p>If I should die, think only this of me:<br/>That there's some corner of a foreign field<br/>That is forever England.  There shall be<br/>In that rich earth, a richer earth concealed;<br/>A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,<br/>Gave, once her flowers to love, her ways to roam.<br/>A body of England's, breathing English air,<br/>Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.<br/>And think this heart, all evil shed away,<br/>A pulse in the eternal mind, no less<br/>Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given<br/>Her sights and sounds:  dreams happy as her day<br/>And laughter learnt of friends;  and gentleness<br/>In hearts at peace, under an English sky.<br/>1915, Rupert Brooke</p>
<p>But - There are wanderers in the middle mist, who<br/>Cry for shadows, clutch and cannot tell<br/>Whether they live at all, or loving whom:<br/>An old song's lady:  a fool in fancy dress,<br/>Or Phantoms:  or their own face in the gloom<br/>For love of love, or from hearts loneliness,<br/>Pleasures not theirs nor pain.  They doubt and sigh<br/>And do not love at all:  of these am I.<br/>Brooke</p>
<p>From memory.  All I have left of her than which I sent home, which I'm sorry for and knew when I did, I would be.  Maleish [?]</p>
