<p>417<br/>New Zealand Hospital<br/>Walton on Thames<br/>6.11.15<br/>My dear Aunt<br/>Many thanks for your kind note &ndash; I have had a bad time since you saw me &ndash; I caught a cold in the head and it affected the eye &ndash; it swelled up and gave me a great deal of pain. When the specialist saw it he said it would have to come out in case it affected the other eye, but as there was a chance it might get better decided to leave It a few days &ndash; I am glad to say that when he came again he found the improvement so great that he says there is a chance of saving it, but I have to keep in bed which I have been doing for the last 10 days and hate it  - however its worth it if I save the eye &ndash; I don't</p>
