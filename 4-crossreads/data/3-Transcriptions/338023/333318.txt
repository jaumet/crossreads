<p>Having seen so much of the smoke &amp; had our dinner we returned to Waterloo in time for the afternoon train and came right on here. This was more by good luck than management, as our orders were for the old cold place of our first arrival. However at Andover Jnt some of the boys going on leave spotted us &amp; told us to come here. Just as well for Parkhouse is a long 5 miles from Perham &amp; our packs were heavy-as. Since then we have done none of our own work it being necessary to do the gun-course. This finished today &amp; you will be glad to hear that I am now a sort of Jekyll-Hyde &ndash; a first class sig., &amp; a first class M.G. Expect to shortly qualify as a 1st c. gun-fighter a la Bobby, as I have a new S.&amp;W. 455 &amp; aim to do a 'course' of that next.</p>
