<p>I admit I was scared but order was restored when the Second officer sang out that it was only a fireball &amp; to look out for rain. The soldiers, he afterwards said, were so scared that they fell out of their hammocks &amp; for a few moments were so dazed as to scramble anywhere. Some came running round the deck in an aimless fashion &amp; without any apparent intention. In a few moments rain, and large drops too, fell &amp; gradually increased until a beautiful shower was falling that made the air somewhat cooler. Such was our first experience of a tropical thunderstorm, there being no sign of the approaching storm, beyond the clouds. Naturally there were some who did not come out of their cabins &ndash; they knew they said &ndash;. The Chief Officer could not find his slippers he said. The steward was not going to get up for that &amp; so on.</p>
<p>11th November  During the afternoon a radio was sent that, as a death had occurred on H.M.A.T. Ascanius, ensigns would be lowered to half mast. At three p.m. flags were lowered &amp; the Ascanius dropped out of line &amp; the soldier was buried with military honours. In ten minutes</p>
