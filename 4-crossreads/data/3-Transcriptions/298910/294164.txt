<p><u>Our Women</u></p>
<p>What made you don the karki man,<br/>   to face the shells &amp; fumes,<br/>You who were used to lounging in<br/>   those cosy smoking rooms?<br/>What made you married men leave all<br/>   to do a soldiers part!<br/>What thought your women folk of this<br/>   the girls who held your heart,<br/>Did they by word or look or act,<br/>   beseech you not to go<br/>Did they suggest that other men<br/>   should deal the hun the blow<br/>Nay gladly they took up their Cross<br/>   the hardest part to bear<br/>And cheered you men on with a smile<br/>   &amp; hid their great dispair.</p>
