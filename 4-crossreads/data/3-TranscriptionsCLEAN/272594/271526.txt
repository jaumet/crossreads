  
 The trench we are holding is the main one of the "Hindenburg line" & in a few places where it has not been battered down by shell fire a good 10 feet deep & fairly wide, the "traverses" are especially strongly built & look like great buttresses of stone, this trench is also provided with big deep dugouts & there are any amount of dead Germans in them these dugouts are more than welcome to us once we get into their trench, for there all our wounded are taken
