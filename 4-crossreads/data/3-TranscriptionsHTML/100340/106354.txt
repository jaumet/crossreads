<p>15526 Pte Vick<br/>France<br/>16/6/18<br/>My Dear Sis<br/>Just a line   <strike>f</strike> wishing you Many Happy Returns of today. I hope you got my card in time for your birthday. I have not got your parcel yet but I had a beauty from Laurel yesterday. I thought when they told me there was a parcel for me that it must have been yours but never mind it is still something to look forward to. We are out of the line now for a spell  &amp; we are real glad too as we had a couple of stunts in this time. The last one was made very lively by his intense shell fire &amp; we were kept busy for three or four days. I was hit in four different places &amp; each off a different shell but did not get them hard enough for a blighty. I had a piece of skin knocked off</p>
