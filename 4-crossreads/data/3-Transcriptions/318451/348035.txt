<p>Monday 27th<br/>I found Chaplains McLean (Pres.) &amp; Blamues (Meth.) both of New Zealand &amp; had lunch with them &amp; as they are leaving soon have secured their Billet.  My kit has gone astray, I have no blankets nor fresh clothes.<br/>Found McCook homeless in town &amp; brought him to our Billets &amp; got a room for him next door.</p>
<p>Tuesday 28<br/>No sign of my kit.  Went out to trenches today.  It is fairly quiet in the lines during the day.  In the afternoon they shell fairly heavily &amp; at night the machine guns are rattling all night.</p>
<p>Wednesday 29th<br/>Batt. Hdqts. shifted billets also A &amp; B Coys.  Went out to Transport this afternoon to look for my kit but no sign of it.<br/>A Bible Class was held here this evening by N.Z. Chaplains.  It was a very fine meeting.</p>
<p>Thursday 30th<br/>Went round the Billets to see the men.</p>
