<p>9-8-16<br/>Wed 9th<br/>We were supposed to attack Bir-El-Abd at 6.30 this morning but the Turks opened the show by putting a couple of shells right amongst our horses before we dismounted for action but got none of us. &amp; a few minutes later we had had horses in a safe position behind a step sand hill &amp; were on the hill above.</p>
<p>the Turkish Infantry welcomed us with a burst of rifle fire from the ridge opposite &amp; the fun commenced.  we soon drove them back to the next ridge &amp; I put the day in on the first ridge (after running a wire from Bde at the led horses) laying at the end with a 'phone   the phone was also connected to the artillery &amp; I was kept busy putting through reports from Major Granville who was directing the troops &amp; giving ranges to the guns from the artillery</p>
