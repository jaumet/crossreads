<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Little boys learning the Hotel business should be kept from</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being too officious.&nbsp; Having every mouthful one eats watched</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or being continually run in front of just for the sake of</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opening a door is very irritating to the quiet man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whiskey with BOTTLED soda should always be available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whiskey should be served with the bottle and not in small</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measures as though a gentleman would help himself to too</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could add a couple myself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head waiters should use tact in seating guests and never</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; put an Englishman at the same table with a rancour voiced,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gum chewing Yank orx a sword swallowing Southerner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#39;t serve macaroni, spaghetti etc. in pieces of longer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than about an inch and a half otherwise the Englishman will</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get tangled up in the stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#39;t fry whitebait - boil it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide spoons for the mustard and salt and a knife for the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; butter, an Englishman hates having to wipe his knife on the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tablecloth and dive for the butter or condiments: besides</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its bad for the tablecloth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, however, the better class hotels are well run and,</p>
<p>with the exception perhaps of the Adelphi Hotel at Liverpool (Eng.), I</p>
<p>Have not seen finer establishments than the Hotel de Paris at Monte Carlo</p>
<p>or the Hotel Ruhl at Nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Southern shore of France was at one time a happy hunt-</p>
<p>ing ground for the Roving Nations in search of territory or more often</p>
<p>booty and one sees to-day plenty of evidence in the way of forts, castles</p>
<p>watch towers etc. to connect the Romans, Greeks Spaniards and Moors with</p>
<p>its early history.&nbsp; Even the Turks are said to have laid seige to Nice</p>
<p>at one time.&nbsp; The Roman&#39;s chain of beacon towers connecting up Northern</p>
<p>France with Rome and by which they were accustomed to signal their</p>
<p>victories, pass over the Southern Alps hereabouts.&nbsp; Some of the ancient</p>
<p>castles and forts are a regular gold mine to the district by reason of</p>
<p>the number of tourists they attract and they are not going to be allowed</p>
<p>to crumble away altogether if reinforced concrete and hidden iron bands</p>
<p>can save them.&nbsp; Villages perched on top of steep mountains are common</p>
<p>in fact it seems to have been a popular precaution against attack by</p>
