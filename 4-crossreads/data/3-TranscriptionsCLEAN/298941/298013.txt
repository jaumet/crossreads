German planes over during the night & this morning & many bombs dropped, but not near here.Understand the 3rd are near Castre & we are joining up about this afternoon. Civilians are still about here, & desultory motor & vehicle traffic on the road. Except for the firing of heavy guns, there is no undue prominence of war here despite the fact that we are about 6 kilos or 3 or 4 miles from the Germans.
