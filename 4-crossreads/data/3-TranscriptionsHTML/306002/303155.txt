<p>20.5.15<br/>Thurs. 20th.  Left the 2nd L.H. trenches early this morning &amp; made a very comfortable dug-out on the eastern hill which took up all the morning.  I believe the New Zealanders captured a line of Turkish trenches yesterday afternoon;  shortly after dinner Smithers, I &amp; some others went to the beach &amp; had a very enjoyable dip in the sea.  A little before sundown, we were having tea &amp; hearing cheering &amp; as all firing had ceased, we looked out to see the cause, &amp; found the Turkish trenches lined with unarmed men &amp; white flags flying.  Apparently a parley is going on between our officers &amp; theirs, &amp; the Turks are busy getting their dead &amp; wounded away, also rifles;  I believe they asked for 3 hours Armistace to collect their dead &amp; wounded, we conceded &frac12; an hour &amp; as soon as the half hour was up they rushed Quinns Post &amp; got a very warm reception.  Hailstone (B Troop) wounded.</p>
