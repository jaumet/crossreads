<p>our marque caught fire, and how I do not know, anyway every case was a walking one so we all got out without any injury.</p>
<p>I remained at this place for about a week and then I was marked for Blighty.</p>
<p>We left the hospital about one pm and we were off in the train for <strike>Cala</strike>Calais where we embarked for Blighty, it was not long before we got a move on, but the boat I do not remember the name as I was too sick to look.</p>
<p>It only took about an<strike>1 hou</strike> hour &amp; a half to run across the channel but I will never forget it as it was very choppy.</p>
<p>I was never sick all the way from Australia to Egypt, but by Jove I was sick coming across the channel this time.</p>
