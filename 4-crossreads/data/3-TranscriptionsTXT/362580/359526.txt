 I have spent most of my time in the Officers Hospital to-day &ndash; have seven now, so one of us will have to be there always. 
 The was an Evening Service in our dining room at 7.30 p.m. and quite a number were there.  Had a little hand organ &ndash; I heard the end of the service, while at our dinner in another room.  Nearly all our Medical Officers were there &amp; it sound so nice to here all the men's voices &ndash; some of the Orderlies were there too &ndash; I should think there were some fine voices amongst them. 
 We are expecting the other sisters on Tuesday &ndash; hope they come.  I was late for dinner this evening.  It is a rush to get done at times.  The minister (Padre) is a great old chap &amp; seems to be very popular.  Must stop now am deadly sleepy.  Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all.  Hope to get a letter from home in a few days. 
 From your loving sister, Edith
