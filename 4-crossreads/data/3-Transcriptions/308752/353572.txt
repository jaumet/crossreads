<p>Already the main road, was just a mass of traffic, our guns were even going into their forward positions. Rather quick &amp; wonderful work. Large batches of prisoners kept continually passing us, &amp; it was very gratifying to see them. After walking about 3 miles we had a spell near some German dug-outs, &amp; discovered a good supply of soft drinks in one of them.  Needless to say the drinks did no take long to disappear. I also found a bag of Fritz biscuits which were acceptable, as rations were "very young" .   [In Transcript this is noted as being very "scarce"]    We still go forward, &amp; about 4 p.m. we arrived at the R.A.P.   During our travels plenty of Fritzs war material of very description was passed.   These squads are posted at the R.A.P. &amp; two squads including L Cpl. Hall, Ptes. Kusman, Thompson, [indecipherable] Sheer, Higginson, Whittaker &amp; myself are posted about a mile to the rear of the Aid Post. The other three squads carrying wounded to our post, &amp; we carry them onto the cars. Which unfortunately was two miles away, rather a long carry.</p>
