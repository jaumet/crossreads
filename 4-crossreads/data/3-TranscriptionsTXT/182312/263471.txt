 what they are.&nbsp; On my first visit, the links and the last few hundred 
 yards of the road were two feet under snow and greens were only 
 distinguishable from fairways (or bunkers for that matter) by the tops of 
 the flags which in most cases were visible.&nbsp; Rain however soon moved the 
 snow and we were able to play within 6 days.&nbsp; The Club House is a very 
 commodius affair and hung round the walls are the pictures usually to be 
 found in Golf Club Houses.&nbsp; With a view to bar-profits the course has

 admission to his subjects.&nbsp; To the right of the vestibule are the cloak 
 rooms, refreshment rooms etc.&nbsp; whilst to the right front is the entrance 
 to the Theatre.&nbsp; This little theatre contains some wonderful decorative 
 work including paintings on walls and oilings by world famous artists. 
 The seating accomodation would by no means pay for the upkeep of the
