<p>Saturday 27th October 1917</p>
<p>Wrote letters, breakfast in bed every morning. At Midland Hotel, every Room had Telephone alongside bed, Clock illuminated over door &amp; fresh fish kept in a pond to chose as you liked. Luxury if you like. Went St. Annes &amp; saw the Church where we were married. Evening went to the Theatre, rain all day &amp; all night cold as anything.</p>
<p>Getting Dolly to pack gradually. Laura is at [indecipherable]. My cold much better.</p>
