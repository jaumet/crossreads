<p>A cloudy morning, but fine [Short hand not transcribed]<br/>I have been sight seeing all day. First I went to St. Paul's Cathedral. The great dome can be seen from miles around. The outside of the cathedral <strike>can</strike> is black with age. I had a walk around the outside &amp; then went in. A service was being held, when that was over the cript was free to visitors. In the cript which is under the church lies buried some of Englands finest men. There are guides to show visitors around and explain and give interesting facts concerning the different graves. All the graves lie beneath the floor with the exception of Wellington and Nelson. Their tombs are  above the floor, the bodies being surrounded by stone surmounted by a monument. Wellingtons</p>
