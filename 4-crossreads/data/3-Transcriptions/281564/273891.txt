<p>Sunday 11th Oct<br/>Determined to have another day "longa big bus: &amp; in order that our souls would be in order in case "longa bus' Kanaka" killed us, we went to mass &amp; pinching our boat set out after the pigs. The forest was much sweeter after the storm but pigs were scarce &amp; after wandering for some hours we returned home with a bag of pawpaws &amp; bananas.</p>
<p>Monday 12th Oct<br/>We went for a march to the same place as we went a week ago, so that there is nothing fresh to add.</p>
<p>Tonight there was some excitement. An alligator was sighted by "E" comp at supper time, out in mid-harbour, &amp; some extremely fine (?) shooting resulted.  The fun reached its climax when Frenouth, Reynolds &amp; O'Brien pinched a boat &amp; rowed out to the monster amid the plaudits of the "swattues" on the wharf But the "gator'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''" refused to move &amp; the hunters returned saying sweet things. A few dozen more of the same breed were to be seen floating round the wharf</p>
