  
 hole in his head in a few he was dead we are in the trenches in sections at different posts 10 and 15 in a section 3 of our section was killed  I had a most marvellous escape  I felt a slight sting on the head, and when I had time I took my hat off to get a breeze I saw two large holes in it I felt my head and there was a slight mark with a little hair off where a bullet had gone right through me hat and just grazed me hair. shells in other sections bursting in the trench terrible slaughter being carried out from all directions in one part a shell  cut the trench up and 5 men who happened to be there got blown to pieces arms off legs it was terrible but in the meantime the other Battalions of ours were sneaking around on both flanks
