<p>On his discharge from here to the base his condition was as follows.</p>
<p>General condition excellent. Normal pulse &amp; temp. Scalp wound healed by first intention. Movements of the R arm &amp; leg normal. All reflexes normal. Slight weakness of R side of face, mouth being more marked than the orbiculisis. Understood what was said to him.    <strike>Can</strike>  Could read both printed &amp; written matter, but rather slowly.    <strike>Can</strike> Could speak quite well, but some words not articulated quite correctly. No astereoquosis.<br/>   <strike></strike><br/>The only peculiar thing was a complete R. sided  [hernianaesthesia?] from the head to the foot. The anaesthesia was only partial ie pinprick was felt but dully. So far as I know this condition is always 'functional.'</p>
<p>As regards prognosis, I think he will continue to improve &amp; should say his aphasia, or what is left of it will almost completely, if not completely disappear in time.</p>
<p>I asked the consulting surgeon of this army Col. Maynard Smith to see him &amp; he agreed with me as regards treatment &amp; prognosis.</p>
