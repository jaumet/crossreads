<p>Fine &amp; Sunny. Went for a bath</p>
<p>again in the morning &amp; it was</p>
<p>great. Had an inspection of</p>
<p>horses, harness ect by Capt</p>

<p>Cleaning harness ect in afternoon</p>
<p>We were the section on duty, but</p>
<p>did not have to go out.</p>

<p>&quot;strafe&quot; but it did not come off.</p>
