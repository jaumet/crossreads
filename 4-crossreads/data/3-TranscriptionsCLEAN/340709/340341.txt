  
 14 well nigh impossible to sleep with the clatter & heat. Tonight I will take my stretcher on deck; we are to proceed with the coaling till 6 am tomorrow. Monro & Skeat went up to Govt. House today & it is their intention when they have finished their wireless operations to recover the guns. Being O.O.D. I am unable to accompany them. Our prisoners are to leave us today probably for Sydney. We have found that as a rule they are not to be trusted. Parole was granted to most of them & they were allowed to go ashore! No sooner had they done so than trouble was experienced with the natives; they (the prisoners) were doing their utmost to poison the minds of the coloured population against the British. Accordingly parole was promptly suspended & the "Berrima" has again become a prison ship. 9.30 pm. I have just returned from the "Mennex" (oil tank) where Butler & I have been with the mails for Sydney. The captain of the oil tank was delighted(?) to find that he was to be inundated with passengers in the shape of 38 prisoners and a guard of 12 men & 2 noncoms. Monro brought one of the guns in tonight, though he did not bestride the nag. The gun's crew consisted of about 10 niggers whilst Monro, Skeat & their party from the wireless plant marched proudly along the wharf whence the capture was slung inboard & stowed away safely. Tuesday 22nd : After sending our prisoners ashore we cast off at 9.30 am and stood down the bay, preceded by the "Australia" & "Montcalm" & followed by the "Encounter". Our numbers on the "Berrima" are considerably reduced; we have two companies of Naval Reserve & four companies Infantry. The remainder have been left behind, four companies Naval Reserve under Comd.Beresford at Herbertshoe & a large garrison of Infantry at Rabaul under
