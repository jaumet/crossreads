<p>8th November<br/>Dear Mrs Ferguson,<br/>Please excuse this scrappy way of writing but things are very rushed in order to catch the Xmas mail. These are a few lines to send you &amp; yours my kindest regards and best wishes for a happy Christmas. Arthur is flourishing but has unfortunately been shifted to another company. Such is the penalty of greatness. We see just as much of one another as ever. These cards were printed over at Ambros good ides ain't they<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>W. R. MacCallum</p>
