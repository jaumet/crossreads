 Judges' Chambers Supreme Court Sydney 18th August 1916 
 Dear Sir 
 I must thank you for your letter of the 14th enclosing a letter from Senator Pearce. It was very kind of Mr McIntosh to interest himself in the matter, but I do not for a moment believe that my son would be willing to undertake non-combatant duties, nor would I feel justified in expressing a wish that he should do so. 
 Yours faithfully 
 David G Ferguson
