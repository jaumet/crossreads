Back from the Front
George Reidy, the well-known clever middle- weight boxer who fought a 20 rounds battle with Dave Smith in 1909, when our twice-retired heavyweight champion was a power in the land as a clever exponent, returned from the front last week.  George is partially para-lysed. He was laid up in an English hospital for quite a long while, and in a much worse condition than he is now.  Reidy's pictorial reply to a Referee question - "Where is George Reidy now?" - was published in a recent issue of this journal. George saw the question, and sent along a photograph of himself stretched out in bed, and wearing tresses of such length that he looked more like a woman than a man.  Alongside of him was a good correspondent of mine and a real fighter, in the person of Larry Lassen-Lashin we used to call him.  Despite his trouble, George Reidy is not down-hearted.  While there's life there's hope, he says, par-ticuarly as his affliction is growing less. I might mention that after the photo. referred to appeared in The Referee, Reidy's sister (Mrs. Donald) called in to see the note addressed to me.  At first George had been unable to write, but his fist was readily recognised, and Mrs. Donald went away highly pleased and in pos-session of the pictorial reply aforementioned.
