<p>14/1/16<br/>Reached Shepheards hotel and was hailed by Colonel [blanked out] who let loose a long rigmarole about finance. Saw Manager but room was crowded and it looked as if we should have to go away, as luck would have it Dr Fogarty of the 21st cooperated and we took a double room.</p>
<p>Lunched in the grill room. Fine gardens full of trees some gums among them. The house servants in red clothes resplendent with gold braid. In the centre of the street was a Turkish looking man in fez attending upon a motorcar heavy with gold and blue and wearing a shining sword. Went round different shops and could not help noticing how the women do up their eyes with belladonna. Above the viel are these deep black eyes and plenty of powder. The European women of course also there buying clothes &amp;c.</p>
<p>Coming back to these old scenes again I feel quite like an old inhabitant. About 1900 I got in a train to go to Heliopolis but current failed so bought a motorcar for 40 piastres. Arrived at Gordon House found nothing doing and returned by train. The place crowded with soldiers all in new equipment &ndash; reinforcements - and things there seemed much the same. Reached Shepheards again and about 2030 tried to get some dinner but had to wait</p>
