Friday 11th September
When we woke we were entering Herbertshhe to starboard rose three volcanoes (two of which are at present in action) The "town" lay in vast plantations of cocoa nuts, in front of which lay our destroyers. The detachment of bluejackets have landed three wounded two German prisoners have been brought on board. Firing has been heard from the shore our machine gun section has left to reinforce the bluejackets who are rumoured to be faring badly. We have been waiting all the morning to follow them.
