<p>tastes but I'd have Lloyd every time.</p>
<p>New Adjutant &amp; the new orderly officer is Colin Richard.  You may know him, an old Kings School lad.  He has been quite nice to me.  I fell up on a young pal of Peter's the other day, young Reg Watt of Minda.  A quaint kid.  I haven't seen Brad lately but I did run on Duncan, looking very cold &amp; freakish but otherwise well.  He was very nice &amp; we talked for quite a while.  I don't think things are too nice for him but he is not so philosophic or acquiescent as I am.</p>
<p>I'm seriously thinking of getting to Paris again but there I don't know.  I'm restless &amp; uneasy these days but have been better the last day or two &amp; I expect will be better.  So many changes of our personnel upset me.</p>
<p>I hope for another Blighty leave next month or February &amp; should have a good time but one never knows these days.  I try not to worry over prospects &amp; am succeeding very well.</p>
<p>How is old Mac, &amp; Tom Fogarty.  Glad you like Jack Findlay, he is a good chap.  I must write to Mrs. Bine &amp; Miss Hilda, they are bricks to me too.  You're a bonza famille.  Glad to hear about Alison, good luck to him.</p>
<p>Tell the Boss I'll write in a day or so.  I must clear now.  Love to all including Graham &amp; especially your very valued self &amp; always believe me,</p>
<p>Yours to the proverbial cinder,<br/>Wilkie</p>
