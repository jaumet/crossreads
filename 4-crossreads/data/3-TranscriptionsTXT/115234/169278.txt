with long range guns from La Bassee 16 miles away.  We got off at "Caestres" just a mile off Belgian border.  Went to 5th Div rest Camp.  A muddy and desolate hole.  Tired & spent we were just laying down our blankets when Fritz aircraft came over & it was douse all lights.  Most uncomfor-table.  Got to bed & slept the sleep of the deadbeat soldier.
