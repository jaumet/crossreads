 Exp. MGC & train here, others go  the  Grantham.           Too cold to keep a "dairy" & anyhow the only thing that happens here of note is we either go to town & drink watery rum or the fire gows out & we freeze.                                                                                                                Snowing. All have colds some have bronchites. Getting paid soon & then going on Leave. Will go to Hortons & hope to see Charlie there.                                                                                                                                  note from   M rs  H saying not to go there  M r  H unwell. no letters from Aust.
