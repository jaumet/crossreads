suppose you haven't broken your heart over that fact.
I believe Mrs. Arthur is en route for England, but fear she will have a disappointment as I'll doubtless be in France.  Hard luck, isn't it?
I don't agree with Hughes and his conscription.  It seems to me Aust. has done her bit.  Hughes is only after Kudos and will get a Knighthood and a seat in the Home Govt. later on, like George Reid.
Your remarks re a bloke called Bartley made me laugh.  Why didn't you cut it out?  Anyhow I'm surprised you should let anyone in Khaki do you in.  The mere colour should make you careful.  Really, the mere donning of Khaki seems to make a man dishonest, - anyhow, soldering seems to bring out all that's bad in one, and crushes all fine feeling, I know.
There's no news.  I don't write for the papers now though I actually had two small bits in London Opinion and one in Passing Show & got turned down & insulted by Punch.  So I don't do any now.  I got chipped by one of our officers about my name appearing in Sydney papers.  Of course, its strictly prohibited for soldats to write to Papers.  I think Thertho [?] or possibly you put them in.  It doesn't matter
