<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A day of new impressions, then Sunday was a free day in which to estaablish ourselves in comfort, to pack away kit, and familiarize ourselves with the locality and to take our bearings generally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; How good it is to again live beside the sea, from my window on the third storey of the villa Les Sopens (The Fir-Tree) I believe it means, I look out across the channel and throughout the night old ocean speaks to me just as he did at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This little town has been a quiet seaside resort, it is my fortune to come here at the beginning of winter, but even now &#39;tis a pleasant change from the mud and slush of inland France, and better far than the battlefields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The villas - in each of which about ten officers are accomodated - are sparsely but sufficiently furnished, the mess is quite good and we have little English Girls, W.A.A.C&#39;s or as they are now called, Q.M.A.A.C&#39;s, to prepare our food and wait at table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The school itself is reputed to be the best in France, that is to say the best in the British Army, I&#39;ll tell you more about that later on in the piece.</p>
