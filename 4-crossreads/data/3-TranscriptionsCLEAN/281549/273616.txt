On the 20th it rained & made everything very muddy & miserable.
At 9 o'clock am on the 22nd we all left Mametz camp enroute for the village of Ribemont, where we are to go into billets for about four weeks resting. Along the route we passed through the villages of Becourt-Becordal, Meault, Dermancourt & Burre-Souis-Corbie, on the road just past Dermancourt, we stopped & had dinner. We arrived at Ribemont at about 4 oclock pm. My feet were very sore through the frosty ground & the long tiring march.
As soon as we were all allotted to our billets I was selected for Guard duty, It was absolutely the worst duty I had done for a very long time, I was dog tired & the cold frosty weather made it impossible to stand still for long, my feet in the morning were as sore with the frost that I could hardly bare to stand on them. When we were relieved at 5pm I went straight away to bed.
We are billeted in barns & stables here, the sleeping accommodation is in bunks, one on top of the other. The quarters are very cold & drafty & in rainy weather the rain comes through the roof in many places.
