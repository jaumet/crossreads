We blew in at the Officers club & had drinks at Bond's invitation & then inboard & supper & Bridge & bed at 10.30pm - A wet night I only got spray & some splash -
Monday Jan 18-15 -  Quartermaster called me at 5.30 - I was awake - Fitz & I took the skiff & went off bathing - After breakfast I was busy but got to the Beach at 10.30 - Saw Fitz. He told me some of the sick had been discharged & were adrift - I told him I'd see to things - I was bound for the Hosp & found that 5 of our men had been discharged - I asked where to & where are the men - God knew - Apes - Fancy discharging a Bluejacket & not giving information to the Senior Ship. However I went over to the Naval Brigade people after going round the Hospital & telling every sick Bluejacket to regard the Fantome as his temporary home when discharged - I fixed up with the N.B. people to find the wanderers & send them to my boat at 11.45 - At 11.45
