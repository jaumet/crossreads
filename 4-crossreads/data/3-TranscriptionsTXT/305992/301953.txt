Mon. 1st  [April]French troopship one of M. Maritimes.   2 funnel Australian passenger boat torpedoed 12 miles from us. 450 soldiers jumped overboard & picked up & sent scantily clothed to the British Camp dozens to No. 19 General Hospital. This steamer was escorted by 2 Japanese destroyers which sank the submarine. Tugs & trawlers came to the assistance & towed same ashore having been hit by a torpedoe opposite No. 1 hold. If fine weather prevails she will be towed off & into Alexandria into dock.
Tues. April 2Left wharf for dry dock. Ship's bottom scraped & painted by Egyptians which made a very poor job in fact (shameful). Least said the better (as war is on). Bearings of shaft Port propeller badly worn & surveyed. Several steamers awaiting their turn for docking purposes so the shaft could not possibly be repaired.
