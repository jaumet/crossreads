  
 day while we were there. Bayonet exercises, marching, saluting & assault were all gone through, & although they were not very heavy it was enough to make us very tired, as it was all done in the loose sand. 
 I experienced two sand-storms while I was there & it was look after your food then. The only thing to do was get in the tents & wait till it finished & in both cases, down came the tents on top of us as the pegs would not hold in the loose sand. 
 Except for a few little incidents such as these, everything went along OK until the night of the 3rd of June, when our Sergeant came & poked his head into the tent & told us Reveille would be at 3 am next morning to pull down all our tents as we were moving to England to undergo training before going to France.
