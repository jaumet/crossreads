<p>Thursday 5 September<br/>Rumour that we move up to the line to-morrow which is now a great distance from here.</p>
<p>Friday 6 September<br/>Move to-day from Morcourt to Halle on the Albert-Peronne road.  We came by Bray, Suzette &amp; Maricourt &amp; we are now camped in a quarry, just north of the Somme &amp; on the old Somme battlefield of 1916. The country is desolate just as it was when we were at Flers in 1916. Rumour that Fritz was driven back yesterday &amp; the A.D.S. even is about 3&frac12; kilos East of Peronne. Just on our left is Mont St. Quentin, not much of an eminence but commanding all approaches to it.</p>
