garrison but the dispositions have now been altered and the post is a 2 Coy one with the other Coy Commdr. (senior to me) as O.C. Post.  It means much less work but also less responsibility & consequently it is not nearly so interesting.  It is strange that I am now camped in the identical spot where the 17th Bn. H.Q. were camped for 6 weeks.
I think I am about drained out of news.
Best love to all,Affectionately yoursC.R. Lucas, Capt.
