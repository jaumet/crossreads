Dearest Mother.
Letters received from yourself Tess & Dad and was pleased to hear you were all well. I think you did the best thing when you sold the furniture provided of course you got a decent price for it. Have you decided on a new house, I suppose now house rent is fairly reasonable, if things are not too good let me know & I will increase the allotment, and give you a bit more assistance.
We are seeing quite a large portion of the Western Front and things are considerably better here. there is an improvement all round. Unfortunately I cannot say much about what we are doing and as there is little else to write about this letter will necessarily be brief.
I am sorry to hear Frank has enlisted, I would much rather he had remained, but of course he knows what he wishes to do.
I have been to a school of instruction in Stokes Mortars and got a pretty good pass, 'Good Qualified Instructor'
