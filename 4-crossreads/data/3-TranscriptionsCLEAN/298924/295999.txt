  
 Friday 17 January 1919 Censors have ceased work.  I think it a pity.  This is a sample of what comes in. "We are polishing irons & bits, & doing ceremonial work, practising for a visit from the King or Prince of Wales.  What do we want him for, he's not been fighting & is only a man - if the officers aren't careful there will be a riot etc. etc." The rations have been reduced 10% since Armistice & coming back to area of Canteen etc., but the men growl a lot & we hope to get the 10% on again soon.
