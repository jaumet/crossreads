Luckily it was not a frosty night, and I had on my overcoat and muffler. About 3 am, a train shunting, ran off the rails. This delighted the troops very much. The froggies were all running about with little lanterns, and trying to shove the vans on again with sticks, blowing horns at intervals. They were still at it when</p>
