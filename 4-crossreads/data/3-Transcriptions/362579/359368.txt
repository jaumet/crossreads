<p>very busy, running all the time &ndash; only have about 9 in my ward to-day but found heaps to do.</p>
<p>We are not allowed out of camp   &amp;  it is a fearfully crowded place, no places to walk about, so retire to bed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Only see a few Australian Soldiers about but they are not far from here. Had 2 or 3 visitors to see us, some of our old friends of Grivellers [Grevillers] but not any special one of mine. My pals are all too far away but hear from them occasionally.</p>
