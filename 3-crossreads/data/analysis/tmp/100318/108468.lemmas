 3/8 /18 Villers-Bretonneux to a kind of slow barrag . Receiv word that the Hun has evacu Dernancourt and that there are sign of him retir from Mondidi . Effort on the part of the 21st to captur a prison prove futil . The men had a terribl hard night tonight they had to do 6 hour dig without have had anyth to eat for 12 hour . Everi gas guard and all other detail had to go on the job . They are work my men to break point and it worri me a lot . The peopl behind simpli do n't realiz what the chap have to do . Stay up until 1 a.m. We shift our headquart from this wretch and evil smell dugout up to where the 21st H.Q . is and settl down there .
