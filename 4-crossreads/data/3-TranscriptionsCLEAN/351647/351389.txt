these mails going to Davy Jones locker one gets so discouraged, it seems so useless to go pouring out stuff for nothing.  But if you felt like that & didn't write where would we be.  So I go on.  I see you have had strikes & things.  I'm sorry for you.  So much inconvenience & annoyance.  Really one does get impatient & exasperated with the brutes.  I really don't know whats coming to the world.  (Usual cry of the old & out of date.)  I hope you haven't been sending anything lately, there have been some whole mails lost.  This isn't a hint.  Only please don't send any more.  I hate to think of you working away, making your eyes ache & then for it to be all for nowt.  Just write to me now when you can & when you feel like it.  I hope you haven't sent the MSC [manuscript ?] of the romance & that it hasn't gone down.  I've felt so bumpy all today, one gets so fed up.  The weather is really pestiferous to a degree, the whole district is a very messy & dirty bog.  It rains every day & every night.
The skeeters are quite prime ones & love me.  I have seen Joe Kirby again, I hear he has been recommended for the Military Cross.  I hope so.
