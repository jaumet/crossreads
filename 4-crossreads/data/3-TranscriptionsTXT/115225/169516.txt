January 1st  We are now part of an amunition colu section . though we are not yet parked with the rest of the section. we are termed 6th A.B.A.F.A.P.S - (6th Army Brigade. Aust. Field. Artillery. Park section) - & our colour patches consist of a red shell with S/6 in blue  We started up & went up to Neuve Eglise for amunition, but there was nothing doing when we got there so we went back to park. We went for a five kilometre walk before we went to bed.
 
Jan 2nd  We were all put on fatigue work taking down a Y.M.C.A. Hut which the 3rd D.S.C. intended taking with them when they moved, which they are anticipating  - Weather very soft & a little rain fell.
 
Jan 3rd  3rd D.S.C. moved to Bailleul Armentieres road next to 1st A.S.P. & we moved with them. in the afternoon we did a bit of cleaning on the lorry. Weather mild & bright & sunny. Fritz put over a bit of shrapnel trying for the baloon over K column workshop
 
Jan 4th  We were busy all the morning cleaning underneath the lorry thoroughly as our new officer (Joe Grim, as he was known to the section) went crook at us for the filthy state of the lorry (as he expressed it)
