<p>dangerous that I decided to go &amp; put it out myself but had hardly started off (it was only 100 yds away) when I heard a plane approaching.  That settled it I said, the damage is done &amp; turned off at right angles &amp; started to run but had only gone a few yards when I heard the swish &amp; whistle of a falling bomb.  Down I went to it altho in line with his approach &amp; then bang, bang, bang, went 3 bombs one side of me &amp; bang on the other, only earth falling on me.  Five were dropped in all one being a dud.  Once again the Good God was looking after us, only one man was hit &amp; he had his arm fractured.  My tent was penetrated by several pieces &amp; one bottle being broken, whilst some of the cars were hit, one radiator being put out of action.  I was wild at the men responsible for the fire being left as undoubtedly that was his mark.  Our latrines were shattered but fortunately no one was there.  I then proceeded to complete my job &amp; put out the fire.  Everyone</p>
