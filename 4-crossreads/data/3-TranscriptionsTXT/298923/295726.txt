1 March 1918 Friday (X to X crossed out)Inspection by Gen Chaytor.   Windy & cold-  The Australasians arrived with local Papers-  I notice from one Dec 22, an article about [indecipherable] Grain at Corowa- [indecipherable] lot for the horses & they do well on it, mixed with Barley Straw, the latter is known as Tibbin in Egypt & we did not like it at first, but realize now what excellent fodder it is-   X As a result of inspection lost 6 horses they are wonderful animals many been tied up for 3 1/2 years issued with horse shoes & like Crimea all HIND & no coal to forge them!!
