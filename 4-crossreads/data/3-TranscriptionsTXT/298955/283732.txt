Right alongside the first lock Mira Flores - built in 1913 - we went forward into the first lock & the water is then pumped in to raise us up. There is  another boat following up behind but only one boat can go through each way at a time. The people here, mostly black come alongside & exchange things with our boys.The American soldier is a lith; well built man mostly young. There youthfulness being very noticeable.The pilot takes us through to Colon which is the city on the Atlantic side. (All towns in America are called cities.) The pilot returns by train. They call their little engines electric mules & they can pull some.The Americans had a different engine in view when they first started but some inventative Yankee introduced these which were accepted by the American Government.The locks have armed guards & at the entrance to the canal they have wire nets
