<p>Selborne Chambers 174 Phillip Street Sydney 4.6.65<br/>Dear Judge, I hope that you will not think it presumptuous of me to write and extend my best wishes to you upon the occasion of your retirement from the Bench. This morning's ceremony was, I think, indicative of the affection and respect which the Bar as a whole has always had for you and of their feeling that the Bench will be the poorer for your going. I myself am grateful for the kindness &amp; courtesy which you have always shown to me, along with all other members of the Bar, on the occasions when I have been privileged to appear before you.</p>
