  
 today arranged for an armistice had given themselves up in our trenches & they were treated well to counteract any impression that they were supposed to have re getting badly used by our troops when their men were captured. It was done so as to allow them to be able to deny this on returning to their trenches & to enable them to return they were sent to gather firewood with the idea of allowing them to stray back. You can imagine our dismay when they came in with a large bundle of wood in preference to going back to their trenches. 
 I was pleased to greet old Pals - talk of the doings of the past few weeks. It was indeed a pleasure. I saw Olly Gunderson. Our section gun which was knocked out when I was wounded had been repaired etc. I found the flies very bad
