December 19, 20waived to save an electric situation.
December 20PreslesPresles has a beautiful Chateau, and the staff have a weakness for Chateaus, and the unfortunate part of the whole concern - even apart from the five impossible Majors - are the ten kilos between us and Charleroi.  The 'staff' have their cars!
Well-billetted again, in a large double-casement window lit room, facing a park and great hill forest of dark lovely pines.  G.Q. and A.D. in separate village Billets:  we in the Chateau's lodge.  Great folk in the lodge, and this morning Madame - an older sinisterly senile dame, had our fire lit, and sent Coffee at 11.
Solre left yesterday morning, and a lunch - of dark beers and light and excellent Cognac - at Charleroi, in the evening an Estaminet hunt proved disastrous.  An order comes into force shortly, that no alcohol is to be sold in the Divisional area, only Beer and Wine ... this rule to the Estaminet Keepers, but the quality of their sales seems uninteresting to Fav'd Authority.
Straight falling slow rain, and the beauty of the tall heavy pines a wounderful setting for the formal building of Fav'd Chateau.
