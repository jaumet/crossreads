"My Creed"Because I hav'nt a creed in the worldAs creeds in the creed books goThere are those who hold me condemned by GodAs I am by them below.
2But I feel, if I read the story rightOf the Man of Bethlehem,I would rather trust my soul to His LoveThan sit and be judged by them
3For creeds at best are man made thingsAnd man is mortal and vainAnd apt, if a sinner he sits to judgeTo break his own creeds in twain.
4But the Lord looks straight in the hearts of menAnd He judges our lives arightAnd He does'nt care for the creed you bareBut the motives you have in sight
5For a thousand creeds which preach of ChristAre full of their own conceitsAnd the line of demarcation is wideWhere God and the creed book meets
6I hav'nt a creed that a Church would ownBut I reckon the Lord of LoveWill open the Gate, if a chap lives straightAnd find him a place above.
