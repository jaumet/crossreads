<p>like you to keep for me.</p>
<p>There are a few cards of Business people that hold some particular memories, &amp; a small map of Paris.  The prize I drew at the leave Club was a fine pocket-knife, worth about 10 francs.</p>
<p>Since my last letter, I have had another trip to France &amp; back.  I took a draft over, 60 artillery reinforcements.  Had a day in Havre and a day in Southampton coming back.  Tomorrow I am going to Codford as Court Warden, on a court martial so you see my experiences promise to be varied, on this side.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br/>Your affect. Son,<br/>George.</p>
