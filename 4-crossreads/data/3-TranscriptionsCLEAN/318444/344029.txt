  
 & it is announced that an armistice is signed. News taken without any demonstration. In fact the Bn had its "muck up" the week previous at Bellancourt on a false alarm so they don't take any interest now. 
 Nov 12th Tues:- Rumour hath it that we are to go on to Coblenz for occupation purposes. 
 Wed Nov 13th:- Marched from Bazuel this morning via Le Cateau to Busigny & billeted. 
 Thurs Nov 14th:- "Cleaning up" parades & it is looked upon as certain for us to go to Germany. No one enthusiastic except perhaps some of the "heads" who see their good jobs leaving them shortly. That reminds me. We have now with us an officer who wears the 1914 red service chevron & who has never been to any part of this war. The first time he joined the Bn was just before the Armistice so he must have judged things well. 
 Fri Nov 15th:- Pay Day. Drew the large fortune of 20 francs (15/4) paid by Lt Thomas.
