<p>21/3/18  Red Lodge</p>
<p>Lt King, Dundas "C" Co. Lt Braithwaite, Cpt Main, Lt Harricks, Gorman, Chalmers, "D" Co Capt Kennedy, Hunter, Lt. Southwell, Kohn &amp; Barker. There are 16 away on jobs of various natures. The question of absences is again beginning to cause worry  but I see no reason to consider my unit any worse in that respect than others and have at any rate the consciousness of being engaged in doing my best which they can take or leave. About 250 men are out tonight on various tasks and Engineers jobs. Spent the evening in my little tin bivouac writing and reading. To the study of French in common with others I find it hard to put my mind seriously owing to constant interruptions. A quiet dark night on the front so far.</p>
