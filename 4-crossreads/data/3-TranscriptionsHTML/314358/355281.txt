<p>20<br/>you will see a cluster of these white flakes apparently surrounding an aeroplane as a constellation of stars lined with a night hawks flight.</p>
<p>It may be that you see them as we do now, in a cluster far below the swallow-like planed of the enemy; with the latest newly created flake spot singly placed much higher, followed by another, and another, yet higher and higher like a chain of starry pointers.</p>
<p>Suddenly a lack spot startles into existence amongst the white as a black sheep thrown into a pure fold. Then another, in the chain above; and yet one more, with the highest reach of all</p>
<p>The stinging guns are spitting a different form of shell, but their range is all too short for theoccassion.</p>
<p>As minutes pass the earliest formed spots widen and thin out and fluff at the edges, but still maintain their original positions, (unless there is a breeze) whilst they contract with the later creations as [indecipherable] with snow flakes.</p>
<p>Our highest plane reaches far up in the its spiral flight but as yet not to the altitude of the enemy</p>
<p>Then we hear the tap-tap-tap-tap-tap---tap-tap---tap-tap-tap---tap-tap of her gabbling machine gun, and we know she is shooting with an upward slant at those alluminium swallows</p>
