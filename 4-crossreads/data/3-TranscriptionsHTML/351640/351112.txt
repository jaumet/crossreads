<p>No 1. A. Gen. Hospital<br/>Heliopolis<br/>16 Novbr. 1915.</p>
<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>A telegram has just reached me &ndash; 6-15 p.m. 16.11-15 &ndash; from you bearing date "5 Novbr. 1915. Sydney, 2-45 p.m.", as well as I can make out from the heirogyphics on the form. Many thanks for it. Much pleased at the words &ndash; "Remaining Macquarie St. Well." If living in Sydney &amp; having to struggle for a crust I should hate to be other place than in our present street. You should be able to manage all right until I come back, and no one can tell how soon or how long hence that day may be, especially in view of the uncertainty of my future occupation. However time will tell.<br/>I shall send the cable &amp; envelope to the Director of the Egyptian State telegraphs and ask what has been the cause for delay in the delivery of the telegram. The 5th Novbr was a Friday, and if the cable were a week end one it should have found me on the 9th.</p>
<p>Most of these days I take a run round Cairo in a tram somewhere, to make the impressions of the city and its inhabitants the more lasting, that you shall have the greater benefit from them when we talk to each other again. This afternoon I travelled for more than one hour at the cost of 4 millimes, something less than &frac12;d, &amp; comfortably too. What think you. To one who knows how to live economically here</p>
