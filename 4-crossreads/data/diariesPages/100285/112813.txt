Got my snaps etc from Liverpool this morning, for a wonder the firm sent them along without being paid in advance.
25th. Have been doing nothing all day so this afternoon Lindsay I went over to see Len had a few games of bridge stopped to tea, then we went to the pictures came home, bfo while over there Len I fixed up a bit of business with the Pay Master.
On arriving home I find a job waiting for Dental Sgt. a rotten one too took me 2 solid hours to get the names out las it will keep me going most of the day, still it will give me something to do instead of dodging parades etc keep me out of mischief for a while
