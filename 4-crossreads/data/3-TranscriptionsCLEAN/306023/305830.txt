  
 10th Sunday. Went to Mass in the morning. 
 More kit inspections and fooling around. I am having a job to keep on the draft as I am unmistakeably an 'immature'. I think I can kid Stan Eastment to leave me on though. 
 Had a yarn with Father Lonergan again. 
 11th Very little doing but more inspections. I got a letter from the Bank to say that at last something had arrived for me.
