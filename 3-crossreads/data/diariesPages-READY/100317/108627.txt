15/7/18
London
Walked down to Horseferry Road and there bought a few clothes but could not get a decent hat. Went to the Army Navy Stores but could do no good there either. The day was muggy oppressive. Was struck again by the whitened stone of the Abbey and of Whitehall. It gives these old places a most venerable look. To Piccadilly and had a shave and a haircut before going back to the Royal Automobile Club for a good lunch. Afternoon took ?bus out to Wandsworth and found the hospital rather empty. Saw Major Dooley who is off to Australia in a few days and also saw Southwell who was up. The V.A.D. girls here are fine capable and womanly girls. My trunk and suitcase here
