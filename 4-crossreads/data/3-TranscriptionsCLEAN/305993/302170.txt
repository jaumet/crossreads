Our Indian crew were helpless, the cold weather having played up with them.  We had to obtain stoves from Salonika so as to warm up their different quarters, on account of being short of fresh water we were detained from going to sea.

The harbour full of ships & about a dozen cargo boats as per usual in each port at anchor, apparently not working & awaiting orders.  Several large troop ships all busy taking in troops for Taranto, Marsailles & Blighty.  We met the H.M.T. Czar & Dunloose [Dunluce] Castle there & several large Italian & French transports.
