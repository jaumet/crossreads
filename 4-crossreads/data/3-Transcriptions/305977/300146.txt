<p>out about dinner time &amp; went back to catch the 5.20 train to Sydney.  Things were a bit messed up when the time came to go away, but we managed to leave camp about 8 oclock.  We had a few showers of rain before we left which made the road a lot better to travel on.  At Enfield we watered and fed our horses &amp; stayed till about daylight.  Got to the wharf at Woolloomooloo about 9.30.  The boat put off into the stream at 10 oclock.  The horses gave very little trouble getting aboard.  We were all pretty tired &amp; got into our hammocks &amp; there were not many who did not sleep well.</p>
