You go to bed at night
And when to sink in blissful sleep
The weary Billjim tries
The mournful Jackal rends the night
With cries, and cries, and cries
4
And Spiders, lizards, snakes and ants
Where ere you chance to roam
All claim a vested interested in
The place you call your home.
And dust and sand and heat conspire
To make these "Holy" shores
A grim, vast, septic Hospital
Of sores, and sores, and sores
5
The Holy land's a golden place
To read about in books
But Billjim covered in its grime
Just sees it as it looks
There ain't no milk and honey
Corn and wine is out of date
And time here only stirs the chords
Of hate, and hate, and hate

Beni Selah
"Exiled from Home"
In the cool and dewy morning
When beneath the slanting ray
Of the yellow orbs uprising
Springs to birth a golden day
From the dewy Eastern splendour
How our memories, sweetly tender
Turn our fancy to the Southland far away
 
2
In the brilliant noonday glory
With the red sky all ablaze
When the scorching blinding Kamseen
Comes in whirling drifts of haze
While we fume and sweat and swelter
Vainly seeking some cool shelter
Oh, its fine to think of Home better days
3
In the evening when the Red sun
Glides adown the Western sky
