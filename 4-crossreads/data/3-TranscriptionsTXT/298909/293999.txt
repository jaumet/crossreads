wharf & anchored, we were to move off at sundown, but the order was cancelled. roundabout  us lying at anchor are 6 transports full of part of the 5th Division - 14th & 15th F.A. are alotted to Cabins & first sitting - first Saloon Mess - so we feel like the Kaiser just it. The Tucker is a bit better & quite a change to Camp.
In the Harbour - which is a very fair one, all sorts of boats are at anchor - the fashionable P & O & White Star liners - most of them turned into troopships - also the seldom seen 4 masted Sailing boats - interned German boats - Greek boats, etc. Got up a scratch concert at night, around the Piano - no smoking or lights allowed after 6 pm or sundown - all port holes to be kept closed, it is just about one removal from hell below deck - I slept on deck. 20/6/16  Tuesday
Still lying at anchor - one troopship returned to port that went out yesterday - all sorts of rumours about - awaiting strong convoys - also several other troop boats have been torpedoed - they also say there has been some trouble in the Canal & that we might have to disembark - to say the least is that something must be radically wrong
