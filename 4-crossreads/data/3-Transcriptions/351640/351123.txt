<p>ago today, by the calendar, my dear Father was killed on the Wallsend racecourse by his horse Sattelite falling upon. Friday afternoon, about 4-30 o'clock. Requiescat in pace. Your grandfather, &amp; a parent who worked hard and continuously to help on my Brother &ndash; R.I.P. &ndash; my Sister &ndash; R.I.P. &ndash; and myself. None better ever live. Alone am I left now to lament his going. He was then a younger man than I am by some six years. A much abler man too in every way. However sic est vita. My dear Mother died in February of 1885, the same number of years ago. Please remember all those mentioned in your oraisons during the Holy season of Christmas?</p>
<p>Tabbie dear I have often heard you say that 'tis always best if one can manage to buy of the highest class. I agree with you. List to the quotation on my calendar for today:&ndash;<br/>"Whatever you can afford to spend for education in art, give to good Masters; and have them do the best they can for you."<br/>(Fors Clavigera).</p>
<p>While writing I still look through my window and a portion of the work of "Ernest Jasper. Architect. 1910".</p>
<p>Good bye my dears. God bless each of you.</p>
<p>Please convey to my friends my best wishes in every way for the Holy &amp; festive season. Reiterating them to you &amp; hoping that Old Father Christmas may once more visit you &amp; find of merry &amp; bright, send you heaps of love &amp; loads of kisses.</p>
<p>Your affection &amp; loving Father<br/>John B Nash</p>
