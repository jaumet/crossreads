<p>on our Journey. The Weather all day was very Muggy. A Thunderstorm was working up which broke during the Evening. The Lightning was beautiful like Skyrockets breaking in the Sky. I never have seen any thing like it in W.A. It was raining all night but the Sea was smooth. Lights out again at 8.30 Pm so all soon was quiet.</p>
<p>18/2/17. Sunday<br/>All hands astir at the usual time. The Weather has cleared up &amp; it was very pleasant all day. Land could be seen during the day &amp; at night a Lighthouse could be seen, I believe it was <strike>A the</strike> East London. Church parade was held on the Well &amp; Poop Decks at 10 am &amp; was well attended. Had a very nice Dinner of Roast Mutton, Potatoes</p>
