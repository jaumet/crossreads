My dearest Mother  &  Sisters, Suppose you have received my letter from Thursday Is. safely. I am longing for news from home, it seems ages since we heard how the war is progressing &  how you all are. We expect to reach Colombo next Saturday 8th May. Hope to go ashore &  stayed until Tuesday-morning. If we can catch a train, we are off to Kandy for 24 hrs. The Major  & Matron are going with us. Oh, to be on land once more. We have not left the boat since we embarked. We have had a wonderfully calm passage but plenty of heat, in the Torrid Zone most of the time & a state if moisture. Have had a cool breeze these last two days. I have not been sea sick but enjoying my food & putting in time very well. I had to look after Dorothy for a few days while her throat was bad. She is splendid again & her voice beautiful. We are still having the two Concerts a week, the Church services, & sports for the me. The Sisters' Sports were a failure
