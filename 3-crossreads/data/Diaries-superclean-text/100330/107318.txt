up to 2 Francs. A French goes around collects the Fees giving a Slip stating how much is paid. After spending about 2 hours wandering about, I made back to camp, very much amused at my experience. At 11 Pm at night we had our first alarm. The Siren blew one long blast, which indicated that Fritz was over our lines, All lights are at once put out Trains Shunting operations are stopped at once. Strict Silence in all tents has to be observed. Flashes of light could be seen over towards Ypres, The lads were all interested some came out of their Tents others stood in the Door Way looking up. After about 15 minutes the Bugle rang out all clear all hands retired to their Tents although conversations of possible Air Raids were discussed in several Tents, at 12 Mid Night Silence once again reigned supreme. As the Weather is very clear Moonlight we can now expect alarms every night. When Fritz with his aeroplanes or Zepplins cross the line the Anti Air Guns ring out in every direction.
