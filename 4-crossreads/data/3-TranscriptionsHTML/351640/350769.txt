<p>Mena House<br/>The Pyramids<br/>Egypt<br/>24 Apl 1915</p>
<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>Letter was posted to you this afternoon to catch the evening bag for Cairo, there to be in good time for the mail which should leave for Australia during the early days of the week commencing Sunday the 25th inst.  Intention at the beginning was that the pages should be few but they were gradually added to, reaching the unlucky number 13 as the last.</p>
<p>I think one of the last paragraphs was that I visited General Ford who is Director of Medical Services for Egypt, and asked him to find me something to do away from No 2 G. H.  He has promised to, at an early date, give me another position, and that to it Jerrom will accompany me.  That is good.  I said little about my chief except that I felt that my personal honour and professional reputation were not safe in the keeping of a weak commanding officer.  This week has brought me to such state of disgust that this show is distasteful to me.</p>
<p>Jerrom has been told to pack up that we may be ready for a move with but a few hours notice.  We shall get everything together tomorrow.  Good night!  God night!!  Good night!!!</p>
<p>Before closing an amusing picture is in The Tatler of date 7 April 1915:&ndash;<br/>A gentleman and aged lady are seated on a lounge, each is partaking of tea from a cup,</p>
