German prisoners are at work cleaning the streets.<br/>Gen Cox inspected the troop at 3 pm. Terrific bombardment all night.<br/>14th Left camp at 8 am. The roads were congested with troops moving in both directions as we neared the line the roads became very bad &amp; in some instances we were knee deep in mud. Met Ernie Kirkpatrick, C.
