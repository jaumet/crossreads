<p>Sunday 9.12.17<br/>Rain Today &ndash; nothing to relate, thank goodness.  He shelled Last night for a bit &amp; then stopped as suddenly as he started;  but he got 2 nice big ones almost right in our home.  By one of the many miracles you see here:  both were 'Duds'.<br/>I haven't a thing to read tonight, which is rotten.</p>
<p>Monday 10.12.17<br/>Had a new job last night.  Took a Load into Messines Village.  The Battery have an O.P. there too.  He's always shelling the ruins their of course;  but our luck was in, and we got finished just before the band began to play in ernest.<br/>Had another small party, as some beer came up from behind.  It makes a break to all get together &amp; yarn sometimes.<br/>His shelling was heavy afterwards.  The heaviest we've had.  It says much for our beer, that I went to sleep quite cheerfully while it was on!</p>
<p>11.12.17<br/>Very cold again, but a quiet day.  He's shelling a bit over on our right now, as I am writing these notes.  I'm off to bed before he changes his mind.</p>
