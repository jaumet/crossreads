to-day hot I mean. Darn close to night I was sitting writing in my note book it was so warm that I took my singlet off.
31.-3.15Very funny last night the lads started swinging one another's hammocks which was the cause of some not being to fresh this morning. Very muggy this morn.We just missed a beautiful storm this afternoon anyhow we got a cool breeze out of it which was a great relief. Measles has broken out on board there are about 20 in the hospital up to date & more are expected. We will be quarantined at Colombo I expect. Which will be hard luck for us.
