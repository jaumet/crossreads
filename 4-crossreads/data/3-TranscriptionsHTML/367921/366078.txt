<p>to let us know that we were not going to have things all our own way. Covering us on our left were a party of bombers, and in the night - lit up like day with the bursting shells - they could be seen being slowly driven back with answering bomb and machine gun fire. It was then that I met my "Waterloo" with a piece of bomb in my lung - sufficient with the ensuing hemorrage to make me unconscious for the rest of the night. However for the benefit of those who have not experienced the feeling, I would likfc to tell you that before I went "right out to it"<br/>I felt very small and cheap, expecting that my resting place was to be in "NO MANS LAND" - right from my earliest childhood days did my misdemeanour come before me, I could only trust that the "man with the slate" hadn't everything written down.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to in the early hours of the dawn and seeing a trench about thirty yards ahead of me, which I surmised was our own front line, I determined on reaching it - knowing that if I stayed in "no mans land" much longer I wouldn't have the strength to crawl a yard.

I was next put on an improvised stretcher and carried about two-hundred yards to a machine gun position immediately behind the front line. Whilst being carried I well remember being dropped twice owing to my carriers having to take cover from the English guns which were shelling their supports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay all day in<br/>this dug-out, receiving all the water I cared to drink, and taunts from a german Sergeant-major about our unsuccessful attack and as to how the Germans would soon be in Paris.<br/>I might mention that even though I was partly unconscious</p>
