On way to YMCA called in at Canadian Beaver Hut & booked a bed for 6d. at 101 Belgrave Rd near Victoria Stn. Had hot bath at YMCA, then went to Trafalgar Sq to meet Uncle Charlie at Nelsons Monument, but he did not turn up on a/c of not receiving my letter. I then went to Clapham Common per tube & was with him for about an hour. Came back by tram, going first of all to Stockwell - thence changing to a Victoria tram, & arrived about 11 p.m, then up to 99 Belgrave Rd to bed.
7/12/18Up 8 a.m. then went to War Chest Club for breakfast. Then booked bed there & reported at Room 15 at 10 am, but papers were not ready. While waiting drew kit bag from cloak room & went to Q M's & changed my new riding breeches for a smaller pair. Went back to Room 15 at 11 a.m. & received my papers etc containing permission & authority to return home via America; also detailed instructions of what I had to do etc etc to fix up at Horseferry Rd. First of all went to Room 27 & received a travelling certificate, then to O.C. Furlough dept &  got his signature on certificate. Then to Pay Office in Royal Horticultural Building & took about 2 hours to fix up there, during which time had to go back to H'Ferry Rd twice & go to top floor each time in order to get certain details. All this was on a/c of not having my proper pay book, as cannot draw money on the Returnee
