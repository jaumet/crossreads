 1915 Dec. 22 Wed. Persistent rumours current for some time that the Australians were being withdrawn from the Gallipoli Peninsula. To-day it was officially announced that the troops which were at Suvla and Anzac have been withdrawn with all their guns &amp; stores. This most difficult operation has been carried out with the greatest skill and secrecy, with practically no casualties and without the knowledge of the enemy, although the hostile forces were in the closest contact. The evacuation was carried out on Sunday night last &ndash; the Troops are on Lemnos.
