<p>possibly have seen the camp but must have gone on bearings given her</p>
<p>by the Taubes (German aeroplanes resembling doves in their flight)</p>
<p>which come over occasionally.&nbsp; A flock of 5 of them came over the</p>
<p>morning after the raid to see what damage they had done, and I have</p>
<p>noticed since that the German version of that night&#39;s raids mentions</p>
<p>having bombed this depot, but does not claim to have done any damage.</p>
<p>The Coastal districts of Kent (England) were bombed about an hour and</p>
<p>a half after she left us - in fact England had raids on four nights</p>
<p>running.&nbsp; They are nasty things and can do a lot of damage, though</p>
<p>the sooner we find a means of getting rid of them the better - our</p>
<p>present methods are futile.&nbsp; We have been in darkness ever since the</p>
<p>raid as it is more than likely she will be back again and perhaps with</p>
<p>a better aim this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anzac Day was celebrated here by a review of all the Australian</p>
<p>troops in the district.&nbsp; A hollow square was formed whilst a short</p>
<p>service for the Gallipoli dead was held by the Chaplain General of</p>
<p>England, after which we marched past the saluting base, our troops</p>
<p>marching like Guardsmen.&nbsp; It was the biggest review I had ever seen,</p>
<p>and the general turnout was very favourably commented upon by all the</p>
<p>British Officers present.&nbsp; One of the brightest features of the day</p>
<p>consisted of about 50 Australian nurses who assembled near the salut-</p>
<p>ing base and got greatly excited as we went by.&nbsp; Poor things, they had</p>
<p>been over here a month and we were the first Australians they had seen.</p>
<p>They were doing duty in some British Hospital pending the arrival of</p>
<p>their own and this was the first day they had been outside the Hospit-</p>
<p>al grounds.&nbsp; A convent is nothing to a British Hospital in their</p>
<p>opiinion.&nbsp; One of them had been very fortunate, and of her the others</p>
<p>were very jealous - she had been one day with the housekeeper to a</p>
<p>neighbouring farm to buy the butter.&nbsp; We picked them all up in an</p>
