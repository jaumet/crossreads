<p>Dear Guy,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sept. 5th 1914<br/>Your letter came to-day and very pleased to get it, the more so since this is the first mail we've had since leaving Sydney. Have sent you a couple of letters and portion of a diary which more or less tells you what we have been doing; am rather afraid lest it should get destroyed if they are censored, for altho I was careful to say nothing important for that very reason they may still be taboo. ve put no heading on this for same reason, but if they did get this we&acute;re still in the same place and doin maistly nowt. I wish you were with us for my own sake, but not for yours for it seems to me we are getting neither excitement nor the sense of being very much use up here; ah well, p'raps we wouldn't be so keen on it if we got to grips.<br/>Can't say much more as must not give away our important secrets (?) Hope you are all well &amp; I see Brian up here &#151; in a strictly unofficial capacity.<br/>Love to all, mail just closing<br/>Yours<br/>A . B . D .</p>
