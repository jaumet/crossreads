<p>Dec 7th  At noon the U.S.A. Battle Squadron arrived and which consisted of the "New York" (Flagship) "Delaware" Wyoming "Florida" and accompanied by one destroyer, and which in due course became the 7th Battle Squadron &ndash; With their lettuce [lattice] worked mast they looked very conspicuous, and in no way comparable to our own battleships &ndash; They afterwards prepared for coaling, and the usual exchange of visits took place between the Flag officers and Captains<br/>At 1 PM we got under weigh and proceeded to the firing ground to carry out full charge firing of 8 rounds per gun &ndash; At 5 P.M. we again anchored and commenced to coal ship, but as the weather so very boisterous, we had to suspend coaling when we had only taken in about 30 tons, and the collier moved away to anchor until the morning.<br/>Dec 8th  At 8 PM we changed our position</p>
