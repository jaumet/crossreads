 Wounded and captured at Reincourt near Bullicourt, France, April, 1917. Repatriated May, 1918.

My clothes were saturated with mud and wet, causing the cold morning air to pierce into one's very bones. 
 The 1st. 2nd. and 3rd. waves assisted by Tanks of the latest pattern had already gone forward to attack the Bosche. The incessant noise of the motors had apparently aroused the advanced Hun machine gun positions, and their Maxims were already pouring forth a heavy barrage &ndash; under cover of Artillery fire. Fortunately the latter was not extensive, consequently the effect caused few casualties, although the first salvos on the sunken road (where the men assembled in mass formation), inflicted many casualties.
