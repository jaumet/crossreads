<p>Camp 24/1/16<br/>My dear father</p>
<p>Since I have now received letters from all of you, it is about time that I answered one or two of them Dorothy wrote very cheerfully &amp; seemed to be highly amused because some poor unfortunate captain fell overboard, all owing to a rotten flag pole.</p>
<p>I am glad to say that my term as Camp Adjutant has at last come to a close; &amp; my new designation is O.C. 12th Reinforcements to the 17th Batt. Every day I have the pleasure of going up to barracks &amp; picking my own men out of the crowd of fresh recruits.</p>
<p>It never struck me before what a few men these are, whom you could really call fine men enlisting now. Most of the decent fellows are trying to get into every arm</p>
