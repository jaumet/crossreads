I visited the Tower Ballroom, 7 nights out of the nine, so you can see that the theatres did not worry me much. On Saturday evening another Australian from France landed at the Boarding House, & he turned out to be a friend of mine from Cremorne-Austen Phillips. I had the pleasure of showing him round this gay place.  Unfortunately he could not dance, so he did not accompany me in the evenings. On the Piers, Pierrott Shows are given each afternoon & evening, & they were worth going to.   One of the performers on the Central Pier, was staying at the Trafalgar Hydro, & each evening she used to entertain us at the piano. She possessed a fine voice, & was very good on rag time singing.
On Sunday evening I had a musical treat, had booked a seats at the Palace Theatre to hear Mark Hambourg, the great pianist. He was absolutely wonderful on the piano, was worth going [Blank] miles to hear. The other Artists on the programme were good also especially Madame ---- who sang my old favourite "Softly awakes my Heart" from 'Samson & Delilah'.
The Winder Gardens, another wild place of amusement was also visited, - resembling the South Shore Pleasure Grounds, but on a much smaller scale. The enormous wheel (which you will notice in the post cards) is one of the attractions here, a magnificent view of the surrounding country can be obtained whilst on a trip in the wheel.
