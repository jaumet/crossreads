<p>in there as we were afraid of being caught. Nov 22. Got a full days leave to Amiens it&#39;s a fine French town very comfortable the largest town we had been into since we left the south of France. It has a beautiful Cathedral wonderful work &amp; the alter is simply splendid [?] to being subjected to bombs a good deal of the work was sandbagged up I also had a good feed whilst I was in the town. Our stretcher bearers had not yet arrived back from the Somme &amp; we heard they were mending roads near Becordel. What a rough time they must be having. I drew no 210 in the leave list to England, but changed places with Cpl Kidson</p>
