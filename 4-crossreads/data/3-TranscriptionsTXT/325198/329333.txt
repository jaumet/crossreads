 "The Pilgrimage" It aint no use in swearin, It aint no use to fret It aint no use agrousin Or getting all upset The wilderness is rotten All dust &amp; flies &amp; tears But the Israelites they stood it For years , &amp; years ,&amp; years 
 The Willie &ndash; willies choke you The dust storms get you down The red sun spoils your beauty And burns you blue &amp; brown The drought is simply shocking And the thirst our Squadron fears Will only be abolished By Beers, &amp; beers, &amp; beers. 
 The war wont last for ever, This scrap will soon be done, And we'll have done our little bit A straffing of the Hun, And when we get back home again And greet our little dears All thoughts of Egypt will be drowned In Cheers &amp; cheers &amp; cheers. By Bluegum
