<p>21/10/1915<br/>Another night out last night. A and B Batteries 56th Brigade taken up into action, their position is a forward one in Achi Baba nulla. It was a grand moonlight night. As luck would have it the enemy was fairly quiet. A lot of Artillery fire on right flank, a sort of Artillery duel. The Turks peppering the French and the French peppering the Turks. A few shots over our way this morning. A shell landed in amongst those Batteries we moved yesterday, killing 3 mules and knocked down a telephone post. A most noticeable thing here is the migration of birds from the 21st to the 25th of this month it is most pronounced. Terrific rifle fire all along the line. Enemy aeroplane over, dropped one bomb, infantry firing volleys at him, he got away quick and lively, this happened at 10 A.M. Thursday. This aeroplane was brought down later in the day, by the French. A section of trench was captured by the H.L.I. without opposition<br/>22/10/1915<br/>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalga. Rumour had it</p>
