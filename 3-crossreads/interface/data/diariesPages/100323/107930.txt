a lovely sunny day. Got up early. At 8.30 a brig came alongside and turned us round after which a pilot took us out. We passed Plymouth. a fine esplanade with a good statue of Drake and another in memory of the Armada's defeat. The old Eddystone lighthouse has been re-erected on this place as an ornament. Passing several warships the crews stood to and manned the rigging giving us cheers which we returned. Quite a number of old wooden wall three deckers are moored here being used now for training ships. The Freidricksran carrying some families, nurses about 1000 troops was lying in the channel waiting for Billy Hughes to come off in a launch.
