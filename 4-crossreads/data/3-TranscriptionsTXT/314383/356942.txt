 An Armenian preacher has his wife &amp; family with us.  Tonight the wife is very low as she has been ill for some time.   Bound all the wounded ones in arrival at camp. 
 Aug 15 Passed thro the most dangerous tract.  Kizal Bulahk to Perga.  Dead bodies are everywhere &amp; all stripped &amp; every spring is polluted with dead bodies &amp; water is about 20 miles apart.  Feeling very ill all day. 
 Aug 16 Arrived Bijah 6 pm done up &amp; burning with fever.  I hardly remember the details of the day but thank God we have got the people to safety. I'm done. 
 A big mail waiting thank God for that cheer.
