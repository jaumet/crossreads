  
 March, 1915 Tuesday 2 Went Abajsia re nose bags & Remnants. Horse fell stroke iron, lamed himself & me, camels coming around the corner make horses very nervous & ashphalt roads are slippery. No wood on the desert so all manure is dried & used. Very few carts all loading packed. Prickly pear is used for wood & cultivated, fewer spines than the Q'land variety. All fencing is made of mud walls & most of the Houses for Natives built likewise.
