<p>finished up by drilling all the afternoon, as you may imagine I was rather tired &amp; sleepy by the time I finished my drill, I will be on sentry again on day this week but what day I dont know yet. I think it is a little solid for a new chum, but I expect we have to be broken in. Our Commander gave us great praise anyhow, for he said he had no fault whatever to find &amp; when doing inspection rounds he found every sentry alert &amp; at his post.</p>
<p>Well Aunty I will end now hoping you are all well &amp; looking forward to a line from you both shortly</p>
<p>With love to all from<br/>Your loving Nephew<br/>Arthur</p>
