<p>25.4.15<br/>Sunday 25th.  Had Church Service this morning at the Tewfik Palace Hotel &amp; had a good service.  There is a Church of England Church here &amp; I believe it is a fine place.  After dinner I put in an hour in the sulphur baths, &amp; had a very good time there.  The baths were pretty well filled early in the afternoon &amp; by 3 oclock it was crowded.  Stan received a pass out from dinner time &amp; had a hot sulphur bath.  I was feeling rather tired &amp; went to bed as soon as tea was finished.  Had a very easy day of it.</p>
