I made very excellent meals the last two evenings cooked by myself.  Yesterday's dinner menu was
Fried bacon & Fried breadToastMarmalade & Swiss milkTea - Egyptian Cigarette
Today's ran as follows
Fried BaconFried BreadCorned Beef Fried in Bacon fatCabbages (machon ochies)ToastSwiss milkTea - Egyptian Cigarette
Not so bad in fact.  I enjoy cooking & eating these meals more than any others.  One has to live absolutely for the moment here or else one would die of melancholia.
