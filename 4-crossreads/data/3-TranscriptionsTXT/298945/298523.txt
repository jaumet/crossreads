 Here is what I have written in Bert Emmott's autograph album &ndash; my first original poem &ndash; least of all sonnet: &ndash; 
 "A topic sketch, I know, is what you fain Would have; yet I have thought 'twere better to Evolve some helping thought, to give to you &ndash; Clothed in rough chaff, &ndash; a simple little grain. On life, the calling which you choose, &ndash; or brain Or hand, if you success desire to woo, Demands you pass through tests: heights are taboo Unless the standard of each test you attain 
 So in the moral side of life you'll find Soul testing opposition, needing strength To overcome; after a fight, at length You'll reach a point &ndash; to failure half resigned Weakness will whisper to you: "Never mind". Fight on: that foe can ne'er be left behind."
