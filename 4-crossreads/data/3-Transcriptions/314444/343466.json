<p>able to get a drink of water, and you say to yourself "I'll play the game, I'll go back and help the boys out, as they will want all the help they can while these shirkers at home wont come". If all the wasters and shirkers and cold feet brigade were to enlist and come and do their bit it would lighten the burden on our shoulders. I never done much while I was there but we all cant be heroes, we come with the intention of doing our bit and that is the main thing.<br/>We are well looked after here, in fact it couldn't be better. There are ladies coming here every other day with books and papers and also cigarettes. The very bad cases get taken out for motor car rides in the cool of the evening, and every one seems to be doing their utmost to help us. I want to tell you mum I havent had a letter or paper from you or any one else since I left Australia, and it has me worried at times as I like to know how</p>
