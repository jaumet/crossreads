 Cold &amp; windy again. Stay in tent all day. This spell is rejuvenating us all. Hayman Ridgway &amp; self walk into Albert after tea for papers. Witness the passing through of troops &amp; cavalry. Albert was full of them all hurrying to the front. It was a most inspiring sight. The first time our cavalry has been called on to do anything of moment on the Somme. Indian &amp; British passing on hours at a time. The great panoply of war.&mdash;a  stupendous organisation truly.
