 played some very nice music. 
 Well we have been very busy this last few days getting things together to go back to "Anzac"  We are now on a boat called the "Ismania" about 7000 Tons.  Well on leaving the camp today I never had such a load of things in all my life I had all my equipment &amp; a big sugar bag of tinned butter fruit &amp; fish for we knew we would not get any once we left. I will never forget it  We had about 1&frac12; miles to walk &amp; I thought it was 20 miles one of the men along the road who was riding asked me if I was a camel.  Well we arrived on board 27 Oct 1915   Well we amused ourselves by playing cards all day &amp; night.  on the evening of the 29 Oct 1915 we started back again &amp; arrived that night &amp; camped on the side of the hill.  next day we went up into the firing line &amp; stayed there for a few days &amp; then came round towards Browns Dip to relieve one of the 3rd Brigade Battalions.  Well we are settled down very comfortable in a nice big dug out partly covered with tin &amp; partly with water proof sheeting.
