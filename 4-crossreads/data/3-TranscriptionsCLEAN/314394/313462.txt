5th Nothing6th Move from KANIMBLA VALLEY to FERRY POST WEST. A hard and fatiguing march as the men had full pack and blankets to carry.
7th Left FERRY POST WEST 9am. The march through ISMALA was very tiring even the sight of the green foliage and habitation did not revive us. We continued to march for hours in the hot mid-day sun. En route we passed by various hospitals, among which was an Indian Hospital under the shade of the trees. A GHURKA stood guard with his drawn knife. Arrived at MOASKAR about 2 pm and very glad to find tents already pitched.
8th Battalion marched to the lake for a swim, band leading. Every one inoculated including myself. A general Officers Mess meeting held.
