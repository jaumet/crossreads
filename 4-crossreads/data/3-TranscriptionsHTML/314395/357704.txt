<p>him, in a single instance, under the fluence of seraphic lubrication.  There's no doubt our fellows look well on leave.  Their uniforms are neat, and they are always well shaven, &amp; well booted.  Their swinging stride, &amp; perpetual good humoured grin appeal to all.</p>
<p>It is my desire to go through a munition factory while here, and next time on leave, I will endeavour to achieve it.</p>
<p>I am also enclosing a dance programme which I would like you to keep for me.  You know that the light fantastic never held much attraction for me but this time I bent a little, and had a real good night.</p>
<p>The Hun is making good progress in the West, and I am anxiously waiting to see the Allies cut in on his flank to restore our line.  If they don't move quickly, it will throw us back about three more years.</p>
<p>Best wishes from<br/>Your affect. Son<br/>George.</p>
