<p>Egypt<br/>21-4-16</p>
<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>Today is Good Friday.  We had a Church Service this morning &amp; have the rest of the day off duty.  I intend going into Ismailia to dinner tonight (C.O. willing).  There is a splendid little Club there and all officers are hon. members.  They serve an excellent meal and it is very nice to get away from Mess tucker occasionally.</p>
<p>We are training very hard now and have great hopes of getting away again.  I think</p>
