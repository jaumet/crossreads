At 9 a.m. a cab called and took me off and away to the Waverly station. Although the train leaves at 10 it is necessary in order to get a seat  to leave at 9 and get on the spot. Succeeded in getting a seat in a smoker. The day is fine and sunny and the city looks well. The old castle perched on the cliff and all the old town there also make Edinburgh a very pretty place. Had a good journey but it is tiring and I did not get into London until 8 pm. Taxicabs were very short so I dined at the Kings Cross Hotel before taking a taxi to the Grosvenor where I got a room presided over by a maid with the Crown of Venus. Bought a paper &c. Later walked up Piccadilly and fell to a jaunt in company to Great Russell Street.
