<p>1918<br/>Mon 1st Apl<br/>I am leaving Kiel tomorrow for the Officer's Receiving Depot at Karlsruhe, Baden.</p>
<p>Cramer, poor old chap, leaves for Kommando, where he shall slave 12 hours a day for 30 phennigs (3d)</p>
<p>Tue. 2nd.<br/>With the benediction of Kate, Doris, &amp; Nummer 25, I left the lazarelt at 11.30 am, escorted by a Landsturm unter offizier of about 35 or so.</p>
<p>The streets of Kiel-Wik were crowded with uniforms, &amp; the shops! &ndash; in one pastry-cooks the window exhibit was two loaves of that awful black-bread!</p>
<p>Boarded the "electrischer" at Hildegarde Strasse. and we whisked into Kiel past acres of awful flats and hundreds of kiddies playing in the streets.   Flats are apparently the only residences.</p>
