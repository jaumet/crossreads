<p>2.  as to Rid's address from the cable we intend to send to-morrow it is Divisional Artillery, 1st Australian Division, A.I.F. Egypt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My address is above, though just Pension Wales, Cairo would be sufficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did think perhaps I should go back to Alexandria, indeed feel almost sure of it when Rid's destination for the present was to be Serapeum &amp; there was no certainty of Wal's or Le's whereabouts.  But just latterly everything has seemed to point to my coming down to Cairo to stay.  I shall be within much easier reach of Rid &amp; Le at Tel-el-Keber, it is about three hours by train &amp; it is possible Rid may be able to slip up about once a fortnight.  Wal, I shall be able to see at least once a week I think if I am in Cairo, that is while he is at Zeitoun at any rate, and I should be cut off from all this if I were up in Alexandria, though certainly I leave behind a rather nicer home than we can find here and a number of pleasant acquaintances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been rather a difficult matter to settle just what to do for the best, but nearly everything seems to point to my coming to Cairo.<br/><u>Monday 28th Feb.  In the train.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just seen Rid off &amp; am trying to finish this in the train on my way up to Alexandria to get my clothes &amp; other belongings.  Intend to stay there until Wednesday &amp; then come back here again.  I will tell you about the Pension Wales when I get back there &amp; settle down though I know pretty well what it will be like since I have stayed there a fortnight and am to have the same room on my return that we have been having together.  You will see what a fine building it is in by the photo that I shall be enclosing.</p>
