others, a mass of ruins. The mud here was also very bad, I think this mud is disheartening. In all my letters for the last six months you will see mud mentioned, it will be a treat when the dry weather really does set in. I had almost arrived at my destination when I noticed a German taube flying exceptionally low. He attacked an observation balloon & sent it to mother early in flames. The two observers I am glad to state came down safely by means of their parachutes. I went over & spoke to them both, to see if they were wanting anything, but they were O.K., of course they were a little scared, it was rather an awkward experience for them.  One of them dropped about 30 feet before is parachute opened. We must admire the German airmen for their bravery & daring, although they are our enemies. This is not the first time we have seen their daring feats. My home for the next few days will be in a German Dug-out, it is fairly comfortable & we have plenty of blankets. Who should I meet to-day but Towser Reid an old schoolmate of mine, he is in the Infantry.
