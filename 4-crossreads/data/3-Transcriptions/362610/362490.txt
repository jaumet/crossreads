<p>Sunday 1 October 1916<br/>Most unlike a Sunday &amp; difficult to realise that it was. A fine day keeping me busy up the line &amp; at strong points during the morning. During the afternoon had to carry out tests with a new tear bomb which proved very satisfactory. At 7 p.m. attended the Burial Service in the dark of Major Rowlands &amp; others killed the previous day, the R.C. padre reading the service for one of his men in a very poor style I thought, Padre McKenzie taking the Protestant service. It was a weird scene.</p>
