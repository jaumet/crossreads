<p>1915<br/>July 18 Sun.<br/>Went into Cairo in the afternoon after a couple of parcels from Sydney but the Parcels Office had closed at noon. The day was not extra warm but a thermometer in a shop registered exactly 100&deg; (about 3 p.m.).<br/>Very thirsty weather &ndash; to-day got through 2 Lime drinks, 2 Ice creams &amp; a lemonade.</p>
