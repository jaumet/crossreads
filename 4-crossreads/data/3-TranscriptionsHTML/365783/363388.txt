<p>No. 2 General Hospital<br/>Mena Cairo<br/>Egypt.   7.3.15.<br/>Dearest old Mrs,<br/>Since writing last nothing very much has happened.  I have not yet had any letters either from you or from the Coolabah folk.  I have been wondering how you have been fixed up since your arrival in London &ndash; whether you have gone to the Miss Ford sort of establishment, a hotel or whether you are comfortably ensconsed in a nice little out of town cottage.   I hope it is the latter &ndash; I know it is what I would prefer more especially as it will be so much nicer for the children.   We get very little news of the outside world here, I have seen nothing about what short of a winter they have had in England &ndash; I hope it has not been too cold &amp; that you have not had any of those beastly chilblains &ndash; I can tell you it is pretty [indecipherable] chill here at night time I think I told you some time ago that my new watch had gone bung on me &ndash; well I could not get it to go &amp; didn't like to trust it with any of the nigger watchmakers so put it by.    I came across it to day &amp; was agreeably surprised to find that it was on the move again.</p>
