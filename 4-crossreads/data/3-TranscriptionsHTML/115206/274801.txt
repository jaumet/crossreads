<p>August,1918<br/>Monday 19</p>
<p>In front of Morcourt, Bty Position<br/>Weather dull and a slight drizzle all day. Had a day on lines and stripped a pair of Bosche phones, rebuilding them up  again. Albert Garfott came back to the Battery.<br/>112th. Howitzer Battery pulled in right above our dugout, and they have been sending down the dirt into the old Home all day.<br/>Have been very bilious today. Don't know the cause of the trouble.</p>
