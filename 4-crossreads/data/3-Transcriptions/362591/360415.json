<p>My dear Judge,</p>
<p>Forgive my delay in answering your letter about Bissenden [Brissenden].  I was glad to hear about him, and have been enquiring what he is doing.  We quite appreciate his value, and there is no doubt a man of his professional standing and capacity ought to be an officer.  But the rule laid down by the Minister that no man can get a commission except by passing an officers' school cannot be got over.  He would get one for certain if he went through the school, but that would delay his departure for the front by some months, and I have no doubt that would not suit him.</p>
<p>A man of his qualities, however, is sure to attract his commanding officer's attention when once on service, and get promotion.</p>
<p>If he was transferred from the Engineers to the Cyclists, it must have been done, I think, at his own request, or if not, he could apply through his commanding officer to return to the Engineers, where I think he would be perhaps more likely to be noticed on service.  However, I know too little about the facts to advise.</p>
<p>However special his qualifications, his lack of military training would make it impossible for him to have been given a commission in some specially suitable capacity, for we are only sending out units with ordinary regimental officers.</p>
<p>However, I am quite glad you wrote to me, and I will bear him in mind.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>H. Foster</p>
