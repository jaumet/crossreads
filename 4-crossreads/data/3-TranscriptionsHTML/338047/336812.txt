<p>1918<br/>Sept 4 &ndash; 5<br/>trench, and stayed there for the remainder of the night and also the next morning.<br/>Sept 5.<br/>About 3pm a runner from Battn HQ came down the trench and gave the OC the word to advance. The Hun was clearing out again. At 4pm we hopped the bags and toddled off to find him. We advanced up the valley about one kilo to just past Bussu. The Hun could be seen clearing out over the top of the hill. The Company Commanders were eager to go forward. We did so and almost got caught by one of our own barrages, which was being fired into a small valley leading into the main valley. We all rushed across the valley to get away from it and got up against the village. Fritz saw us and shelled us heavily. We got into the shelter of a bank on a roadway, and stayed there for a few minutes. As our own barrage had now moved on the OC told us to get back to the safe side of the valley. We got across in small parties by rushing in between each shell</p>
