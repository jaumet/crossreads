  
 Every time the battalion is on Parade, the Major after calling the Parade to attention he  always finishes with roaring "Stand steady the band".  At a concert the other night given  mainly by bandsmen, the Major acted as chairman and gave a song.   Every now and then some of the men would sing out "Stand Steady the Band" but the  Major only smiled and took it in good part. Our doc. is a good old sport.  Every time we play at the officer's mess he shouts us a  drink and gives us boxes of 20 "Greys" (Cigs)
