  
 Thursday 20 July 1916 In the trenches in front of Posieres under more or less shell fire all the time. Our company was in the communication trench leading from the sunken road to the trenches. Very cramped & crowded but had to make the best of it. Round about were the bodies of scores of tommies who had been killed in the capture of the trench we were holding, & numbers of Germans also. At various spots were German rifles, bayonets, equipment &c. & some of the boys got some fairly good souvenirs. Was glad to find that Arnold Hazlewood was on duty in B Co. quite close by & had several yarns with him.
