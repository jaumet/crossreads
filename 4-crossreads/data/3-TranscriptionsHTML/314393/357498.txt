<p>reached the Huns parapet before being killed. The bodies had evidently been lying there for some time but owing to the freeze of winter were fairly well preserved which enabled us to bury them to the best of our ability, standing something up at their heads to indicate that a soldier was buried there. This was done so that the dead men may be located by the graves section who followed on burying our dead in properly formed cemetries. Slightly to the south of the Maize was the "Butte de Warlencourt" where the "Aussies" made a great name for themselves just previous to this time. The chief duties carried out by us whilst in this position were ammunition fatigues &amp; burial parties but neither of these duties were very strenuous &amp; I also spent my 20th Birthday in this position. The 20th Battalion arrived during the night of the 7th of March to relieve us &amp; this being done we marched back to Bazentin where we were put into No 2 Camp for the night. Before turning in the troops were given a good meal followed by a big rum issue after which the boys lay down for a well earned rest. After breakfast next morning the battalion set off &amp; after a short march we were put into huts at Marmetz Camp. our stay in this camp lasted a few days our only duties during that time being short route marches without gear which was very acceptable for it provided necessary exercise for the weather was still very cold. A Boxing Tournament was also organized which gave the boys some welcome amusement &amp; past time for some very good contests took place. When the battalion moved off on the 16th the men were all feeling fit again &amp; completed the march to Dernacourt where we were put into billets without turning a hair. This being the first village the troops had been in for nearly two months they spent their money freely on eggs &amp; such foods that were not issued in the army, also patronizing the Estaminets for their beer during the drinking hours.<br/>[Image includes a hand drawn sketch titled "Rough Sketch Showing Evacuated German territory in The Maize Sector]</p>
