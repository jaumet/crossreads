<p>Tuesday, 13 July, 1915<br/>Arrived at Malta at 4 pm went right into quarantine harbour and tied up, none of the patients went off at night, doing so in the morning.  It is a wonderful harbour and everybody seems to have only the one occupation that is swimming in the lovely waters, the town Valetta is built on solid rock, there is no earth at all and the whole island is one impregnable rock fortress on which some beautiful buildings have been erected every thing is quaint and our visit here will be ever memorable, the sisters &amp; officers went ashore, but we amused ourselves by throwing coins in the water for the clever Maltese children to dive for.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 14 July, 1915<br/>All military patients went off at eight in the morning, and as they arrived at the Wharf were met by English &amp; Maltese Ladies who distributed cakes, chocolates etc to them, the Naval patients we took around to the Naval Hospital in the Grand Harbour then we got leave and in partys explored the sights of Valetta, the first thing I did was to post my belt of badges home and some lace I bought for my sister then we saw the wonderful &amp; beautiful ancient church of St John &amp; the tombs of the knights, to describe it hear would be useless it is impressed on my mind for ever, we saw all the sights went through a couple of hospitals the wounded that can walk about are given blue &amp; white uniforms &amp; a red tie, they look very funny, there other clothes are taken from them, everywhere people show us kindness, the Austs are very popular here, all the Maltese girls glance their wonderfully beautiful eyes when we pass.</p>
