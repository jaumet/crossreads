<p>Wednesday June 5th<br/>On parade 6 a.m. not feeling too good, went to Dr. who gave me some tablets and sent me to bed (temp. 100&deg;) but I didn't go.  I got paid 55 frcs.  After dinner Ron Powell &amp; I walked into Pont Remy and spent the afternoon there.  After we had had some tea we went to a concert given by the 4th Divisional concert party, and it was a really fine show.  Arrived back in camp 8.30pm and went to bed tired out.</p>
<p>Thursday June 6th<br/>Up at 5.30 a.m.  Went to Dr. again and got some more tablets and was again told to rest.  (Got a touch of fever.)  Feel very groggy.  Went for a walk through the woods and lay down under a tree and went to sleep.  After tea watched the "try out" races between the 41st battery horses and donks.  There were some very good finishes.</p>
<p>Friday June 7th<br/>Made another visit to the Dr. and was again told to take it easy.  After dinner went out on the wagon to practice for the review on Sunday.</p>
<p>Saturday June 8th<br/>Went to Dr. again (got my usual tablets) feeling rotten, temp up to 100 again.  After dinner went into Pont Remy and wandered round, after tea went to a play by J.M. Barrie, and was very good too.</p>
<p>Sunday June 9th<br/>Left camp 10 a.m. for the review ground, after getting there we took out the horses and watered and fed them, then cleaned the gun &amp; wagons for the inspection.</p>
