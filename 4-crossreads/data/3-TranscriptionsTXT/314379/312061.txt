We soon realised much to our regret, that we would not have the opportunity of setting foot on what appeared to be such a beautiful place. however our attention was soon directed to the canal itself. As we passed the fortified positions of the city the whole of the troops, who had previously fallen in on their "boat stations" stood to attention, the buglers sounding a salute which was timed to work in with a specially selected party on the sun deck for the occasion. These duties only took up a few minutes and we then settled down in groups at the many vantage points of the ship to watch a really interesting moving panoramic views of this region, which would be unfolded as we steamed slowly along the canal.The first objects of interest just after passing Panama were huge cranes, loading machinery, shipping, wharves, offices and boats and a little further on we passed big ironworks with wharves etc. at one of these wharves the first warship seen since leaving Australia was sighted, she being the U.S, boat "Ulysses".
