<p>Another batch of men, mostly hospital cases left this camp very early this morning , to go on board the Port Denison.</p>
<p>This afternoon the boat roll of the "Shropshire" is published, and my name appears on the list. It is to sail next week. Today I interviewed the A.I.F. Educational officer with a view to getting a month's work at non-military employment in some of the workshops of England, with a view of getting practical instructions in Oxygen-Accteycline welding, but I will not proceed any further with it now.</p>
<p>I was not on parade this morning &amp; it is probable that I may hear more about it according to reports. If I do I will plead 'not guilty'. I received a letter from my wife late this evening written from the Lakes dated 21/1/19 which I answered tonight.  Letter 164.  5 Pages.  I also wrote to Cis &amp; sent Mother a P.C. of Weymouth.</p>
<p>Wednesday March 26.1919.   136<br/>There was a heavy frost last night. Today is cloudless, but the wind is very keen &amp; sharp. My name was read out on Parade this morning for the boat roll of the Shropshire.</p>
<p>I was at a lecture here this morning in the Y.M.C.A. hut,</p>
