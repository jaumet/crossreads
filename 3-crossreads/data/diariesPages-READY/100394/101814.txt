We had a whole holiday today. Russ and I went down for a swim. Edric couldn’t get away as he was on duty. I am in a tent with a good many R.C’s, so I had a good old feed of meat for once. I am trying to study artillery work every opportunity and if I see a chance will go into an officers school of instruction for a few weeks. We are going to practice firing next week. I’m afraid it will be an awful showing as very few know anything about the gun.

I have been out with the directors all day. I understand we have to do guards and fatigues on Sundays and holidays as they argue that we have an easy time through the week and it is only fair the others should have a spell. Young Bunting a friend of the Daltons and also out of A.B.C. Bank, Forbes is with me on the instruments. I don’t go much on him, but it gives us a little to talk about

I’m very lucky to have missed fatigues today as all the others got let in for something There is a Church parade at 9 o’clock. I went round and saw Russ & Edric this afternoon. They are coming round after tea and we are going to see if we can get something to eat at the Canteen. A tin of pears or something. It is too hot for chocolates and the beer is simply abominable. I am as keen as mustard to learn this artillery work. We will have a great day on Tuesday (Anzac Day)

Have been out range firing again all day. It is very interesting work and not too hard. Two more canteens are being established quite close here which will be handy. We had a medical inspection of our Brigade today. Major Moseley conducted it. We just marched by him naked. I am just beginning to get a glimmering of the gun. It seems disheartening at first but I suppose I will pick it up by and bye. Church parade tomorrow. If we have a good speaker he should be interesting.
