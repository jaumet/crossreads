  
 coming out this way; at 12 noon we struck the foothills of the Judaean mountains. We are now in a country of rocky escarpments & giant boulders amongst which grow the most beautiful and varegated wild flowers a great number of English flowers interspersed with others more delicate subtropical species. Altogether this promises to be a most interesting trip. 
 We are now camped by the side of the Jaffa-Jerusalem road
