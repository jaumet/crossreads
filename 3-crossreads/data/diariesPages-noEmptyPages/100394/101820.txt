We are having more shooting today. 40 rounds each Battery. The Director men were supplied with a horse each. The first time I have been on one since leaving Australia. We put in some excellent shooting with indirect laying even better than our direct shooting, a few days ago The weather is still fearfully hot. One simply swelters during the daytime in tents.

We have reveille at 4 a.m. now Breakfast 4.30 Fall in 5 till 8.30 and then we are off until 5 p.m. but unfortunately one can’t sleep during the day. The flies and sand are simply awful. I haven’t taken any photos for ages. The light here is splendid for photography too but no subjects

The Howitzer Brigade have to be embarked by the 24th so I don’t suppose we shall be long after. 11/6/16 What misleading rumours one gets. According to the above the Howitzer Brigade should have been in France. They are now to be embarked by the 15th so I will probably have another note to add later on.
