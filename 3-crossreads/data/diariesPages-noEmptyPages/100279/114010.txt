block up an old gap in front of 22 B. so off we go get the wire rotten stuff to handle too.
 It did not take long to fix her up but my wanderings have not finished yet for he wants Mr Broughton the next officer on watch I to go out reconnoitre an old German Sap in front of 21, we do this get within 10 yds of the German front line where we can see the Huns quite plainly after doing our job back we come, the tea rations are just beginning to arrive so I have to take charge of these see that they are issued fairly.
5 oclock at last still snowing so I call Bellchambers turn in to snatch a few hours sleep.
