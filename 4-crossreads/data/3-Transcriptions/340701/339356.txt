<p>the country is mostly under water especially on the Railway side.  We are coaling now.  The niggers here can beat the Colombo mob out of sight at Coaling they carry fair  sand Baskets &amp; they move very quickly they sing at their work.  The singing is painful to listen to.  There are plenty of Bumboats around here &amp; also a number of men-of-war in port nearly all French.  There is also a number of Hospital ships including the "Gloucester Castle".  A chap offered to dive under the Ship for 4/- but there were no takers. There is a French woman &amp; a coloured one rowing around the Ship playing &amp; singing for coins, they catch the coins in an umbrella.  We thought we were going ashore &amp; mustered up in Marching Order to be told that we had to go on to Alexandria.  I suppose we will be sent on  from there to France direct there is a rumour that we are to have a gun mounted on Board.  More ominous signs a 4.7 gun with ammunition was hoisted on</p>
