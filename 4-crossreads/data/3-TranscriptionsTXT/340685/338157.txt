 by the rattle of the dishes as they slid to the floor and the slap of the heavy waves against the boat and often they rushed right in our portholes and made a mess until someone colder than the rest got up and closed them. It was rocking and pitching hard all night and quite a lot of the men made use of the various receptacles placed about for purposes for which they were not intended.  From  24.3.16. This morning we were still pitching and rolling pretty badly and have been doing so all day although there has been no wind at all and it is really funny to see the various expressions of pain and don't care-ness on some of the faces. Last night at tea one chap was looking particularly green and eating feverishly for all he was worth and when we asked if he was alright he replied that he wasn't too good and immediately rushed to the deck to complete his tea in solitude. I suppose it is very unsympathetic but so far I have not been a bit sick although I am among the few but quite expect to shortly before we leave the Bight especially as this evening I  we were  was again inoculated. We were on horse duties all day to-day and before breakfast we had to sweep out our lines and feed the horses and were late for breakfast much to everyones annoyance and things are very unsatisfactory as Engineers can hardly be expected to take on a Light Horseman's duties although of course in an emergency we might do it but anyway the D.D. should have foreseen the contingency. After breakfast we were put on to clean out the stalls and a hateful job it proved and two dead horses had to be thrown out. Three more are expected to die to-night and that makes 9 for the 4 days travel. They are jolly well looked after but nevertheless only about 5% are expected to reach Egypt. Shocking isn't it? IN the afternoon we were supposed to exercise the lot but only about 90 got done owing to the limited space and time and owing to the rotten organisation all over the ship. Hope we get better in Egypt even if it is stricter. It is rather hard trying to write with the boat pitching like she is so I will retire 7.30 and read some "Sentimental Bloke".
