Aug 4th Have been three days now at Gamli, about four miles south east of Sheik's heran Railway station. I am feeling very happy over my work here. I have always loved horses, and the chance of working among them, and I have it here. I am pursued by a dread that they will try to put me into the Tent Division, but am determined not to leave the lines without a struggle. I am with the bearers now, and ought now to see some work to my taste. Of course, I know, there is always the possibility that after my first scrap, I may never want to see another, the same as many others have been before me.
Here I have had one days grazing, the horses are taken out, each man riding one, and leading two, about three miles to water, and then another mile and a half further on, are turned out to graze, being minded, of course, all day. There is some good picking here, the old crops (barley) left by the Turks being plentiful, though all lying down on the ground. The horses enjoy the freedom from the lines, and get a great tuck in into the bargain. But what a dusty track. Some months
