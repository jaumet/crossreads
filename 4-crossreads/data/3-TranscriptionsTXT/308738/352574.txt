 Dec. 25 Saturday 1915 Woke up at Mena House to find all sorts of provision made for our cheer. Lottery tickets were give &amp; parcels with all sorts of dainties handed round. Concert at night. Went for a walk with a few friends today as far as the Pryamids, there are crowds out to see the sights &amp; the camels &amp; donkeys are having a lot of work.
