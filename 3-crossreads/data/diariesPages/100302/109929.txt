A filthy day. The sand blowing in everywhere the dilapidated tent and making eyes red raw blotches in a damp ring of gritting dust. Received word the Battn was to march past and then be inspected by the Prince of Wales, of whom the prevailing opinion seems to be one of compassion in his insignificant stature. 
Received further particulars of our shift and that I was to act for the voyage as Ships Adjutant. Grabbing a few clothes and Plart boarded a passing train for Alexandria and in the seclusion of a lavatory worked a transformation emerging resplendent in full uniform and Sam Browne belt. Changed trains at Benha for Alexandria. 
Very pleasant journey through waving plots of cultivation like one large market garden. Whole families at work in the fields surrounded by their live stock. Good roads pleasantly shaded with trees running across country. Bengal lancers patrolling railway Tel el Kebir a forest of tents with very substantive mess and recreation sheds ? probably 60000 in camp. Some rain during afternoon, niggers sucking sugarcane. In some places their custom of putting lucerne and other green stuff upon the roofs of their houses makes the places look like an untidy feed heap.
Through Sidi Gabr reached Alexandria about 1940 and drove round in gharry. Tropical down pour of rain which soaked driver through "plenty moyn".
Had great trouble in finding way to quay and at Gabbary docks found all others there but ours ? the "Llandovery Castle" ? "anchored out in stream" said a drunken sailor and cordially invited us to his bunk for the night. Most of the sentries rather beery. A cold wind was coming off the sea and constant inquiries seemed to get us no further. After promising oneself the luxury of white sheets, a bath and some soft bed it was hard to be so grievously disappointed.
For nearly three hours we drove in search of information and purchased some fruit in the native shops. Visited the big embarkation office in the Customs
