Dear Mrs. John
I've just had two letters from you dated 17 September and 24 September, for which thank you very much and I've enjoyed reading them immensely.
On the 27th you wrote from "Omrah" and the next one from Toganmain, so that although your leg hadn't quite recovered, I trust it had got much better.
The trip to Singapore was a surprise to me.  What the devil you would wish to go off to these rotten shores for, I cannot imagine:  and specially rushing off there, just after being only three days back at Toganmain:  and when you say yourself that the garden was looking so lovely.
However, don't go and forget to write to me occasionally even if you are in one of those places.  Singapore is the only place I can think of up that way:  but I shall continue writing to you at Toganmain as I don't reckon on your residence in the Malay Peninsula being very permanent.
