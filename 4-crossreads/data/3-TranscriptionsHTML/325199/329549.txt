<p>my tent in Seymour by mistake by Lieut. Cerity [Cerutty].</p>
<p>After dinner there was a parade of the whole of head quarters for an inspection of the men by Lieut. Colonel Woods and our OIC.</p>
<p>The Colonel addressed the men, gave instructions to properly acquit ourselves like Australians, when we go ashore to-morrow.</p>
<p>At 4.30 I went on sick parade as I had a sore throat, and felt indisposed. I got some medicine &amp; a gargle.</p>
<p>I finished reading a book "About Peggy Saville" by Mrs G. De Horne Vaizey. [Following shorthand is not transcribed.] The clock was put back a quarter of an hour this evening.</p>
<p>Tuesday July 25. 1916<br/>At bed time last night orders were given that fog signals might be used during the night. 3 whistles, were signals, and we were not to take any notice, but if there were 4 or more everyman was to get on deck with his life belt.</p>
<p>This morning is damp &amp; foggy and everything is most miserable. There is a war boat No 92 conveying us this morning a Norwegian steamer passed us before breakfast.</p>
