Before long it became evident that the march was going to be unpleasant as the heat was unbearable and we were wet thro with sweat ere long.  To make matters worse it commenced to rain heavily and we had to don our greatcoats.<br/>However we took stock of the town during our progress and found it very clean &amp; quaint looking.<br/>It was noticed that no native women were seen but it did us good to see some white women at the Oriental &amp; Galle Face Hotels which we passed.  The beach also on route was very good although no one was in surfing.<br/>All sorts of color was lent to scene by the dress of the natives and their jabbering reminded one of a chinese quarter say in Sydney.<br/>Our march ended at Barracks a rather extensive building which was garrisoned by North of England troops and Indians.  There we were allowed a drink each and made several small purchases at canteen.<br/>Posted two cards here one to M.B. &amp; to home.  After an hours spell were marched back to Jetty &amp; to ship via the smelly &amp; hot lighters.</p>
