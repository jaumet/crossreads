8 July, 1916CairoWe got finished with the kits last night about 5.0 & I went back to the Hostel & had a good clean up & some tea.  We arranged to catch the train back to Kantara at 11.0 next morning.  We had an evening at the Egyptian Caffe & had a good time  However we found out that we would be in plenty of time if we caught the 6.15 this evening so are putting in a quiet day at the Hostel.  Its a case of "[indecipherable] money.  The nurse is a soul of goodness, she has attended my hand every day & it had been pretty bothersome & to night she tells us to be sure to call in before we go & we will get some sandwiches to take with us
