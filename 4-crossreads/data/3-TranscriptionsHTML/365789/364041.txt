<p>Dear Major</p>
<p>An hour ago I received a letter from Fletcher embodying your cable in which it is stated you have no authentic news of Fred Phillips.  I am sorry to say I think it pretty certain he is gone.  I saw a good deal of him right from July till Nov. especially in the latter months while our ambulance was clearing the sick &amp; wounded of the Division from August to December.  It happened about the end of the 1st week in Nov. when his battalion made a raid on the enemy trenches at &ndash;.  He stayed behind after the attack to bandage a fallen comrade on the enemy parapet &amp; while doing so</p>
