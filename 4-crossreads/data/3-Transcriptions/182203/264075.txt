His wound is nearly healed &amp; most likely will have a couple of months leave &ndash; so is hoping his wife will come in the next few days. <br/>Went to a very grand place for luncheon &ndash; then went to a matin&eacute;e "Peg O' my Heart" &amp; it is the prettiest little play I've ever seen. We both enjoyed it immensely. It was over about 5. p.m. then we got into a Taxi &amp; went to a most beautiful place for afternoon tea The Torcodero? They are called the Concert Teas, some <u>Swank</u>. The music was beautiful    &amp; the whole affair was just what I love, oh, if only my boy was here to take me &ndash; I know it is just what he likes.<br/>Capt. had to get back by 7. p.m. so he put me into the train at 6.15. p.m. &amp; would have a rush to get to his Hospital by then.</p>
