<p>[This diary covers his time on Gallipoli from 9 June 1915 until his evacuation on 30 December 1915. Being a gunner and then spending a period as a quartermaster, Sparkes is not involved in frontline action. Nevertheless while there are few dramatic incidences, it is an interesting account of the day to day life and the trials encountered &ndash; from artillery shells overhead to snipers while swimming in the sea.  Sparkes describes the physical and mental conditions on Gallipoli and seems astute in some of his observations e.g. a certain officer under strain (and he never criticizes those who leave Gallipoli because of stress), the mess of the campaign, a comparison between the Egyptians and the Aborigines and remarkably the probability of Anzac Cove being a tourist destination.  He was mentioned in Despatches but does not explain the circumstances.]</p>

<p>I had not much money while in alexandria and when going about seeing those gay Cosmopolitan crowds which haunt the brilliant cafes I was somewhat reminded when midst the chatter of many languages the words of a writer "When one has money time has a swallows wings, when one is broke he indeed has leaden feet. Life is only for those with money.</p>
