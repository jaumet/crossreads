Packed up & left Le Transloy this morning at 9.30 & marched to the same trenches we were in a few days ago, it was a glorious morning & as we slowly marched along it seemed more like a huge picnic than anything else, all over the place horses were quietly grazing on the new Spring grass & they were enjoying it properly while the chaps who were looking after them were lying on the grass sunning themselves
