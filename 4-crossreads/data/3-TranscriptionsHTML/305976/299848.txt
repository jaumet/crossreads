<p>Some of us are civilised.<br/>Arrived Sydney 1pm. Home once again. Had a pleasant re-union old friends.<br/>Sunday April 8th<br/>Went to Manly Glad. One did not think he would see our dear old Arbour so soon again.<br/>Monday April 9th<br/>Went to Easter show, great crowd present. Does not seem as if there is a War on. However much better to be cheerful &amp; miserable. Hate idea of saying Good Bye again. Left for Melbourne 7.15pm. Bidding Goodbye I will never forget. Never will I come to Sydney <strike>again</strike> on leave again. The old Lady takes it too much to heart. Whatever comes or goes the memory of this night will live forever.</p>
