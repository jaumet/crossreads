Notes.
All temperatures recorded were taken at 7.a.m. Owing to the issue of bread from about the 25th to the 31st March falling considerably, several shifts did no baking. Such as on the 26th 27th: 3 shifts, the 28th. 2 shifts, 29th. 1 shift : 30th 2 shifts, 31st. 1 shift. The personnel of those shifts were detailed for general camp and bakehouse fatigues, and those not thus detailed for duty, were taken for route marches and foot drill.
Vaccination.
As a result of cases of smallpox having occurred in Rouen, orders (i.e. B.R.O. No. 3336 d/d 20/3/18), were received for a systematic inspection of all ranks of the Unit. This order was complied with, and those who did bear satisfactory marks of Vaccination were re-vaccinated without delay.
Offences, etc.
During the month of March, the discipline maintained was very good; not one case of an offence being recorded.
