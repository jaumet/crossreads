  
 Wednesday 17th April 1917 [1918] Nothing of interest to put in my little book.  A long quiet day, no trace of the M.O. but as have no hope of getting permission to arise it matters not at all as he never has a friendly word beyond bothering how many flies are stuck to the wretched fly paper. From my window I watch the Alex. trains fly by all day long. "Zep" scare last night, trustworthy resident reported "hostile aircraft" but nothing doing. All our shutters go down 7 p.m. & one almost smothers until 9 p.m. when "lights out" & shutters up once more.
