<p>Sunday, 24th June 1917:-</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon in order to have a look at some of the damage done by the Germans, went for a bike ride through Albert &amp; Pozieres to Bapaume and back. Left Warley ay 1.30 pm &amp; rode through Lavieville into Albert (10 kiloms). After traversing the town I gained the Pozieres-Baupaume road and soon arrived at Pozieres or at least what was left of it. There were numerous overturned tanks lying on both sides of the road and plenty of old steel helmets, barbed wire, equipment etc. Two large memorial crosses had been erected &ndash; one to those of the 1st Div and the other to the 2nd Div who fell at Pozieres ridge. The country side was dotted with small white crosses with a small cemetery here and there. The country right from Albert to Baupaume (19 kilom.)  is a dreary waste containing a few shattered tree stumps. Entering Baupaume the road is lined on both sides by trees which have been badly knocked about. About 5 kiloms this side of Baupaume I went through the vullage of Le Sara with every building absolutely shattered to pieces. Confused</p>
