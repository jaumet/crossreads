 Aug 11th Moved camp to cleaner ground, as the refugees have defiled this place. 
 This evening two girls came into camp practically stripped, one with a terrible hole thro her shoulder caused by a dum dum, the other wounded in the behind. So bathed the wounds with condy water.  The poor girl hit in the shoulder has her wound all flyblown.
