The food here was remarkably good being better than I had seen in any of the hospitals or camps I had been in, so that when we were moved off next day to Aix la Chapelle, Ifor one, was sorry to leave.         However we were warned by our guards that they meant to kill if we attempted to escape, so as no chance offered itself on the way we arrived at Aachen in a few hours and were taken before the Commandant who sent us off to,a military gaol, where we found ourselves certainly up against it, for, as our fellow prisoners were all disciplinary cases from the German army in occupied France, the treatment was anything but gentle.
