At heavy losses these men make resolutions that they will not gamble any more, but once they get some money into their hand again they are very soon at it again.

Working on Ward duty.

After lights-out at ten o’clock to-night there were faint sounds of men talking. Apparently it was the finale of conversation before the occupants fell asleep. The Orderly Officer had ordered the men to stop talking. This nettled the men a bit and out of mischief they continued talking in the same subdued tone. It was the O.O.’s turn to be nettled and going in search of the Orderly Sergeant gave him orders to go round the camp and tell the men that reveille would be sounded at six o’clock instead of seven to-morrow morning. This news was greeted by all with burst of laughter and ridicule. Next the order was sent round that there would no football match to-morrow if the "noise" did not cease. These things were looked upon by the men to be so pettish that it only made them laugh and ridicule more. Some of the more unruly counted the officer out.

Feb 27th. Sun.
A special parade called at ten o’clock this morning. Four tents were said to be responsible for the so-called disturbance last night. Everyman who occupied these tents was paraded before the O.C. with grave ceremony. Each one was asked individually if "he began the counting out".
