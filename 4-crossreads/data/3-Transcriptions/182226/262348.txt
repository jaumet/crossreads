<p>Monday 22 November, 1915</p>
<p>There had been a terrible storm during the night &amp; no ferrys were running so we had to go across in a dicer or rowing boat. We just had 1/3 to pay for our garry back to camp.</p>
<p>Everything had been flooded there, but luckily my blankets had kept fairly dry so I managed to get a good sleep.</p>
