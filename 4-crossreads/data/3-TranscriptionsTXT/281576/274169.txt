 Thur. Dec. 21.  O Lord wet again &amp; they call this "Sunny France".  Jolly good news in the Paper about the French giving Fritz a hiding at Verdun.  Got an Anzac today &amp; a pair of Leggings so I'm getting equipped gradually.  The fellows who have had leave to Blighty all seem to have had a jolly good time.  Shall be glad when my turn comes. 
 Fri. 22.  The 8th got the worst knock they've ever had this morning.  Poor old Alec &amp; Nugget Bennet got killed in their dug out.  It gave us all a most painful shock.  Hughie Taylor of C sec got baldy wounded too. 
 Sat. 23.  The Bearers returned today &amp; what a sight they looked.  Unshaved, unwashed, lowsy, clothes in rags &amp; Poor beggars I felt sorry for 'em.  It was good to se 'em again &amp; they were mighty pleased to be back.  Stan Wright brought back my mail 2 Letters from France &amp; Xmas Cards I from Cis, one each from Kath, Arthur &amp; David. 1 from Nell, Ruth B, Aunt Nell, &amp; 2 glorious long Letters from M.S. &amp; 2 [tricky?] Post Cards.  How the deuce I'm going to answer 'em I don't know.
