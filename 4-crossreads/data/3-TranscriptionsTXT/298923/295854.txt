 7 July 1918 Sunday Church Service 7.30 pm Blood Test taken for "Malarial" in the morning- mostly Indians &amp; Australians in the Valley as it is not considered fit for  white  Troops Horses still well but Dopey GAS drill again &amp; all the usual duties of a mounted Unit, means more work for men than INFANTRY.  Been issued with those wretched STEEL HELMETS again, too  hot  to handle.  The rushing sound of the Farrier's "Forge" puts the wind up some of us now.  Good health means good nerves- And I'll admit I'm scared on some of these night WIRING parties, when Jacko shells heavily.
