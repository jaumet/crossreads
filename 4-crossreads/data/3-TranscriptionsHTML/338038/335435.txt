<p>My Dear Mother<br/>Ever so many thanks for your letter of 2nd Dec just received. I have been reckoning up  &amp; find that the mail from Aust. of 13th Dec is also due, but no doubt my letters going to Sis will occasion some delay &ndash; There is the advantage however of getting my mail per medium of the "Fishes" that should my address be changed I can always notify them in a few days from here &ndash;<br/>Rain set in here tonight so expect the morn will disclose to us a dreary waste &ndash; We are in the battle ground of 31st July</p>
