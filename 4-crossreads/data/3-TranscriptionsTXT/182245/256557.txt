 1917 FEBRUARY 
 11 SUNDAY 
 Fine &amp; sunny &amp; the warmest day we 
 have had since we came to 
 France. Cleaning up in the 
 stables in morning, &amp; Bill 
 Hunter &amp; I went up to Point 
 du Neippe in afternoon to 
 get some stores. Looking over 
 old snaps in evening &amp; they 
 bring back old memories all 
 right. Good Lord what wouldnt 
 I give to get back home 
 again. There was a hell of 
 a strafe on from 7.45 pm&nbsp;to 
 11.45 pm, the heaviest we have 
 had yet.
