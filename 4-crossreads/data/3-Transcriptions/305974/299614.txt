<p>23 Tuesday<br/>Didn't do any drill all day.  Detailed for fatigue duty over at No 2 Stationery Hospital.  Shifting patients from No 2 Stationery Hospital to Tel-el-Kebir railway station &amp; thence loaded into Hospital Train.  Great rumors of our leaving Tel-el-Kebir for either France or England circulated.  A very cold night.  Wrote letter to Olive Turner.</p>
<p>24 Wednesday<br/>Went for march in morning. Wrote a letter home.  Got issued with mess tin, Jack knife, &amp; ground sheet in evening.  Concert held by A.M.C. detail in Mess hut in the evening.  I forgot to say before we have no bugle to blow the calls here, a whistle serves the purpose.  Went up the Infantry lines &amp; saw a few of the boys.</p>
