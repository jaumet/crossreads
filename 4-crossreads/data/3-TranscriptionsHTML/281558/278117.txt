<p>Voices From Home.</p>
<p>Though I hear but tongues of a foreign people<br/>&amp; I list to sounds that are strange &amp; new<br/>Clear as a silver bell in a steeple<br/>Come voices from home so fond &amp; true<br/>I sit at times when the leaves are falling<br/>Alone with my thoughts as I sit today<br/>&amp; listen to voices from homeland calling<br/>Calling so sweetly Ah! Could I but obey</p>
<p>&amp; so there is no sting to death<br/>&amp; grave has lost its victory<br/>Tis but a crossing &ndash; with bated breath<br/>&amp; white set face &ndash; a little strip of sea<br/>To find our loved ones waiting on the shore<br/>More beautiful more precious than before</p>
