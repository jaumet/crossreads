Had orders at 10 oclock this morning to pack up and clear the lines &were bustling to get away from camp by 10.45. the camp is about 2 miles from the piers where we embarked & were played from the camp by an infantry band, another one met us half a mile further on; After all the bustle to get away from camp we had to wait for a couple of hours just off the pier as the boats were not ready for us, some English Tommies who were camped in barracks by the roadside offered to boil a "dixie" of water for us & the drink of tea was very acceptable, we brought a loaf of bread & a tin of jam each with us & it was a good thing we did as the sun was getting low when we got on the first boat, & were transferred to a "ferry" & after waiting on it till after dark
