<p>I saw Brian Mac the other day looking so fit &amp; well.  We'd a little chat.  Quite refreshing to find a chap who has lately got stars &amp; is not spoilt thereby.  Brian isn't neither is Bert nor old Ted or Duncan but some of them make me sick.</p>
<p>I haven't seen our Colonel much lately.  I have been busy otherwise than Brigade work &amp; he hasn't been well.  This cold weather tries him.</p>
<p>Had a letter from Hefty Lasham, she is a dear &amp; so good, sent me a hamper for Xmas.</p>
<p>Well my dear I must flee I am sorry you didn't like the Casabianca photo of me.  It <u>was</u> rotten but twas the best I could do.  I'm really pretty well but have a slight cold, very sniffy.</p>
<p>Dying to get back to Australia.</p>
<p>My love to Mac, Mrs. Ellis, Graham &amp; the dear old Boss &amp; muchly to yourself.  Thanks for the calendar so much.  I'm glad to hear the book is progressing &amp; am dying to sample it.</p>
