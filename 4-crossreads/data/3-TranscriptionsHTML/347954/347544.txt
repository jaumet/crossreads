<p>we have Ghezireh which is indeed a very nice place &amp; full of colour.  When I saw it last, it indeed was a picture &amp; certainly merited me remaining a whole afternoon.<br/>It was a race day &amp; a vastly different course from either Randwick or Flemington.  Nevertheless I managed to back two winners, which wasn't too bad considering everything.</p>
<p>A very pretty place &amp; one of interest to engineering people is the Delta or Barage &ndash; &frac12; an hour in the train from Cairo.  It has a very pretty park &amp; garden &amp; the works are worth a look over.  Described roughly the irrigation of the lower border is the main idea of the lock being constructed.</p>
<p>Sakhara is the place of places from the Egyptian point of view, &amp; it certainly is wonderful from the antique side.  The usual Sphinx, Pyramids, Sarcophages, etc., meet the wanderer here &amp; also the ancient city of Memphis has its ruins near by.  Personally I was a good deal interested in a wandering band of Bedouins who had their village near by.</p>
<p>Nearer the city of Cairo we have a very fine panorama view of the district from the heights of the Cidatel [Citadel?].  Here you gaze down on the Dead City &amp; through portions</p>
