<p>deepest sympathy with you all in your bereavement.  It must be greatly softened for you when you know he died like an officer &amp; a gallant gentleman.  He was greatly liked by all our men, &amp; they felt his death keenly.  As for myself, I had been commanding the unit since leaving Sydney, as Col. Howse was on the staff &amp; I had many opportunities for observing the brilliant promise displayed by your son.  He was keen to do his duty, how keen his untimely death shows.  I mourn his loss as an officer &amp; as a friend.</p>
<p>I understood from him in conversation on the "Berrima" before he left the ship that he had made a will before leaving Sydney.  Beyond that I know nothing.<br/>Private Henderson is writing to you by this mail also, &amp; will give you the messages he received from Brian.  I deeply deplore the dearth of news you have received, but I understood from Captain Donaldson that he had given you all particulars.  I did not write before on that</p>
