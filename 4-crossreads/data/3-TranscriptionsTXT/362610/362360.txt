 Wednesday 24 May 1916 Dull, but no rain altho' there was every indication of it. Up soon after 2 a.m., got  sleeping bag &amp;c. packed &amp; had breakfast by 3. Moved out at 4 for the Etaples siding, entrained &amp; left by 5 on a crowded troop train which went thro' Boulogne to Calais, then E thro' St. Omer to Hazebrouck which we reached at 10.30 &amp; detrained. Luggage left in cloak room when word came that we were not to move on until 6.30 in the evening, &amp; then we were free to wander thro' the town at will : quite a typical French town of rather large size with cobble-stone roads having exactly similar verandah-less houses abutting the footpaths which were more or less busy with women &amp; children passing up &amp; down, but hardly any men. Numerous casualty clearing hospitals in the place, &amp; a good deal of military activity. Fine old church. Bought &amp; sent "Fragments from France" home. At 6.20 our train left for Steenwerck, &amp; thence we had a 5 or 6 mile march out to Sailly, arriving abt. 9 o'c &amp; going into temporary sleeping quarters in a school belonging to a shelled &amp; ruined church. Found a place for a cup of coffee &amp; bread &amp; butter &amp; then turned in : it was commencing to rain lightly. The flares along the front could quite clearly be made out.
