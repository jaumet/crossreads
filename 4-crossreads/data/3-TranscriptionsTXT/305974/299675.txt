 21 Thursday Went on sick parade, &amp; as the doctor informed me that I was too weak to walk about I was to be admitted to hospital.  There are a good few fellows evacuated to General Hospitals from here.  Nearly everyone in the Ambulance are still very crook, suffering from colds &amp; Influenza  It rains nearly every night now. 
 22 Friday Considering our position here we get looked after fairly well.  The Hospital is an old barn &amp; we are sleeping on straw, Great hopes of an enjoyable Christmas being spent are anticipated, arrangements are now being made for  an enjoyable time  such.  I am taking tonics &amp; am just picking up my appetite again. 
 23 Saturday The weather hasn't been too bad of late, we actually get a glimpse of the sun now.  I was informed today that the 21st of Dec is the longest day here, but it still remains very cold well into the month of march, so we have a long while to go yet.  There are a large amount of Xmas pcls coming in now. 
 24 Sunday Discharged from Hospital.  Not feeling too bad now although rather week.  Plucking geese for tomorrows spread this evening.
