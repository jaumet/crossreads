deep in the ground one such piece just grazed my head, a very close shave
While all this was going on an aeroplane flew pretty low down over us & blew the cock-a-doodle-do on her horn again & again this sort of cheered us up.
We had a fine tea tonight just before we left the firing line the cooks brought it up as much steak & bacon as you could eat & to spare, tea, boiled potatoes & onions mashed together, this was the first square meal we had for some days & we enjoyed it.
Its wonderful how they kept the supply of food up to us during this fearful bombardment.
