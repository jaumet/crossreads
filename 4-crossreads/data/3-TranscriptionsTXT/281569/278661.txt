80 wks from home
Revielle at 5.15
Had miles of running about to do today fixing up for the concert tomorrow I have managed to scrape together 22 items the Gen has consented to preside & Capt Chisholm is to be his off-sider the Mikadar of Sohag & his escort have also consented to be present, the proprietor of the gardens has got enough food for an regt & seating accomdation for 600 men, I shall be satisfied if half of the seats are full, fixed up the wicket & marked the boundary & had it watered.
The case against Lt Potts is to be gone on with straight away & the business of collecting evidence is proceeding steadly, he stands a fair chance of falling in properly.
Played cards & chess all night & slipped down the town for supper & then turned in at 10.15. Tired out.

I was elected Capt & lost the toss so they went in to bat they made 114 Cambell out of that got 57, Hal Bowled well, the heat was very oppressive we went in & went down like fun for a start, I got 17 before being cleaned bowled we made altogether 63 so never had a look in, after the match went & had a shower & had tea then off down to the gardens & found there an awful crowd of fellows present got things going straight away & everything went off splendid, the programme turned out first class, I had to get up & thank the Gen for his presence & made a bit of a speech which passed off OK no comments. Got home at 10.30 satisfied with the way things went & turned in.
