 9th August 1916 The mess business turned out all right. Riding School &amp; signalling morning. Had leave all the afternoon till 10.45 night. Went to Arlseford by car to visit the fete which was held for Red Cross. Was not much of a show. The grounds of the house where they had the show was very pretty. The village of Arlseford is a slow show, but with plenty of pubs. Some of the boys &amp; myself got slightly mixed &amp; our car did not turn up &amp; had to walk 5 lovely miles to camp. Arrived home out of breath. Had a shower &amp; slept well.
