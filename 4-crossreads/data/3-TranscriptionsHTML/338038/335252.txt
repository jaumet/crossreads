<p>Friends have showed up lately, as we are at present detached from our Div and are supporting Canadian Infantry. I received a great surprise on arriving here to find that to date Canada has only 4 Divisions in the Field, and one of those minus its Artillery, while Australia has 4 Divisions on service complete &amp; a 5th almost ready to take the Field. When one compares the population of the 2 countries, Australia 5, &amp; Canada 81/2 millions, it makes one realise what a great feat "God's own country" has accomplished in raising and maintaining the Army she has. It is believed that Gen "Sam" Hughes Canada's Minister for War will not rest until he has equalled Australia's record, but they will have to increase to 81/2 Divisions before they are up to our average, which does not include our Light Horse Division still in Egypt &ndash;</p>
<p>This is a fairly hot corner we are holding at present and has been the scene of some of the fiercest battles in <strike>France</strike> the war. It is the Ypres sector</p>
