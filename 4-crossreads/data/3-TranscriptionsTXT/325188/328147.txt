 This is anniversary of my wound last year but I'm not at all bad - &amp; will be about again in a month &amp; will go England then &amp; later Australia if possible, anyway I am safely wounded now &amp; I hope you got my cable saying "Nothing serious shrapnel ribs flourishing" &ndash;. My notes will give you some idea of what went on. The Brown horse Albert [indecipherable] was killed by a bomb on the Lines &ndash; the smaller horse HLAustin gave was killed under me by a shell before I was hit myself &ndash; the Cables will have given you the military news, but we well &amp; truly stoped the Turks &amp; there are now 4500 of them safely interned in Cairo. After being hit I lay in the sand with the wind knocked out of me &amp; a N Zealander came &amp; offered me his horse which somehow I rode to the Field Ambulance put on the table a dose of ether, bit of shell taken out bandaged up, given a whisky &amp; a cup of Bovril &ndash; Mrs Norman Robertson, one of the Playfairs
