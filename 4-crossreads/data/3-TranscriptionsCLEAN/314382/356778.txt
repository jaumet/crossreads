  
 there. 
 Went after tea to a  new  revue "Push & Go" which was wonderfully staged at the Palace Theatre. London playhouses are enormous in comparison to ours & this one was most lavishly decorated inside. 
 After the show, just  for  to see what the theatre suppers are, we went to Claridges which is perhaps the most noted Cafe in the city and here we had a supper, which was wonderfully served and as extensive in it's courses as a midday dinner would be. The bill was in keeping with the place and just as alarming so we have decided not to venture there for some time yet, to come. 
 October 9th: - Fine & very cool all day. 
 Caught the 10 am train to Epsom, where at the famous Grandstand Hospital I saw the brother of my chum, Leo Drinkwater. He was doing splendidly & recovering from a severe wound which had kept him in bed 13 weeks. 
 Epsom is a pretty place, very picturesque and it's racecourse wonderful. The Grandstand & the King's own stand have both been converted into hospitals and they are kept in splendid condition. 
 Back at Waterloo at 6 pm and with Reg, after tea witnessed a performance of "Romance" a pretty piece staged at the "Prince of Wales" theatre. Night wet, dismal & very cold.
