 I notic a patrol of come 12-15 Cavalri on our right , with about 6 on the left ; natur think they were our own patrol , we leisur walk in their direct . When onli 400 yard distant , we were speedili disillus by a volley of rifl fire . There was no mistak ident now ; for I discov we had all but run into a patrol of Turkish Cavalri . As the distanc between us and the car was too great to make , and I did not wish the whole of the rifl fire to be direct against us , should we attempt to escap in the car , I gave the order for the car to immedi get out of rang . As it disappear from view , the batteri enfilad the road from the east bank of the Jordan , open up and sniper it retreat with 10 pounder .
