They aught to send the whole damned lot of them into the trenches only for 1 day & they would know what lovely sweet jobs they have got. I guess that our "orchard" is getting on now.  You should get a nice lot of fruit if the wind does not blow the whole lot of it off the trees.  I have had many a good time on the Bike.  I am to pay for one of them on Tuesday.  I was caught riding one night & my red tail light was out.  So I've got to appear at Salisbury Petty Sessions   I had a look all over the place once but little dreamt that I should have to go there on "business."  There are a whole crowd of Us so we will all go in together.  It will only cost me 7/6 so that's nothing.  I will have the whole day off, & as I've to go on Duty to another Camp on Wednesday, I'll have two days more leave when no one else is allowed out of Camp.  It is worth more than 7/6.  St George's has been modernised now & looks just like an ordinary C of E. Church in our Own Country.  Of course the Gallery is still there but there are no doors on the Pews & the Chancel & Altar are changed too.
