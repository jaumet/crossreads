  
 October 1918. Tuesday 8 
 With the 3rd Bttn Hdqrs. Joined up the above crowd of Yanks last night. Moved from Hdqs Ramicourt to a new one in Monteberain. Ran into Fritz barrage in the above village. At 5.10 am our barrage crashed out, I got caught again in barrage. Weather held good throughout. Proceeded to Brancourt and established a new hdqrs there. Had a hell of time, one never to be forgotten. Ran rations and wounded for some time, very sad scene in a house in this village.
