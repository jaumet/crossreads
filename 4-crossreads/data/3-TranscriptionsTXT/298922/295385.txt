Wednesday 28 February 1917
Did an Out Post time for a change & spent an evening with an old Scotch family I know at Zeitoun, had a time on Piano etc. Quite civilized - Lectures 2 per diem keeps me writing steadily & a RECONNAISSANCE tomorrow on approved EUROPEAN lines. We are getting this training to put us alongside English Cavalry if necessary.
Went Cairo for Lunch at Continental. We get 3 hours 1 in middle of the day - & Saturday afternoon & Sundays off.
