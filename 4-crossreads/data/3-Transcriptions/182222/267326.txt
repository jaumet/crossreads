<p>A Guy blew in with a tale of 33 Boche DWs. kamerading. (approx. 187000 men) Told him an Economic Strategem as Boche has just got out a labor saving 5.9 on 8 day clock principle. Shot per sec. for 8 days after once laying &amp; starting up &amp; down set scale of 60 ranges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He replied that next time he bears good news for cripples he&#39;ll forget it.</p>
