2/7/19 H.T. "Chemnitz" Hull.
Thoroughly explored the ship during the morning and allotted the accommodation. Crowds of carpenters caulkers busy and much gear coming aboard. Many other ships also lying in these docks. Gave all the men leave after lunch. Had tea and then went up into Hull myself ? the quarter round the quays is dirty and squalid. The people in the trams poorly clothed and dirty. Many youngsters barefooted. Some fine shops but generally the city seems uninteresting and dull. Had dinner up the town but it came on to rain so I returned early to the ship and put in a quiet evening. Steady rain falling. Our departure from here is not yet fixed probably the day after tomorrow.
