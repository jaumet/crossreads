  
 Febuary 1917. 15th   During the night some light rain fell, but the day has been bright with a warm sun shining. The ice is melting fast & the ground is getting very muddy & sloppy again.  We heard a very severe explosion yesterday morning about 10 A.M. & today we received the news that Fritz had blown up a large ammunition dump at the "Quarry" (near Montauban) destroying over 1,000,000 worth of ammunition. He has been trying for some considerable time to get that particular dump & has at last succeeded in dropping a bomb from one of his Taubes on to it.
