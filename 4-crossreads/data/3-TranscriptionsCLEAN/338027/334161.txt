  
 Thursday, 8 April, 1915 Allowed up nearly all day, and smoked and read in the sun on the piazza and beautiful gardens. 
 All leave is absaloutley stopped troops are not even allowed into Heliopolis.  I send passes to my mates and they manage it that way.  Wrote home to M & E. to-day.  More deaths and military funerals, this country is playing havoc with the Australians, the desert is claiming all them as victims.  Military funerals are very common now but none the less impressive and sorrowful. 
 The Band of the13th Batt played popular airs on the Piazza at night in camp we cursed them and their daybreak practice but here they seemed to play well, I think it is because we want to listen. 
 Friday, 9 April, 1915 Greatly improved, we were all moved into a big ward to-day called the convalescent ward.  Consequently I have lost the nice little Sister. 
 Some Daily Mails presented by the London War Associates came to hand to-day, one has an article of mine in.  i am writing a copy of this diary for a friend but he is paying me well for it.  As smoking is prohibited it must be done secretly, and every day there is a meeting in a snug retreat.  As all the men are from different regiments you hear some funny yarns.  There are a lot of old soldiers amongst them who have seen previous active service.  The elected president of the society is a hard case, Scotchman, who rules an Irish sergeant continuously out of order.  It is a case of who tells the biggest lie gets an iron cross. 
 Of the Sultan to-day there was an attempted assassination and was unsuccessful.
