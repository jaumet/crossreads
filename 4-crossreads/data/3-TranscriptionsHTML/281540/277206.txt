<p>If I return and sit at last<br/>Beside some hearth-fire safe and sound,<br/>Maybe I'll send some tales around<br/>About our doings of the Past</p>
<p>Of stairs that twist from musty lanes<br/>Weird dens of sin with latticed doors<br/>Fierce gasping fights in corridors<br/>Slave market walls with rusty stains.</p>
<p>Peach-colored dawns with opal mists,<br/>The snaky camel-train that steals,<br/>Past oxen plodding round the wheels,<br/>Gold bangles loading women's wrists.</p>
<p>The flash of anklets through the dust<br/>Veiled women round the village well<br/>(What dark eyes say no tongue may tell<br/>Of hate of hate, of lust of lust)</p>
<p>A hundred breeds of men that meet<br/>And strive with tales in broken speech,<br/>Sad tales of homes far out of reach<br/>Barbaric music weird and sweet</p>
<p>Huge tombs of priests and dust of kings<br/>Rising beneath our careless tread,<br/>While bristling kites swing overhead<br/>A thousand thousand wondrous things</p>
<p>Still heaps beneath the outspread flag<br/>The wolf-like captives pleading eye<br/>The firing party plodding by<br/>Quiet heads beneath a bloody rag</p>
<p>Are heaps of clothes that clutch and sprawl<br/>And ghastly boys who fight for air<br/>Old twisted mouths, wide eyes that stare<br/>Blue skies and sunshine over all.</p>
<p>If I return to sit and weave<br/>These tales and watch the homefire burn<br/>When I return &ndash; if I return<br/>Do you believe that they'll believe.</p>
