 Je suis tr&egrave;s content, mais nous avons trop travailler. Je n'aime pas cette ville, et  j'irai  au front bientot. 
 30th August:- Wednesday Raining in torrents, all day  Late for work. The rain comes in on top of us for some time. No work for half hour. Our office was formerly a hay shed. Keeps half the rain out &amp; the rest comes in. Great. Too cold to write &amp; my hands are nearly frozen. Spend the night in, with Madame showing me antiquities   Most  interesting is a medal won by her grandfather, named Petit who fought with Napoleon in all his wars &amp; with him to the last at St Helena in 1821. Inscribed on the Medal   Most interesting. Some delicately cut champaigne &amp; liquer glasses, also of Napoleon's time are produced  The work in these will never be seen nowadays, pure crystal  &amp;
