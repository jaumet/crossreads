We, most likely to leave in the morning. Hope it will be a fine day for travelling.We have had perfect weather this week but last night a fearful thunderstorm    &  is raining heavily now.
Got up for early Communion this morning, quite a number of us attended this a.m. Had breakfast, so am writing before I finally pack.
We had a beautiful day for the Sports last Monday   &  they were a great success. Concert in the evening   &  were then told we were closing down on Wednesday.
