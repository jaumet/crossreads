Dear Father & Mother,Just a few lines before I leave for the front It is now 12 midday & we will be at them by midnight so we are only a few hours off Well I hope I have good luck. Don't feel frightened I will be alright There are hundreds of us going and we are all in great spirits. Remember me to all my friends & tell the single chaps they are all wanted.The boys from our way have made a wonderful name here & we are going to keep it up. The Turks have a great fear of them. We are all in great condition & very anxious to get over & at them. We will be hard at them to take Archi Baba The Hill that will make all the difference if we take it.Good by my dear Father & Mother and Dear DorothyWith all my love & kisses I am ready for the worst. From your loving Son off to do his dutyTom.
