<p>it was a strange thing me writing such an optimistic letter the day before we went over to Fritz but I am a strong believer in the Good Spirits that look after me in my hour of need.</p>
<p>I dont know what you think of the pres[en]t state of the war but I am confident that the Allies Must Win owing to the fact that Americia has thrown her wait at the hun and you may dipend that the Yanks did show good judgment when desiding which would be the wining side as you know the Mighty Dollar is their god. but as I said before I don't worry myself about it, just carry on and live a good Christian sort of a life its absolutely the best.  tell Mother, sisters, Brothers, where, and how I am wounded hoping you are well, as I am not too bad myself.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your Brother<br/>R. T. Wharton.</p>
