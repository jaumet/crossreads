<p>thing &amp; one has to be very careful.  I have not heard from him for months now.  I had a nice letter from J.C&ndash;'s friend &amp; he asked if I had heard from him.  He has not heard &amp; he wrote to him everso many times.  Funny isn't it.  Dont mention this to any-one.</p>
<p>I've not heard of him nor inquired about him since last February.</p>
<p>Had a P.C. from Jess Marsh, a nice letter from Mrs Balfour &amp; a long letter from Bessie</p>
