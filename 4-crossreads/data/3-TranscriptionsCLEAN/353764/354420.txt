9.3.16 ThursdaySpent the bigger part of the day in the Saddle exercising the Horses & out on treck with the wagons.Went up to the Town in the evening & regaled myself on Port Wine on the Piazza of the Grand Heliopolis Hotel.
10.3.16 FridayTook over a further 49 Wagons Limbers Water Carts etc from the 1st Divisional Train, who have gone to Sed-el-Bisher, where they will camp for 10 days & then embark for France.We are the next train to go, so we are looking forward to the voyage, which I believe takes 7 days.Went out riding last night & met with misfortune.   I had a horse which is very hard to mount & as I had to get off for something & he started to play up I was left in a rotten predicament.  There I was in the middle of the local Desert & could not get him to stand.  However after a half an hours struggle I managed to get on him & started for home.
Have not had any mail for a long while but I am expecting some
