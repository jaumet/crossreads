Yes ? we see you in the pictures clobbered up so flash an? neat
A chattin? of our wimmen on the corner of our street
While their chaps is dying mucky in a lonely sort of way
But the blokes that come ?ome after ?praps they'll ave a word to say
Theres a few fit blokes too spruikin? fer to make the rest enlist
That ?ud do a dam sight better with a shovel in their fist 
Grab a gun and drop play actin? photographed in fancy dress 
And hop out and help yer cobbers in the real and dinkum mess
Now we ?ope that you'll excuse us if we seem too rough an? plain
But them bally illustrations really causes us some pain
And if you don't believe it, ?urry up an join the show
And we'll lay an even tenner it wont take you long to know
