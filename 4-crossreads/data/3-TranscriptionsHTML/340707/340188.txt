<p>amp; for the next three nights I do not go to sleep or to bed.</p>
<p>This year the [Qualorze] celebrations are united &amp; combined with the official peace celebrations &amp; you can imagine what days these will be &ndash; days that have been looked forward to during 5 years now.</p>
<p>The streets are crowded &amp; everyone seems to be out &amp; as a crowd it is as good natured as one of our own but pulsing more with life. I was surrounded by a party of young imps all girls who whipped off my hat as a souvenir &amp; when I pinned one of the girls as a hostage the hat was returned on condition that I kissed all the group, &amp; they were so sprightly that I willingly paid toll &amp; recovered my hat though it would have been returned with the kissing.</p>
<p>Only with difficulty can you get along the Grand Boulevards. Every taxi is surrounded &amp; the crowd try to rock it till it capsizes but usually a gendarme arrives before this or the driver asks pity &amp; they let him go. Often a crowd of 10 or more all sorts girls soldiers sailors foreigners (Americans or English or British) surround &amp; dance in a circle round any one they meet.</p>
<p>Everyone who can</p>
