London
Walked down to Berkleys in Victoria Street and got them to alter my uniform tunic. A rather close day but being in mufti found it cooler than uniform. To Westminster Abbey and had a look round inside. Grotesque monuments detract from the beauty of one of the most beautiful of places. To the Bank by ?bus and to the Bank of Australasia for mail c. Walked a lot around Cheapside and the old parts thereabouts and eventually ended up in St. Pauls Cathedral for rest. Had a walk down the Strand and went into St Clements Danes Church and St Mary le Strand ? old smelly places with the odour of ages. Lunched at Lyons caf very well and then went down to Old Bailey and heard the Common Serjeant Mr A.
