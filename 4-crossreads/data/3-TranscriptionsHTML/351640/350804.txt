<p>Read Gossip on J. L. Trefle.   He was an honest man, not of great capacity, but of the best.  I wrote to his widow.</p>
<p>Have read all the other articles.  Now to bed<br/>Good night</p>
<p>5-5-15. 11-15 p.m.   A running beastie of some Egyptian species has just with great speed caused across my table.   What was it?  Like a centipede!   Gone why bother.  It looked scared.   Then why did it venture.</p>
<p>If you know any wicked words, and you were here this moment, your assistance would be enlisted to swear loud deep and long.  There are two carbide lamps here.  One is working fairly well but has the jumps the second refuses to pass the gas through the burner.  It comes close up to the lighting point but beyond that no.   My ingenuity is exhausted by efforts to make both shine bright.   If they would but do it, several letters might be answered before I go to bed.</p>
<p>My lines are cast in a New Spot to-night.   They may or may not be in it for long.  Yesterday morning I left Mena &amp; No. 2 GH.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I ever go back?  That cannot be answered with surety by anyone.   However here am I my own chief.   Cols Martin &amp; Springthorpe are far away, the former can pursue his own course while I mine, &amp; the voice of the latter cannot annoy me.   What a nuisance 'tis to be educated to a standard wherein truth is valued, knowledge respected, and puerility in the aged not appreciated.<br/>Information has reached me this afternoon</p>
