 16 December 1915 
 The last letter from Anzac. 
 My dear Mother & Father 
 How do you like the look of that top piece?  Yes we are going - I have hoped against hope for the last 3 weeks that it could not be - but now no one with two eyes in his head can think otherwise.  Almost everything is gone, just a thin line holding the trenches.  If they come now, well we may hold them, but we are weak; if they let us alone till tomorrow night we ought to do it. 
 If it wasn't so serious, it would make you laugh, and yet it nearly makes you cry - to think that we - after all the bluster and talk about getting to Constantinople, & the Australian driving the broken down turkey with a bayonet - are running away like a whipped dog - Its scandalous, someone wants their bumps read for the whole show - We just take it; as a matter of course, no good doing anything else, but its hard Day after day we have sat here, hearing the troops going away
