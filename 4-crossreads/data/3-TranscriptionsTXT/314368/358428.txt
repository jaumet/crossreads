 France Feb. 12th.18 
 My Dear Ida, 
 I think I told you in my last letter that I was going to the Australian Corps School for a course of instructing well, I came here on the 15th of January and still have another week to go, so will be joining the battalion again about the 19th. This Australian Corps School is a school for Officers and N.C.O.s,  all N.C.O.s having to pass the standard infantry tests here  before going to the Officers Training College in England. As far as the tests go, I have done exceptionally well, but as to whether they will take notice of it in the battalion is another matter. This school is situated on the old Somme battlefield
