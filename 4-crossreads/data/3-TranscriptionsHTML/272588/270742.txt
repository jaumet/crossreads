<p>Tuesday 23 July<br/>Wet &amp; miserable all day. Up at Strazeele Station R.A.P. again where the English troops are holding the line.  They are labour men &amp; are not fit to be in the line, little chaps &amp; old men!  They are very funny but are getting quite a number of cases already. Australian officers &amp; N.C.O.s are attached to them to stiffen them &amp; our chaps detest the job.</p>
<p>Wednesday 24 July<br/>A few carries last night, sick &amp; wounded. Wonderfully fine to-day &amp; to-night &amp; wonderfully quiet. These chaps are very funny here. Living very well indeed.</p>
