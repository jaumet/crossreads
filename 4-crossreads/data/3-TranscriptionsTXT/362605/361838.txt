I met Aubrey Hickson who is at Park House Detail waiting to go Home.  He looks very well too.  I was surprised to see Him.  He is coming over to see me some night if He is not sent away soon.  I received the running shoes but I don't think that I will want em over this side now.  Well, my Dear ones, we are both doing well & can't grumble so we must spend the time as happily as we can until der tag when we set sail for Home.
Best LoveHarry
