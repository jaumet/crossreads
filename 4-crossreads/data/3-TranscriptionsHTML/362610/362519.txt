<p>Monday 30 October 1916<br/>A most distressingly miserable day which for the front line men must have been the absolute limit. Throughout the night a battery of 4.5 hows. just outside H.Q. barked &amp; brought down bits of chalk &amp;c. each time, to say nothing of jarring &amp; shaking us as we lay. During the morning a biting cold wind with showers at intervals reminded us of winter, &amp; in the afternoon heavy rain continued incessantly so that the sea of mud extended its borders, if that were possible, &amp; dug-outs &amp; trenches were afflicted with landslides everywhere. How the front line men hang on under such conditions makes one wonder, for on Bde. H.Q. we are comparatively cosy &amp; comfy. Cuthbert left for Division, Newth of the 4th taking his place.</p>
