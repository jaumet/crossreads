  
 back. three cheers were given for the Prince & a big hoot was given for the Brigadier Gen who was responsible for the conditions & plans. It would have been a great success if we had marched at night & rested by day We did not stay at Moascar long we were off the same day & marched by the Prince & Gen Birdwood the boys soon  began to drop out again & we picked them up & carried their equipment. Their feet were very sore & blistered, we then marched through Ismalia the pretty town I have already refered how lovely & beautiful it seemed avenues of trees & flowers & two little flowing streams along each side of the road for irrigation purposes.
