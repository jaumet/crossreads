El Enab. It was raining heavily & bitterly cold all day. By midday our few tents were full of wounded & the rain pouring through. We found three large Caves & had to use these accommodating about 200. All Waggons, Camels & horses which came our way were commandeered to carry wounded to Jericho some 15 miles. A party of slightly wounded set out on foot. We have no rations & things are in a deplorable condition.Saturday Still raining & cold. Busy bringing in attending wounded. None of us have had any sleep since leaving Shunet Nimron Messenger
