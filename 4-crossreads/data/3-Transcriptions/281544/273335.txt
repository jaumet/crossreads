<p>with the noise of the Big Guns all over the place. All the Balloons which were around our Depot &amp; in a circumference of a mile prior to the first push of July 31st last are all now around St Jean Station, the distance I think is about 8 miles from here &amp; as Fritz is about 2000 yds further on, so we have made good progress up to date. The Leading Eng of my Train had to shunt Cracker Doom a big 12 inch howitzer out &amp; go about 150 yds up further &amp; put the Gun into H2 Gun Spur, &amp; I had to come back into Zouave Siding about 100 yds back to pick up a load of Empties, &amp; as soon as this was done I came back after a few delays &amp; reach our Depot at 9 Pm &amp; did no more work signing off at 11 Pm.</p>
<p>Saturday 13/10/17.<br/>I signed on again at 13 oclock on the Armoured Eng 3568 &amp; after preparing my Eng I was attatched to 34 Trucks of Mine Earth &amp; left at 15.15 oclock</p>
