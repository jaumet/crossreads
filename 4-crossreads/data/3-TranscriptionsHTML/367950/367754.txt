<p>at him making desperate endeavours to take the place. But Egypt is not for Jacko quoth the raven "Nevermore"! Jacko is to be finally and utterly crushed and put back well within his own boundries <strike>where</strike>  and have his fangs drawn and dictated to.<br/>Then we had the Battle of Romani Quatia and the severe engagement at Bir-el-abd where the Turks put up such a desperate resistance when they were routed. The greatest pity is that we could not follow them up on that occasion. Then came a short spell and I went to the School of Signalling at Zertowi and when I rejoined the regiment they were enjoying a rest at Kantara and all of the men were having a short fling down at Alexandria then pack up and march into the desert again and from place to place further out each time until one fine night we make a bold bid for and occupy El Arish. And the end of the old year finds us just returning from a reconnaissance to a place 18 miles up the coast from El Arish and only 10 miles from the Turko-Egyptian Border. Sandwiched in between these incidents is of course the scrap at Maghdaba where we did such good work. So that, in the main &ndash; constitutes the work done in the year 1916 &ndash; what does the year 1917 hold for us? Peace I hope.</p>
