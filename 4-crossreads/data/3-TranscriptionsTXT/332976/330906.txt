August 19174th   It is still raining & has continued all day.   We paraded in "full marching order" this morning & went for a route march for over 13 miles. & returned wet through at about 2 P.M.5th   It was raining all the morning but cleared up before dinner.   All the crops are looking in a delapidated state after the heavy rain combined with the wind, & most of them are laying flat.After the morning parade we were dismissed & had the day off.This afternoon Pritchard & I went for a ride around the country, & returned after tea.   The Major returned from leave to-night.
