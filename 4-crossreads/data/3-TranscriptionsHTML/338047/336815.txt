<p>1918<br/>Sept 5<br/>pulled up at about the top of the hill. We marched back through Peronne going through the Central Square. The town was very battered, and looked weird at night with the little moon there was. I remember singing to myself. "T'was deepest night in the city square; hushed were the drums and the trumpet's blare". it seemed appropriate &ndash; "Solemnly, silently, through the night &ndash; grim set faces and eyes so bright" &ndash;although we were not spectres, but very much flesh and blood. We went along a causeway by the side of the canal for a while, and then took the road through Le Mesnil. I found this out afterwards because at the time it was difficult to see where we were going.<br/>Sept 6<br/>We stopped at a trench about two kilos further on till about 7am on 6 Sept when we advanced supporting the 31st Battn, about a kilo to the North of the East West Road. We crossed over the main road leading to Peronne about 9 am</p>
