<p>the dictum: "The friends thou hast and their adoption tried, Clasp them to thy breast with hoops of steel".<br/>Glad to learn that M.M. Thomas was pleased with my letter.</p>
<p>To my mind the Referendum proposals are a great mistake which will first of all, if carried, place the states in such a servile condition that the yoke will in time become unbearable, then there will be a revolution which will destroy the Federation, people will not submit to be ruled by a beaurocracy, nothing is worse in the form of government than to have the ruling power in the hands of a few civil servants, and if the referendum proposals as now presented to the Australian people were carried, disaster would rapidly come into view, and it may be that in the course of time a civil war would be required to rectify matters. If you think like me then it is you duty to vote every time against the extension of powers to the Federal Parliament. As the Senate and the Representatives are at present constituted nothing, in the way of a parliamentary body, could be more unsuitable for dealing with small matters, such as those compassed by the new proposals.</p>
<p>Bellvue Hill should be one of the most desireable places about Sydney to live, the sites are of the best and the prospects not to be improved upon. If we were sufficiently well off Point Piper would be the place where I should like to live, at least I think so. Earp's house is on a site hardly to be improved upon. What does the Government propose to do with Cranbrook, when H. E. moves to his new home?</p>
<p>I was wondering why the photo of Buddie was so short, and the explanation lies, in the letter which I am answering, which, by the way, is four weeks late. Fancy cutting my Buddie in half because the beads were not right, none here could have known the correct from the incorrect, oh, on looking at the letter more closely I note that it is her hands that should have been under her scapular to make her pose strictly Dominican, well it will be best when she has her photograph taken next to remember, even in a conventual order it takes time to master the details of the rules under which the institution, and where wisdom has prevailed each rule should have some sound reason behind it to justify its existance, and I doubt if rules could last for any length of time if they have not the backing to be found of such kind. Poor Buddie to be so bound. Yet why say poor, it may be that she has chosen the better part, and in the end may be the most happy. J'espere.</p>
<p>The tidt [tidy] which Buddie sent to me is hanging in my room, it helps to keep things in their proper places. I am much obliged to her. Kiss her for me when you see her again.<br/>If there [are] Pointiana [Poinciana] trees about Sydney</p>
