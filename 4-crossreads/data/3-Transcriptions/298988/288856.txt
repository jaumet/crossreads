<p>there.  Our wireless operator intercepted a wireless message from one of the Hospital Ships this morning &amp; it stated that they had 32 dead bodies including two military &amp; 1 Naval Officer &amp; 400 wounded on board &amp; were about to proceed to sea to bury the dead.  As there are three other hospital ships here, of course there will be a lot on them too &amp; there are probably 2 or 3 more at Cape Helies, so evidently our losses yesterday are pretty severe. The Lighthouse at Cape Helios was demolished last night. I daresay the enemy were using it as an observation tower.</p>
<p>1 p.m.  Have spent all the morning on the tower of our bridge, watching the Warships fire.  We can see them quite plainly from this Island, but cannot see the men on shore at all.  We are awaiting instructions to go in &amp; land the rest of our men.</p>
<p>6 p.m.  Ten French Troopships have just arrived &amp; by the look of them, they will have at least 2,000 men each on board so they will be a welcome addition to our men ashore. Firing is still going on solidly from the Men 'o 'war &amp; two of them seem to be firing right up the entrance to the Dardanelles.  An Airship attached to a steamer has been with the Queen Elizabeth all day.  It is flying about 200 ft in the air presumably taking observations of enemy positions. The Queen Elizabeth has just left where she has been all the afternoon north of Gaba Tepe &amp; steamed down towards the Dardanelles.  The Agamemnon then took up her place &amp; continued to pour in shells to the shore.</p>
<p>8.30 p.m.  All is fairly quiet now, so perhaps they are having a spell tonight.</p>
