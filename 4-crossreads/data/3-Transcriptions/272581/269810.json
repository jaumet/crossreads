<p>February 1916<br/>ascending &amp;  descending &amp;  also the hangers &amp;  it was very interesting. The next thing to happen happened on the 14th when we had to strike camp &amp; get ready to move off. We fell in about 2 am &amp;  moved off at 2-30 am &amp;  went to Zeitiun [Zeitoun] station. We had to wait for our train &amp; when it arrived it consisted of about forty open trucks &amp; had about 30 men in a  truck. The train ride was very cold for the wind was fairly strong &amp; in Egypt it is hot of a day &amp; very cold of a night. We reached Tel-el-Kebir our destination about 8 am &amp; disentrained &amp; was told that we were to reinforce the Third Battalion . We were lined up &amp;  told off into Companies &amp; I was put into "A" company, and when we had been told off we marched to our companies lines &amp;  had to bivouac for the night. Major Howell Price is our Commanding Officer of the Battalion &amp; Captain Edwards our "O.C" of the Company. Next morning we fell in for parade &amp; was marched out into the desert &amp;  had to start squad &amp;  section drill all over again. Our parade ground was the battle field of the "Soudan War" &amp;  the Arab trenches still to be seen there. They are not like the trenches of to-day for instead of  being dug into the ground they are built up about eight feet high on top of the surface. Thing went on very quiet for days with the same drill &amp; on the 21st</p>
