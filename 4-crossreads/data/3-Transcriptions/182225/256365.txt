<p>SEPT.&nbsp;&nbsp; SUNDAY 3&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Cold &amp; bleak all day. Had a morning&#39;s writing in the hut and wrote &amp; read in afternoon &amp; went for a walk round with Bill &amp; Warren &amp; Armstrong in evening. Had a lot of surprises first I got put under open arrest by QMS Lark for not having my blankets rolled but he did not carry on with the case, then I got a parcel from Linda with an Anzac Book and pair of socks then Warick Gregory and old Poss Nivison came over in afternoon &amp; we had a great yarn about old times.</p>
