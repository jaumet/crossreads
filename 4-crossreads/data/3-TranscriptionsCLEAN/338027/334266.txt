  
 Thursday, November, 1914 Very hot day granted half holiday to do our washing, it was very funny to see the efforts of the men. 
 In the morning we sponged the horses over with disinfectant & rubbed all superfluous hair off. 
 One of our horses died to-day of inflammation he has been sick ever since he came on board, it is the first we have lost, whilst the mortality on the other boats is very heavy. 
 Concert at night, successful turn out, I recited Taking his Chance, Gunga Din & The Day.  A Mail boat the Osterly passed the fleet about 6 pm it must have been a great sight for the passengers. 
 Friday, November, 1914 Terrificly hot day like a furnace down below amongst horses.  When I first commenced this diary I wrote that our duties were light.  My Opinion is now greatly changed as we are always doing something with the horses. 
 I have discovered the names of the escort as far as we know, of course we surmise there are others cruising further away, they are Cruisers, flagship Minator, Sydney, Melbourne, Pyramus & Japanese Ibuki. 
 Organising a sports meeting to be held on Sunday. 
 Wrote a poem to my mother whilst lying in bed.
