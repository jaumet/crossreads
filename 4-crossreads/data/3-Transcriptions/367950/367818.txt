That did it. Every light in the ship went out &ndash; switched off from the engine room. So for two nights we have had "lights out" at 7 pm as a penalty &ndash; Truly the innocent suffer for the guilty!.<br/>To night however the lights are on again and if they are not screened, out they go again. The whole thing is nothing but a piece of bluff and officiousness, the second mate being the sole cause. He had better watch out for another pillow.<br/>The weather has taken a sudden turn and it has been cold all day with a strong wind quite a change to what we have been having lately<br/>All West Australians are getting ready to leave us at Fremantle and they are not sorry either<br/>There are several of the 2nd Regiment on board going back to Australia</p>
