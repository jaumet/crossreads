<p>21-2-16<br/>Mon 21st<br/>Last night the mounted patrol of 3 men &amp; Corp. Johns had an adventure probably with a jackal as they could not make out what it was in the dark so, halted it &amp; challenged 3 times &amp; then fired a shot &amp; saw nothing more; This morning while the transport was going over to B Troop one wheel broke through the earth into an old tomb that had been hidden; The Dr &amp; Maj Mills &amp; several lads secured curios out of it such as old coins etc.; Was on duty last night with the patrol out to the North; I sent down 10/- worth of bread to B Troop today , the name of the village they are camped by is Sequela. Had some rare fun boxing  tonight; An Aeroplane flew over us into the desert this afternoon</p>
