<p>your own discretion about it.</p>
<p>It is a pity I am just a bit too late for the Silver Wedding &ndash; Helen said you looked quite young &ndash; "as young as Hazel or I" were her words, but better luck next time. I may be there for the Golden wedding.</p>
<p>Well, Mother, there is not much news to tell you now &ndash; I'll talk plenty when I get home &ndash; which I hope will be this week sometime.</p>
<p>With Love to all the family &ndash; and Helen if she is still at Dene Gully</p>
<p>Your loving son.<br/>Alan.</p>
<p>PS I do not want to upset any arrangements Dene may have made re that little matter, but thought I would mention it in case Dene did not know what to do with all his money. Does he know when he is going away? I'm afraid this is rather a scrawl, but it is cold here and my hand is nearly numb. My word it gives us some 'hurry up" in the mornings when we roll out for our wash &amp; breakfast not to mention doing sentry all hours of the night.</p>
