[Saturday 8 July 1916]
Out of the original 1st L.H. only about 50 men remain now in the Regiment, & when my 2 years is up I shall apply for some decent leave-   The old hands mostly address all officers, doesn't not matter whether Major or Capts as Mr. they do not mean anything just CIVILIAN courtesy, but the Touring Officers roar at times.Did I thank you for the Shirt which arrived safely & the buttons are decently sewn on!! So much stuff is sent here, that falls to pieces with living in it.Our men are in "shorts" now Gippy made (I mean Egyptian not Gipsies), & with such poor thread the men are always sewing or hanging their pants together with the thorns from the Palm Trees
