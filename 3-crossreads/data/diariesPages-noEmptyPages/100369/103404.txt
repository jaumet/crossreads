The ghosts of prayers and cries and tears
The Ghosts of Good deeds done
Passing and Shuddering, gliding by
Solemnly, one by one
Silently, one by one
5
Ghosts of Faith and Hope and Truth,
Memories brought from the Womb
Of byegone days, (what a host there are)
Passing again to the Tomb
The still and Desolate Tomb
6
Ah me, they are only Ghosts to day,
But the Sin that slew them is here
Lusty and strong, astraddle the tomb Graves
Of the past I held so dear
The Past with its memories dear.
7
They pass, and a lonely road of pain
As I bow my head, I see
For the tender Joys of a nobler past
Will never come back to me.
No, never return to me.
