  
 aged (at least) dame.  He sent me her photo, (shock No. 1) & (shock No. 2 she appears to be a 'Cleopatra' or a 'Crice' in modern,  very  modern dress.  And there are Mary & the child living quietly in  Mosman , quite oblivious of the drama which may or may be about to catch them up & encircle them in misery & gloom.  Wow-wow.  I always did think it a pity Ron married Mary.  What good is a wife in Sydney to a man in London.  Still they tell me merely being married is rather an additional charm in a man to some women. 
 Now I must flee.  Love to Graham & the Boss & yourself, 
 Wilkie
