 it danger work , help to hunt Fritz back to Berlin becaus he doe n't want to go , and argu the point , over go someday perhap they will get him move , and then he want to either move veri fast , or veri cautious . I saw a fine sight a few day ago , four of our larg Plane pass . The Hun were shell them for all they were worth , but the airmen kept straight ahead , fli two in front a littl higher than the two in rear . The sky was cover round them , with white patch of smoke , we could see them come for some time , just tini speck , with littl white black patch of cloud form round them . They pass us and fade away in the cloud , The airmen seem to bear charm live , of cours it is veri hard to determin whether a shell is burst close to a machin , when you are down below , the shell burst all round them , when they get close the airman just alter his cours and often he will be sail along , and the Hun Shell will be burst right away in a differ direct , when one of Fritz machin , travel over , and our gun commenc work it doe not take him long to turn for home and show his heel .
