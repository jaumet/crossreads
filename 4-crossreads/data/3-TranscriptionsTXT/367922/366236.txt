Dear Mr. Fry,I must thank you for sending the photograph of Dene. I shall value it greatly &amp; keep it as a mememto of our friendship.
I had the pathetic privilege of paying a tribute to him at the last meeting of our Royal Society. You have doubtless received an official record of our resolution. As several of our members knew Dene personally, I shall show his photo at our next meeting.
Very sincerely yours,Heber A. Longman.
