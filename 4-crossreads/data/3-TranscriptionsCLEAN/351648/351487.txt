 I wish you could see this country now out beyond Bapaume near the Hindenburg line, everything is beautifully green & deliciously refreshing, wild flowers are beginning to make themselves seen & to give an air of gaiety to the scene, & yet among it all a few miles in the guns are blazing away & the war goes on its relentless way making everything that is trying to be so beautiful hideous, the weather beautifully warm with blue sunlit days is more like an Australian Spring than anything I've yet come across out of Australia.  The nights are warm & everything would be lovely but for the war.
