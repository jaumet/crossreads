The house & outhouses take up 3 wings & the stables the other, being built in two story's.  Scotty & I have a large comfortable room.  Dick Hooper & Toby Williams another, Wilson a small one, Kay & Fisher another.  Starnes, Seddon, Chaildecott & Lieutenant Crawley-Boevey & old Wilson have small ones to themselves.  The officers occupy the top floor & the Sgts the lower rooms.
We have got a large mess room also the Sgts.  I was elected Mess President today & am arranging with a cook who swears he once cooked for the Shah.  Got the old devil new clothes & cooking utensils.  Scotty has built a fairly decent cookhouse & is now arranging to build another to bake bread, as one of the Sgts. thinks he can make bread from sour dough in lieu of yeast.
