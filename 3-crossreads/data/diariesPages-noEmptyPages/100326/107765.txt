19/9/15 At 3 pm went down to beach with Major Smith for a swim Got down with safety passed the two burial grounds. Some graves very well kept and neat. Large hole dug one corpse there but waiting for some more before filling in First time had clothes off for 3 weeks., filthy dirty ? feel awful. Never enjoyed a wash better ? got thoroughly clean. Cut short by Beachy Bill putting three shells within 20 yards of us so got out in hurry. In among the Indians ? theirs a smart business-like uniform and all alert lithe little chaps with their mules. Up the gully and quite a number of shells bursting behind us but no one hurt. Bed early. A pleasant Sunday. Noticed the same old dead Turkish sniper caught between the two enormous pinnacles of cliff. Another shot sitting down. Been there a month. Sent man out to bury him, knew it was an awful job. Said "How?d you get on, he replies "Alright only the "gravy" ran all over me!" When bombardment opened the other night a new chum bowled in with his eyes staring out of his head with fright and looking like a scared sparrow in a storm. Said "What are you doing here". He. " --- if I know!"

Monitor putting some into the Suvla Bay position. Bang ? pause ? plonk. HMS Ulysses Barber Ireland Turner Macleod Benjamin. Old up for drunk at Heliopolis after signing the pledge in a previous case.
