<p>Flanders<br/>4.10.16.<br/>We are in yet another part of the line in the Salient, the home of gas attacks, almost nightly somewhere along the line a siren blows and is taken up growing steadily in intensity telling all within three miles of the line that a gas attack has been launched.  Helmets are taken out.  Eyes are strained out across No Mans Land to try and trace that white cloud which might at any moment envelop you bringing Death in its wake.<br/>But no the attack is further down the line, it is not coming this way and work is resumed.  Our line stretches along the bank of a Canal, for a mile you can walk along a trench completely covered by willow trees.  Here is the home of the sniper the natural cover for the observer, further along our line runs through three craters</p>
