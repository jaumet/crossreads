This morning our Coy on parade numbered no less than 3 men & 3 N.C.O's.    Some Coy. wasn't it the reason of it is that all our men are either doing fatigues or guards.
Entries were sent in today from the different Coy's for the spats which are coming off shortly.
There was a bit of a disturbance today in the cookhouse some of the boy's were "showing" & a few blows were struck but no damage was done.
Last night I was down at the Y.M.C.A. at a concert it was the funniest turn out as ever I was at, the singers with one or two exceptions were rotten
