 Your letters are beautiful  XOXOXOXOXOXOXOX 
 My darling Eddy, 
 Suppose you will be commencing your Xmas holiday now. What are you doing? Grandma should take a small house near the sea, then you could have bathing, fishing   &  build houses in the sand. All of you could have a holiday together. 
 Fondest love   &  kisses XX From Auntie Eadle X
