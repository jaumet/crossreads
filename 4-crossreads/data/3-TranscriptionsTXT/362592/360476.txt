ing officers of a great fighting Battalion, and I only wish that he had lived to see them through the heavy fighting in which they have since been engaged.  But the effect of a brave man's presence does not cease with his regiment when he leaves them.  I have seen over and over again how the spirit which fine officers such as he breed in a Battalion lasts long after they have gone, and is the chief motive which enables them to hang on where a Battalion which has had inferior officers cannot hang on.  It is trivial to measure a man's work by what happens in his lifetime only, and I am very sure that the 20th. Battalion as it exists today is in a large measure the creation of your son and of certain officers like him.
Yours very sincerely,C.E.W. Bean.
