<p>to you all today , advising you of the changes &amp; before it reaches you I hope to have my Star up.</p>
<p>14.9.16  Thursday</p>
<p>The weather still remains very cold &amp; that my new work is very congenial &amp; is running smoothly. 3 company Commanders have gone on leave to England on leave also CO train leaving Major C temporarily in charge of train. My time will come directly to have a look at the old dart I suppose.</p>
<p>War news still continues to be of a very satisfactory nature &amp; the French are again doing wonders near Peronne. I took a stroll through Steenvoord which is in the nature of a large French City &amp; it was very gay.  Every second place is an estaminet &amp; needless to state they are all full of soldiers, owing to the 13th Brigade being camped in this vicinity. It would do your eyes good to see the happy way all these fellows have with them &amp; the whole town is simply one big uproar of various noises.</p>
<p>I understand we are going to winter on this front so am setting down to it. I am going out this</p>
