<p>19 September <br/>Headquarters acquainted me late last night that the Battle will take place tomorrow, so Bean, Wilkins &amp; self set off at 1 pm to take up suitable positions for the great event tomorrow. Bean who learns all information at Headquarters informed me that we are undertaking a new system of attack. At 5 am the Artillery will all simultaneously open a barrage on the front Boche lines for a period of an hour or so. This is intended to engage his artillery &amp; demoralise them: the machine guns will play on his infantry.  At a specified time the barrage will be lifted &amp; our troops will dash over into the enemy's lines.</p>
