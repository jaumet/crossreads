Saty  -  Nov 7  - 14  There is a stir on  -  We are going to move - to Sydney is the general idea but no one knows definitely  -  Personally I wish to happen what does happen though the majority want to return to Sydney - AE2 cant go up on the slip  -  She is leaking we hear  -  We also hear that 5 G cruisers off Valparaiso have engaged 3 British ones & disabled or sunk 2  -  Our friends Scharnhorst & Gneisenau are among these 5 cruisers so we are not doing much good here as a fleet  -
Perhaps it may be best to go back to Sydney for there is a good deal of grousing on the Upolu & its starting point is the Captain  -  He reviles his superior officers & grumbles at his orders & then of necessity all under him do ditto  -  Discipline wants to be stricter  -  Moore's idea of discipline is to be very sweet to his superiors to their face but to his subordinates he is more often bearish in his manner not to say boorish  -  He also permits - drinking & talking of a vile description & even tries his feeble hand at it himself  -  Well - I promptly wrote a note to you & posted everything I had to post by 2 pm & then I felt quite a free man  -  There was some tennis on - a tournament was ended & the Governor gave the prizes  away  -
