<p>1917<br/>March<br/>charters that Wilton had had.  These were on view at the time.   The fact of a town having a charter absolves the residents from payment of toll tax, and some other tax which I forget, and they agree to pay taxes as a town.<br/>The oldest charter on view was that signed by Henry I in the year 1100 AD.  It is on a small piece of parchment about 3" x 7" and is supposed to have been signed in Clarendon Forest near Wilton, where the king was shooting at the time.   Nearly every other King and Queen down to Queen Victoria has given the town a Charter.   The Mayor was very proud of the original one, as there is only one other in England as old.   London has the other.   Winchester had one but unfortunately lost it.   The Charter given them by James II was signed by the notorious Judge Jeffreys, whose journey through Wales, trying the Nonconformists concerned in the rebellion, has been called the "Bloody Assizes".<br/>The Mayor in office at the time Queen Victoria gave her Charter thought it would be a good idea.</p>
