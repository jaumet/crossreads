 2.5.16 Another short march this morning with a large rest in between under the guidance of our worthy sergeant. No chance for surveying party. One corporal from our crowd gone &amp; 30 others are picked. However I had an interview with Lawrence the lieutenant who promises a chance for stripes if any vacancy occured but I don't like my chances. I haven't enough crawl. Inoculated in the afternoon and spent the rest of the day writing letters and didn't get up till late next morning. 3.5.16 Wrote a letter before breakfast (9 to-day) to Melv. inoculation not troubling me much. Bought a book of postcards last night for 6 pt. 1/3 24 Writing to Fate S.B. off duty all day passed by bridge and reading and letter writing. Feeling pretty crook in the afternoon and a bit feverish in the evening due to inoculation and I think bad water. Arrival of another batch of Engineers by the  Miltiades  "Macharine" including Harry Tuck looking well but a horrible old gas-bag fowl. 4.5.16 No first parade and after breakfast we had a medical examination and afterwards were paid 10/3 or 50 piastres Usual half holiday in the afternoon but we didn't recognise the fact and played bridge expecting the whistle to go any time. Played bridge all the evening. Got my boots repaired in the afternoon by the natives in the native bazaar free and it was just as well as they were the only pair and nearly worn out. Dave Griffiths in our tent a bonza chap has to return to the base with trouble with his right lung and may have to return to Australia. 5.5.16 Exempt from first parade as we go on guard at 10. new man in our tent. Rather good-looking but appears a really bad egg to me and is suffering from cold feet. Doesn't appear to be attached to any unit and a new row of tents being set up next ours last night he evidently lost his way and hasn't appeared yet. Guard alright and I got some good sleep. On guard for first relief but saw the O.C. who told me I had been promoted to Corporal and henceforth I only had to mount a fresh guard every two hours. Some of the men are regular pigs and although got through my job alright there was a terrible growling if one man happened to be on guard 5 minutes over time. However the dissentients were all from another reinforcement. 6.5.16. First parade this morning about 70 men were called out of various trades to be in readiness at any moment to depart from here. Destination unknown, probably France or England though and 3 officers with us. I am classed as a miscellaneous man and may lose my stripes but may gain more and I think it was chiefly because I had them that I was chosen. Very warm to-day and we have the afternoon off as our relieving guard was 1 &frac12; hours late on duty.
