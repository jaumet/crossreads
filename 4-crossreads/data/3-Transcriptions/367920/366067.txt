<p>I went to Rollestone on the 2nd Oct. and left there on the 7th for France. We arrived at Etaples on the 9th and went into training again.</p>
<p>While at Etaples I had my first vote and voted NO on the conscription referendum. This was on the 29th. On the 22nd I left with a draft for the 13th Battalion. We joined them at Steenvoorde next day.</p>
<p>The 13th were on their way to the Somme front again and I went with them. We came into the battle area November 14th having stopped at several villages on the way down. Some of our stops lasted four or five days.</p>
<p>We were camped at Trones Wood and were doing a fatigue on the railways which had been pushed right up to within a few thousand yards of the front line. That night I was pulled out of bed and told to report to 4th Divisional Head Quarters at Pommiers.</p>
