pretty green & leafy trees, so as if a German came over he could not see us, the padre preached a very good sermon.Yesterday was payday here & the boys were very merry, but they behave themselves well here. We also had a full muster parade yesterday, & while the inspection was on a Taube came over & we had to get back in our billetsNews is coming through of the advance our chaps & the French are making, I suppose it is just a feeler before the real thing comes off which I expect will be next month or September.Nearly everyone seems to think the 1st Div. are shortly going to England, to be trained in Street fighting & etc. I hope its true what a time the boys would have in old England
