 17/10/17 Boulogn Everywher the mapl leaf was much in evid . Our car tore along and a cold bite wind made us keep our head down rather than allow ani admir of the sceneri . Outsid St Omer on the Eublinghen side is an old mill tower which remind me of Bishop Hatto 's castl . Just as we were about 30 kms . from Boulogn we ran into raini condit . The countri hereabout is veri pretti and not much touch by the War . The road pass over high place and a wonder scene is spread below ? a gigant basin of ?lanscap target " countri all chess board and criss cross by hedg . Not far out of Boulogn our rear axl went phut and we had to come slowli into the town . Put up at the Terminus hotel . There were mani nurs about and it was veri good to hear English voic . Book up a room for the other but ascertain that there is a train for Pari at 9 pm .
