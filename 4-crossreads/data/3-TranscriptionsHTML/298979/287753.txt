<p>Whenever shell fire bursts close "in front" a watch must be kept to see that none of the shell holes are near enough to render the parapet dangerous even to rifle fire. If a shell hole is made in the parapet within three feet of the trench this width of earth would not be sufficient to stop a Rifle bullet let alone any thing heavier hence a constant inspection of the parapet must be made when shells are bursting "close".</p>
