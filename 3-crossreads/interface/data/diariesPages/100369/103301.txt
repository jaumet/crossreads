groups of men, Greek, Italian French, Arab and "Gyppo" took their fez's or hats off, and (apparently) gave us their best wishes. So we commenced to get our first glimpse of Egypt. This was not very cheerful looking. On one side we got occasional glimpses of the Canal, the wonderful work over which that talented Frenchman De Lessep broke his heart and committed suicide, on the other side desert, oceans of yellow sand stretching away into the hazy distance; a "willy willy" now and then picking it up into a swirling column.
On the Canal side, the dreariness of the outlook was broken occasionally by plantations of date palms, the great, graceful leaves overhanging the clusters of ripe fruit. These places formed a pleasing contrast to the monotonous desert view, and the sense of relief afforded the eye was grateful.
