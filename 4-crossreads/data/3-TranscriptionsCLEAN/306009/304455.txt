Procession of the Holy Carpet (Kiswa) took place this morning when it was taken from the Citadel to Abbassia on the commencement of its annual journey to Mecca in connection with the pilgrimage business. Went to Mena with M. Brown & had a look at the Pyramids & Sphinx. The Nile flood is still coming up & spreading a great sheet of water over the flats near the Pyramids as well as filling all the canals. The muddy main stream of the Nile is swirling along at a great rate.
