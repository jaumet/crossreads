Monday 4 August 1919Very warm today. Did nothing but read. Played a few games & also cards. Ship ran 330 miles yesterday. Saw 3 whales & 3 boats. Some excitement. Played bridge before lunch & in one rubber was down 701. Finished the game after dinner & won by 1000 (5/-) for us. Do me.
Tuesday 5 August 1919Mild today. Played deck quoits all day. A dancing class started this afternoon for officers but is very poor so am not joining in. The Colonel spoke to the men about leave at ports & giving the 'birds' a fair go on board. Played bridge & lost 4/- so I'm just about even.
