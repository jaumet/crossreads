<p>Judges' Chambers<br/>Supreme Court<br/>Sydney<br/>18th August 1916</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I must thank you for your letter of the 14th enclosing a letter from Senator Pearce. It was very kind of Mr McIntosh to interest himself in the matter, but I do not for a moment believe that my son would be willing to undertake non-combatant duties, nor would I feel justified in expressing a wish that he should do so.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>David G Ferguson</p>
<p>H. Holt Esq</p>
