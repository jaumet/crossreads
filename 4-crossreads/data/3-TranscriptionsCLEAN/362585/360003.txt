Dear old mater,
What do you think of this scrawl for a young beginner?  Dont think it hurts because it does not, but its the best I can do for the present.
It was on  the 31st March that it happened and I think Fritzy might have been more  careful.  The first was alright, a bullet through the fleshy part of the right arm above the elbow; but throwing bits of shrapnel at a man's head was a bit too  strong I thought.  It landed on the left side and glanced off - a good job it was the head.
I  swore for a  while  but after about 5 mins. gradually lost the power of speech.  I can't speak
