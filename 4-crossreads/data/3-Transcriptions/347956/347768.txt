<p>Nov 9 &ndash; 10</p>
<p>badly hurt &amp; ran on to the Cocos Island to save herself from sinking.  the Sydney is out scouting for the merchantmen that was supplying coal when she was sighted.  no sign of the Minitor's return yet.  I was on the bridge on duty from 4 till 6 PM.</p>
<p>Tue 10th<br/>Cold seems a bit better.  gave the cook 1/- for a feed of onions.<br/>the [indecipherable] steering gear went wrong at one o'clock this morning &amp; she has been running out of line all day.  another man died on the Euripideis yesterday; there was 2 killed &amp; 30 wounded on board the Sydney yesterday.  The Sydney has captured the collier that was supplying the Emdem with coal &amp; taking her with the crew off the Emdem on to Colombo. (Wireless received from the Orvieta)</p>
