 Messines Had a very quiet morning. Strolled down to Daylight Corner and "bagged" a horse. Rode to Dranoutre to [indecipherable] Baths. Had a good bath and got a clean change of clothes. Had lunch at Waggon lInes. "Tommo" pretty well screwed. Albert and Charlie were my companions during the visit. Saw Jamie, cleaning limbers. Fritz shelled the house at F.O.P. and the occupants drifted off.  Garfoot on L'aison
