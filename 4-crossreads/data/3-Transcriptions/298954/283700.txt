<p>Mon 25th Nov.<br/>I am ashamed to confess it, but as the "Kong Haakon" drew away from Hunland with the disconsolate 200 still seated in their 3rd class coaches, all I could spare for this dramatic leave-taking was a hasty glance through the saloon window before settling down to more Good Food.    Past the white chalk cliffs of Rugen &amp; North across the Baltic &ndash; and I snoozed in the dainty little cabin.    Lunch was plain &amp; perfect &ndash; delicious plain foods in any desired quantities.</p>
<p>A couple of unobtrusive notices warned us against overeating till our stomachs had become accustomed to Plentitude and Second Helpings.  Then I slept again &ndash; coming on dusk to find ourselves in the grey misty Cattegat approaching the entrance to Copenhagen &ndash; a destroyer (Danish) accompanying us to be "on the spot" if we bumped a mine, presumably.   In the misty sunset Copenhagen reminded me of Melbourne as seen from the river.</p>
