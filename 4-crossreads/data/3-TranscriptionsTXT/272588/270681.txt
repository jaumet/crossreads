Wednesday 27 MarchSecond anniversary of our seeing France, the town & beautiful harbour of Toulon.  Papers & information from G.H.Q. confirms the rumours of the German advance, as far as High Wood, Bernafay. Ye Gods, the papers report that a German gun is firing on Paris from a distance of 75 miles. Glorious day & very quiet on our front.A Fritz 'plane came over our lines last night & to-night & flew very low indeed & still he is O.K.
Thursday, 28 MarchWet & miserable today. News to-day of the Arras-Quentin-la Fere, battle is disconcerting & our line is now west of the old line from which we attacked in 1916.  In fact Albert is in German hands. The offensive began on 21st inst.  Fritz is shelling our vicinity with gas just now.
