Snowing when I woke up with a leaden head and a violent cold in it. Dies irae! Fairly busy on routine till noon and afterwards about all the battalion was fooled up over a band concert which made us all very annoyed. Bad staff work. After evening mess I roused up the officers about language. Stayed in all the evening. Rotten.

A fairly busy day. Dealt with many matters during the morning ? a range from fining a chap 10/- for not wearing colours to dealing with cinemas and other things. Afternoon went up to the E.F.C Officers club and then had afternoon tea at our mess. Word for 18 subalterns to leave the Bde for home. Picked them and then found several not so keen to go ? cherchez les femmes. Dined with Dr Mathys.
