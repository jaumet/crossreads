<p>objectives, La Busnic has been captured, and there have been brilliant gains, hundreds of prisoners South from here and North to the Sea. Armentieres is the first and we are advancing each side of Lille, which will compel the Germans to evacuate Lillie. This they will not do without a terrific struggle, but once they are out their hope of holding Belgium is done.<br/>[Next line is in shorthand]<br/>Throughout the day there was intense artillery activity all along this sector. During a lull we went to the front of the hill for Petrol and had a trying time coming back, we met the chaplain riding his bike back from the front, admidst it all accompanied by his batman. We left without the rations &amp; came up with some borrowed petrol. This morning a big H.E. shell exploded about a chain away from me. This last day of July will be remembered as a big battle day, on the W. front, a day that is drawing us nearer to glorious victory.<br/>This evening a signaller told me that over 3000 prisoners have been brought in. There must have been as many more killed for our bombardment was terrific. The enemy counter attacked this evening and was received with a terrific hail of shells.<br/>I am on night duty all night on account of the lights being wanted all night, and I have to pump water for the engine tank every 3 hours. I go to bed between times. My mate done it last night when the lights were wanted all night. I am writing these notes at 1.30 to night.</p>
