  
 victims to-day. My knee is alright now. 
 Sunday 11th July You should see enormous fountains of dust smoke, fragments and blocks of earth as the big guns of the Cruisers further bombarded part of the enemy's trenches. Every day we are subjected to shells & a rain of bullets. 
 Went along to Headquarters on beach to see Olly Gunderson who is now working at stores. Had a long talk. Saw one of the large shells which the Turks fired some days ago. It was 11 inches across base and the thickness of the outside to the hollow in center was 3 inches. A tremendous lump of steel. My throat is not too good. 
 Monday 12th July We bombarded the enemy's position this morning early
