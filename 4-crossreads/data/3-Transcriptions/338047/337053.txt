<p>1919<br/>May 30<br/>&amp; met Harold Brackpool at London YMCA.  We picked up Nance &amp; caught the train for Hastings at Cannon Street Station.  Harold was dressed in "civvies".  On arrival at Hastings we caught the tram to Hollington, &amp; was introduced to Nance's father &amp; mother.  They had been looking after a lot of my things while I was in France.  I was surprised to find the number of socks that  they had been keeping for me. We went for a walk along the front esplanade &ndash; or whatever they call it, &amp; saw a stranded German submarine which had broken loose when being towed to England &amp; washed up there.  Nance bought me a photo of it.</p>
<p>May 31<br/>We went to Hastings again for a walk.  We went along the "front", &amp; I noticed that the trams are propelled by three different means.  In one part the electric wires are overhead.  For a little way the same trams run by petrol motor, while along the front, the power is obtained from plugs set in the ground</p>
