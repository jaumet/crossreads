March Sunday 18 1917
Confirmation of the Fall of Bapaume. At last that great objective has been gained.

But isn't it costly? Those who have been before it know only too well. Other great advances are in progress too. The revolution in Russia came as a suprise to most. What will be the upshot?
Had to stay in all day this evening on acc. of all the patients being under observation 
Fine dry.
