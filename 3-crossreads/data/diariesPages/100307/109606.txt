Bapaume
5/4/17
Set out for La Boisselle at 6.45 and reached there by 8.45 pm the road excellent. Dismounted at Poizieres and went over and looked at the cross to our dead officers "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" What a bloody place this was. Near the big railway siding here is a big cross to the 4th Bde dead. Near La Boisselle on the road is a big Main Dressing Station Operating Centre 5th Army. Right alongside is a big bomb dump. This misuse of the Red Cross is so flagrant and prevalent () that it appears part of a definite policy. 
Stayed with Evans for a cup of tea some toast and then made back to camp. Lovely night bright moon. The hum of an aeroplane up high with a searchlight trying to find it. Later two of ours with lights sailed across. At camp received a big bundle of letters from home folk and also saw of America's entry into the war. All valises and blankets still being in Bapaume decided perforce to sleep in some old ones. Maguire had raked up and spent a night tolerably comfortable. Orders out for musketry tomorrow.
