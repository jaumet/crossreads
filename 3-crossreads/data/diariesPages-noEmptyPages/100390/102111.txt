My Dearest Mater, Pater, Stan Dora Babes
I got the pouch tobacco some few hours ago a welcome present much appreciated as an affectionate thought. Things move very slowly at present there is a heavy drag on the hours. But "Shur Shur" as the Arab says Bye Bye. "Bootha zum quies" a fine day tomorrow. I got also two papers Lane hand Table Talk this is the second L. Hand lately. Many many thanks for them all. They pass round and are eagerly read. I really think you know more of the world events than we. 
My health remains splendid in spite of the many sicknesses around. Im pretty tough after all. You would hardly have prophesied in my delicate chested youth the possibility of my roughing it in early middle age. But Ive got you Mater Pater, my dear ancestors to thank for my condition.
