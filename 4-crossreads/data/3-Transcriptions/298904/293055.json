<p>While at Giza I saw the wedding of two high class Egyptians, for weeks beforehand they had been fixing the place up, &amp; putting big Oriental carpets &amp; gaily coloured screens up round the house the road was also being lined with lamps of all shades &amp; colours at last the great day arrived or evening I might say first thing to come along was an Egyptian Brass band playing some weird &amp; unearthly tune that no one could follow, then a string of motor cars &amp; carriages with the guests, &amp; after these the bride came in a bonzer motor car we all strained our necks to get a glimpse of her but no good she</p>
