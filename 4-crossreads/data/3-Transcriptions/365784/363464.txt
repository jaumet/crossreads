<p>4.<br/>have remained at their bases, but their appeal was ignored. Colonel Barratt at Heliopolis seems to have commandeered all our Red Cross Stores &amp; Funds &ndash; why he didn't supply the transports no one seems to know. He is in Charge of the No 1 Aust General Hospital &amp; really cannot have time to attend to that &amp; the Red + Work too. Something or someone must suffer!</p>
<p>He was given &pound;500 to the YMCA at Alexandria from the Red Cross Funds but our men lack Red + stores of all sorts!</p>
<p>I have not told my husband that I am writing to you for he would say that I have no business to criticize his superior officers, but I feel that people at home ought to know how little is being done here for the actual welfare of our men.</p>
<p>Of course the local YMCA is very good, but many of the men fight shy of it. I wish you could take a run over here, but am afraid you would find the heat too trying. Miss Owen would revel in the colouring &amp; quant scenes &ndash; her clever brush would get heaps of subjects here.</p>
<p>Hoping you are well &amp; with kind regards to yourself &amp; Mt Owen</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>Irene V Read.</p>
