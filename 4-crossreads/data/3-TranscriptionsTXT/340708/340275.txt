August 1917Thursday 9thFinished up bombing early this morning & then started shelling again got very close to the Hospital at times so we are going to shift the hospital in the meantime we are drafted to various C.C.S's.   Myself & a lot of others went to Baillieul it is pretty close to the line & we are surrounded by aerodromes so we are in a dangerous place.  The hospital is part of an internal [indecipherable] Lunatic Asylum.  There are 1400 Women in it of all nationalities so there is not much fear of him shelling us.Friday 10thFritz commenced the day by by sending over a lot of stuff into the railway station & bombed all round us this evening.   We have great entertainment watching these aeroplanes as there are thousands here
