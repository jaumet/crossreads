  
 Friday 14 March 1919 Red Sea All ranks settling down, anchored off Suez to take in Water & then pushed on. The Tucker is good & the men are given all the Deck space there is.  I opened a Library & issued canvas shoes to all ranks. The men have been issued with 200 Packs of Cards, draughts, Punching Balls, Boxing Gloves & literature, & only have the general inspection once a day.
