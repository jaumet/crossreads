We were wet &amp; cold &amp; the trench was full of mud, it was impossible to sleep so we just had to shiver &amp; moan all night for the four nights that we were in and to cap the lot he put a big H.E. on our ration dump &amp; blew the lot up. We were living on biscuits with cocoa &amp; milk spread on them the last two days. On the 21st we were relieved by Tommies &amp; came back to a camp about five miles behind the line ordinarily about 2 hours walk &amp; I did not get there till 8 am. the following morning. The ground was in a terrible state, we were weak through having no sleep or [indecipherable] &amp; there was a heavy fog on &amp; we came out in batches; about a hundred yards was the stretch you could do without a spell &amp; to finish up with we got lost in the fog. Some stunt, believe "ma". Well we went back to billets &amp; stopped there for three weeks. I had a slight touch of trench-feet, but nothing to write home about. We shifted about a bit until the 24th December, Christmas Eve, when we marched to Bernafay Wood. Christmas Day we went into dug-outs at Delville Wood.</p>
