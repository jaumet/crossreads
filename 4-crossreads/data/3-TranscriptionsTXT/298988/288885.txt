June 23rd  Having glorious weather through the Meditteranean.  Have passed several ships bound for Egypt.  At 9.30 last night whilst getting along in the darkness, without lights, a searchlight was suddenly flashed on us & we were asked our name & what our flag was.  We replied & as they didn't fire at us we took it for granted that it was one of the French Cruisers that are patrolling this part of the seas.  We are not traversing the ordinary (peace time) trade route but are zig zagging in order to avoid enemy submarines, should there happen to be any about.   7.p.m. Passed Malta 8 miles off.
June 24th  Nothing of note last night, except that a couple of French Destroyers put their searchlights on us & enquired our name & flag.  7.30 a.m. Passed Pantellaria Island about 5 miles off.  This belongs to Italy.
June 28thArrived Gibraltar 7 a.m. & went ashore 9.30 a.m.  One cannot get on shore here without permission from the Admiralty.  It is a wonderful place.  From information I got I believe there are 360 big guns on Gibraltar Rock, ranging up to 12 inch.
It is a most peculiar rock, sloping on one side where all the barracks, offices etc are & being almost straight up on the other.  On looking round it which the captain & I did in a cab, it is just a net work of holes drilled in the rock, out of which guns can be fired there being just enough room for the muzzles to get through.  No outsiders are allowed inside, but I am told that it is a real hive in there where the guns can be shifted about & the garrison
