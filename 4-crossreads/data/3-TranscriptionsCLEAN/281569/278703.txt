 Slept in till all hours

Spent the day hanging about eating, eating, had a good dinner & spent the afternoon in the lounge. At four oclock had tea & then made off for the tram which we caught OK at 6.30 arriving about 7 at Kantara, had a lovely swim in the canal for about an hour then retraced our steps to the R.T.O's [Railway Transport Officer] office where we put in the night sleeping on its hard sandy floors, a bitter contrast to the sleeping apartments of only last night.
