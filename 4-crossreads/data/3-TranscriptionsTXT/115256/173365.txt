The passing of Kandeliusa lighthouse at eleven o'clock this morning was proof that we were well on our way to Lemnos - our immediate though not our ultimate destination.  A little while after, we had our practise fire turn out.  On board a troopship, according to regulations, troops must be shown their respective fire stations, and occasionally fire alarms are given to accustom the troops to a prompt and silent turn-out.  So there was nothing very extraordinary in the fire alarm being sounded.  But when everybody, crew included were ordered to put on lifebelts, things began to assume a more serious aspect.  Our course was suddenly changed and rumours of important wireless information and submarines were circulated throughout the boat.
But after an hour's expectancy of an attack, the troops were dismissed and ordered to sleep beside their life-belts.  It is just this occasional reminder which makes you realise that what you consider to be a big picnic, an elaborate tourist trip and a supendous waste of money, is really an active service affair.
