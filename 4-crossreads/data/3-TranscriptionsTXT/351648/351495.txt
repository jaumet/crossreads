It's all such a waste, & then poor Scott, he was such a fine chap so full of the joy of living & such a fine Soldier quite one of the finest of the younger men we could had, it cut me up terribly.  I used to lie in the Hospital & look round & think that we could spare any ten of them rather than him, but its all part of this bloody business of war, how I loathe it all & yet how necessary it is to keep on & on till we have won once & for all, nothing could be more tragic than the thought of a patched up peace with the impending horror of it all again in a few years.
Am too gloomy to write more now.
