order rifle all. I went under right out of sight I had some difficulty in rising for I was heavily weighted, when I came to the surface I found that my rifle was at the bottom so down I had to go after that scoop it out of the soft mud what a nice weapon it looked the Germans need not have been afraid of me if they had attacked me with a rifle like that, to my surprise the water was not the least bit cold I thought it would have been freezing but I was in a beautiful state green slimy weed's hanging all over me water running off like a wet rag. I thought my watch fountain pen was spoilt but neither of them were hurt though nearly all my papers letters were spoilt
