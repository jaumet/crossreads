 Vaulx-Vraucourt. On 20th April the Divisional was relieved including the Pioneers who were sent back to repair the road thro' Flers over which the Divisional Transport had to pass.  This was done &amp; on the afternoon of April 21st the battalion moved to the hutted camp near Bernafay Wood after exactly 6 months continuous work on the Somme in the Corps Area, most of which was at or near the front line.  During this time the battalion suffered the following casualties
