<p>May<br/>attack that night which afterwards proved a great success. It was also this night that I fired my first shot on active service. I was again detailed on the night of the 8th as one of a covering party &amp; I was placed several hundred yards from the (our) parapet &amp;  during my watch I could both see &amp; hear the enemy working outside their parapet but we were not troubled by them &amp; and after our lads had finished a good nights work we retired uninterfered with &amp; turned in. On the night of the 15th the Welsh Fusaliers gave a rifle &amp;  machine gun demonstration which lasted about twenty minutes. During the afternoon of the 19th the enemy opened out with artillery fire on our lines &amp; five casualties were sustained in our company &amp; our parapet was knocked about in places. We were relieved by the 9th Battalion about 11-30 pm &amp; we left the trenches in sections in single file &amp; had to march to our billets which were situated several miles the other side of Sailly Croix-de-Bac &amp; it was not till day break that we layed down for a few hours rest. During our stay in the trenches we experienced some very wet weather &amp; my duties for twelve days were barb wire fatigue in no mans land between the trenches of a night. One night I was on covering party &amp;  the next on wiring &amp;  were very lucky for several night's the enemies machine gun opened up on us</p>
