  
 completely smashed up & dived head first to the ground in flames I think machine gun fire caught her. A 3rd Battalion chap has just done a brave deed, he rushed over to within 50 yards of the German trenches & rescued a wounded Tommy who had been there for 5 days both got back safe. Just close to where I am there is a German gun, & thousands of rounds of ammunition, By Jove there is some stuff laying about, rifles, ammunition, wire of all descriptions, clothing, gas helmets & etc. thousands of picks & shovels, & plenty of German helmets, the ground about here for miles is just one vast mass of shell holes, there must have been millions & millions of shells shot away by both sides, & there is any amount of dead men lying about
