"Right There" 27.5.15
Dr. Vol
Over a month here & so far well.  Poor old Ted Larkin went down at the start & fell facing the enemy, right in the "forwards".  We had an armistice & buried him, with others.  I got a letter from you recently, while in the trenches, and same was appreciated.  We are having a pretty hard time though are not growling a bit.  Don't talk about coming as I think you wouldn't like it.  Hope you're still doing well.  Poor old Roy Smith got one through both knees right near me on the first day.  Only allowed to write one half page, so ta ta.  Give my regards to parents & sisters.
