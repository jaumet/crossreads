<p>Convent Wall for water &amp; while pumping, the dirty wretches nearly sniped me. I came away with half the quantity I wanted. I will try &amp; find out particulars of the Convent, which has been a very large one , all that remains are a few heaps of bricks &amp; stones - &amp; a sort of court yard but &frac14; mile square with a high brick wall some 12ft high, standing where not broken by shells, you can plainly see the remains of a beautiful gate &amp; a substantial marble arch. It is here the Germans I believe carried out their shocking outrages. Used to be the Crown Princes Headquarters.</p>
