<p>Monday 16 April</p>
<p>Short march this morning before breakfast.  This incinerator job is a very soft one allowing us practically the whole day to ourselves.  This time is spent near a good fire, reading or writing.<br/>Showery again today and very cold.<br/>No further orders are on relative to moving.</p>
