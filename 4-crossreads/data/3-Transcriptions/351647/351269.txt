<p>I just loved them &amp; you are a dear to write so often &amp; so much.  Its no good trying to say how much they are appreciated.  I see they have had rain &amp; floods in Riverina, so I hope Tog is all right now.  Congratulate Peg for me, will you, my very best wishes.</p>
<p>You engineered things beeyutifully.  I'm glad the garden is so good, old Biggs isn't bad.  Rumors are very persistent about our being home by Christmas &amp; we are all hoping it will come true but ---</p>
<p>Now I must flee.  Love to the Boss &amp; Graham (how the lad is growing) &amp; dear old Mac &amp; Mrs. Kathryn &amp; Tom Ellis also the boys &amp; all the men.  I'm glad you've forgiven Tommy &amp; hope things are all right with you &amp; the family by now.  You know (you musn't mind my saying it) all you Bettingtons are a bit hasty &amp; hot headed &amp; touchy but these little differences are only on the surface &amp; you love one another &amp; stick together O.K. underneath.  I'd just love to see you if anyone came up to you &amp; started to run Miss Hilda down real badly.  Talk about fur &amp; feathers.  Hooray my dear, much love &amp; tons of thanks &amp; gratitude.</p>
<p>From<br/>Always yours as ever<br/>James</p>
