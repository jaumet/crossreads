  
 H.M.A.S. Fantome Dec 7 - 14 
 Dear girl While I think of it - The 'Lawn King' is a very good brand of mower - Pay for it out of my Queen St Balance - It's my little present to the garden - It was hot yesterday - I put it in at Roseville with Blackwell - He's a pleasant fellow - His wife, a fine girl of just 20 & a boy are all stone deaf - Enquiries come in - none of them can hear you unless you speak very loudly - I saw a man who had just come from England - He & Lord Chelmsford & the Editor of Pearsons had all tried to get evidence of the maiming of children - hands cut off - The Editor he said offered 500  for any photo of same - nothing came of it - They never cd. get hold of anything authentic - At 11 pm I was on board the Fantome - for good - I slept in board & about 5 am got up & studied the situation - I have a good cabin - top side with lots of air - a fan - 6 drawers under my bunk & a table. At 9 am we went out for gun & speed trials - There was a beastly swell outside & dozens were seasick - There are 109 all told of us - We got off the 12 pounders - They are really 5 inch guns or thereabouts - We go by the diameter of the cartridge so that a 13.5 gun means a charge 13.5 inches in diameter - There was a flash & a roar & a hiss in the air & then a spurt of sea water a long way off -
