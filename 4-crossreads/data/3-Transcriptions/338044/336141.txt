<p>3rd Jan. Monday<br/>It is now as cold as ever I wish &amp; the dreary long night duty is most miserable. We are wrapped in Greatcoats &amp; mufflers all night long, but still feel cold &amp; also sleepy, for it is impossible to obtain a good sleep during the day, as we should then have to go without our meals.  Sleep from 4 to 4.30 am; (our &frac12; hour off)</p>
<p>4th to 7th January:-<br/>Nothing out of the usual monotonous routine of duty &amp;  sleep occurred during the week  &amp; no prospect of any removal from this miserable night duty. I never wish again to hear opinions about Egypt's not being cold</p>
