 18/10/16 . Was paid 20 Franc 's yesterday . I am enjoy the spell in this pleasant area . We exercis vigor in the ground of this chateau ; and carri out some brisk rout march . Receiv some letter and parcel . 20/10/16 . The Vote on the Conscript Referendum was taken yesterday . I do n't think the troop are keen on it . Did not get a vote . A battalion Parad ; the colonel warn us that we will see more fight befor we are much older . Have order to move off at midnight . I am sorri to leav my White Chateau , I doubt if we will ever get anoth home like it . Had a white frost this morn the first I ve seen this winter .
