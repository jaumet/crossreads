 MARCH 1917 
 30 FRIDAY 
 Fine, but had one storm of sleet 
 & rain at midday. Cleaning 
 harness all day. I rigged 
 up a stable outside & put 
 old "Lazarus" outside again. 
 saw old Mother Jesus watching 
 one of the cows calve, & as 
 soon as she calved, took 
 the calf away & washed him 
 in ice cold water & dried 
 him with straw. They dont 
 let the cow have her calf 
 here at all.
