I remember when we first came here at the end of April some of the highest peaks on the Peninsula were snow clad even as late as that, so I anticipate a fairly cold time. However, as tucker is plentiful and also clothing, we will not come to any harm.<br/>Have not heard much news of the NSW Artillery lately but hear they are coming up here from</p>
