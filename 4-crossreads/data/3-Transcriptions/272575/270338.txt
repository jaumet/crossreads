<p>Well when I landed in Egypt I was only there a few days, when I received a letter, a jolly nice letter too from this young lady &ndash; she seemed so far as I could make out from the Promenade deck to be Rather Pretty, and seemed to be a quiet Sensible young lady.   She seemed to be looking for someone, and looked as though she could not find whoever it was.   In her letter She told me that She had gone down to the boat to See her Cousin a Young Engineer, <strike>but</strike> named Jack Newlings, but his wife was there, and Monopolised him &ndash; She is employed in the Customs Department, Freemantle, what as I dont know.<br/>I wrote in answer to her letter and with the budget of letters I received a few days ago, came an answer She, was quite Surprised that I answered her letter, she also informed me that she writes to two boys from other States, one from N.S.W. &amp; one from S.A. and says she just writing to boys at the front.  I tell you that, ever, if she was surprised to receive an answer I was more surprised to receive a letter a few days after I landed in Egypt &ndash; Now Old Chap I must Ring off, as it is growing dark.   my Love to Everyone at Home  Good Luck.  from your Affec Bro Chas</p>
