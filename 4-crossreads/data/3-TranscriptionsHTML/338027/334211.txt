<p>Saturday, 17 July, 1915<br/>Uneventful day and weather is basically hot.  At night I organized a concert and the sisters and Ships officers attended.  Was a success but the crew were nervous before sisters and many did not appear when names were read out.  The sergeants provided a burlesque programme in which everybody got a hit, mostly the sisters.  Two of the latest Monitors [warships] en route to the Dardanelles before three weeks are up I expect to chronicle here the best news I have yet written in my diary.</p>
<p>Sunday, 18 July, 1915<br/>Passed a quiet day playing quoits with the sisters we had a sweepstake on the time the pilot came aboard at Alex he arrived at 5.22 it was a great race only half a minute separated two of the contestants.  We anchored in the harbour and general leave was granted I was on guard on a prisoner so could not leave the boat, there was only the guard at home.</p>
<p>There has been a further advance by the British &amp; French towards Achi Baba.  Everything points to a big battle shortly and we will be in it.</p>
