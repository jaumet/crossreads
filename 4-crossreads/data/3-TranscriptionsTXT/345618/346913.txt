Whether you be war records [indecipherable]Or in the ice-cold ocean swimming,Or killing Turks, or kissing womenIn sultry climesWe'll often fill the bumper brimming& drink Old Times.
Old chaps like us are never fit,But you can shew you've got some grit,And if by shell or bullet hitYou chance to lose a limbYou can come back & buck a bitAbout Jerusalem.
You will come back of course - but still -You probably have made your will -Unless your balance stands at nil -It seems a rum thingTo ask but in a codicilLeave the Club something!
