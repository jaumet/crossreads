<p>Liverpool Camp.<br/>Thursday Night<br/>8th July 1915.<br/>Address my letters Priv. J.L.W. A. A. M. C  Dept. Liverpool Camp</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I am writing this from the C. of England Tent in the A.M.C. Dept.  After a lot of humbugging of which I will tell you when I see you next as it is too long a tale now.  I &amp; a mate were transferred at the same time (to-day) into the motor section of the A.M.C.  Percy is a trained mechanic &amp; driver, &amp; will probably be put on a Motor Ambulance or Transport, &amp; Capt. Schlinck wants me as Motor despatch Rider.  Will give you details later.  Will probably be down on Saturday afternoon if I can get leave.  Have some more kit to bring home.  If I don't turn up, &amp; you come up next week would you please bring an empty bag to take a few things back.  As you come up to the A.M.C Dept. keep to the left &amp; our tent is in the row next to the main <strike>row</strike> road, No 8 tent from the end you come in at.  That is my present abode &amp; I don't think I'll be moved.  We have the same hours, better tucker &amp; better accommodation.  If you can't find me at above address, ask at the A.M.C Orderly Tent.<br/>This is in case I can't get leave for Saturday but I'm going to try to say Good Bye to Rid &amp; Ol.</p>
<p>[Note on side of page:]  Am keeping well.  Was inoculated on Tuesday, Walter yesterday   Arms progressing favorably.  Wal not too well to-night when I saw him.  Nasty cold &amp; sore eyes.<br/>Love to all,<br/>Leo.</p>
