  
 Sunday 1 July 1917 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.] Mail in at last letters from Mother, Day, Joe 6/5/17 & 13/8/17, Percy Smith with photo of "Spot" - I can hear the men saying - "It would do me to be walking down that little path" etc. etc. Some are pretty home sick. 
 Flies very bad - just put "insecticide" on my head to keep them off while writing. On the Mediteranean the flies really bite, these don't. 
 [The following sentence crossed through.] Glad all well at home. English mail very late, fear some has gone down in the Mediteranean. 
 We are expecting General  ALANBY  who supersedes  MURRAY . 
 [The following sentence crossed through.] The latter did not like the Australians - but thought them good common fodder.
