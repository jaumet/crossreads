  
 7.5.15 Fri. 7th.  Yesterday we packed our saddles etc. & this morning we placed them under the grand stand of the Aerodome.  I packed all my spare clothing in the signalling pannier so we should fare well for clothing at the front.  The Sqd. signallers were issued with bicycles to-day & we put the greater part of the afternoon in getting them in going order.  After tea Penny & I came to Heliopolis & put our time in writing at the American Mission.  There was boxing at the picture show last night, & again to-night, but I did not go to it.
