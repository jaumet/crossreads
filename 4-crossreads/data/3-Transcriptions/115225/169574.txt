<p>June 6<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We worked on the lorry (not too hard) all day - Went for our usual swim at noon - Jno was kept working late in the evening &amp; I went to Zita&#39;s on my pat &nbsp;We are looked upon as fixtures now, not visitors. We feel very much at home &amp; enjoy the society of a family -</p>

<p>June 7<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Worked on the lorry as usual - Jno was a bit crook &amp; we did&#39;nt go for our swim - We went to Church in the evening with Zita &amp; Marie going home with them after &amp; spent the evening there (it was a f&ecirc;te day at the Church)</p>

<p>June 8<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull morning but it turned out beautiful at noon &amp; Jno &amp; I went for a swim. Frank was on guard last night so did&#39;nt work this morning &amp; I did&#39;nt do too much either - Jno &amp; I went as usual in the evening for our french lesson (so we called it) &nbsp;We learned a useful phrase with proper prononciation every day &amp; Zita learned the English of it. a very good system &amp; it helps out, with what one picks up in conversation -</p>
<p>M<u>em</u>o &nbsp;The weather has been lovely this</p>
