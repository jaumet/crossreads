<p>Visited the 3rd Australian General Hospital at Abbeville to-day, and spent a pleasant time there. Came across a number of old pals. Bought a number of souvenirs to send to Australia for Christmas, but I could not buy much, as the price of different articles, is beyond a privates pay. A couple of dances were held during the week in the Recreation Room, &amp; everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. It was funny to see the fellows dancing together.  Splendid War news to hand on the 20th October &ndash; the whole of the Flanders coast has been evacuated, by the enemy. It is great to read of this after the Hun having these places for four years. Lille had also been captured. An impressive service was held in the Recreation Room on Sunday evening. Corporal Cosier in charge, there was a good attendance. The following evening another dance was held &amp; every one present enjoyed themselves. The Unit Orchestra (consisting of a piano, three violins, a flute &amp; a cornet) rendered good music. On Wednesday the 23rd inst. the Unit were invited to a picture show, the programme was appreciated by all, as it has been a considerable time, since any of us were present at a cinema show. Another invitation came to hand for Friday evening to Lena Ashley's Concert Party from Paris. The show as a good one. On Sunday evening another service was held in the Mess Room, Pardre Hareward, taking charge.</p>
