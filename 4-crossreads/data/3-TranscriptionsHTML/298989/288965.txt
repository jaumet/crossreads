<p>26/1/16<br/>"F's this morning and this afternoon. I am going to give them the Gs &ndash; Gout, gut aches gonorrhea"!</p>
<p>Fell in at 1400 and went out to outposts. On our right the canal and bitter lakes with several cruisers and other war vessels on the water. Dredges going constantly. The canal like a blue ribbon shining between low waves of desert sand. A luxurious patch of foliage is Ismailia. The desert hereabouts presents another variety different to any we have before seen. The sand is somewhat like that at Heliopolis and a few varieties of stunted herbage occur in places, mostly though it is just plain sand. In places are patches of small limestone flakes, almost like small tiles. One can generally retrace ones steps on a calm day as the footprints remain in the sand. A handy feature this when it is so easy to get lost. Managed to fill all mens waterbottles today by running watercarts to the pontoon bridge pump.</p>
<p>Ships whistles and quite a lot of busy noise coming from the canal. This place has hitherto been just plain desert but since this activity has become "Staging Camp". Sinai Peninsula "somewhere East of Suez where East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet".</p>
<p>Heavy rain came on while practising outposts &amp; soaked us. Major Smith returned from a look round the trenches 8 miles out. Lying in bed last night we listening to a most amusing argument between two drunks. Cronin &amp; Gascoyne of A Coy &ndash; as a rule very quiet chaps. They had a good cargo of beer bought in Ismailia. The argument was centred round "Captn f &ndash; Bean who lived at b&mdash;Shepheards for fifteen f&mdash;months" and the argument waxed furious until lights out Cronin pronouncing never times that he was not " argu f---, ---bator!" but always reverting to "Capt f&mdash; Bean". Others merry too and all round the camp in the morning was a thin pink ribbon of Japanese beer bottles.</p>
