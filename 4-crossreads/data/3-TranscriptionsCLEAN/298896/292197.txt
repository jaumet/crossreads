  
 Saturday 2nd.Nov.  News through of Turkey having surrendered, this time 'tis dinkum whilst Austria is rumoured to have done so. The dagoes have captured most of their artillery & thousands of prisoners so, they may cry enough at any moment. An ultimatum will now probably be given to Germany after which no quarter will be given. It must end soon now and finds me unable to realise the fact. Pulled out 42 Francs out of a game of PackaBo last night. Very little doing except to issue clothing. Sunday 3rd.Nov  A very quiet day. At 4.30, 10 of us went by car to Blangy about 6 miles away for a dinner & mild hopover & had a good time. There was nothing flash but with the help of Bacchus & two pianos we had a real good singsong until 9 P.M. when we set off home, two of the ten being stretcher cases. Manage to get them home safely so all ended merrily, cost was about 30 francs.
