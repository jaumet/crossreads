April 1918him & altho the odds (300-30) were heavy his casualties were heavier. He came in waves & got mown down in waves. On 11th he started shelling with 4.2 guns, the Wadi Anja & tried to get some of our batty's but beyond killing a few mules & wnding one man slightly & getting a cook in the leg & arm no damage done. We shifted a few yds in Wadi Obedia where protection better. 60 pdrs very much in evidence. Good Austn mail recd on 10th & letters from David Joe on 13th. Dave coming to Egypt next draft & Joes 10m off coast in France. Letters to Dad Mater & Molly written & others rec'd from them 3 long years & 7 long months today since I enlisted. Jordan crossed on March 24th & recrossed again on April 1st or 2nd.May 30th. Back in Wadi Hanin. April & may 1918After shifting from Wadi Anja to Wadi OBeida (cause by enemy shelling) we struck a very dusty camp L.H. & transport repeatedly passing & raising clouds of dust. About April 28, we again shifted, this time across the wadi into a patch of tees besides some old ruins. Jacko made several air raids while we were here flying overhead & very low each time. An A.A. brought up to meet him first morning when a dozen of his planes came over & the following morning about six came over & the anti played up & broke their formation. Third morning when four came over, one of his planes evidently got it. It turned round, dropped his load quietly & without attempting to go further, cleared for home, apparently hit. First indication of a raid to me was the antis shells
