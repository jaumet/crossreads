 8/9/16 Bideford , Buck Cross , Colvelli , Appledor , Northam . Took motor for Clovelli after breakfast and the patriarch old chauffeur turn out to be a red hot scorcher and tore round the mani corner of these twisti old road at a speed that made one rather apprehens at anyth get in our way . Beyond damag a dog , no other casualti result . Along hedg line lane , past wood and snug thatch farmhous and barn reminisc of Steenwerck district , through Buck Cross . Glimps of the sea occur , and mani a snatch of exquisit countrysid , until you pass the head of the Hobbi drive and glide through a particular fine lot of thatch and whitewash hous just outsid Clovelli . Walk down from here one look almost straight down hundr of green tree cover cliff to the sea below but terrac from top to bottom is the uniqu doll-hous like villag of Clovelli . The High Street turn like a corkscrew and is in cobbl step . The onli anim traffic practic is donkey . The chimney of one hous vent their smoke on a level with the garden of that abov . The street wind through at least one build and at last reach the stoni beach where are the Red Lion inn and a littl old quay . The cliff tower all round .
