Thursday 6 December 1917
Spent today on Malta. Dolly bought 2/10/- worth of Handmade Lace.  We visited the Cathedral of St. John a beautiful place & after went to the Palace where the Knights of St. John lived. I took tickets for the Opera TOSCA & returned tired out. It is no use trying to save any pennies so Boomly Busted & Co.  A Torpedoe is on view here that did not explode rather interesting under the circumstances to us.
