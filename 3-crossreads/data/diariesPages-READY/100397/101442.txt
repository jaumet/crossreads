Then I go to sleep for awhile, if I go to sleep earlier I generally wake up again later on, and then sometimes, one of the nurses on night duty brings in some hot milk for the patients who cannot sleep. I told her when she brought me the first lot, that I would keep awake every night, just to get the milk. This morning she came in at 3 oclock I was awake and, she wanted to bring me some tea but I wouldn't let her. She is such a bright jolly girl, nearly as tall as me just a little taller than my shoulder, so I call her little Sister ? She moves round the ward, as though she was never tired, but this morning when she came in I could see that she was just about tired out. They have to work hard sometimes, then for awhile when the men are nearly fit to go to a convalescent camp, they have easier times, but there is allways plenty for them to do. Life as a Hospital Nurse would not suit me. I dont think that I will be here much longer my arm is pretty well healed now, but it is stiff I cant raise it very high but that will soon wear off. then I suppose back again but it is no use worrying about that, just at present as long as I dont get much winter work over there. But I suppose it would be nearly as bad in camp here, in England ? there is a big camp over here for Australians I think somewhere. I better no say where lest the censor dissapproves if he sees.
