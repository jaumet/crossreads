<p>Committee which represents Mr. Budden's work here, but is called "The Australian Comfort Funds" now instead of "The Australian Comforts Fund".  Mr. Budden is President now instead of The Hon. &ndash; Oh bother, I forget his name &ndash; who visited on resigning in spite of Mr. Budden's very strong protest, but is Vice Pres.  Mr. Stuart Grainger has resigned the Treasuryship and Mr. Hopkins is now <strike>nominally</strike> Treasurer &amp; nominally Secretary.  He had too much work for the latter position but was asked to retain it with Mr. Goward from Aus. as Assistant and to do the actual work.<br/>The work now of course has nothing to do with Hospitals but deals with the Camps and men at the Front.  The Canteens are doing a splendid work here and so many women are engaged and busy at these places.  The A.C.F. advances money to start any who apply.  Some have started without assistance from us.  They quickly become self supporting in most cases, &amp; the money is paid back for further use.  Of course the loan is really nominal so that in case of a sudden move and the thing having made no profit the workers are under no obligation to pay back</p>
