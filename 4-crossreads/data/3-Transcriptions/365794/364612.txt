<p>Monday 29 July 1917 [1918]<br/>Yesterday was anniversary of Kath's birthday 16 years ago &amp; yet it is all so vivid it might have been yesterday.<br/>Went 27th 5 p.m., all pleased to see me.  Miss Gemmel on duty after 8 days at P. Said.<br/>How I love my own room again all to myself! even if the kitchen noises are deafening, gum leaves rustle out through the window &amp; stray falling leaves drift onto my bed.</p>
