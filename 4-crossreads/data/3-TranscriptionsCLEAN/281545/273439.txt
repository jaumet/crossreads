My Mate & myself played cards in our Hut on Sunday 14/4/18 & after having Supper turned in at 10 Pm & were both sound asleep when the Call Boy came in at 12.50 am & called us up & told us to pack our kits as we were off somewhere.   We were not long getting dressed & packing up, we soon found the Camp astir, there were 60 all told under Transfer made up of 20 Drivers, 20 Fireman & 20 Guards, we were called on parade & inspected by the O.C. who spoke a few words & then we were ordered to put our kits into two Trucks & went to the Cook house for an early Breakfast & at 8.15 am we started away, we kept going for an 1/2 hour then arrived in the Mont De Cats Yard, where our engine left us & our two trucks were coupled on to a Train & soon was off again arriving at St Omer after numerous stops.   An Imperial Officer met us & wanted the two trucks taken off the Train but was refused, & as we had orders to remain in the Trucks we did not stir.   There were two long trains of covered in Vans loaded up with French Refugee's all clearing out, they all mostly came from Hazebruick.   I could not help feeling sorry for the people.   The trucks had Furniture packed in each end & one, two & 3 families were in the middle, one couple told me that they had been in the Truck for 24 hours & only travelled 14 miles.   We stopped at St Omer for a while & off we went to our disgust, anyhow
