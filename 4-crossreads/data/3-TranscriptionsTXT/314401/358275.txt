 sensation. I go on again tomorrow morning at four till eight. This afternoon I tho't something was at hand &amp; I was at my post in the fore transmitting station ready &amp; keen. But it was only a cargo steamer which was able to give a good account of herself. So on we went. The officers have no chance of sleeping in their  beds now; they are in the turrets all night and must snatch what sleep they can. I actually fell asleep for half an hour today over the coding table. We know nothing of the outside world at all, except that England has declared war. What weeping &amp; bitter sorrow must come. Yet strange to say I cannot help feeling proud that I am in it.

I did this at a point 80 miles north of Whitsunday passage, which you can easily find on the map. 
 8/8/14 It is now Saturday morning and six a.m. I have been on watch since four, and as things are quiet, I am making myself happy by writing to you. We are now about 1500 miles north of Sydney, and daily drawing nearer the enemy. What a lesson this is in organization &amp; discipline! It is at most worth the risk of fighting just to see how men can be welded into a single unit. There are 960 men on board &amp; it is arranged that
