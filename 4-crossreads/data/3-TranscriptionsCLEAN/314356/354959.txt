  
 December 26 One disappointing episode - Hardy arrived, self-invited, with the General.  He'd made up his mind for a programme, and he beat us.  In the early afternoon he offered two bottles of whisky - and we refused.  So he joined the General's party - issuing instructions through Q to Richards to call on him at 6.45 when they would meet the General together. 
 The G.O.C. [General Officer Commanding] was great - absolutely genuine and without "Bulleeh" [?].  Later Geoff blew in and confirmed his popularity.  George, half screwed, wailed on him. 
 Altogether a bon night. 
 December 26 Last night I watched Racy:  and later - after a dozen exquisite punches - I tackled him. 
 Once at Courcellette, Arthur, of the Amb. and I (drunk perhaps) yarned of the difficulty of obtaining good models:  he told of a dozen "seduction" experiences - of girls - and men - suddenly asked to pose.  Morality outraged.  Yet, the whole concern is so rotten, that I asked Racy if he would remember my asking:  both of us were half over, but even then he - by the very request - thought I was quite over.  Then he promised.
