  
 them away to work in another part of the island, & bringing them back at night.  In afternoon we had a sudden storm, with the largest hail I have ever seen. 
 25th Same as yesterday.  Tired & sick. 
 26th Had a day's rest.  Went out in a sailing boat to the flagship of the fleet, H.M.S. Exmouth.  Had a good look round among the guns, etc.  They have a lovely string band on board, and it sounded lovely after the rough time we have had.  Got sea-sick coming back in a naval pinnace, & a soaking in the rain to boot.  Had tea with Jack Pettit in bakehouse. 
 No work for the Turks to-day as our Friday is their Sunday. 
 Tried to return to the peninsula, but the M.O. wouldn't let me. 
 27th Went out on H.M.S. Bacchante a 4 funnelled warship. 
 28th M.O. agreed to let me go back again to-morrow, going first to Mudros for M.E.
