<p>Somewhere in France<br/>12.6.16</p>
<p>Dearest Mother,</p>
<p>We are here at last, though have not had our fling yet. That's coming very<br/> soon though. We have had a most interesting and varied trip since we left Egypt, and even though it was a bit monotonous sometimes, I wouldn't have missed it for worlds. Were lucky enough to have a very smooth &amp; uneventful voyage in the Mediterranean Sea and never even sighted a "tin fish" though of course we always had plenty of  guards on the lookout and all sorts of precautions were taken in case one was sighted. Everywhere we went on board we had to wear our life belts, even at meals, and very cumbersome &amp; uncomfortable they were. But it was for our own good and though everyone growled &ndash; naturally! &ndash; at having to cart these things about &ndash; we all wore them continually.</p>
