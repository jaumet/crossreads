 received such treatment as was dealt out to it on this occasion. 
 One is constantly reminded of the last Franco / German war for 
 each village found about has a memorial somewhere within its 
 boundaries erected to the memory of its contribution of soldiers 
 who fell about Bapaume mostly during the first week of January 1871 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is rather an important town, as roads and railways 
 radiate out in several directions forming a new connecting link 
 with out forces in the North and South.&nbsp; The scene on the Main 
 Albert - Bapaume road immediately after the occupation of the last 
 named town was a remarkable one.&nbsp; The traffic was immense.&nbsp; Guns, 
 ammunition, transport of all descriptions, cavalry, foot troops,

 of miles the Boche had blown a huge crater in the road measuring 
 about 50 feet in diameter and abour 30 / 40 feet deep.&nbsp; To look 
 at one of these holes at first one would think that about 50 men 
 could fill it up in a day, but after a day&#39;s hard work the hole 
 appears as big as ever.&nbsp; It was found to be much quicker to build 
 a road round each side of these craters (cutting down the banks 
 where necessary) than to block traffic whilst they were being 
 filled xxx in.&nbsp; In one place a huge caterpillar dragging a 
 howitzer blocked the traffic badly by falling into a trap left by 
 Fritz.&nbsp; Whilst the frost was on he had driven a tunnel under the 
 road about four feet below the surface knowing that when the thaw 
 set in, the first heavy vehicle passing over would dislodge the 
 earth and fall in.&nbsp; The caterpillar fell in all right and in 
 doing so swung half way across the road.&nbsp; The next heavy vehicle, 
 coming in the opposite direction in order to avoid the cater- 
 pillar edged well over to the side of the road and there fell
