<p>the searchlights were playing in the air overhead trying to locate the Hun Machines. The machine Guns &amp; Archies kept banging away at random I think. But it was no use. "Crash" Crash" Crash" they came. I could hear the swish of the last one as it was falling just behind the Train. That was our last narrow escape. We reached Boulogne &#64; 4.0AM. . It is now 11.30AM and the 5.0AM for Calais has not arrived yet. I took the liberty of Boarding a leave special that left Boulogne at about 3.30P.M. and came to Steenwerck myself, at Hazebrouck the M.Ps made me get off &amp; get into another but as soon as they left I climbed in again &amp; sat down with a prisoners guard the M.P.s thought I belonged to the Gaurd &amp; I got through O.K. The Railway Traffic is rather disorganised owing to Fritzs rapid advance on Amiens.</p>
<p>Thursday 28.3.18  Some of our mob who were in Bailleul came in today. Fritz made it too hot for them. He is coming through like a house afire on the Somme. The latest report is that he has got Dernancourt.</p>
<p>Bell (Will Stewart's friend) got his head blown off by a Bomb at Bailleul the other night.</p>
<p>Friday 29/8  All the French Boys about here over the age of 16 have   <strike>to go</strike> been called up. I believe they go on munitions or reserve line work. Things must be very serious alright.</p>
<p>Saturday 30/3  Very quiet today. There</p>
