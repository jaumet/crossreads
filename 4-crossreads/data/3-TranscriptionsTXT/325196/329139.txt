12-3-16Sun 12thOur tents were brough from Minia station this morning & erected this afternoon; Reid & I have a tent to ourselves with the telephone by the tent pole, we are having a particularly easy time as we can move about anywhere within hearing of the telephone bell & come back to it when it rings, we go to bed anytime we wish & trust to the phone waking us;
Today has been lovely neither too hot or too cold, & the spot we camped on would be considered a perfect place for a picnic at home & it is a holiday in reality for me, One troop has to go out every night on patrol. Also a troop during the day so with the guards & horse piquets fatigue & patrols , the ordinary troopers have a fair amount of work to do
