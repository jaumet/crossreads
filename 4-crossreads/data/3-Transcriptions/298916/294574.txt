<p>The Voyage<br/>A registered letter from the P.M.G. stating that "Under the Powers set forth" etc etc, all amateur Wireless Stations must be dismantled, on account of England's declaration of war on Germany, the instruments carefully packed &amp; sent to the district Post Office, until such time as Peace was declared. So my anticipation of following the warships around the coast was doomed, so within the 24 hours granted, my station was handed over to the Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p>It was Thursday evening 21/8/15 I was doing the 3.11 shift in Burwood Substation.<br/>[Transcribers' note: this date should be 21/8/14?]<br/>I had just finished tea and was glancing through the Sun when the word "Wireless" caught my eye. It was an advertisement:-<br/>Wireless Operators Wanted<br/>Troopship Class now forming. Free course of Instruction.<br/>For the Naval Secretary<br/>The Marconi Coy.</p>
