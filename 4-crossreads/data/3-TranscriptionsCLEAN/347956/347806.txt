 that General Sir Byrd-Wood was to be over us in Egypt & that we would bring the forces around Cairo up to about 45,000 men.  We arrived at Alexandria at 9.30 this morning & found the new Zealanders here at the quay.  the Hororota & Omrah are also here at anchor.  we put the morning in getting horse rugs, blankets etc ready to send ashore also all our kits are packed on deck ready to land; 
 Stan & I received two letters apiece from Jessie & they were very acceptable (even though they made me feel a bit homesick for an hour or two) being the first mail we have received since we left Australia; as soon as we dropped anchor here, native boats came out selling oranges 15 for 1/-, also cigarettes are very cheap, we get a box of cigarettes here for 3d & the same cost 1/- in Sydney.  I bought 10 oranges for 6d
