however in the end we had quite a long yarn & parted best of friends, after this 2 other chaps & I went for a stroll down town to get away from them for a while & get cooled down a bit.
23rd. Rained heavily last night & it is still going strong it will do the world of good for it has been a terribly hot the last few days, a rotten heat so moist. We are all expecting to go Convalescent any day now for the majority of the boys are pretty right & feeling fit.
23rd. Out again this afternoon in spite of the rain which was falling fast but it cleared up nicely by 3 oclock when I met Grace & to put the afternoon in we went to the Pictures in New St. they were very good after this to a restaurant & then I took her home.
Went & had a look at my films
