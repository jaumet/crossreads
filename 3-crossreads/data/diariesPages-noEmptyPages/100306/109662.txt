15/1/17 Firing Line. Ginchy 
feet. Little Jimmy O?Connor half witted and 16 years old was crying with shell fright and the doctor sent him off. Pitch dark at 5.30 and quite impossible to see hand before face then. Rations commenced arriving on pack horses and our old bushmen prove invaluable in finding their way in these places where no landmarks are and through an intense darkness. Evans came in. Our machine guns commenced a programme of indirect fire and some shelling was arranged for midnight as relief was expected but no indications were seen and no results obtained. Snipers and patrols out as usual. But beyond usual coughing talking heard they did nothing of interest. Two cases have occurred lately of sheer collapse from physical exhaustion. Men just drop right down suddenly in middle of a job "spent". Great hearts. Outlook from here at night shows a dull plain line against skyline, part firing line part No Mans Land, with flares going up from it. Not a tree in sight just one undulating plain with here and there a sunken road filthy debris strewn, once a pleasant French country lane. Bed 7.30 pm.
