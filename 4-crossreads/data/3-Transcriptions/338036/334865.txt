<p>[20th Jan. contd]<br/>I made a bit of a fire with furniture &amp; making some water hot fixed up the pump which had frozen.</p>
<p>Sunday 21st<br/>Water carrying &amp; some heavy work.  At 5 pm I went on Gas picket (watching for gas attacks) but my shift did not start until 3 next a m so had some sleep in the meantime.  On sentry from 3 to 7 am &amp; very cold.  A "stiff un" was brought up for Harry the grave digger just before my shift commenced.</p>
<p>Monday 22nd<br/>After breakfast slept until midday  Then pack up blanket etc and off up trenches to Reg Aid Post.  No sooner had we arrived there than two cases came along &amp; later two more.  The trench duckboards are terribly hard to walk on as they have a thick coating of ice of a weeks duration.  Therefore we preferred the roadway for taking our patients notwithstanding orders to the contrary.<br/>Things went well until night time.  Jack Arkins [John O'Connor Arkins] &amp; I were resting on the roadway near Suicide Corner when up went a  <strike>searchlight</strike> star shell &amp; after a few seconds bang bang bang &amp; then a whizz ------  We didnt wait for more but Jack was down on his face &amp; I made headlong for the gutter</p>
