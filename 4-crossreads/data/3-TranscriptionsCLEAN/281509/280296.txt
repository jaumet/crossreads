1916 March 14Tuesday
A little more work & a lot of leisure. Nothing of import. Oh yes though. Receive wire from Stan telling of his arrival in Sydney with Harry & Alice and Ted to see me off. Of course our day of sailing has been postponed till next Tues. Go down to Hewletts & meet them. Have dental leave till tomorrow night.
