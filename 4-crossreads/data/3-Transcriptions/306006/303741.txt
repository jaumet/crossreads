<p>17-2-17<br/>why the 2nd in Command of this Regt was detailed to go in charge of 5 men &amp; take a trench which left the Regt without a Commander in the event of Granville being hit, the C.O. replied that he sent Major Irwin to C Sqdn with a message &amp; gave him no orders to attack; Major Smith said Major Irwin collected 5 C Sqdn men without consulting him &amp; rushed the trench &amp; took it. &amp; it now appears that Irwin will get into trouble for doing work that should have been left to a troop leader; Major Irwin jumped into the trench first &amp; as he did so a Turkish Officer wounded him through the shoulder with a revolver bullet, Irwin shot the Officer dead &amp; 11 Turks all that were left surrendered We have started the Sergeants mess going &amp; it was opened today</p>
