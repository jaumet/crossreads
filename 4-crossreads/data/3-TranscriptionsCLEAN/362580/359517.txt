  
 Norman & George could have got off because I could have easily got them invited. 
 Thursday afternoon Dorothy, Esther Hart, & I went into Cairo with young Leslie Peel, so we did a trip to Geizia Gardens then left Esther & Dorothy and we had dinner in Cairo.  Went to a very nice restaurant (which we often frequent) and had a good dinner, with some beautiful music. 
 To-night I was too tired to go out and wanted to write some long letters; the room is quiet, by myself & such an opportunity to have them posted without censoring.  Had a glorious afternoon.  Great hospital sports at The Sporting Club, so everyone who was off-duty was there.  I entered the donkey-race and came forth - my little Donk. made a bad start, anyhow we did enjoy the fun.  The Palace won nearly all the prizes - our boys were all is good form, so we are very delighted.  Major McLean
