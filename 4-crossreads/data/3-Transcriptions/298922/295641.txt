<p>Saturday 8 December 1917</p>
<p><u>Malta</u> still. We visited the underground vaults of grain &amp; forage 7 years supply as Malta has little good <u>soil</u> in fact years ago every ship had to buy a certain amount of <u>soil</u> as Harbour dues.</p>
<p>Then we went to St. Paul's Cathedral in the old Capital 8 miles by rail. Cette Vecchia or NOTABILE or MEDINA according to the Arab reign or Spain. The Paintings &amp; Marble Statuary etc. is beyond anything I have ever seen. Not least interesting was one of the Silver Crosses of the Crusaders brought from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Outside the Children were making the Malta lace, with PINS &amp; wooden bobbins, a quaint country of BELLS, SMELLS, &amp; YELLS. Many Churches &amp; much cruelty to animals. <strike>Went Opera again Rigoletto.</strike></p>
