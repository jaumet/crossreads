  
 Gallipoli 7th Nov 1915 
 My dear Father, 
 This writing tablet is the biggest inducement to write, I have yet had; because even though I have nothing to say, I don't have to fill several pages in saying it. Today I left the old dug-out, which I had come to look on as my new home, & have taken up my quarters some mile or so away from it. Yesterday I was posted to "A" Coy as second in command, & this morning was ordered, the company commander being incapacitated, to take the company to a new position, & so here I am in solitary state, with no senior officers to criticise  how  my way of doing things. The remainder of the battalion will probably join me in a day or two. My new home is very comfortable, already being furnished with table, bed & pigeon holes. On the table are cigarettes, pipes, tobacco, matches, one lighted candle, writing blocks, magazines, Barrack Room Ballads & the Golden Treasury, & the day out itself is fairly 'oozing out smoke. I was sorry to be separated from Walter who has gone to "C" Coy but is not yet back to duty. In case I don't get another chance to write before Christmas mail closes, I wish all a very happy Christmas & tell mother not to worry about me because I'm going to have the happies Christmas I've ever spent. 
 Your Affectionate son  Arthur
