To date they have done wonders, their bravery is unquestioned & their initiative & grim determination unsurpassed, but our small force is only holding a very small portion of the whole front & should we fail to reinforce our men, this little bit of the line, Australia's proud position at the front, will be defended by other Britishers & our volunteers at the Front will be absorbed  in other  as reinforcements in other Imperial regiments.  We must remember that  our loss is not the number of men we send away but the number of men who never return.
