<p>We have just had news of the Naval Battle in the     Carregat, but not many details as the news came by wireless. We do not seem to have come out of it too well but according to the report seem to have been greatly outnumbered &ndash; However I think the old Bull-dog has a bite left in him yet.</p>
<p>Hope to be able to send my impressions of France shortly &ndash; wish I had taken more trouble to learn the lingo but I suppose one wont have much difficulty.</p>
<p>Saw McBudden &amp; Jack Fell lately. McBudden is sending you a photo of me dishing out Comforts Funds Stores to some of our lads at Tel-el-Kebir</p>
