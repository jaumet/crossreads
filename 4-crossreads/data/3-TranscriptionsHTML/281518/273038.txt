<p>19/8/16<br/>Left early for Victoria and from there walked to houses of Parliament. Went all over Lords and Commons, the beautiful work in their interiors (done 70 years ago) shows that our artists in wood and stone can do work thyat compares favourably with those of past ages. The Lords is a gilded chamber and brighter than the Commons. Noted the Thrones &amp; Woolsack. Westminster Hall is under repair but the great roof could be plainly seen. To St. Margaret's Church in front of the Abbey a lovely old place full of stained glass &amp; dating 800 years back. To the Guildhall and sat in the Lord Mayors chair in the Council Chamber Saw the standard weights and the measures on the floor. More exquisite stained glass and carved wood work. Saw Gog &amp; Magog. To Trocadero for lunch and after a promenade round the streets went to the Abbey and sat there for a while. Then to St Edmunds Chapel and the Cloisters. The beautiful windows and tracery of wood &amp; stone have a great edifying effect on one. Home per bus.</p>
