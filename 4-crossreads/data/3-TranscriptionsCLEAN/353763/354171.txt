  
 The French war ship - Montcalm  lies close to us - guns out  -  By the way she put up an A1 signal this morng which I think any lady might copy & some with great advantage - town or country  -  It is usual for Captains to call on the Admiral  -   The Frenchman obviated all this by this signal  -  "All visits & the return calls will be taken as paid  -   already carried out " What a grand signal!!! You run it up & there you are - free & quiet  -  Did I mention prizes? Two were alongside of us till yesterday - SS Sumatra & the Madang  -  The S.S. Sumatra was a German trader with lager beer, provisions & stores  -  Mossy Lambton was sent off to her & report says he scooped 1200 bottles of Lager for the thirsty Berrima - then another chap came & scooped her coal & now she is being fitted up with a 12 pounder gun & is to be a sort of guard ship  -  Our chief officer - Elms is to be 2nd in command & we drank his health & wished him luck  & if they want a medico I'm first on the list  -  They're going to look up the coast line for AE1 Germans & what not  - 
 The Madang is a cranky small steamer
