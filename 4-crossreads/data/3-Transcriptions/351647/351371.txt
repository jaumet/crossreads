<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>I missed last mail, I'm sorry &amp; I hope you weren't feeling too vexed, it seems ages since I wrote a decent letter to you but <strike>really</strike> its really very hard here to write.  I'm going hard from getting up to going to bed &amp; the latter is anything from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m.  Interruptions are the rule and at times young Strath Playfair (who is Adjutant here &amp; my Boss) is very trying.  You can imagine how at times I just ache to pick him up &amp; spank him.  He's an amusing youth, do you</p>
