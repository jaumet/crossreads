 Sun.Mar.30th Another glorious day. Received parcel no 2 from B.E. &amp; Nell containing a delicious Home made cake which the crowd at my table greatly enjoyed. The Tinned Fruit &amp; cream we had for supper. Gilbert &amp; I start the day in the surf. It was glorious I had a good Sun Bake. It was my turn to get the morning coffee. Next Sunday I hope to have the extreme pleasure of taking morning Tea in to B.E. The time is passing by quite pleasantly, but the sooner Wed. comes round the better. After Dinner we were marched down to some buildings near the main Quarantine &amp; went thro' this [indecipherable]. We went for a swim afterwards. I write to B.E. also Mother &amp; Nell. Monday. Mar.31st  Another month gone only one more Day to go &amp; then my dream will come true &amp; I shall  see  B.E. &amp; the wonderful Boy. I was very disappointed at not getting any Letter from B.E. today. Thought she would surely write to me on Sunday, but then of course, she may have been  too  busy. I wrote to B.E. during the Day. The sun was very hot &amp; it made me quite sore. The Y.M.C.A. erected a Picture outfit &amp; we had quite a good open air Picture Show at night. I'm hoping to get a Letter from B.E. tomorrow to know how she got on about the Cottage. Hislop, one of the chaps at my table lent me his Camera &amp; I took a number of snaps. Hope they turn out alright, as they will be interesting souvenirs.
