  
 The beach is about 3 miles from here & occasionally we ride over for a swim. The horses have all been graded A, B & C class & we expect to lose them. A & B class are to be kept. C class we understand are to be shot. There is plenty of leave kicking about &  next week  tomorrow I am spending a week in Cairo Tuesday Jan 21 Going on leave to night by the 5pm train. I expect it will be my last leave in Egypt for we will shortly be going home.
