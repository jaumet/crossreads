  
 [Friday 25 February 1916] 
 Went 6 miles up stream in a Royal Engineers pontoons tied behind a Felucca-  Shot one plover & 2 ducks- floated back with current - took our Doctor & quite enjoyed the day- Letters from Mother Aunt Louie  Mrs Cotton & Papers Jany 8 from Mother & of course I always hear from  Brooklands it is a treat to get news that all's well & to see an Australasian- Mails seem to be better now but the men from ANZAC have so far got no Billies- Thank Mrs Wilkinson for thinking of me but nothing arrived from her.
