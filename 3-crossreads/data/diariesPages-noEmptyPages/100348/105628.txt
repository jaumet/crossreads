16/10/16.
A stiff march today, about 20 miles. All the way we passed through charming scenery. If Picardy is is pretty in the Summer time; this Department-de-Calais is beautiful in the Autumn. Marched though the large village of Watten. Passed another large castle; much older than the one I saw yesterday; a real old Norman stronghold. Three companies, and all the officers are billeted in a big chateau here. It is a fine place; was the property of an enemy subject; and it has been seized by the French Government. Picked big, luscious, blackberries this evening. The signs say that we will rest here a day or two. We have hustled over 50 miles during the past three days wherefore the hurry I wonder?
