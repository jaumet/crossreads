<p>Thursday 21 March<br/>Beautiful day.  Last night Fritz drenched the front with gas again &amp; many cases are coming through, also wounded. Fritz is still continuing his shelling the back areas &amp; to-day I went to the M.D.S. at Kemmel just in time to see eight H.V. shells land in the camp grounds.  In fact he has been shelling Kemmel vigorously, always in the Hospital grounds &amp; our people are evacuating it to-day.  The back store has been blown up for a second time.</p>
<p>Friday 22 March<br/>Very quiet day at A.D.S., practically no shelling.<br/>Rumour is to hand that the German offensive has commenced &amp; they have attacked the British &amp; French fronts on many mile fronts. It is said that the French have repulsed all attacks but that Bullecourt, Lagnicourt &amp; Havrincourt have been taken from the British. Whether these rumours are correct I cannot say.</p>
