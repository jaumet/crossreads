<p>July 29, 30<br/>Night, a sullen day of haze and stillness ended:  working on M.G. Dispositions.</p>
<p>July 30<br/>288.<br/>Today has been like the last day of the term at school:  mid-morning brought word of an early move, and the order to cut down for <strike>mobile</strike> transporting.</p>
<p>A hot sun-haze day.</p>
<p>From T.B.C. a sketch book:  tonight with it to Hondeghem but nothing done.</p>
<p>At the Farmhouse yarning to some of the Gordons:  they tell of a second Etarples "M.P." stunt, at Calais.</p>
<p>Tom last night told the tale of our stunt at Hondeg., two months back.  Kilts, bare knees, Aussy hats, dust and stoush.</p>
<p>An Aussy sights the A.P.M.,<br/>"Have you seen the new star?"   A swing and a mark, "&mdash;well sort it out of those!"</p>
<p>Merris circled again last night by the 10th and a baging of prisoners and material, 4 officers, 165 O.R., 10 ps.  From the noise of the guns, a counter attack.</p>
<p>July 31<br/>289.<br/>After all our swimming the pool's kept its cleanness:  today the Jocks newly arrived discovered it, and tonight, no swimming.  A hundred paddlers and splashers have churned it to muddiness and tangled weeds.</p>
<p>In the afternoon they kept a long unending stream to its banks and from it, and stripped of their kilts they lost their apparent beauty of build.  With kilts well girt and beribboned hose-tops, and tanned knees and faces, they are good to see:  but in the sun stripped of their uniforms their beauty is gone.  And naked, they are even more modest than the posing Venus de Milo, one wore full bathing costume.</p>
<p>Tonight to H.:  an hour yarning to two S.A.s:  they in clink awaiting D.C.M., for desertion.  One, in his short kilt knickers and loose open shirt, a lad of fine black haired bronze, and full of splendid movement.</p>
