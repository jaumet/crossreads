<p>Perhaps the residents hereabouts had approached the military authorities, with a request that the soldiers be &quot;ordered&quot; to bathe here, thereby causing some movement in the water and thus relieving the somewhat over-charged atmosphere, as it were.&nbsp; That I could quite understand, but why rifles and ammunition?&nbsp; Ah well!&nbsp; I suppose I am over full and cannot &quot;fathom&quot; the mysteries of military genius.&nbsp; Now had we been ordered to wear gas masks during these swims, it would have been more to the point, more sensible, - but not, certainly not - military.</p>
<p>Physical jerks and all kinds of drill were carried on in this camp as it was also the place where reinforcements were finally drafted to their correct battalions.&nbsp; Met quite a number of fellows who had left Aussie since my departure from it&#39;s peaceful shores, thinking then that the &quot;job&quot; would be over before my arrival.&nbsp; The end seemed further away than ever, now.&nbsp; Things were daily becoming more exciting in the air too.</p>
<p>About a couple of hundred yards from the camp was our canteen or rather a canteen belonging to one of the &quot;Tommie&quot; regiments camped in the locality, which we were allowed to use.&nbsp; It was situated at the side of a very narrow road, which did not allow of the passing of two vehicles at one time.</p>
<p>One day a lorrie was unloading at this canteen when a &quot;staff car&quot; approached and could not pass.&nbsp; The car contained a &quot;staff&quot;captain, who called to the driver of the lorrie to remove same and allow him to pass.&nbsp; The &quot;command&quot; was given in such a tone as to make everyone turn and look at the occupant of the car.&nbsp; It seemed so unnesessary for the huge lorrie to have to move, when the &quot;staff officer&quot; could so easily have got out of his car and walked the short distance to the camp.&nbsp; However the lorrie had to move, and the &quot;staff&quot; car went along with it&#39;s irate staff officer.&nbsp; I formed my opinion of the said officer, and it coincided absolutely with the loudly expressed opinions of those who witnessed [d added by hand) the incident.&nbsp; The opinion was at once unanimous and popular, and was expressed in two words only, a very expressive &quot;adjective&quot; and a decided &quot;noun&quot;.&nbsp; I think those are the correct school terms for the words.</p>
