<p>morning. On the 11th August I walked about London, it is a most marvelleous city, I had no idea it was so beautiful. The streets are beautifully clean &amp; of course no trams to spoil the look of the place, plenty of motor buses, a ride on top of these buses is very enjoyable.  It was quite a treat to be amongst an English speaking people again. Who should I meet in Trafalgar Square but Syd. Sparkes, the poor fellow has had a lot of trouble as you know. I also cam across Will MacDonald who was wounded whilst in the Line with me last May, we had a good old yarn, he is looking quite well again. In the afternoon I joined a party from the War Chest Club to tour about London. We travelled in motor buses, had a guide with us, &amp; of course he explained everything to us as we went along. Visited Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, the Guildhall, Hyde Park, Rotton Row, The Serpentine Lakes, &amp; the famous Dogs Cemetery. The Abbey &amp; House of Parliament was most interesting, as you know these historic old buildings are hundreds of years old. This London is some city I can assure you. In the evening I went with a party to the Coliseum. The biggest theatre in London, &amp; the largest I have been in, the stage alone is almost as big as Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney. On the way</p>
