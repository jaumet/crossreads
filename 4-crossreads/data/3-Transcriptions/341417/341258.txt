<p>I arrived back in Egypt on 2-1-16 after showing a clean pair of, [dash] propellers to a German submarine on the run across. It was probably the one that sank the "Persia".</p>
<p>We were put into a train at the wharf &amp; until a few days ago were on the move from one place to another.</p>
<p>Travelling with a light outfit &amp; once or twice getting seperated from my blankets I decided that there's no place like Anzac for settling one's differences, after all.</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing like the same danger here from "fireworks" although we had one Army Service Corps officer killed (Sth Australian) &amp; a couple of men as well, by the Senoussi. They are brave but ill-equipped for modern fighting.</p>
<p>At present I am in the Suez Canal locality and, along with another Australian Officer &amp; a few men, we are the only "Kangaroos" in this camp. All the remainder are English troops, but a week ago I was with Australians. I met Dr Marolli twice, he was M.O. to the [dash]th Batt.</p>
<p>[Captain, later Major, Giuseppe Enzo Marolli had come to Australia in 1906 and settled in Newcastle NSW, where he had a medical practice in Denison Street, Hamilton. He embarked from Sydney on 9 November 1915 on HMAT A72 Beltana as Medical Officer with the 3oth Infantry Battalion.]</p>
