<p>My dearest Mother  &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>Of course I'm feeling disappointed at not haring from you for so long. Dorothy received a letter from Belle a couple of days ago dated April 10th or something near that. Well, the last I got was dated March 25th &ndash; Suppose mine have gone to Miss Conyers   &amp;  she has not had time to forward them, that is why I've given above address.</p>
