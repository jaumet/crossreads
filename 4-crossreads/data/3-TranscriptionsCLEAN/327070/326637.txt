Early morning parade is from 7 till 8.30 & seemed rather long: we get a cup of tea, but the men get nothing before their breakfast at 8.30. forenoon parade is from 9.45 till 12.30 & the afternoon on from 2 till 4.30.
The morning was dull with a light sprinkle of rain: we were inspected on the forenoon parade by Brigadier General Spencer Brown commanding the brigade, this taking all the morning. After lunch a smart shower of rain fell & as we were about to fall in the "no parade" sounded, so that we had the afternoon off. The rain came thro the thatch (?) roof of the huts in all directions & the men had to rig up their waterproof sheets to keep the rain off their gear, for there was a steady fall during the afternoon.
Just before dinner Lloyd Jones came along: he was about to leave with another detachment for Tel el Kebir, a further batch from our battalion also leaving very early the next morning. Another lecture by the adjutant at night.
Wednesday 16 February 1916
A bright clear day but rather cool: I found the breeze cold at times. Our Company was for duty & had to supply guard & all duties & fatigues so that there were no men for parade & I spent the day in chasing round looking after fatigue parties, & in writing.
