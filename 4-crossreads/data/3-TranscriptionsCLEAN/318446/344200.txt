  
 So far as I can find out the only damage done was four horses killed & five or six men wounded. 
 Jan. 4th The weather nowadays can be only described as positively fiendish.  Last night I was on picket;  from 10 to midnight - my first shift the moon was shining amidst light feathery clouds looking most hopeful.  At 4.30 a.m., when I next resumed it was pitch black & raining in a steady downpour.  Most depressing. The wadi is now running pretty freely between us & El Arish.  Another stunt is hatching - originally for tomorrow - but I believe there has been a train accident & our rations & fodder have I believe come to grief owing to the railway bank having slipped somewhere so I don't think we shall go out tomorrow.
