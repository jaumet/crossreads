  
 21. Thursday Fog again. Arose to cold miserable house. Glad to get to office. Another trivial pottering day. Nelson S. came after 11 & kept me up to let him in. Thereby little more chill but powerful cough mix. Kept me quiet. 
 22. Friday Grey day again but not quite such dense twilight. Got up & got N's breakfast. Ethel appeared with news of her father's death. 
 23. Saturday Lunch with Fay B. Judge Mackarness [?], R Dalton & Mark. Then at Albermarle. Sun pierced the fog at lunch time for a little while. Got home at 5.30 & made black velveteen tam.
