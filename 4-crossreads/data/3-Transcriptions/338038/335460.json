<p>[Letter to Garling's father]<br/>enclosed - leaf from sprig I placed on the grave<br/>answered 20/6/18<br/>France<br/>14.4.18</p>
<p>Dear Uncle Willie<br/>I have deferred writing about Terence till I had thoroughly satisfied myself that the report of his death in action was correct.  Yesterday I went to his grave &amp; added to its simple yet fitting embellishment my own offering, a token of my silent but deep sympathy for a grand young life, sadly cut off in its prime.  But he did grand work, Uncle, &amp; all, both his seniors &amp; juniors, speak in just as high terms of him as an officer &amp; a man as our his confreres speak of him.  His ability was amply attested by his rank while yet a youth &amp; so his life we cannot say was wasted.</p>
