<p>14/7/18<br/>Boulogne - Folkestone<br/>Left Boulogne on the leave boat at 12.30 p.m. in rain having four Australian nurses as travelling companions. No airship accompanied us today but the usual torpedo boat destroyers were in the convoy. Found seats and yarned with the nurses all the uneventful way across. Arrived at Folkestone we disembarked and caught the second train for London. The journey up through Kent was uneventful, the country looking very pretty and green. Arrived at Victoria changed some French money for English and rushed over to the Belgrave Mansions</p>
