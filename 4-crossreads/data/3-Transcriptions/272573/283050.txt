<p>that it is Xmas time at home. Parcels, Letters, newspapers etc occupy a good part of the tents. Great excitement in camp owing to the reception of this huge mail.</p>
<p>The huge battleships, the "Cornwallis" and the "Jupiter" passed down the canal to-day.</p>
<p>Received news that W.I, is married. Uncle J. has died also learned from the letters.</p>
<p>Feb 4th. Frid.<br/>E.P. tent pitching to-day.</p>
<p>Food is not very plentiful. Some private stores bought at Ismaelia have helped us on a bit.</p>
<p>Owing to the canal banks being patroled by a guard we cannot walk very far along the banks.</p>
<p>A large troopship passed down the canal to-night. A fine spectacle to see the faint outline of the ship and the magnificent searchlight lighting up the canal. The usual questions were shouted from the banks, "Who are you?" "Where are you going?". The answer came back "Australia" but I could not make out the name of the ship though I learned afterwards that it was the mail boat for Australia.</p>
<p>"Big Mac" entertained us in our tent this evening whilst stirring cocoa, boiling on a primus stove, giving his humorous experiences as a teacher in a bush school.</p>
<p>Feb 5th. Sat.<br/>P. transferring to the Infantry.</p>
<p>C.C.S. opened. Patient go down the canal in barges to the hospital at Ismaelia.</p>
<p>A sand storm has got up. This makes one very uncomfortable owing to the sand getting up one's nose</p>
