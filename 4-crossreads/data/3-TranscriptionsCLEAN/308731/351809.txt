 Dear old Dad 
 I am soon going to bed, I have one of your night-shirts on.  Frank has just written to you and is getting ready for bed.  Mum is nearly finest her letter?  Mum is a bit cross to-night.  I hope you can come home for week-ends this week.  I did not go to  Shoc  School today.  And we have a little Kitten Nancy had four but mum had to drown the other three, Now Nancy has put the Kitten somewhere and we can't find it.  The Docter came yesterday and Frank was not there he put something on our tongues I don't  no  know what it was.  Mum has written quite a lot and Frank is in bed Frank sleeps with Mum to night.  I think I will end off now. 
 Good-Bye Much love from Ruth Burrowes. xxx etc. ooo etc.
