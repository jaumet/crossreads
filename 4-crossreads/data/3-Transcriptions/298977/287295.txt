By way of celebration, after a heavy bombardment which lasted nearly two hours, the 5th Brigade made a successful raid on the German trenches.  Saw a peculiar cloud effect in the afternoon.  Shrapnel at 'plane broke clouds.</p>
<p>26th June 1916  Two observation balloons destRoyed by our planes this afternoon and four more forced to descend.  To-night was extremely lively.  Fritz got in on us and gave us a lively time for about an hour.  Starting at 9 o'clock and kept it up every half hour for about three hours.  However, we replied vigorously and quietened him.  Later on we gave him his own back with interest and incidentally carried out a successful raid and repulsed one by Fritz leaving.</p>
<p>27th June 1916  Bustling around to-day getting ready to hand over.  Some bustle too.  Relieved at about 11.30 tonight.  The boys were filling in time with the rum issue and were rather funny.  I had to stop behind all night and hand over.  No sleep, raining all night.  Just as they left a stunt happened on the right and mixed things up.</p>
<p>29th June 1916  Came out about 8.30 and had to set to work cleaning the gun which was covered with mud.  Nos 3 and 4 Sections moved off.</p>
<p>30th June 1916  Before moving off to-night we had a small concert most amusing.  Came in to Erquingham and are now in huts.  Heavy bombardment, a soir.</p>
<p>1st July  1916  Looking over gun belts etc., and generally straightening up.</p>
<p>From 3rd to 4th July  1916  Same old thing.  All the boys seem to be having birthdays which have to be celebrated.</p>
