Sinn Fein Song / current 1918
(brought back from Ireland by Don McKinnon)
I'll sing you a ditty of Dublin's fair city,
And a place called Mountjoy which all of you know;
?Twas there of all places the boys cut the traces
And got out of prison, alive, alive Oh.
The first was bold Barton, when he was departin?,
Left a note for the Boss, his politeness to show;
And a dummy in order to fool the poor warder
But Barton had hopped it, alive, alive Oh.
J.J. Walsh and Pierce Beasley the trick did suite gas?ly,
Some pro-German devil a ladder did throw;
Then some twenty Sinn Feiners, like acrobat trainers,
Scaled the wall and got free all alive, alive Oh.
They're thinking tomorrow, to call it Mountsorrow,
It's made of John Bull such a terrible show:
His prisons no longer have locks any stronger,
To keep in Sinn Feiners alive, alive Oh.
I'll finish my rhyme now, I think it's near time now,
The people are laughing wherever you go,
It's caused great elation in this ancient nation,
Sinn Feiners, pro-Irish, alive, alive Oh.
