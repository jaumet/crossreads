26th August 
Still we linger so do the "Sydney" "Encounter". No excitement. Wrote a letter. Had a wash. Got served out with sundry shirts sweaters. Swore considerably. Soldiers Sailors on the life boat. Sailors came back at 5.45 Soldiers not yet returned 7.46.
 8.46 Weary splashes heard hard to port (a seaman's phrase) 9.46 Several weary punters retire to roost. Many other jovial punters dance rags on the promenade.
Some more excitement. "Encounter's" brass band comes aboard 8 PM. Discourse wonderful music. More excitement. Stewards bring round chocolates 4 for 6d. Another graze with a higher civilization.
