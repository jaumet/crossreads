<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>Horses exercised &amp; I went for a ride round the town then out to Tuckel-keel about 16 miles out along the main canal the boys are having a good time there for they get heaps to eat from the Omdah &amp; plenty of swimming.</p>
<p>The planes are still very busy &amp; three was up today all day they go about 200 miles out on the desert &amp; reconnoitre one went out late last night &amp; camped in the desert so as he could watch the enemy early this morning.</p>
<p>Our telephone system has been altogether changed &amp; we now use the Markas &amp; General Exchange both for our communications.</p>
<p>Turned in at 9 tonight.</p>
