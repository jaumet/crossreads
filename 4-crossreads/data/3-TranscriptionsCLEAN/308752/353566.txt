  
 5th August 1918 our just desires. Four years ago everything looked black, & much doubt may have been in the minds of the people as to the outcome of such a gigantic undertaking, as the crushing of the Huns. The Allies have received some very hard knocks during these awful four years. The British have been sorely taxed. Russia was absolutely crushed, Roumania, Belgium, & Servia are broken, & poor old France is indeed suffering. Yes, the Allies have received some very hard physical knocks but the  Spirit  has not been injured. The same old spirit of the Allies is still to the fore, & though we have lost a lost, especially in men, I honestly believe that we are stronger now than ever. The entry of America into the War has altered the whole outlook of affairs. The "Yanks" are here in their thousands, we have talked & dined with them. What fine chaps they are too, it is a pleasure to see them here. Already they have given Fritz a taste of their determination & what they can do in the art of "Stouch". Fritz may still be strong, but he cannot be growing stronger as we are. 
 On the whole I think the Allies have much more genuine reason to be hopeful on the  4th Anniversary  than at any time during the past four years.  I fancy ere another year has passed the Allies will succeed in making the enemy listen to reason. 
 As for myself, I have every reason to be happy, with the above news in my mind. To-day the 5th Aug completes a  thousand days  Active Service for all the original men of the Unit, & I consider it an honour to be able to claim as one of these men. I am also cheered by the prospects of an early trip to Blighty, on  14 days Leave.
