<p>train from London and we spent our leave together.<br/>Stopped at the Royal.<br/><u>Sunday 27th Jany to Fri 1st Feby.</u><br/>Left Dundee 9/45 a.m. and arrived Aberdeen about 1 p.m.<br/>Stayed in the city 6 days.<br/>Aberdeen is a beautiful city, carefully laid out and without doubt cleanest and most substantially built city have ever been in. Nearly every building is constructed of granite. Even the fences around the farm, are made of it. Managed to get good rooms and obtained our meals where and when we desired. Seldom out before 11 a.m. so nearly every day did without breakfast. The people are more confident in the Nation's endeavours and are a grand crowd to be associated with.<br/>Viewed the Don and Dee: both are picturesque streams.</p>
