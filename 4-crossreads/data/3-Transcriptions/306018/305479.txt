<p>January 1918<br/>Have had a couple of games of football here &amp; find the game very strenuous for one who has got so soft here.  Have been to a couple of dances at the British Recreation Club &amp; enjoyed myself immensely.  I did not know there were so many girls here &amp; most of them are English too.  Had a weekend in Alexandria over the 20th &amp; while there called in at Records GHQ to find out how cousin Willie was as I had received no reply to my letter.  They told me he had been killed in action near Jerusalem on the 23rd November.  I was very sorry to hear the news &amp; got all the particulars I could.<br/>I went up to the 15th Gen Hosp &amp; saw Sister Barrow &amp; Nurse Averinos.  I had lunch with all the nurses, felt quite conspicuous surrounded, being the only man in about 50 of them.  After lunch we went out for a drive</p>
