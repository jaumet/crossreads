18 September 1915Saturday Arrived Lemnos
No sleep again last night on account of the itch, the doctor thought that perhaps a little refreshment might do us good & at tea we were ordered bread & butter. We up anchored at 6 at last & proceeded to Mudros arriving there at 11 to find the harbour very conjested with shipping. The airship followed us for a long way & the way she can be handled is a treat, on our way up the harbour 8 hospital ships were passed the Aquatania sailed this morning for England with fever cases on board. Mudros the chief town of Lemnos is a few brick shanties with a rather superior type of church in it & the sole living of the populace is fishing & rural work. A few windmills adorn the ridges round a place they call Turks Head but nothing more breaks the view over dry & desolute hills that resemble very much the arid hills of Asia in the Red Sea. The French have a fairly large garrison in this place
19 September 1915Sunday Went ashore
Spent a real good night at last & temperature was down to normal, at daybreak we moved further up the harbor passing on our way dozens of ships of the mercantile fleet, many French warships & heaps of ours also we took up our anchorage off the Mudros pier, stationary hospitals are on all the hills round the island in fact its practically a sick island the French also have their hospital here. Turkish prisoners are making roads by the mile under Sengalese guards. at 2 pm we were told that we had to go ashore to hospital & 10 minutes afterwards we were lowered in stretchers over the side into a naval picquet boat then landed at the quay to be picked up by a motor ambulance & conveyed to No 1 Gen Hospital & dumped in the hospital. The Swiftsure left during the harbour & she was no sooner out of the harbor than a submarine had two goes at her but both luckily missed she then went up to the Cape & its rumored they are going to force the Straits. doubt it.
