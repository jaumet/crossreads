<p>Red Cross letterhead.<br/>Bulford<br/>19.6.17<br/>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,<br/>We received a couple of Letters from You this week dated 29.4.17.  They are the first for a long time.  I suppose all the others have been fishes food.<br/>Talking of sports, I went to Lark Hill to run in the 100 yard A.I.F. Championship but was outclassed &amp; only got 2nd or 3rd in My Heat.  All the Pro's were there &amp; there were three beauties who won as they liked.  I ran well enough but these coves have been at the game for years &amp; run against Postle &amp; Donaldson &amp; Co.  It was an awful hot day &amp; we motored from Bulford to the Sports but had to walk back about 4 &frac12; miles.  Gee the heat here is more oppressive</p>
