  
 Wednesday 19th June 1917 [1918] Matron moves into my cubicle & all her pretty frocks hang along beside my modest white dresses with ward gray ones (her room being painted). Concert at Zeitoun 8 p.m.  8 V.A.D's, 4 sisters attend & I meet Eric Chauncey & years roll away & again I see their tiny cottages & hear of their poverty & how they must have "made good" now!  Very nice evening driving in the moonlight & the simple pleasure of these boys in their pet officer's appearance on the stage does one good to see.
