<p>studies of the natives; the sergeants get annoyed at my presence &ndash; I go on to the officers' deck and am better received.</p>
<p>Jan: 21<br/>As soon as daylight appears there's a deafening riot of bartering voices recommences. See a P. and O. liner go past;  passengers on board waving to us &ndash; after the uncivilised conditions of a Troop Ship it makes me long to be on that liner and in the society of refined women.</p>
<p>Jan 22: Same old noise of niggers. Cannot get a decent sketch &ndash; naturally the men are everywhere.</p>
<p>Jan: 23<br/>Leave Aden &ndash; nearly a collision with a N.Z. Troopship; got ready to make a sketch of the collision, which, had it happened, I should probably have been studying deep sea fish.</p>
<p>Jan: 24<br/>Daily routine.</p>
<p>Jan: 25<br/>Daily routine and noise. Geat excitement; first mail delivered to us from home; only those who have been cut off as we were can realise what that means to us &ndash; a  letter is the greatest boon we can receive.</p>
<p>Jan: 26<br/>Enter the Gulf of Suez &ndash; weather fairly warm. Daily routine. Writing to catch mail at Suez.</p>
<p>Jan 27<br/> Part of Suez very interesting. All ships are sandbagging all upper works prior to entering Canal &ndash; we hear that a P. and  O. officer has been killed and some men wounded by rifle</p>
