Every move we creep up closer to the line & last night I strolled up to the top of the hill behind us & saw a sight which I'll never forget. A fierce Artillery battle was raging a few miles off & the roar of the guns was deafening. It was a wonderful sight, the sky was illuminated with bursting shrapnel & star shells, a fascinating sight but one which made one think.
I will very likely see more of it as I hear the HQrs. are moving to Albert a town that is shelled pretty constantly. We passed numerous Ambulance wagons on our way here full of wounded but the chaps were all smiles.
