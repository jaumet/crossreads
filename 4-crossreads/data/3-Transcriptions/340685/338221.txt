<p>next the vegetable garden, grassy and comfortable in the open air. The old gentleman of the house here stocks large quantities of liquor and red wine and I had a dixie lid full and later Jock McHugh was evidently intent on a having a blow out and I tried to stop him with MacNamara but it was no use and he got very badly pushed. MacNamara was nearly as bad and I was just feeling unable to see straight. However went for a stroll and was sick on the way and felt quite right soon after. Jock was intensely funny. We evidently moved out of Bonneville to make room for the incoming 2nd Division who had just been relieved at Albert. Bed at 9.30.<br/>10.8.16 Reveille at 6 and check parade at 6.30. Wrote two letters home as the rest of the morning we were off. At 2 P.M. we had a helmet and gas inspection and dismissed at 2.45. Aust mail to-night which was late and the last of the mail about 6 letters. In the evening went to the 10th Battalion about &frac12; a mile away and saw Leaver and all the rest who all came through alright. Got new pair of boots.<br/>11.8.16 Nothing of importance happened. Evening received first batches of new mail and I got 2 chronicles and a letter from Auntie Sarah.<br/>12.8.16 Pay parade at 8 this morning. Now assets 35 francs and were told to stand by for a route march. However, I chanced a bath which was very enjoyable. Fell in at 2 for a route march which was compulsory brigade orders and our officers decided to go to Candas about 2 &frac12; miles away where there is a canteen. Warm walking and arrived at 3.10 and were dismissed for &frac12; an hour to buy supplies. However, there was hardly anything to be got and after some coffee returned. Before we marched out Orders were read one being that we were not to leave our billets probably due to raids carried out by us. Special order was read in which Cpl Allison of the A.A.M.C. was awarded the Military Medal for good work in the last engagement. Played "66" with MacNamara all the evening and beat him by 3 games to 1. Slept in the paddock under a spreading apple tree but  at 2 in the morning were awakened by rain and had to come into an outhouse that luckily no one had yet found and was very comfortable.<br/>13.8.16 ordinary check parade at 6.30. At 9 we fell in in marching order and marched to Beauval the first village on our road about 4 &frac12; miles away. Pretty big place and purchased some fruit there for future use. Got back at 12.15. Check parade at 2 and went down to Montrelet about 1 &frac12; miles away on the water cart to get water which brought back to the drivers where I got some more tobacco. I didn't return this <strike>this</strike> trip as Tonkin and MacNamara and 2 others were enough for the job and I heard there was a big parcel for me. Sure enough Aunties Sarah had sent me one a bit knocked about but bonzer</p>
