<p>My dear Girls:</p>
<p>How the time speeds by! More than half of the September month has gone, and I am still in Egypt, and at this same barrack hospital, with my ever flowing in and out of a stream of patients, to night there are 600 sleeping in the wards or the tents, far too many of course.

One large specimen looks like a piece of wood which had been cut with some instrument, a not too well sharpened axe, this and the other stones that you do not require are for Prof David as are also the other specimens with the ringed and other markings, look at them for a few minutes and you will note how strange they look. Father Vrigille, the Jesuit told me this afternoon that the larger specimen was representative of the palm trees of long ago. Ask the Prof. if he thinks like wise? The sand is for the Prof. too.
