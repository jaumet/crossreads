<p>Monday 1 March 1915<br />My wards in the hospital practically empty today.<br />St. Davids day &amp; Hy V<sup>th</sup> IV-7-101 to 108.&nbsp;<br />Everything points to us moving at an early date from here&nbsp;<br />Not well today.<br />The food here, eggs, cellery, onions, turnips, and these garnitures&nbsp;round the&nbsp;various insip[id] meats are horrid. I would not live here for all the mud in Egypt</p>
<p>Tuesday 2&nbsp;March 1915<br />Wards still emptying.&nbsp;<br />At 11-30 p.m. left Mena House with Jerrom and eleven nurses &amp; a guide for Sakkarah. Two camels and Twelve donkeys. I rode one donkey, &quot;Telegraph&quot; by name, there &amp; back, being at least 16 miles across the desert (8 miles each way). The donk. a pleasant little beast to ride travels quite as rapidly as a camel. Carried my weight quite well.<br />The tombs of the hills at Sakkarah, the most remarkable subjects viewed by me in Egypt. their weight &amp; size, their being of granite, the lids. how they were got into position after coming down the river five hundred miles. Mirabile dictu. Very sick in my belly on arrival home.</p>
<p>Wednesday 3&nbsp;March 1915<br />Much improved this morning, yet able to eat but little.<br />Obtained Charcoal and pepsine tablets, have taken&nbsp;a few, hope they may do me good&nbsp;<br />Ordinary work about hospital.<br />Dr Schuber<s>t</s> called to see me. Very good of him.&nbsp;</p>
