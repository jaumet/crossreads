<p>Am just falling in with the other pals arrangements   &amp;  taking as much rest as possible. We expect to have a very, very busy time when we return, so must feel fit for work.</p>
<p>Went to bed early Friday-night after a glorious, <u>hot bath</u> - something we have not had since we left England. Oh, and a lovely clean bed with white sheets. Had a great dinner also. Did not waken until 8.30 a.m. Went to the Base that morn (Sat) to report to Miss Conyers   &amp;  get some pay, had a rather tiring morning running around, saw several people I know   &amp;  they all  seemed pleased to see me. Did a little necessary shopping, had dinner, then returned to Base   &amp;  at last saw Miss Conyers. She was delighted to see us   &amp;  all looking so well. We got the pretty little Brooch send out to us by "The Aust People".</p>
