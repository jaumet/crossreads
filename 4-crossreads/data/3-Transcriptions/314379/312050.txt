<p>1 to 90 consecutively and about 40 cards on each of which are printed 15 different numbers in three rows of 5 each, one man sells the cards at 3d each game, and when he has disposed of sufficient of them the game is ready to start. The other man then takes out one disc at a time from the bag, calls out the number thereon and lays the disc to one side. There may be any from 30 to 40 men holding cards and as each number is called out, those whose cards bear this number, places some object (such as a button or a piece of a wooden match) on the numbers called and so on. The first player who has an object on each of the five numbers representing one straight line (any one of those on each card) immediately calls out "House" and wins the game.<br/>His card is then checked to see if everything is correct, if it is O.K. he receives the whole of the money paid in for the cards, less 6d or 1&frasl;- for the men running the game. It appeals to the men as it is absolutely fair. Some rather funny sayings are introduced in connection with the calling out of numbers such as "No 1 Kelly's eye", "Legs 11" "Clickety Click &ndash; 66" "The top of the house &ndash; 90" and so on. The query "Who'll 'ave a card" is the most frequent loudly expressed saying on the ship.<br/>It does not matter what takes place, whether it is church service or a lecture by the O.C. the first words we hear at the conclusion is "Who'll 'ave a card". Card games, quoits, draughts, chess, etc., also have many admirers. At the beginning of the voyage some of the hard'uns introduced real gambling games (in which a certain amount of cheating is possible) of two up, crown and anchor, etc., But the Authorities have forbidden their use. Of course no doubt, gambling is carried on secretly &ndash; everything that is forbidden generally is &ndash; but if any of the boys now get "fleeced" they have themselves to blame. There is also a squad of Military Police on board to see that order is kept and disturbers of the peace arrested and put in the cells to think the matter over. Such examples have a steadying effect on the rowdy members of the troops. Apart from the fore said games we are just about to start competitions for the whole of the ship for the following:<br/>Indoor games: Euchre, cribbage, bridge, chess, draughts and dominoes.</p>
