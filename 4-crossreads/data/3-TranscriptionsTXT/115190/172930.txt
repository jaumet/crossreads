 There is a cemetery in the making here fenced in with barbed wire.&nbsp; It is filling up far too fast.&nbsp; Every day I see fresh mounds.&nbsp; One of my mates lies here a wooden cross on his  head  grave.&nbsp; Poor Harry&nbsp; I saw him alive &amp; well just after we crossed the Jordan River.&nbsp; This place is called [Rornar ?] and is about a mile outside Damascus.&nbsp; 150 Turkish officers are billeted in a house here with a Tommy guard.
