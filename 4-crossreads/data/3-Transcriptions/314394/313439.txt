<p>June 25th 1915  The night of the 25th was spent at Liverpool Camp, all kits had been sent to A 35, the Berrima.<br/>The last night in Australia was very cold indeed and a roll call was made at midnight.<br/>An early rise was made amid a kind of silent excitement, a roll call taken and the blankets rolled up ready to be taken to the Depot.<br/>At 8 A.M. The 20TH Battalion paraded for the last time and were inspected by the Colonel. Shortly afterwards the Battalion with machine guns, signallers and band marched off in full marching order with bayonets fixed, and scabbards on.<br/>The Battalion was cheered all along the route and there was a lot of shaking of hands. The entrainment was very rapid, it being done in 10 minutes.<br/>It was a stiring and memorable time, we were cheered and waved at all along the line and at length arrived at Sydney Station. The march down to the boat was a very sad one and for ever will be remembered by all the 20th. The ladies got into the ranks and there was a very deep feeling amongst us all. It made one inclined to cry as lads dragged themselves away from their people, girls and etc and pass through the gate to the wharf.<br/>After a short delay in order to form up the men we went on board the Berrima were allotted messes and remained down below until the District Commandant, Colonel Wallack inspected us. My parade state being ready and the inspection being over I gave the words Go on deck", there was a mad rush for the deck all being very anxious to get a last look at their people. The cheers were loud and long which caused a ships officer to remark those people are loyal alright". You could read in every mans eyes deep feelings working and many could not help giving way to tears. All those over strength were sent back by a waiting tug as the ship had pulled out into the harbour. When we got outside the Heads the sea became a little rough which caused most of the troops to feed the fishes. During officers mess hurried leave to be absent was obtained from the Colonel. Before going outside the heads we were anchored off Rose Bay.<br/>The pilot boat signalled Good luck and a safe return" It was 5 pm the clock on the 26th of June<br/>That night was spent in settling down, the men learning how not to swing their hammocks. I had a hot salt bath and turned in early as there being nothing to do.</p>
<p>June 27th   All were up early and wandering about the ship trying to find out all they could about the ship, which to many was a new experience.<br/>It was generally known that we were bound for Melbourne, for one reason the paymaster was on board</p>
