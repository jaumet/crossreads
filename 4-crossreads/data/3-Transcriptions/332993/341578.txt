<p>Thursday August 16, 1917. (1109)<br/>It was fine last night but threatening rain to day.  We are at the usual routine work today; feeding, grooming, &amp; cleaning.  I received a letter from Willie this morning.  He is now at Lark Hill &amp; getting on well.  He left Melbourne on the 10th of May &amp; arrived at Devonport on July 19th.</p>
<p>Friday August 17, 1917. (1110)<br/>A beautiful morning.  The weather has now taken a turn for the better.  Last evening was an ideal day.  There is a little creek running below the barn, which has beautiful clean water in it, &amp; flows very rapidly.  I can hear it bubbling over the stones as I write.  It is the best water I have seen in France &amp; the stones in this district the first also.  They are mostly flints, with some hard lime stones.<br/>This afternoon all the transports washed &amp; cleaned their web equipment &amp; brightened the brass work in accordance with Brigade orders.  This is the first time we have done it since it was issued to us at Seymour.  At one time it was a penalty to brighten the brass work.  There is evidently to be an inspection.<br/>I packed up ready to send to my wife the following souveniers.  1 horse shoe made out of a German shell. 1. Butter knife &amp; 1 paper knife made out of the driving band of a British 18 pounder shell, 1 serviette ring made out of a German driving band, 1 piece of alluminium being a fragment of the timing fuse of a German shell.  I wrote to my wife this evening letter 89.<br/>[3 lines of shorthand]<br/>The Pope's peace offer is not entertained by the Allies.  It is inspired by Berlin &amp; has caused great enthusiasm there &amp; in Vienna.<br/>The French &amp; English have delivered</p>
