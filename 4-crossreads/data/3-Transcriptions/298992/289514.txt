<p>and I only wish it was a man to man fight instead of this awful Artillery. We would have nothing to fear then. Of course its no use denying there are some big lumps of men in the German trenches, but such a large number are weedy &amp; undersized, and look quite done up. Our Artillery is supreme now, and has it all over the Germans. All day &amp; night they pump shells into their trenches, till its wonderful that there is any living thing left. As our Sergt Major of the Huns who were captured yesterday said &ndash; "You English don't know what a bombardment is", meaning of course that our guns give them ever so much more than they give us, and I think its right too. &ndash; I wouldn't like to change Artillerys anyhow.</p>
<p>We have been here about 3 days now, and I have had a couple of lucky escapes. Last night I was in the dugout just going ot turn in when a piece of a shell blew in, and nearly blew me out. It was a spent piece however &ndash; didn't hurt much. Hit me on the big toe, and didn't I talk!!</p>
