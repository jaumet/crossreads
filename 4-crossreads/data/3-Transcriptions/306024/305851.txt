<p>1918<br/>8th August stunt<br/>When we got back to Vaux en Amiennois, &amp; particularly after having been taken back in motor lorries, we felt sure that the 'Heads' were at last going to recognise our wishes for a good spell back from the line.</p>
<p>The fact that the furphy kings were again busy after  a day spent in peace and bliss did not alarm anyone, but when orders were given to attend lectures at the Tankodrome, and to practise stunts in co-operation with Tanks, well, &ndash; what could one think? Even the nucleus of "Tivey's Chocs" were sure of the impending stunt, but according to their story, they were to take a decent part. Naturally we refused to believe that such a thing could be possible.</p>
<p>After a few days, though, our doubts were confirmed. I knew sooner than most that something was going to happen for Martin M&ndash; was brought back from a holiday under escort and rather merry, and being brought before the C.O. was fined seven days pay, and promoted to corporal.</p>
<p>The battalion received five minutes notice to pack up, cover tin lids with sandbag, and get ready for a ramble up to Querrieu, where we had rested before going in to Morlancourt</p>
