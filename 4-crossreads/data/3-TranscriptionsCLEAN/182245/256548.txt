 FEBRUARY 1917 
 2 FRIDAY 
 Fine & sunny & fairly warm in the 
 sun. Went for a bath in the 
 morning & cleaning harness 
 ect all afternoon. There was 
 an inspection of everything 
 by the "heads" in evening, but 
 did not hear the result. There 
 was a few airial bombardments 
 right over our heads & several 
 lumps of shell fell amongst 
 us.
