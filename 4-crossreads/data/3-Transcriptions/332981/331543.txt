<p>My Cabin was the first from the Depot at Peude and only 7 kilos away we arrived there in 15 minutes and after putting my lot off also my mate putting his lot off, the train continued on. Both of us brought our kits etc into the Nessian Hut and soon made ourselves comfortable. As the two Tommies had to remain until further orders, we did not take over until Wednesday, and in the meantime amused ourselves about the Camp.</p>
<p>There are thirteen men stationed here co[n]sisting of three Sergeants, one Corporal as Yardmaster, two shunters, four Blockmen, two for West and two for East Cabins, a cook &amp; an orderly and a numbertaker &amp; we are a happy family. In the Cabins we work 12 hours a shift from 6 am until 6 pm and 6 pm until 6 am and on Sundays the 6 pm Blockman works until midday &amp; he is then off duty</p>
