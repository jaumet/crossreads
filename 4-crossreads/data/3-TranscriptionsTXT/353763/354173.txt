Friday 18th Sept  -  Yesty aft  Captain Moore - Patterson & self went for a stroll on the beach  -  Well laid out place  -  No butcher's shop to be seen  -  They live on the stuff & food is vey  -  scarce since the war broke out  -  We then 'blew in' (very common expression) on the Berrima & met men & drank  -  The bar trade on the Berrima is a huge one  -  We also were on the Sumatra & Madang - the prizes   -  & then blew in on the Protector & had more drinks & 'buz' then off to S.S. Upolu  -  I'm the medico that gets around & sees things thanks to being on the 'Robert D  -  Lee'  -  I all but got a week end patrolling on the Sumatra  -  I wanted to go badly but as I'm MO to 3 ships (Upolu AE2 Protector) I couldn't be spared  =All our men & officers are doing jobs somewhere & I've my name down for any odd job anywhere or anyhow  -  That's the way to see what's doing & you don't lose anything even if you don't go  -  You mop up all that's possible  -
Its hot & close to-day  -  What I'll jot down is the 'Buz' First of all a few facts however  -  In this harbor lie the Montcalm - not much good as a first class fighter - the Protector - no damned use at all - the Encounter? ditto - AE2 - the Destroyers   -  [indecipherable] Yarra & Warrego  -  Yarra has her shaft buckled  -
If  - If   -  the German cruisers - Scharnhorst & Gneisenau only knew it now's their chance & their only chance  -  As a matter of fact the Germans expect us to be attacked  -
