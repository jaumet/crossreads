  
 boy to get all my odds & ends back to the battalion. Came to this hospital (No 2 Stationary) in the Ambulance & was put in No 5 ward after having a bonny hot bath. Can eat at this place. (Chicken etc) Much better than the school fare. 
 Friday 20.9.18 Goods today. Guess I'll be up for a while & should leave on Sunday in time to go back with the boys from the school. Four gas cases came in yesterday, 3 with eye trouble & one with chest. Mustard gas it was. They got it near St. Quentin fighting with the Aussies. Hope our casualties were light. 
 Saturday 21.9.18. Got up in the afternoon & went for a stroll over to No 3 A.G.H & saw Sister Nicholls. She is some sport. Invited us to afternoon tea on Monday. Had temp taken when we got back & sent back to bed 'cos my temp was up. 
 Sunday. 22.9.18. Very dopey today. Six from this ward sent to Blighty. Very lucky
