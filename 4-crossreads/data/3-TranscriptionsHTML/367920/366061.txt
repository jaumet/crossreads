<p>The following night Fritz opened a heavy bombardment about five minutes before ten. He then sent a raiding party over but it was wiped out by our rifle fire. Later on our artillery opened up and our battalion's raiding party went over. They were very successful. The artillery fire was terrific and Fritz kept it up all night. I was in the front line this night and it was the worst bombardment I have ever been under.</p>
<p>We were relieved on the 27th and went into huts at Erquinghem. The 13th Battalion relieved us. Jack was in a few days before we were relieved and I saw him several times. We went into training again and did some fatigues marching about six miles to Chapelle d'Armentieres. We were shelled several times and one night</p>
