<p>15:  Brig. Cox paid us a visit &amp; the boys complained to him of treatment by lady doctors &amp; the food.  He saw the C.O.  &amp; played old Harry with the [indecipherable], saying the food was not fit for dogs &amp; wanted to know who was getting the 4/- per day paid for sick Aussies in all English hospitals.  Attack of Spanish flu &amp; vomiting day &amp; night, having a rough time.  Champagne &amp; Brandy &amp; Soda is my diet at present, but cannot keep it down.  Life is awful here, the place is more like a prison &amp; a man would go wanky if the Aussie sisters were not looking after us.  Our doctor is about 24, skirts just below her knees &amp; a military cap pulled over her eyes &amp; ears; the boys calling her Jockey Jack.</p>
<p>24:  Still in bed, slight attack of pleurisy &amp; have lost over two stone since coming here.  Have quinine abscesses since the injections &amp; balancing on rubber cushions.  Shall be glad to get out of here, it is awful being in bed, but many of my pals from the cadet school visit me &amp; it is good to have them for an hour or two.</p>
