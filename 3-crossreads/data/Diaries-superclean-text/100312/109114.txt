29/10/17 Rome
Rome seems to have any amount of people living on the church ? monks of all kinds shaven and bearded frocked and unfrocked. After lunch went out with my guide and we drove to the church of St Peter in chains where is a wonderful statue of Moses by Michael Angelo. It is lifelike to the extreme and they say that the old sculptor, then 88, struck it with a hammer when completed saying ?Speak!" From here we could see a house said to have been occupied by one of the Borgias. Next pulled up at the Colloseum exactly like the pictures. An enormous place and still remarkably well preserved. It could seat 87000 spectators most of the marble facings have been stripped away but the masonry nobody could shift. The dens of the wild beasts, the prisoner's cells and the underground passages still remain. Now to the Church of St Peter (?) without the Walls very mosque like and they did the match and alabaster trick. The front of this church is all gold mosaic work very beautiful
