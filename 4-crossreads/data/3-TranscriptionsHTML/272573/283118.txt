<p>At various places all over the country here where there is grazing land it is bordered with tall trees. This I have no doubt is a means of providing timber, and still being grown without any loss of land for produce etc.</p>

<p>Never a day passes but one sees numerous aeroplanes over our heads either our own or the enemies and accompanying them are the anti-air craft shells bursting all around.

<p>News in newspaper that Russia is making rapid advances.</p>
<p>July 30th Saturday</p>
<p>Heavy Artillery bombardment.</p>
<p>Some of the chaps who were at the landing on Gallipoli say that the bombardments here are far worst than what happened on the 20th of April 15. In fact one chap said he would rather put nine months in on Gallipoli than one month on the western front. The privation on Gallipoli were more than in France.</p>
