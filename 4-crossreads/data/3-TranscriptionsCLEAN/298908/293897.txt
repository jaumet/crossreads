At last we reached the ship & she turned out to be the old "Port Hacking" sure enough as each man went aboard he had to hand a card which he filled in with particulars of himself & etc. & his pay book to an officer who was collecting them.  Another old chap then handed each man an envelope containing a message of congratulation from the King & Queen & we filed downstairs to our quarters.  The Sgts. are separated from the rest we have a fairly good little joint.  We soon got our hammocks & blankets & then had dinner for we got aboard about 10.30.  After dinner I went up on deck for Ethel was coming to see me if she could get past the police sure enough she was there but they would not allow me to go off the ship.  I could go out along the gangway which I did & we had a good yarn by the time she went she had about 61 letters to post for the chaps kept on bringing them out to her for this was their last chance of posting a letter
