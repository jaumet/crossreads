<p>History tells us that the building was commenced in the year 1131. You can imagine yourself how interesting it must be to inspect such old &amp; historic places as these. The market place was all decorated, in honour of our great victory, it must have been a wonderful sight here, a few weeks ago when the King of Belgium made his entry into the city. The Grand Place has played many an important part in the history of Belgium and even in this War it has become noted. Before I enlisted, I read of the Gemans entry into Brussels and it was in this place where they treated the high officials etc. of the town in a shameful manner. They also held a great number of ceremonial parades here. At night time, the entire market place is illuminated and is a pretty sight. At the back of the Town Hall we come across the Manneken Fountain. This is also a very old piece of structure. The Guide Book informed us that we had visited practically all the most important &amp; historic places in our stroll so we made our way to a Caf&eacute;, &amp; partook of another sumptuous meal. The price of which was enormous.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dinner, one finds it very hard to beat these French meals. Another short stroll after tea, &amp; then to the Opera House. Although the Opera La Tosca was all in French, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The music, well words fail me to describe how beautiful it was. I have never heard such voices before.
