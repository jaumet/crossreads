At last we got on to the " Bazentin Road which carri us near to " Delvill Wood " the place which cost so mani men of all the sloppi dirti walk as ever I have been on well this one take the bun , it was neither mud nor water but it was about the same thick as cream , as we went along we got cover with white mud from head to foot , talk about a mess we were in you would scarc have known us , especi some of the boy who came "gutser " fell in the rotten stuff , well we reach our destin at last just back
