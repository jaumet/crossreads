 5th September  Remained in Camp all day, except for a short trip to Cassel to see the Censor. Harrison is an excellent fellow &amp; I have set him to building a small kitchen. Harvey is doing the cooking and he does it well.  Martin I have placed in the darkroom to look out after printing &amp; titling. Wilkins will attend to the records &amp; I myself to publicity pictures &amp; aesthetic results.  Collectively we are a contented little unit; absolutely isolated at Steenvorde &amp; &frac12; a mile from the town. We are in immediate touch with all fronts. 
 Cassel, where are the General Headquarters is a fine little town, built on the crest of a lofty hill, which overlooks the surrounding lands of agriculture. Like all other roads, in Nth France.   The ways to Cassel are lined with stately poplars &amp; other trees.
