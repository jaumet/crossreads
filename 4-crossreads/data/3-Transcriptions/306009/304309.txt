<p>1915<br/>May. 3 Mon.<br/>Had my third swim in the Mena House Baths this morning.<br/>The 4th Light Horse left Mena for Heliopolis to-day &ndash; No. 2 G.H. is the only Unit left here now.<br/>Wounded men only arrived for 2 days - we are now discharging numbers of them to Base Details camp, Zeitoun for return to the firing line.  In the hall which is full of beds a man is laboriously scrawling a letter with 3 fingers of his left hand - the remainder of his digits being out of action &amp; many others are inconvenienced in various ways. One man has just been in the office with 6 inches of cloth ploughed out of the crown of his cap by a bullet which also grazed his scalp.</p>
