Got a letter from Bill How from All Saints. He was a New Zealander who was in the same room as myself & we got rather chummy.
I was speaking at a debate this evening & I won the decision. We had a very enjoyable evening.
Still no boat, had to have bully beef for dinner & it was pretty hard to tackle.
