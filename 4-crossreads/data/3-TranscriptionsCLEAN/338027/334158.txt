  
 Friday, 2 April, 1915 (Good Friday) An all day holiday I went on all day leave to O'R's and although they were fasting they prepared a great Easter dinner for me, after dinner I went to two "station of the cross days" at the R. C. one in French and the other in Italian, it was novel for me and most impressive, I spent an enjoyable day but unfortunately Good Friday was a bad day for Australian troops here as there was a terrible riot in [indecipherable], it appears that a soldier the previous night was  robbed of six pounds in a house of ill fame and next day with some mates went back for it, and instead was stabbed by the woman, this excited a mob and they started to wreck the house, they threw all the furniture out the windows and made a bon fire, then the trouble started. 
 A light horse picquet had almost resumed order, when the hated English red caps rode down and drew pistols and fired straight into the crowd wounding several, one man is reported to have died since.  This made the Aust's mad, and they gave the red caps a great doing, and the cowards ran for their lives, with the mob chasing them.  A lot of natives were hurt, but order was created by eight o'clock when a battalion from one camp arrived.  All soldiers were sent home and Cairo after this will be out of bounds. 
 Saturday, 3 April, 1915 In morning cleaned saddlery and exercised horses, p.m. was fortunate enough to obtain a pass, five minutes before they were recalled.  I went to Mena to see old mates and was astonished to see one brigade had gone and they were leaving all day and night and the coming week.  They are going to Lemnos they think a Greek island in the Dardanelles.  We will be I think the last to leave as the infantry will have to fight there way in .  personally I think the L.H. will not be wanted very much in this war.  We may go this week or we may stay here some time. 
 I arrived into Cairo too late to go to my friends so came right home to camp.  The cheering of the men as they were departing showed how eager they were to get into action.
