<p>Warning!<br/>Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>Irregular sexual intercourse involves a considerable liability to infection with Gonorrhoea, or Syphilis, or both.  Of those who are infected a portion are never cured; the consequences are serious so far as they are concerned, and still more serious as regards those to whom they may communicate these diseases later on.</p>
<p>Incontinence is not in any way necessary for purposes of health, and the advice the medical profession would give to all would be abstinence from intercourse other than in marriage.  At the same time if you determine to take the risk, it is your duty not only for your own but for that of other people to avoid infection, and infection can usually be avoided by following the procedure indicated in the following:</p>
<p>Instructions for men</p>
<p>Immediately after intercourse thoroughly wash the genitals with soap and water, pass urine, and then dry the parts, especially the opening of the passage.  The washing must include the parts under the foreskin which must be drawn back.  Then dip the wisp of cotton wool into the liquid supplied and gently pass it into the opening by a twisting movement; pass it in for a quarter of an inch, and allow it to remain in position for three or four minutes before removal.  If the opening or "eye" of the penis is so small that this cannot be done, a few drops should be inserted with a medicine dropper.</p>
<p>The ointment is then to be used by rubbing it in thoroughly and firmly over the whole penis, but more particularly the head, especially if a crack, abrasion, or small tear is noticed anywhere.  The foreskin must be drawn back to allow of this being done properly.  A small portion of the ointment should be allowed to remain in opening of the canal.</p>
<p>The value of these simple precautions depends on the rapidity with which they are adopted after intercourse.  The sooner these steps are taken the less is the risk of infection.</p>
<p>The applications should be made in the order indicated.  The longer they are deferred the greater the risk.</p>
