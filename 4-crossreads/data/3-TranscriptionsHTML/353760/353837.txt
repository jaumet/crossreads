<p>January 30<br/>134.<br/>Another April day.</p>
<p>No mail.  Books from Hendersons overdue five days.</p>
<p>Wrote today, had censored &amp; delivered to Jim W. letter addressed to Windsor &amp; Newtons for one of their Press Sketch Books.  Rumour of our moving back near Bailleul tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Yesterday Jim Mitchell back &ndash; and B. Section celebrated.  Jim knocked with Algie, were the first of our wounded at Ypres in September.  Looking well, and has hip wound well healed.</p>
<p>135.<br/>Book distribution.  In F.M.P. No. 1.  Diary IV and Sketch I:  Keats, Ginger Mick and B. Constr.  With Eric G. "Songs Before Sunrise" and Brookes.  With Frank S. Sketch Book II and "The Achievement", F. Thurston &ndash; from Y.M.C.A. today.</p>
<p>No. T.L.S. this week.</p>
<p>January 31<br/>136.<br/>Last night the guns that have been so silent for the last wounderful weeks opened out heavily bombarding and all the night kept continually speaking.</p>
<p>We are in our new position, leaving Dranoutre at 4.30, relieved by 15 Field.</p>
<p>February<br/>In the R'Avelsberg [Ravelsburg] D.R.S. by Bailleul.</p>
<p>February 2<br/>137.<br/>Working in Dispensary with Jim S. and Staff Ford.  New D.R.S. not a patch on Dranoutre but better than A.D.S.s in Dressing Posts.</p>
<p>Yesterday coldest day &ndash; full of cloud mist &ndash; of the first of 1918, today chilly after a heavy frost fall, but the sun out, and a clear fine day.</p>
<p>Mail:  From Mat letter of Nov. 23 and from Lindsay and A.B. of Jan. 25.  None of the expected books, a mail now that brings me a book will be a temporary annihilating of all these damned [indecipherable] that mentally torment.</p>
<p>138.<br/>Is it the sensual element that has my appreciation of art?  Certainly in such drawings as Spares and Ricketts it is that blood-utility, that superb nakedness that fascinates:  but Alan Odles sensualism merely quietly amuses, and Beardsley? &ndash; it has the fascination of the obscene &ndash; the brilliant obscene:  yet for all that, even though it is so far removed from life itself, it remains always true to life and reality.</p>
