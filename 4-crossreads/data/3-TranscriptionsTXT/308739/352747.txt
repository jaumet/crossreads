 Thursday 20 July 1916 After a wakeful night we left Katia on a Scouting Expedition &amp;amp; found Turks about 3,000 camped on the Hills at Oghartina.  They were digging in &amp;amp; generally preparing defences.  After watching all Day, Guns were brought up from Rail Head &amp;amp; the Brigade accompanying the Artillary went forward at Dusk to make a "demonstration".  The Turks replied to our fire &amp;amp; three of our men were slightly wounded.  Our Artillary did excellent work.  We returned to El Maler at 11 p.m. All men reported back safely in Camp. 8 Prisoners were captured by the N.Z. 
 Friday 21 July 1916 Resting all day.  It is now a common sight to see Enemy's Planes flying over our lines, but little or no bombing is done.  Apparently a big movement is in progress &amp;amp; Observations are being taken to find out our strength. Col. Fuller at Brigade arranging matters in connection with the Stunt of tomorrow morning. The 1st L.H. Brigade takes up position in touch with Enemy to-day, &amp;amp; we relieve them tonight some time. 
 Saturday 22 July 1916 General Chavel arrived on scene of Operations. Our Brigade assisted by New Zealanders left Camp at 1-30 a.m. (midnight) &amp;amp; slowly wended our way to Katia arriving there Day Break.  B Squadron was put out in advance to get within touch of Enemy.  Their advance posts had a remarkable escape owing to the Turks allowing them to pass through their lines &amp;amp; then fired.  None of our men were hit but couple of Horses were slightly.  During the Day the Turks advanced towards our lines, but apparently decided to withdraw.  Major Anderson of B Squadron did His Work in a thorough manner, &amp;amp; will prove a good man when needed. H.Q., A &amp;amp; C Squadrons camped all day at Katia with Machine Guns &amp;amp; the Whole Brigade returned to El Maler by 10 p.m. tonight. It is reported by our planes that the Enemy is in Force some 6 or 8 miles South of Katia. We expect very soon to have a scrap with the Turks, &amp;amp; great preparations are being made to make a successful Haul.
