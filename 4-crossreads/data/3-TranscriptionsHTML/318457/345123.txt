<p>[16-21st October 1914]</p>
<p>Intelligence came through on September 17th Oct. that German ship "Komet" the German's yacht at New Guinea had been captured; it is not known by whom. We knew this ship (about 300 tons) was in some hiding place in New Britain on the island but not far from Rabaul. Her wireless installation was in order. She was sometimes used as a surveying craft.</p>
<p>On Fri. 16th Oct we left Suva at 5pm for Sydney but did not know our destination until we were at sea. Then we were informed that we were to dock, coal at Sydney and join the "Melbourne" to escort the convoy The Imperial Egypt Force, as far as Aden. The "Minotaur" was said to be at Hobart.</p>
<p>Several Japanese and other British ships will assist in this duty on the passage across the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>We reached Sydney about 10.30am on Wed 21st Oct, just two months later than our  peaceful trip north which had planned to bring us back in 21 days.</p>
<p>About 11am we went alongside Garden Island and at 21.30 were towed to the dock. Docking was finished on Friday and at 8.30am Fri. we left dock, and spent several hours at the oil wharf, filling up &ndash; thence towed to Garden Island.</p>
