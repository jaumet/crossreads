Nearly any time there are 3 or 4 planes continually "up" &amp; the aerodrome is busy place  We reached Masaid, our destination, about 4 miles on the canal side of El Arish  Masaid is a large palm grove (Hod) of about 750 acres in extent, by far the largest palm grove I have seen on the desert.  There is beautiful water in the wells also fresh water laid on.  The New Zealanders, 3rd Light Horse Brigade &amp; Camelry are also camped here.  There are also canteens &amp; a big YMCA.
