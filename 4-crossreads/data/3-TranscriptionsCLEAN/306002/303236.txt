  
 27.7.15 Tue. 27th.  Tommies have arrived here & are taking over the Army Service work on the beach.  Mark 7 ammunition  h  is also arriving & as it will not fit our rifles a rumor is gaining ground that we are likely to soon be relieved by English Tommies & we will make a move goodness knows where.  Murga Mack arrived back to-day he was sent to Cairo & appears to have had a good time as he looks very well on it.  Dr. Wells also showed up this morning but was at once ordered back to the beach, it is said he had a row with Col. Meredith at Heliopolis & came over here without permission & has to go back again & no one here is sorry.  Fiaschi is the man we want, he has been busy to-day inoculating us against Cholera.  A good deal of artillery firing going on this afternoon from both sides.  We were relieved from the phone at 12 oclock.
