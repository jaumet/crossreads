<p>The "Matunga" gave us a loud coo-ee as she swung round to follow again after the gun-practise.</p>
<p>This morning we came up the Straits outside the island of Waigiou.   Some small native croft visible in the distance and many islands in vicinity (both volcanic and coral.)</p>
<p>The 'plane rose in the Straits, flew over the island and returned with an "alles klar" report.</p>
<p>The "Wolf" headed straight for the shore at about noon.   We were sent underdeck as she approached the shore but saw most of the business from the poop-doors.   The raider entered a magnificent harbour through an intricate &amp; narrow channel which took her at times within a few yards of the beach.   She finally dropped anchor in a land-locked sound which is a perfect harbour of wonderful beauty.</p>
