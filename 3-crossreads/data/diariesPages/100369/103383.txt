The gifts are quite simple, yet useful, but they represent Home to us, they represent to us all the loving feminine hearts and hands that have planned and toiled unceasingly for our good throughout all these dreary months of war. Behind each simple gift there is Self Denial, and Sacrifice, and a world of patient, loving toil and thought, that makes each article of infinite value. And we do not forget.
