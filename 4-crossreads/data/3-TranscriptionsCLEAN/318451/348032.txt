Each man carried 220 rounds of ammunition, 2 gas Helmets, 1 steel helmet, Haversack, Water bottle, Web Equipment & Pack including a blanket & wore his overcoat.  We marched four miles.  Weather fine.  We are now at Amesbury all on board the train.  The signal to move off is about to be given 1.15 p.m. At 1.15 our Train left & we drew into S- at 3.  At 7.30 the ship left.  The Crossing of the Channel was calm and uneventful.  We landed at H-at 7 a.m. 
 Wednesday 22 After a wait of 4 hours on the wharf we left for a rest camp situated out about six miles.  The men had very heavy load each exceeding 110 lbs. weight & it told on them heavily but all got into camp.  H- is a very fine town with an exceptionally big traffic in the harbour. The Camp was very welcome notwithstanding the march. We had a meal at a little French Cafe which was excellent.
