<p>Fine all day, but came on misty rain about sundown. Exercising horses in the morning &amp; cleaning harness ect. up at the harness room all afternoon. The 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;battery was shooting out of the gun pits in the morning &amp; did some very good shooting I believe. I went down &amp; saw Hughie McMaster, Reg Wall ect in evening after going to the Palace with Warren. Its good to see old mates again &amp; compare notes ect.</p>
