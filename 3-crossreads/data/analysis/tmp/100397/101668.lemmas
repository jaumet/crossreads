 Saw Jack Howel about 10 day ago . he came down to look me up he look well , but is like myself and all the rest just about - fed up ? but I fanci everyon is feel that way . At present we are amongst the Poplar again and can go swim everi day when not on parad , we want a wash when we arriv here I had not had one for quit a week so you can guess it did not take us long to get into the River when we arriv . we had to fix up shelter for ourselv so three of us set to work and cut a good pile of reed to roof our Bivouac then I set to work and thatch it with grass I think it will keep the rain out , but still I dont want ani rain to come along , to show whether I 'm right or wrong . Had a coupl of letter from Mrs. Horton a coupl of week back Mr H. had a touch of the new flu Edgar was not veri well , and Elsie had a bad cold , so I guess the Poor littl woman just about had her hand full . She tri hard not to worri about Harold , but find it veri hard . The parcel with tin of Tabac , Sugr etc arriv O.K. and was veri much enjoy by self and a coupl of mate , we still have a littl of the Sugar and some of the Tabac which was in first class condit and veri welcom , as the canteen was out of decent smoke Tabac and I was tri everywher to get someth worth smoke = it is veri hard sometim to get a good Tabacco here for a great mani of the chap mixtur are not even decent imit . I hope the flower seed are allright , The Cornflow , Poppi etc are out in full bloom here but there are not so mani as when we were in this area last , There are a few white marguerit seed in the packet I sent , but I do not know whether they were much good .
