Sunday 27 July 1919Didn't go to church parade. Played cards & won 7/6. Had a bath, developed a spool & went for a walk to one of the old Roman Camps. Gee they are marvellous old things. They are really strongholds & redoubts & must have taken a terrible amount of taking. Even now they would be hard. Took a snap of it but don't think it will show up too well.
Monday 28 July 1919Two parades today. Asked for leave for tomorrow & got it alright. Bill came down tonight. Played bridge again & won. Do me when I win.
