Wireless news from Tenefrie was posted up yesterday &amp; today at the canteen, but there is nothing much in it. [Shorthand transcribed as follows]  There is a barber shop on board now in the forward part of the ship and I got my hair cut today.  [end of shorthand]] Land was sighted very early this morning by some of those who were sleeping on deck. 
 There was a concert tonight in the forward part of the ship on No3.  Deck.  It was the first of a series to be held on board. One of the best items was a recitation "Salt Bush Bill" contributed by Brigadier General Lloyd. Some of the ships staff contributed songs,  the balance of the programme was contributed by privates. A newspaper is to be established on board, and articles are invited. 
 Tuesday April 8.1919   (149) A fine clear day.  A fresh wind is blown on the Port bow. The course of the ship has vered a little more to the South. 
 We have permanent mess orderlies and are paying them 2/- per week. Today was their first pay.
