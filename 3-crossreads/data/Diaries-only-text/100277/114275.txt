8th. I had a lovely experience last night. I had charge of the last party that moved off from our old positions at 8.30. Something like 60 men not a bad swag for a corporal to look after, well on the way down we had to follow a tramline a part of the way, down both sides of the line there are great holes 3 parts full of water made by old Fritzie's shells, this little line is our means of bringing nearly everything to the firing line all night long it is crowded with trucks going both ways, well as luck would have it just as I was passing one of these big waterholes a truck, or something, hit me knocked me head first in, I fairly dived into it with every thing I possessed, full marching
