Friday 31st
Had busy day pitching tenets. It was read out in routine orders that we were to get everything ready for receiving 150 patients. These were the fellows who got "knocked up" during our famous desert march. All the waggons and horses were in use and they brought ?em in, in double quick time. A 6 of us were in our party, pitching tents and we had to move lively, as the patients were coming in on top of us. None of them were very sick most of them were suffering from blistered feet, and it only meant a couple of days rest to put ?em right. About 6.45 the cry went up "Fall in for pay" ? needless to say, we fell in very smartly, as almost everyone was "broke" I drew 100 P.T. but had to pay our 70 P.T. which I borrowed when we went on the trip to Cairo. I only had 30 P.T. left, but it is very nice to be out of debt again.

Saturday 1st
All Fool's Day, but the crowd are too jolly tired to play jokes. Most of our patients belong to Battalions who are camped near us, and many of them rejoined their units to-day, only the sick ones remaining. The 56th are on one side of us and the 54rd on the other. A big crowd came into camp to-day from around Cairo you can always tell a crowd of "New Chums" as they carry such a lot of superfluous gear, while the older hands travel light as possible. Most of the chaps that came in to-night had walking sticks. We had another hard day to-day. Billsy May, Rass, Trousdale, and I were carting stone to fill up a grease trap. It was a dusty job and I was glad when we had finished. Thenn we went down to the Canal and had a swim. When we got back we were issued with Cigarettes, I got 3 very welcome papers from France today.
