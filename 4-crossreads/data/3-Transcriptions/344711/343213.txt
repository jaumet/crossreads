<p>24th<br/>Was surprised and pleased by a visit from Leuit. Ferguson, of our squadron, who is going back to the Peninsula in two days time, after five weeks illness. He was in charge of our demonstration on 12/7/15, and proved himself a cool game officer under fire.</p>
<p>25th<br/>Some ladies visited the Hospital this morning, talking to us, and bringing flowers.</p>
<p>28th<br/>Three of us taken out in a motor car for a drive to Mena in charge of a sister.  Had a look at the Pyramids.</p>
<p>October<br/>1st<br/>Took Sergeant Smith over to Cairo to the Pay office.  He has lost his eyesight owing to shell-shock, but will most probably get it back in two or three months time.  Afterwards took him in the launch for the river trip.</p>
<p>2nd<br/>Went to see the Aquarium, &amp; saw a lot of queer looking fish.  There is a fine grotto there too, and a lovely garden and trees.</p>
