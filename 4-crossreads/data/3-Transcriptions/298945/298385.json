<p>Friday 16th Aug.</p>
<p>This morning we left Villers Brettoneux &amp; marched near Corbie by Chatelet to the village of Vaire. Here we were joined by the bearers, (who had arrived before us,) in a camp surrounded by trees on the bank of the Somme. Although this was just behind our old front line, it is a tremendous contrast to Villers Brettoneux. The former place encompassed us in a scene of desolation &amp; an atmosphere of abominable stinks; here, outside the village &amp; in a perfect woodland retreat we have nature again near us. It is temporary wonderland; only temporary for we are going up the line again tomorrow, I believe.</p>
<p>There are certainly dug outs in the woods, &amp; along the river, &amp; here &amp; there</p>
