<p>the whole of our Battalions Transports assisted by the A.S.C. moved off together. I was brakesman for W. Kicleys limbre and drove by turns with him riding the near side mule while doing so. We went through Bailleul and through two villages beyond it, when we halted for dinner. After dinner we made another start and kept going until we reached Staple when we unharnessed and camped for the night. We passed through several nice little villages, and saw many on both sides of the roads in the near distance in fact the whole landscape was <strike>covered</strike> dotted over with villages &amp; farms, the spires of the churches standing out prominently. It was beautiful weather and harvesting was in full swing. Side by side with very primitive methods of harvesting such as the hook &amp; scythe were some of the latest American binders the Massy Harris, &amp; in one village through which we passed was an agency for these machines displayed in prominent characters. Through the open doors &amp; windows of some of the houses we could see hand looms at work and also old women making lace. The scenery was very beautiful and overhead there were scores of British Aeroplanes <strike>flying overhead</strike> protecting the land from the devastating hands of the Huns. We crossed many railways, the engines &amp; trains of many being British, &amp; all engaged in carrying munitions of war. The whole distance we travelled from No. 2 camp at Kamel was about 15 Kilometres   miles<br/>Before dark I went with W. Kirby to Wallow Cappel to obtain rations for men &amp; horses, a village about 3 K. or 2&frac12; miles away.</p>
