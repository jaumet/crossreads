<p>2<br/>to me and  thank God too!<br/>i am sorry to hear of mother's bad burn with the fish. Such an experience puts one off fish and that would be a pity if it does that.  Anyhow by the time I get your letter informing me of it I have the satisfaction of knowing that she is better again.<br/>Congratulations  to Anna on her progress.<br/>I got a "Methodist" with all my screed on 'Lights Out ' in it. I almost forget writing it. It seems so strange now. It was just the expression of a mood caused by those experiences and that claimed an utterance. Anyhow if it does anyone any good I am thankful.<br/>Anna may be pleased with the enclosed letter coming to Australia with me 'apres la guerre' is one of the jokes Lucienne  &amp; I have together. I hope Anna will write to her, she is a nice simple little thing though not smart in any way her French sometime may not help Anna. All the same the interchange is interesting.<br/>Tell Ol one more day gone &amp; I am still at it in good health. I wrote her yesterday. Good fun in our trenches last night but I can't tell.<br/>Yours affecty<br/>Rid</p>
