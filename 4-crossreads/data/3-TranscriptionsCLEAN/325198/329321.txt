  
 24 June 24, 1916 Etmaler  last night When I got back off gaurd the horses were all taken out of the stables & linked up at the back, the lines & tents all cleaned up & every one had their saddles packed so I got to work & packed mine, had a bath, bought a water bag off a [Eepto?] for 6 pt & lay down on the saddle blanket out of the road of the horses & went off to sleep.  We were turned out at 1.0 am & moved off at two.  It was a beautiful night & it was nice riding along with the cool breeze blowing in one's face.  One always thinks of the Sphinx, Pyramids & veiled women being connected with these nights of Egypt   Still silent, mysterious, beautiful & [indecipherable]. 
 Then dawn came gradually  & old sol rose up in front of us & very soon we had our coats off, he is a warm chap  We arrived at about 8 oclock gave the horses a drink at the well & although the horses were famishing for a drink they turned up their noses at the brackish taste of it.  We got our lines down among a few palm trees, some horses being lucky enough to score a shady spot.  We are fixed up now again for a while tents & all.  Stand to at 3.30 in the morning just the time I can do my best high pressure snoring stunt.  Ill likely use some language when they wake me up in the morning.  Our present camp is situated about 1/2 mile west of Romani.
