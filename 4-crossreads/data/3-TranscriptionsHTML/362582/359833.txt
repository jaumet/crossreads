<p>8.<br/>I'm thinking I may want more money in England if so I shall cable. We hear all sorts of rumours about our uniform being altered. Hope shall not have to go to  too much expense, want all my money, in case I think of settling down. From your letters I'm sorry to see you are not friendly with Lucy.
