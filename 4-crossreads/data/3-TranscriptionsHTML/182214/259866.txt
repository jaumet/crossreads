<p>disentrained at a place called Steenbeck about three kils from Hazebrouck on June 26th after being in the train for 60 hours &amp; I can safely say we all enjoyed the trip up from the South of France. It was raining when we marched to our first billets, a kind of a rest camp in a field in the Village of Morbecque, a fine oldfashioned village with its church &amp; cobblestones. Life here wsa quiet and we soon got to know the place &amp; made friends. The people were very good to us here &amp; strange to say most of the shopkeepers spoke English very well. My brother was in camp about two kils from here in the Tommy army &amp; I did not know it &amp; he knew we were not far away&nbsp;&amp; could not get leave to come &amp; see me</p>
