<p>witnessed a fine bayonet charge by the Choshires, who launched an attack on Pear Hill, gaining all their objectives.  At 2 p.m. we took over from our infantry post, remaining here during the night.</p>
<p>10:  Stand to 3 a.m., moving into the wadi at noon.  Our infantry still on the enemy's heels &amp; causing them to retire across the wadi Auju.  Scores of wounded Tommies coming through our lines, only serious cases on stretchers, any who could possibly walk, had a three mile journey ahead, owing to the nature of the country, impossible to get waggons up to the line. 470 prisoners taken to-day by infantry, including 54 Huns.  Outpost at night, Mjr. Weir just saving one of our mountain howitzer batteries from falling into enemy hands.  They had lost their way when coming up to support &amp; our outpost rescued them after seven men &amp; a few mules had been hit by enemy gunfire.  We stayed on Pear Hill doing duty day &amp; night, - holding the post with 20 men of the regt. &amp; 4 of our gunners with one gun &ndash; till noon on the 16th &ndash; when the Yeomanry relieved us.  Men were glad to get away, as we could not erect bivys, as we were only 2,500 yards from the enemy, &amp; no cover except a small cave.  During the past four days the rain has hardly ceased &amp; our gear is soaking wet.  We left at 2 p.m., reaching Beitin at 9 p.m. on 16th.  This place was under water &amp; we could not lay down, the men sitting on</p>
