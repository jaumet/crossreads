The trenches throughout the night were held by our men and the Turks constituting perhaps an unique situation.
We were greatly struck by the fact that the Turkish Garrison notwithstanding its superiority in numbers we terrified by the Bedouins. Several instances occurred during the day of the Bedouins capturing odd Turks. Though armed the Turks seemed incapable of resistance & simply screamed like dying pigs. The condition of the Garrison on the whole was deplorable, & although they appeared to have food in quantity they were evidently worn out.
