<p>marching on to the canal.</p>
<p>The nights are getting quite cold, have had to start rugging our horses again. <strike>Saturday Jan. 30th 1915</strike> expect to get through <strike>drifted</strike> the canal, are only allowed to travel at 5 knots an hour.<br/> Have anchored at Ismalia tonight about halfway through the canal. There are a big encampment of Indian &amp; British troops here.</p>
<p>Saturday 30th Jan. 1915.<br/>Drifted during the night on to a sand bank, are having some trouble to get off this morning, they have had to tie a rope on to the Persic &amp; drag us off, have just got clear. This is a big lake, came through two yesterday. Saw two biplanes rise from the shore this morning, they are scouting round watching the movements of the Turks. Still passing British &amp; Indian troops, they are lined right along the canal, there are supposed to be 60,000 Indians troops alone. They are busy making trenches &amp; putting up barb wire entanglements.</p>
<p>Have had a bit of a stiff leg these last few days where that horse kicked me, went to the Doctor, he says that I have a little water under the knee, swollen a good bit &amp; <u>damn</u> painful, but I expect it will be right in a day or so. Passed another Battleship today the Swiftsure. There is a battle inland now we can see the smoke from the artillery.</p>
