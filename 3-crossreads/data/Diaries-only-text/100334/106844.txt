Sunday April 27th
After a cold night's sleep, three Blankets not being enough to keep us warm, and large cracks in the floor of the Hut, I for one did a perish and intend hunting up some more Blankets during the day, we lined up about 8 am and marched in two deep into a large Dining Room, where a Digger directed us to the Table's, 8 each side and we were well packed, in fact too many on each side and we hardly had room to move our arms, There are no arguments about Mess Orderlies, the two Men on the end have to serve out the Food which are in dishes on to plates and Tea into Cups and they are passed along, There are sufficient Table's to seat 420 Men at one sitting, The System is good causing no delays and every man has his share. On coming out you bring along your Plate and cup and place them boxes provided and outside is a Bucket of Hot Water provided to wash your knife, fork spoon.
 During the day we renewed old acquaintances from other companies, met plenty of friends. After Tea Pictures were held in the Cinema called the "Mildura Hut" and afterwards supper of Bread Cheese
