<p>12 November 1916<br/>After tossing sleeplessly most of the night, was awakened about 3 am by Davis and told that the sky was clear and the day promised to be fine. Was dressed for the journey up the line by the time that Davis had my breakfast of fried bacon, bread, butter, jam and tea ready, then buckled on my revolver and equipment and went round the 4.5 howitzer  battery to the 2nd Bde. H.Q. some 100 yards away where Brig. General Glassfurd was staying. Had only a short wait before he came along with an orderly and we set off at once on our journey up the line. Going was fairly good as there had been no rain for 2 or 3 days, but the surface of the ground   and duckboards was very slippery and in places there were small lakes of mud.<br/>The guns were quiet. LL the noise and bustle caused by the ammunition columns and rations and fatigue parties had died down and only an occasional burst of machinegun fire and the scattered pop, pop of a rifle shot along the front line broke the early morning stillness. There was no moon. The bright starlight was sufficient to enable us to distinguish outstanding objects but not the shell-holes and patches of mud. Now and then a flare shot up from some point in the line, but for the main part there was very little activity on either side.<br/>Scarcely had we got past our Bge H.Q. than we came up with Capt. Richards of the 1st Machine Gun Co. on his way up to visit some of his gun positions, and he accompanied us as far as Cheese Rd. The general was keenly observant of the country and full of questions as to relative positions of various places, unhealthy spots and so on.  At Bn. H.Q. in Bull's Rd. we picked up a guide who had been detailed to go with the general along the Right Bn. front from the gun pits, and thus reinforced we struggled on going over the top for the latter part of the journey from Cheese Rd. to the gun pits, the communication trenches in this part being (as I knew to my cost) thigh deep in mud and slush.<br/>The dawn was just about breaking so it was still pretty safe. After showing the gun pits and points of interest thereabouts, I left the general and his guide to go along the right front while I reconnoitred the way from the gun pits to the Left Bn front and sent a message for the officer on duty to come along to this end of the trench to meet us. In the middle of this the general put in an appearance, the mud   being so bad along Grease Trench that he had abandoned the attempt to traverse it. He was wearing gum boots that came up to his thighs!<br/>My messenger had not returned but with the increasing light it was dangerous to wait so we scurried across the intervening little stretch of ground and dropped into the front line trench on the other side, a proceeding which I knew was often objected to by the</p>
