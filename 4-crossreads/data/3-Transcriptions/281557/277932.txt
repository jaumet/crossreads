<p>rush to their aid again &amp; suffered heavily the last of our bombers being put "hors de combat" on Thursday night our boys charged &amp; got knocked about: from reports the trench was supposed to be almost empty &amp; no artillery preparation was given: a couple of minutes before the charge Fritz sent up flares  &amp; must have known the exact time of the stunt: the boys went over through a hell of machine gun fire: the guns were in every hole imaginable we went to get Elliot in &amp; how we got through that fire beats me: God indeed has us in his care: We worked hard &amp; were practically without tucker &amp; next morning were were done up: our O.C. ordered us a sleep &amp; we got two hours before being called out : the W. Ridings had a go at the dead end again &amp; with our boys aid got two hundred yards or more &amp; succeeded in holding it: our Major &amp; Colonel congratulated us on sticking to our work: it was Hell carrying wounded over the open through barrages of shell gas &amp; shrapnel: we had to carry through the open as the saps were blown to pieces: the artillery fire all the time was terrific on both sides &amp; we had some very miraculous escapes being hit slightly &amp; also buried a few times: our planes would not let Fritz get his balloons up &amp; also kept his 'planes back &amp; some good duels took place at times: one of ours got hit with a shell &amp; had to go down: we were relieved at last on Tues august 1st  about 6 pm &amp; toddled out: we were done up &amp; the smell of the dead bodies was beginning to be awful:</p>
