<p>Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines to let you know that I am quite well and I hope that you are both the same.</p>
<p>Well I am down in Port Said at the present for ten days on leave, well it is a break and that is all you can say about it, but of course it is a change of tucker and one thing they do not bother you much, well it is a very dirty place, like nearly all these forein places are, there is nothing to see here at all.</p>
<p>I am not writing you a letter this time only a short note, I will write a longer letter later on. I had my Photo taken yesterday so I will be sending you a couple as soon as I get them, I hope that they will be good for your sakes at home. I have just heard that we are likely to be recalled at any moment, so that means that we must be moveing out at once.</p>
<p>I am afraid that you will be disappointed with this short note. I have sent you a scarf and a table Centre I hope that you have the luck to get them safe, they are in a parcel that I sent Nell, so that you ought to go over and get them as soon as you hear that they have arrived.</p>
<p>We have been down and saw the Armenian refuggie camp, my word they are a fat and Happy lot they all look well satisfied with them selves</p>
