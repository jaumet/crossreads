has fixed my promotion up by this.  If it shd come along I wish you wd let my wife know [in margin] Mrs. J. Lamrock, Kensington St., Kogarah, & she wd send me a cable.  I was in charge of 5th Brigade for 6 or 7 weeks when the evacn. was on but I handed over tempy. to General J. Paton, to go back to Russell Top to look after my Battn. as I had lost 3 of my senior officers & was wanted there for the final job.  We were fair in it as we (the 20th) were absolutely the last men to leave the trenches.  I was in charge of all rear parties of the Brigade after 12 oclock the last night, got them all away, the last party was 1 officer & 30 men [in margin] at 3-30 from Russells Top where my Battn. had been stationed.  When they got nearly to the wharf we let go 3 mines, 4 tons of ammonel [ammonal], under the Turks forward trenches & support trenches so I leave you to imagine how they got on.  We got on board all right.  I was the last of the Bn. & Gen. Paton & his Brigade we were the last absolutely of the Army to step on Board.
