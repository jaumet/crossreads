<p>Traill, but Nelson is the only man in the Regt.capable of taking the job</p>
<p>This afternoon one of the English scouts attached to us captured 5 natives with two donkeys a good way out on the desert &amp; brought them back they were cross exmined by the Colonel through the interpreter, they said they were going to the salt lakes for salt. A penalty of 2 years can be imposed for going out at all at present, but the Col gave them the benefit of the doubt &amp; told the Egyptian Officer to let them go, the Officer then asked if he would give them a good thrashing before letting them go  but the Col. objected;</p>
<p>I have been pretty busy today getting all the Signalling gear together ready to move, but an order came through this afternoon to remain where we are till Thursday morning</p>
