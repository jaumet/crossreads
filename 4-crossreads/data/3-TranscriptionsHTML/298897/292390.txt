<p>without an M.O.  Extracted a shrapnel bullet from a mans foot, the first I had done by myself altho' I had assisted at hundred.  Had a few Germans through also.  Men very dirty &amp; muddy altho' not so bad as those of a week previous.  All were pleased at a victory but the majority appeared to blame our own artillery for their wounds.  Finished up about 7 A.M. had breakfast &amp; then went off to the German Camp.  Had an interesting discussion again on interesting topics.  He defended the murder of Capt Fryatt as he contended that he had acted as a pirate attempting to sink a U boat, a war vessel at a time when he had been ordered to hove to;  he likened the case to that of a civilian shooting a soldier.  Nurse Cavell he held was a spy so had to be shot.  The destruction of "Louvain" etc were reprisals against the people for shooting at soldiers.  Gas attacks he held were less severe than artillery as a remedy could be devised.  The Cossacks &amp; French blacktroops he stated, they were under orders not to capture but to kill, the one for murderous assaults on women in Eastern Prussia &amp; the other for cutting the throats &amp; mutilating the dead after battle.  Indians on the other hand were well treated &amp; looked after at the expense of the Kaiser.  In the afternoon I went to "Albert" to draw stores (drugs) &amp; had a good look at the church.  Certainly it was a fine building &amp; beautifully finished inside but was sadly smashed up by the shells.  The image on the tower still hangs in a threatening attitude. Did not feel unduly tired after my 36 hours spell of duty except when sitting alongside</p>
