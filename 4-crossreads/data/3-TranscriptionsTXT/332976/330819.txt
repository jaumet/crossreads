March 191719th continued   around here is in a far better state than the country we have been in of late.   The difference is marked after one leaves Fritz's late support trenches.   The ground between Millers Son & Fritzs third line is literally strewn with dead, & presents a gastly sight- beyond description.   Fritz has left a terrible lot of material behind him, but it can be noticed throughout the village & surrounding country, where he has piled the stuff in heaps & attempted to burn it.The weather has been bad lately & to-day a strong S.W. wind has been blowing, & at about tea time it started to rain & continued steadily throughout the night.
