Cold but fine & windy. Got orders to march to the lines about mid day. Relieved 1st 7th & 5th Field Ambulance about dusk. 7th had some heavy casualtys - 14th had 45 killed or wounded 5th also got a rough time - I heard N. Hill got a nice blighty on the hand and knee.
Two of our fellows got knocked badly before we reached our destination. Went up to R.A.P. on the Bullecourt front, which is in a sunken Road - under observation - no cover - we all admit this is the limit & the hottest joint we have yet struck. Gordon Highlanders and Devons came in on our left. Fritz observed them changing over & gave us particular Hell. Going our very hardest all night. Had a good squad - B. Trail, P. McMahon, E. Hand & self. We hope that the luck which we have always had will stick to us.
