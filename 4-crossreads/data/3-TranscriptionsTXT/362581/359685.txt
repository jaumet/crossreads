XOXOXOOXOXOXOXOXOMy darling Eddy,
Wrote a letter to Grin, Mammie   &  Aunts this morning since that a mail has come in, with a letter from Auntie Ethel dated June 25th   &   I'm so delighted at getting it - also one  from Annie Thomas   &  Counsin Alice.
So glad to hear you have gone to school   &  like it so much, hope you will get on well    &  have good health to help you at your work. It will be my birthday in two days time but not much like it away from home. Hope I get the cake all right. Fondest love   &  kisses From auntie Eadle.
