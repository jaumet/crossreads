  
 [Friday 11 August 1916] 
 Lot of men have been in to see me Bushies mostly -Sisters at very top here same Routine & Tucker as in No 1-  This hospital was at Lemnos & the Sisters all experienced.  They cursed the L.H. keeping them in Egypt- till this scrap came- now they are happy- got something to do. These are the DINKUM sisters.  No 3 General was the Hospital at Lemnos in all the mud etc & no conveniences. Some more 1st LH Officers came in last night.  Knocked out by Camel ride after being wounded its hell in those Casolets. Poor Lt Ronny Macdonald killed yesterday 8 officers out of 1st LH.  [indecipherable]
