8/9/16Bideford, Bucks Cross, Colvelly, Appledore, Northam. Took motor for Clovelly after breakfast and the patriarchal old chauffeur turned out to be a red hot scorcher and tore round the many corners of these twisty old roads at a speed that made one rather apprehensive at anything getting in our way. Beyond damaging a dog, no other casualties resulted. Along hedge lined lanes, past woods and snug thatched farmhouses and barns reminiscent of Steenwerck district, through Bucks Cross. Glimpses of the sea occur, and many a snatch of exquisite countryside, until you pass the head of the Hobby drive and glide through a particularly fine lot of thatched and whitewashed houses just outside Clovelly. Walking down from here one looks almost straight down hundreds of green tree covered cliff to the sea below but terraced from top to bottom is the unique doll-house like village of Clovelly. The High Street turns like a corkscrew and is in cobbled steps. The only animal traffic practicable is donkeys. The chimneys of one house vent their smoke on a level with the garden of that above. The street winds through at least one building and at last reaches the stony beach where are the Red Lion inn and a little old quay. The cliffs tower all round.
