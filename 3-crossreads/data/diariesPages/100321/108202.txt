23/2/19 Marcinelle
The doctor and his wife did Gorman myself in style yesterday evening. He is elderly and speaks good English. They produced some excellent old wine which made us merry. This morning the General left on his trip to Cologne and I took over from him. At 10.30 we had a Brigade church parade in the Cinema Hall and Generals Rosenthal Martin and Birdwood were there. After parade B. met all the senior officers of the Divn. and talked a good deal about things in general. The question of War Gratuity was mentioned by him as very likely. He and W.M. Hughes seem rather at loggerheads as politicians Imperial soldiers don't fuse. In the afternoon I took a walk up the streets of Charleroi
