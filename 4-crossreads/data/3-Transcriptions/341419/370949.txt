<p>that in 4&frac12; years active service in the Field I had only been in Hosp. once.  Two days after coming aboard I got the Flu.  Came out of Hosp. 4 or 5 days afterwards &amp; then discovered that I couldn't eat or smoke.  I doped myself with everything I could think of to no purpose.  I hung on till we reached Colombo, &amp; then I got a pain in my chest &amp; went to Hospital again &amp; was diagnosed Pleurisy which I think was wrong as I am all right again now about 4 days afterwards.  But by this time I am a perfect skeleton.</p>
<p>It was curious when we first got aboard, one was meeting fellows you had not seen for two and three years.</p>
<p>They reckon we will hit Melbourne on the 19th Dec.  But I may be dead from starvation before then.</p>
