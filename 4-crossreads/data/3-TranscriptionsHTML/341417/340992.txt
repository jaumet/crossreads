<p>I cannot get home quick enough for I just detest this country.</p>
<p>I hope you are in good health after all your good work which you did for us during the war and I sincerely hope you are enjoying the peace which we took such a big part in bringing about.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrive in Sydney Miss King and am free I shall call on you so I hope you are still at Elga so I will be able to call on you and know where to go.</p>
<p>I will now fetch this letter to a close as it is getting near sleeping time.</p>
<p>With Best Wishes and Kindest Regards<br/>Yours Sincere Friend<br/>Sgt. R. Otto<br/>2nd Btn AIF</p>
