19172nd June.In one corner a group of niggers were squatting on their haunches and chattering - in another an Irish-Liverpool fireman was torturing a waltz out of a concertina to a rapt group of assorted cockneys, & other former occupants of the foc'sl.  A small corner was partitioned off for officers - prominent playing bridge being the venerable looking Captain of the barque "Dee" - a pious white-bearded old fraud who bore the classic sobriquet of "Mudguts".
An armed sentry marches to and fro among the prisoners night & day.  Finally, we were each given a hammock of brown canvas & a blanket; slung same in a corner of the bulkhead up against the mine-chamber and tried to sleep.
