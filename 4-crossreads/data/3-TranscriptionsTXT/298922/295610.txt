Wednesday 7th November 1917
Went Red X office & A.I.F. Headquarters, it will take "wangling" to travel with Dolly as I am booked to leave on the 14 inst. with a draft.
Lunched at Australian Club, Piccadilly, quite a nice place. Aldy Isherwood & wife are to arrive tonight at Berners Hotel where we are staying.
Slept well I'm glad to say.
Capt. ISHERWOOD is a year older than Dolly & has a very pretty wife who I met in Egypt.
