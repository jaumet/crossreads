We met a 'Sumatra' chap - He asked us where we'd been - we were dirty & torn & sun - Up Die Mutter we said - He said Come & have a drink - N & I had a bottle each of Lager - Well this was A1 & privately I told Nelson we ought to go round the fleet & say we'd been up Die Mutter.  However we sent a signal to the Fantome & got a boat & inboard by 2 pm - I jumped into the Ditch to cool off & had a very good time - Bumpus & Gauntlet - cursing loudly because I woke & splashed them blow their scuttles "with very big feet" - at least so they said - I I did not know about it at the time -I had a second go in the Ditch with Fitz about 5.30 & went  to bed early - Die Mutter is the big volcano that towers over Rabaul - you look over sea & island & the main lands of New Britain & New Ireland.  The view is superb but you must earn it, by a couple of hours, even 3 - of hard physical graft -
