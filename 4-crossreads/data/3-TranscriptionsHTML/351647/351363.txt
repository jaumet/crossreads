<p>France<br/>6 January</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Just received two letters from you, glory be, on 13th October, one 21st October &amp; I'm very bucked up in consequence.</p>
<p>I'm glad you liked the photo, it <strike>was</strike> is very vague &amp; my bandolier had slipped but every one seems to like it.  I had one taken in Paris since &amp; I sent you one, oh very martial.</p>
<p>It is snowing hard outside &amp; everything covered in white.</p>
<p>Last night <strike>it</strike> was absolutely the coldest ever I think.  It blew like fun &amp; the wind came in our little shanty.  It froze half a bucket of water absolutely solid so you can gather I wasn't altogether warm all night.</p>
<p>It really is just the weirdest climate.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the Bulletins &amp; the socks, beautiful gray ones with mauve silk ornamentation.  They are lovely &amp; soft &amp; warm &amp; if I were French &amp; had a tot or two of rum to make me let myself go I could be most thrillingly eloquent.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tobacco.  It is lovely to have the old brand.  Tell Mac I still suck and curse at my pipes &amp; go out into the dark &amp; cold to look for bits of wire or splinters to jam through them.</p>
<p>Well Christmas is over &amp; New Year is well started.  I think I told you about Christmas Day.  Well New Year's Eve we had a very festive little party down here.  I was a little above normal I must admit, joined in all the choruses which were more</p>
