<p>Jan 29<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;I got up &amp; had breakfast &amp; caught 8.30 A.M. train to Calais, where I had dinner &amp; caught 1.20 P.M. to Bailleul - (on the Paris trip a man travells in comfort on a French civilian train paying his own fare, which is quarter rate to Soldiers) had supper at Marie Louise&#39;s Joint &amp; walked out to the park where I arrived 8.P.M. where I told of the good time I had spent in Paris &amp; I swore that I would never go to Blighty again on leave, Paris will always do me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jan 30<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking shop again now - The lorry had&#39;nt been out since I left, Jim went to Blighty on leave on 21<sup><u>st</u></sup>&nbsp;last night was cold but to-day is warm &amp; the sun bright, I spent the day reading in the lorry - a 15 minute barage at night .</p>
<p>&mdash; otherwise all quiet&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
<p>Jan 31<sup><u>st</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a bit colder to-day. I stayed in the lorry all day &amp; studdied French which I wanted to learn for my next leave in Paris. I wrote several letters in the evening -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>February 1<sup><u>st</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing doing to-day - cold misty day, had the back down all day &amp; studdied french by artificial light &amp; read all day&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
