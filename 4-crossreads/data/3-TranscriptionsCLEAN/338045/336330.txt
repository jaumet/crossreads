(Received mine to-day.)  As usual I have the job of taking back my section, of whom I know not one.  Dinner & a rainy afternoon.  Censoring letters until 6 p.m. & tea.  Sergeants' Mess meeting until 8 p.m. & then to my tent.  A cold & miserable rainy night.  Camp under these conditions is no good.  Meet several old pals to-day:-  Sgt. David from A.I.F. Hdqrs., now on 1st Anzac, Ray Ruhan from Town Hall, Will [?] McDonald
