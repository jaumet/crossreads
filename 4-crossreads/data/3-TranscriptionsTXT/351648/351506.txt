 Australian nurses at one of the French Hospitals I shall go in again as often as I can.  I knew them at Hospital when I was a resident, they have promised to introduce me to a charming French V.A.D.  Life is beginning to become interesting again &ndash; what!  I completely wormed myself into their good graces by taking them a lot of sugar &amp; biscuits as their rations are not the best in the French hospitals &amp; sugar is absolutely unobtainable at shops, so "my marble is good" as they say in the Classics. 
 Well I must write other Aust. letters now, thank you awfully for the coat &amp; for the papers that come along regularly &amp; are a great boon. 
 Send me a copy of the book "tout de suite" &amp; don't be too severe on the kid &ndash; you wouldn't expect your son to feed out of your hand &ndash; what! 
 My regards to John. 
 With all best wishes Yrs very sincerely J.B. Metcalfe 
 P.S.  Did I tell you I was a Major now?
