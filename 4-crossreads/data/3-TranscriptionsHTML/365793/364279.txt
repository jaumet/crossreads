<p>June 29  to wait until Tuesday for that eye. Went (with several of the boys in a drag) to a sort of garden party, &amp; it was pretty decent too, only the rain pelted down when things were going strong, &amp; the wind blew like one thing. Yes &ndash; its great weather for summer time! Five more chaps are living with us now, so guess our family looks promising</p>
<p>30 H.O. today. All except A class men leave shortly for Monte Video Camp &ndash; which is another mile or so from town. Went for a nice long walk over the downs &amp; along the beautiful lanes</p>
