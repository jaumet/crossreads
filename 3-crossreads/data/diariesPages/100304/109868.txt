Edinburgh, Glasgow the Trossachs. up at 8 and left by the 9.6 train on Cooks Trossach trip. Detrained at Aberfoyle and coached to Loch Katrin passing through the most delightful and enchanting scenery which defies description. In many places the place reminded me ofImbros particularly in regard to the bare barren hills with their steep rocky sides and grazing black faced sheep. Boarded a boat at Loch Katrine which is a lovely lake with the most perfect reflections in the water. Loch Achray is a little gem though and we passed it before reaching Loch Katrine. From there we coached to Loch Lomond passing through rugged grand country. Our old driver (named Cleland) had driven the same coach for 49 years but has not yet been to Edinburgh and a youth of 14 proudly informed us in the broadest accents, that he had never been inside a railway train. Nearing Loch Lomond the road is most beautiful. We had afternoon tea at Inversnaid Hotel and after wandering round the falls there boarded a steamer and went right through Loch Lomond and its beauties calling at many sidings The lower part of the loch is studded with little green islands. Reaching Balloch pier we boarded the waiting train and arrived in Glasgow at 7.20 pm having covered 170 miles in 11 hours by road water and rail. The arrangements were excellent, no delay just step off steamer on to train so on. Cols Hutchinson with us
