A perfect Australian sunny day with a light breeze blowing. The Transport men out shepherding the mobs of grazing horses lie in the grass and think of home. In the distance over rolling grass land is the little village of Morez. Skylarks up aloft trilling out their songs and many aeroplanes aloft. To get a day like this after months and months of dullness is like taking a draught of wine. Took out ?C? Coy and put them through their attack practices, the barrages being shown by flags manipulated under the direction of that animated mushroom clothed in purple and fine linen - . Tried the 2 wave principle and consider that a 2 pace extension leads to dangerous bunching. At 10.45 sent the men in (they are looking very fit at present) and let them get their lunch at 11 a.m. and their kit ready to fall in at noon. Last night there was dirty work by rifle and m.g. fire and heavy gunning on our left as the Hun counterattacked the 3rd Army. Hear that Fontaine is in our hands and surely Bullecourt becomes untenable
