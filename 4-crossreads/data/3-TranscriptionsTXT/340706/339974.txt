20vain.
While at Corps I am told that my pay book has been discovered though I was unaware of its loss. I go to Railway & obtain it & then go to Paymaster to get some cash but find that it is mutilated & the most important pages torn out & that I can obtain no money. This is unfortunate as I had decided to let the duty slide & visit Bruxelles & any other large town that came my way. However the PM promises me an advance if I can get an identification from Corp.
I go to night to Cafe Central & met Man whom I last saw at Liverpool in the 4th Bn. He introduces me to two of his friends both Gaby one of whom is french & the other Belgian. When Cafe is closed I go to supper in a little cafe & met one of the Gabys I dine with a [ISO] of 2nd Div. & then wander about street & put up in a private hotel
4-1-1919As I had seen adjutant & been officially relieved of my command I take my time to day for my trip to Bruxelles with or without pay is decided on. I shave & wash in my rooms at the annexe of L'Hotel de l'Europe & visit Paymaster who generously advances me 200 f (7.13.4) just on my word that I have cash
