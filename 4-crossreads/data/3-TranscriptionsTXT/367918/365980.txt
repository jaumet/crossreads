 Dear Judge, I have just had a letter from Professor Holme, telling me that you had mentioned me to him. That was awfully decent of you. When the educational scheme started to come into force I hesitated about applying for an English University course because I was not sure as to the pecuniary situation &amp; thought that it would be very

 difficult to get. But as I was very keen to do something I compromised and put in for a job with a Scottish solicitor Mr Scott Moncrieff of Edinburgh &ndash; who offered me a place in his office and an opportunity to attend University lectures on Roman law outside of office hours. 
 Professor Holme told me he thought I would get it all right but asked if I didn't think a University course would be better. As I am going on leave in a week I am going to 
 see him and be advised. 
 Just at present I'm laid up with a touch of sinivitis. Don't know what I've done to merit this as I haven't played football for the last month. However its going on all right. 
 Your chocolate is still arriving O.K. You know, Judge, you spoil me in every way. 
 Haven't heard anything of Caesar for donkey's ages. 
 Life at present is very dull &ndash; all the old officers have gone and their places taken by those who have just arrived from Australia. The Educational scheme is the only thing that is keeping me alive. 
 For a while they had me on Bde H.Q. understudying the Staff Captain but when they amalgamated the 1st &amp; 2nd Bdes I was not necessary and was very glad to get back to the Bn. 
 I had 19 days in Brussels with the Bn band and my experiences there would fill a book &ndash; so I wont attempt to describe them. 
 My love to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; Dorothy &amp; salaams to Keith 
 Yours sincerely [indecipherable]
