<p>July 5th<br/>Very quiet here, tho tonight Diddler came in &amp; told us that the Kurds attacked his village this morning &amp; he gave them a go with his two Sgts. &amp; 13 [Indecipherable]..  The Kurds retired &amp; Diddle chased them for about 20 miles &amp; then returned to write his report to find that tho he chased the main body of Kurds another group came round the back &amp; carried off all the stock.  He had one man killed &amp; is only sure of killing one Kurdish horse.</p>
