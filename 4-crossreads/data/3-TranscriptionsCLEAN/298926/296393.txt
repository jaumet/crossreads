  
 I'd though my will could master stern temptations wily snare             But she gripped me in her clutches sapped my brain & left me bare                Man's poor strength is puny feeble when he walks the trail of Vice                       I, who braved my parent's teaching, ridiculed their good advice 
 Think, then when temptation offers In the person of a friend.                     The devil uses traitrous weapons when he seeks to work your end                          Do not let your better nature pander to the devil's tools                                                  For the life that he would lead you is the "Paradise of Fools"
