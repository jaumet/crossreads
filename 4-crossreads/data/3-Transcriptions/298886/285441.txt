<p>Made arrangements for having an "Egyptian Mail" sent out daily from Minia. We never get any news here at all about things which happen in Egypt. The weather has been very hot today and it was warm work riding to town</p>
<p>The Corporal in charge of the 9 oclock "feed up' party has just come along with the pleasant intelligence that 5 of my horses are without nosebags! Very nice!  "C" Squadron have packed up their gear and most of them have their nosebags strapped to their saddles in anticipation of a hurried turnout tonight and they have (under cover of darkness) taken 5 of my nosebags and the worse crime is they have taken them off the horses when feeding. The most contemptable action that can well be imagined. Some men are absolutely soulless, and callous to a degree. I would much rather forego my dinner any time than take the nosebag off a feeding horse. Such conduct is reprehensible but what remedy in the dark? I have got a broad green strike painted around the middle of all my bags but how am I to identify that green stripe in the dark? Words fail me I cannot even swear. However I have sent a couple of lads to make</p>
