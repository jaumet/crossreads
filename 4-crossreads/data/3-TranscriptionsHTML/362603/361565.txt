<p>Bulford<br/>16/12/17<br/>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,<br/>I have been up to London for a couple of days.  I had to get some money &amp; Ellis &amp; I had both written to the Firm &amp; had no reply.  It appears that they have been very busy &amp; the letters were overlooked; And, they were quite willing to let us have the money but they had no authority to give it to us.  I want Dad to pay another &pound; 10 to the Firm for each of us; also, to get the Firm to write to the London office giving them authority to supply us with money if we wish to draw.  I saw Mr Devereau &amp; also Mrs. Bob Davis &amp; another Lady from the shop who have come over to England to buy for the firm.  After I received my money I went up to H.Q. to meet a chap on the Staff who was a good pal of mine when He was on the staff of this Hospital.  I met Him &amp; we went to Tea &amp; then to the Theatre afterwards.  I've enclosed a programme but that does not give You any idea of the show.  It is a spy play acted in Gibraltar at the outbreak of War.  It is very very good &amp; you know that I don't like dramas as a rule.<br/>I met Young Williams who was a Sunday-School pupil of mine once.  You Know the one who had a red-headed Aunt &amp; whose Father kept that Grammar School in Burwood.  I think He the father married the Aunt or she Kept House for Him anyway.</p>
