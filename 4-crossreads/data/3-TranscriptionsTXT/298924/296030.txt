 Monday 17 February 1919 Last night we trucked the remainder of our horses to the Remount Depot, Moascar.  O.C.s Squadron keeping one horse only. Wet &amp; cold &amp; I cannot shake my cold off. Polo team in Cairo doing well, winning all before them, against the pick of the English players &amp; the pick of all the Ponies in Egypt. Stilling living in uncertainty in regards to embarking but I do think the end of the month will see us away.
