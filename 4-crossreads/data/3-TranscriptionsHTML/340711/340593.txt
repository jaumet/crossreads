<p>Monday 24.<br/>Diarroehia not too good. Wired for leave till Thursday morning. Granted. Party, M.B. and the Mascot and I to Black Spur. Left 10.30 am. Had dinner at "The Hermitage" (German kept). Magnificent grounds. Tropical growth of tree ferns---one could be lost in them. Our journey back---beautiful country. Returned to Allambee about 6 pm. Yarned in evening after music. Went to bed early.</p>
<p>Tuesday 25.<br/>Very hot. Easy day. M.N. very sympathetic---played piano all evening. M.B. and I encouraged her and listened. M.B. depressed because misunderstanding with M. She regained her usual lightheardedness. Great saying Healesville: &ndash;"This is the life".</p>
<p>Wednesday 26.<br/>Cashed wire &amp;pound:10. Returned from Taglawirra where M.B. and M.N. and I spent the day. The former drove in buggy with me and the latter rode a little white pony. Pretty drive. Trip to Creek (Canoe Ck) Pony played up. Saw Mills. All sat out on lawn while M.B. sang (in evening). I promised to return there when I got back to Australia.</p>
<p>Thursday 27.<br/>M.B. called me at 5.30 am. Good breakfast. She walked down to P.O. and I caught train nicely. Arrived in Camp with kit at 12 noon, after catching wrong car and having to lug kit up---no cab. Just in time to scribble my name on kit and put it on wet on transport as it left the camp. Reported then to Embarkation Office and found I was down to go alright. Wrote letters in afternoon in Melbourne. and at Camp at night. Retired 10.30 pm.</p>
