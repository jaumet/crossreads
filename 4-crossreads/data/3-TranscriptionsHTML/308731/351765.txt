<p>I can't write much because I can't think of anythink.  I am going to start a letter for you on Sunday that's all I know.</p>
<p>Much love from Ruth<br/>xxx etc.<br/>ooo etc.</p>
<p>[Note from mother]<br/>A P.S of my letter.  I <strike>am</strike> have written my letter in front of room heater &ndash; we do as you used to always like doing &ndash; bring room heater into our bedroom &amp; sit round it &amp; warm our nighties on it &ndash; the dining room keeps nice &amp; tidy &ndash; but oh! The poor bedroom in the morning would cause grandma heart failure.  It is 11 here now &ndash; so will be in the afternoon where you are &ndash; as I suppose it is much the same in France. I dare not let myself think of where you might be &amp; what you might be doing.  Dear Arthur I do not <u>worry</u> about you really.  I only think &amp; think, &amp; hope &amp; hope &ndash; I don't often ever feel <u>miserable</u> &ndash; &amp; what do you think I am 9 stone 4 &ndash; 10lbs heavier than when you went &ndash; I was 9/2 when we were married. But 10/2 when at Young &ndash; so expect to see a great fat floppity old thing when you come back to me next Christmas.  Perhaps you could manage to get off this winter &ndash; because it would be more cosy now than in the summer.  Lots &amp; lots of very best love. From Annie</p>
