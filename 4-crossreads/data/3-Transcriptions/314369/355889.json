<p>14 September 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>Feeling a bit better but still pretty rotten, I don't seem to have a particle of strength left, it is quite an effort to sit up in bed even.<br/>Foot doing well it will be right long before I am well by the look of things</p>
<p>1915 September 15<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>A little improvement not so many pains but still weak  &amp;  miserable<br/>Taken the bandage off my foot  &amp;  painted w/- iodine to allow it to finish healing in the air</p>
