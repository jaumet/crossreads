 I shall send you some more after a time, when they will be more thorughily ripened.   Owing to the pods being large and numerous there will be no difficulty in collecting a supply.   Good bye for the present, I am going to dinner.   I have a great desire for a rice pudding. Why? I do not know, but it has been with me for two days, and were you near I should ask you to make one for me.   I miss some one to look after the things that are placed before me to eat but that cannot be helped for the present, I fancy sometimes that you spoiled me when I was at home, neither can that be helped at this stage of my existence. 
 Enclosed you will find a neat account of what it feels like to be under a Zeppelin.   I do not know what other people think, but it looks to me that the Germans are enterprising beyond expectations with these engines of destruction.  You may remember how some months back it was being constantly noised abroad that the enemy was in possession of but a certain number of these great floating bags, and announcing number this and that has been destroyed there cannot be more available.   Yet even now they appear to be more numerous and enterprising than has been exhibited during earlier phases of the contest.   And so the great game goes on, becoming beyond the grasp of the ordinary intelligence. 
 In the newspaper of this evening we are told of the speeches being made by Mr. Lloyd George to get the workmen of Britain to make shells and other munitions for the fighting line.   Is it not dredful to think that such an appeal is necessary, when the best of the people are fighting so strenuously for the safety and honour of the Empire. 
 This afternoon I was surprised by an old friend calling upon me, a Dr. Pentland formerly of Maitland and Singleton , he came as medico on one of the troop ships and is temporarily attached to No. 1 hospital.  He looks much older than when I last saw him, that was in N. Zealand last year. 
 And now to finish for this mail. Good bye my dears. Ever Ever shall I thank God that He who made each of you fair has also made each of you good.   To my friends please convey my best wishes and kindest regards.  To your-selves do I send heaps of love and loads of kisses. Your loving and affectionate father John B Nash
