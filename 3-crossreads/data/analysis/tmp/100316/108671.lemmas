Busi myself with the question of promot and will be put up some N.C.Os . for their commiss . The question of honour and reward is also a one that requir go into . We had an earli dinner and I rode out into Franvil . Found that not a tremend satisfactori amount of billet had been done and had to butt round myself . Saw Colonel Traver ( D.S.O. bar ) of the 26th at Mess with his offic and yarn with them . Then took a walk around the trench which are wide and full of quit good bivouac . Met a littl French kiddi whose Mother ( a nice woman ) I had been fix up domest arrang with as she is the patron . She is go away tomorrow as a refuge owe to the shell . The littl boy is 4 . I ask him where his Father is and he said " a la guerr . " Ah ! la pauv petit , son papa est mort sur le front depui troi anne .
