  
 had a bottle of rum in a bag but some of the beggars pinched that also.  It was wonderful that no one was run in over it but the officers kept out of the way & allowance was made for the conditions so nothing came of it.  I managed to get quarters in a house & slept splendidly in a bed on the floor 
 Saturday 14th Oct O.S. for the day.  Nothing much to do except fixing up billets for the men during the day.  Owing to some of the chaps playing up we had to arrest 6 & put them under guard.  It had the desired affect as the remainder were more careful.  Beer wine etc is far too easily obtained & many men are never satisfied unless they are continually boozing & making beasts of themselves causing more trouble than they are worth.  The place we arranged for our mess turned out splendid.  They knew all the 1st Field chaps so we were tres bon with them.  All the people speak English well & tis a regular home, sitting by the fireside & yarning.  This particular crowd are much superior to the females we have met previously, we usually come in contact with the roughs so that this time was a vast difference & the more enjoyable as one
