 A fine day but not as clear & bright as yesterday. Had rather a troublesome night & abt. 10 o'c. set off to find a dentist & made an appt. with him (a Canadian Capt.) for 2 p.m. Went on into town with Prescott & the other officer who was with us (Moy) & stayed with them transacting business for our Officers' Mess, & then had lunch there with Prescott, having sardines, boiled fowl & sauce, fried steak & potatoes, tinned apricots & tea for 3f. each. Had rather painful attention from the dentist who started to kill the nerves of a large back tooth, & then went out to Paris Plage to get some photos left there, coming straight back by the same train. Not equal to any dinner & glad to turn into bed. The blowing of "Retreat" altered to 7.15 p.m. showing how much the days are lengthening.
