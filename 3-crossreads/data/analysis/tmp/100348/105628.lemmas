 16/10/16 . A stiff march today , about 20 mile . All the way we pass through charm sceneri . If Picardi is is pretti in the Summer time ; this Department-de-Calai is beauti in the Autumn . March though the larg villag of Watten . Pass anoth larg castl ; much older than the one I saw yesterday ; a real old Norman stronghold . Three compani , and all the offic are billet in a big chateau here . It is a fine place ; was the properti of an enemi subject ; and it has been seiz by the French Govern . Pick big , luscious , blackberri this even . The sign say that we will rest here a day or two . We have hustl over 50 mile dure the past three day wherefor the hurri I wonder ?
