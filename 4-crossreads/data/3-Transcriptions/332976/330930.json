Fritz has been bombing heavily all<br/>30th   Returned home 4 AM to Cafe Belge.   The section left Zillebeke Lake yesterday afternoon.   The Tommie Engrs have taken over from us &amp; are moving into this camp to-morrow.   We are very tired after our spell but have had a very easy day.   To-night Fritzs planes came over &amp; dropped a few bombs very near our camp but we had no casualties.   Our casualties in the stunt are as follows 10 killed 2 missing 20 wounded Lt Turner &amp; Sgt Elliott are missing.<br/>(28th    I went out this afternoon with 2 sappers to test a well I found near Glencourse Wood &amp; also continue the reconoisance.
