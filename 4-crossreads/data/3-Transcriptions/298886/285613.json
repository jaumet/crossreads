Bourne &ndash; see Glossary below] to go out several miles beyond Kateb Gannet to a newly named Hill &ndash; MERIDITH HILL to make a Sketch of the country where the outpost line would be stationed for the night (The regiment by the way was ordered out for outpost at 5.30 pm.)I went on ahead and reached MERIDITH HILL and made several sketches before the sun went down Then I gave assistance in laying telephone lines to a spot where the regimental Head Quarters were to be for the night</p>
<p>7.pm.<br/>All the Squadrons on outpost duty and the signallers on duty at the telephone we held a line between MEREDITH HILL and a clump of palms called HOD. EL-ENNA 2 miles at least. Everything  peaceful and quiet. Reports "all clear" going through each hour to Brigade Head Quarters.<br/>10pm.<br/>Tried to have a sleep but was frequently interrupted by horsemen riding over our telephone wire and breaking it.</p>
<p>Report came in from the outpost line "Some firing going on immediately in front of our outposts possibly an enemys patrol feeling for weak places."</p>
<p>11pm. Intermittant firing going on nothing too serious. Good deal of shifting troop about placing them to</p>
