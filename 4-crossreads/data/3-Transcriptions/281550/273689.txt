<p><u>July</u><br/>first captured I was doing the same thing, Afterwards when I began to get parcels from England there was no necessity to do it. You can imagine what sort of treatment Prisoners-of-War receive, when their own civil prisoners are starved so much as this.</p>
<p>The reasons why the Germans take our tins from us, is to prevent us from escaping, or getting any poison through in them.</p>
<p>Yesterday July the 27th I was speaking to three girls who have just arrived here from England., their ages are 8, 7, and 5 years. Their Mother is an English woman &amp; their Father is a German.</p>
<p>They told me that their Father had only just been sent back, He had been interned for a long time in England as a civillian prisoner. Neither the girls or their mother can speak German. It sounds very funny to us to hear English spoken in the streets &amp; by children too.</p>
