who have been out just a little over a fortnight have to go in again. Saw a balloon of ours come a "gutser" this afternoon. I think a Taube shot her down for we saw one high above here when she started to fall, out flew 2 parachutes one floated like a huge umbrella over towards us but I could not see no one hanging on to her the other parachute had a man on alright for she descended rapidly a bit too fast I think for the chap on her, the old balloon turned over over as she neared the ground, I dare say fell a wreck.
Len was sent ahead as billeting N.C.O. to these huts.
