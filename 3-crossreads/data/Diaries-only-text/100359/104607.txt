The 3rd Highland F. Amb. is in charge,, and a party of them were playing croquet on the lawns when we arrived. Serg. Johnnie Moore asked one of us to go Cook, until the rest of our crowd arrived, so just for a change I took it on. The scotties are a very decent crowd and made us feel quite "at Home" They cooked the tea, and Mac and I washed up. There were tables and chairs, knives and forks, and even a big clock and pictures on the wall. We had bully beef, cheese jam and butter for tea, and it was quite a treat to feel ones legs under a table again. After tea a party of 8 went out to the trenches. The rest of us stayed in and played cards.
Saturday 22nd
Arose from my virtuous couch at 7.30 washed and shaved then played a game of croquet before having breakfast. The Scotties cooked the Bacon and got breakfast ready and I washed up assisted by Laycock and Sullivan. After breakfast, I had a look through some of the ruined houses in our vicinity. Every house for miles around is in Ruines and 
they are just as the occupants left them during the bombardment. Pictures still hanging on the walls, and clothing of every description lying about. In one house was a baby's cot all complete with its little sheers and a pretty quilt. Near by was a baby's hat, a straw, trimmed with forget-me-nots. It nearly made me cry when I saw it. We went into a milliners and there were scores of hats of all shapes, trimmed and untrimmed, some of them had the prices marked on and varied from 10 F to 40 francs. Hat pins and belt buckles were there in abundance, but mostly of a cheap quality. One big drawer was full of kiddies hats, and they were sweet and pretty. Of course we had no business in these places and would have got into serious trouble had we been caught, but luck was with us.
