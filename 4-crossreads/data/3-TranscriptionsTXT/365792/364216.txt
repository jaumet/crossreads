One would hardly realise that the world is at war, if it were not for the many tents dotted here &amp; there on the landscape, &amp; the groups of soldiers passing to &amp; fro along the roads. And yet &ndash; what hidden dangers may be lurking beneath the calm surface of yon sea, what enemies even in our midst.
