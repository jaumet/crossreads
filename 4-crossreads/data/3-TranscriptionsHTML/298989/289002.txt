<p>Sinai<br/>7/3/16<br/>Up at dawn and got the men on to packing up and getting into full marching order. Struck tents after breakfast and sent stacks of wood, boxes and other rubbish down to the incinerator. Fell in fatigues and sent them over &amp; over the ground picking up and then send long "waves" of men through picking up the remainder of the stuff. Camels roaming and bubbling as their loads are put on and the scene is a very busy one. Noticed some of the camels have their tails tattooed like the Cairo donkeys.</p>
<p>A very hot day and a good many water bottles emptied before the march even commenced. Fell in finally at 1130, the N.Z. mounted rifles have taken over &amp; laid down their horse lines. The amount of stuff that a move discloses is wonderful. The incinerator has been a raging furnace all the morning, consuming a lot of rubbish and not a few good things. Rather than carry an extra blanket or their iron rations men will fling these into the fire if not checked. The packs with the roll of blankets and waterproof sheet around them are great burdens and with 150 rounds of ball and a rifle added make the soldiers load of heavy one.</p>
<p>Moved off with our band playing in great heat at 1200 and turned back on Brighton Beach Hog's Back and the other waste places. Halted for 5 minutes after every 20 minutes marching. Was mounted on an English charger but carried a pack on my shoulders which was a devil of a weight. Along the line of march we constantly passed strings of camels going along with their peculiar swaying gait and with their picturesque drivers. The true Arab wears a coil of horsehair twisted round a head shawl which gives the headdress its burnous look. At Railhead we struck the road and at once the men bucked up and said it was like "walking on a springboard". Passed the N.Z. Mounted Rifles Ambulance and also some motor transport. After the yielding sand it was a wonderful relief to get on this good road. No men were allowed to fall out without a signed pass &amp; poor chaps they hailed every passing nigger</p>
