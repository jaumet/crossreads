<p>Wednesday 5 December 1917.</p>
<p>In bivouac 1 mile from main Jaffa road but hardly yet out of range of Jacko&#39;s Jack Johnsons <s>6</s> 5.9 inch Howitzer guns, but partly protected by sand dunes right against our position.</p>
<p>Watered camels &amp; filled fantasies at Richon Zion village which is the best village we have come across. People mostly French &amp; well spoken.</p>
<p>Had a look round the shops and bought figs, <s>&amp;</s> almonds &amp; bread.</p>
<p>Back to bivouac at 12.15 pm. On picquet from 1 till 2 pm.</p>
<p>Saddle up (full gear) &amp; moved off at dusk. Travelled to Richon Zion &amp; straight onward &amp; now getting <s>well</s> away <s>at</s> from&nbsp;the sound of guns etc. A relief too. Travelled till midnight.</p>
<p>Rain started near Tebna.</p>
