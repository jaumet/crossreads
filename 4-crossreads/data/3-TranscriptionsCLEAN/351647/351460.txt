  
 you.  Hope you like it.  You hold it firmly in your left hand & waggle the bent edge with your right & watch the photo.  I've run out of paper so must stop. 
 My love to Mac, & Graham & the Boss & you. 
 Thanks for the 'bacco' & food.  Also for being such a buck & writing as you do.  Hope to be home soon now (soon means, next year). 
 Yours as always Jim Wilkie
