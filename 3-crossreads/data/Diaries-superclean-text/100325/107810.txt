4.45 Up and shaved. Platoon drill bayonet work. Roused buglers up 21st Battn to Citadel and Kasr el Nil as garrison
Evening paradeBattalion advanced and rear guards. Went about 2 miles out towards Suez Road and in rear of new rifle range on which firing has commenced. Fine view of Cairo from high ground, the Pyramids (all three) very distinct. The broad ribbon of green along the Nile brings home what the river means to Egypt. On both sides barren desert and sand everywhere. Between a broad expanse of trees houses and cultivation. This narrow strip which is Egypt carries a tremendous population. Away from where the river water can be carried is wilderness. 
Returned in dark. The weather much cooler and rather windy. It looks as if we shall be here some time as all the yeomanry are being relieved of garrison work by our Division
