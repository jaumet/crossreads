I had no chance of doing anything with reference to the personal effects still I know his Comrades would look into that & arrange for them to be sent to you.
I often said to Fred we cannot let you go on like this unmarried & his reply was "Oh! Rene is my Sweetheart.  We have grown up together & now she is married I look upon her Home as my Home.  I have heard Brothers say they were fond of their Sisters but never have I heard a Brother speak of his Sisters as Fred would do of you & Trixie.  Not once would he do so but many times a day when we were away on our own together & you were certainly his favorite & he would see something nice & that, he would say, will do for Rene when the war is over.  I said Hubby would be jealous & he said, "No fear for he is another Brother & we are great pals."  If I can obtain any further particulars I will let you have them at once.  We are bound by work to our one little spot so that I can only perhaps get an hour off & then that is not sufficient to go & see his old Battalion.
I pray that this War year will end this awful strife & then I trust I will be able to go & see you.  Goodness knows what will be the outlook if it goes on very much longer.  The news at present is good.
I thank you for having my wife & wee ones, Rene up to see you.  Do please for my sake go & see Brenda & try & let her forget for I have been away now since 1914 & the strain for her must be something awful.  I know she is quiet, is it any wonder when I have been away so long from her & I sincerely hope ere long to then thank you in person.
With Kindest regardsYour CousinG.C. Somerville
