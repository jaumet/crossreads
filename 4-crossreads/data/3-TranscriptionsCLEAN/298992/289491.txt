a pretty free hand, as far as wandering about goes. I am not supposed to say where I am of course, but did you ever hear of a place pronounced something like "eeper". Will you have a look on the map & you will see just about where we are.
I know this is an awful scrawl but ink is unobtainable and we have not much time to sit down & write long neat letters. They'll probably be a lot worse than this soon too. It is impossible to write nearly so many now, so you can pass the news on to anyone who cares to hear it.
No letters from Australia for a long time now and I'm longing to hear how Hazel is getting on & if Dene has left yet, in fact about you all - it seems ages since I last heard.
Goodbye for the present Mother dear, & if you like you can post a small parcel of cigarettes or socks now & again, they will be very useful.
Heaps & heaps of love to you all & I will write again soon before we go to the trenches.
Your son
Alan
