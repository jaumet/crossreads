<p>1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 21 &nbsp; APRIL</p>
<p>I wish to be simple, honest, natural, frank, clean in mind &amp; clean in body, unaffected&nbsp;&mdash; ready to say &quot;I do not know,&quot; if so it be, to meet all men on an absolute equality&nbsp;&mdash; to face any obstacle &amp; meet every difficulty unafraid &amp; un abashed. I wish to live without hate, whim, jealously, envy, or fear. I wish others to live their lives too&nbsp;&mdash; up to their highest, fullest, &amp; best. To that end I pray that I may never meddle, dictate, interfere, or give advice that is not wanted, no assist when my services are not needed. If I can help people, I will do it by giving them a chance to help themselves, and if I can uplift or inspire, let it be by example, inference &amp; suggestion, rather than by injunction &amp; dictation.</p>
