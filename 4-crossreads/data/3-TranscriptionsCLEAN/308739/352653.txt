Sunday 6 February 1916Church parade.Committee Meeting to arrange about Sports, etc.Col. Fuller & Brig. to Helouan to inspect site which is situated just behind The Twific Hotel.  The Town is a very quiet place & one wonders why such Palaces are erected.  The Gardens surrounding the Building are Beautifully laid out & every comfort is forthcoming to those who have the Cash.
Monday 7 February 1916Clearing up for Brigade inspection.I went into Cairo with 'Hegarty' by Train.  Brunker took the two Horses by road.Arranged for accomadation for Horses & men.Brought back 1 Case Whisky & Beer for Mess.The Racing Stables are small but clean & the Horses will indulge in a cosy Home for a few Days.  The men in Charge of them are untrustworthy being too fond of Liquor.
Tuesday 8 February 1916Brigade marched to Heloun leaving camp at 2 p.m.I went into Cairo to see Horses & returned by train to Heloun with Col. Fuller's Suit Case.  He had dinner at Tewfic Hotel (Palace).  Concert at night at Hotel in Grounds. A number of Ladies assisted.  The men sat around on the Grass whilst the verandah made a good platform.  The Brigadier was in good form & appeared to enjoy Himself immensely though I do not think He would ever make a successfull artist.
Wednesday 9 February 1916Packed Valise & left by train for Maadi.  Col. Fuller had Breakfast at Tewfic Hotel & then brought regiment into Camp.  The Brigade left at 8 a.m. from Helouan arriving in Camp at 12-30 p.m. (noon).I went into Cairo by afternoon Train to see Horses & returned at 10 p.m. with 2 Cases Beer for Mess.The Horses appeared to be neglected & I found the men in Charge drunk.
