theres another thing which I am going to put my foot on if possible that is men chewing that rotten "chewing gum" while on parade its alright for those that like it chewing on the march but when it comes to drill, well its rotten.
About 11 oclock they collected all pay books they are having them altered I believe, some reckon for the purpose of collaring our money for the War Loan, be a bit of a stinck Iguess if they do, though they are welcome to mine for that purpose 
Well having a fair bit of time on my hands tonight I am going to try describe an ordinary 24 hours in a garrison trench.
You can start your day any time you like for there is no beginning or end to any day in the trenches
