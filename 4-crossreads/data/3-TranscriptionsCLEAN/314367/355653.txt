  
 One grasps very much the difficulties & hardships of German cruisers with no coal - no stores - no water - hunted from spot to spot by the British & then a watery grave - 1915 is going to be an awful year for the Earth. It will probably see a series of Waterloos & God knows how many of us will see 1916 - I've been now on 'active service' in the Australian naval section of the Fleet since Aug 22nd. My baptism & even confirmation may be said to have been successfully conducted - I am rapidly progressing in wisdom & knowledge - I wonder how long I shall remain a Naval Officer - I am proud & glad to be a Volunteer - but I shouldn't care to be a real service man - By the way I shall get the New Guinea medal for being with the Fleet in Sept & they say we shall get something - a bar - ? - for the present job - I wonder if we shall? - If we go into action something extra I believe - Fitz wont run if we meet the cruiser Cormorant & they say she can scoop us - Our men are dying to meet the Germans - We may -
