<p>July 1915</p>
<p>Wednesday 28</p>
<p>Day of embarkation.</p>
<p>Took men down to boat at 8 A.M.</p>
<p>All arrangements in good order.</p>
<p>Splendid system of fixing men up</p>
<p>Huge crowd assembled on wharf &amp; great excitement as the boat slowly moved away.</p>
<p>I sat on forward bridge &amp; watched vain endeavours of friends to hear what each of other said [indecipherable] till afternoon &amp; then left for Melbourne 2 p.m.</p>
