The Effect we Hope For]
Our artillery further annoyed Fritz on the 11th during the night he had another shock. At 10 oclock (PM) the loud bomb explosions began to reverberate through our lines on standing to we perceived the unevenspace dividing our trenches from the Germans was left as bright as day by flares while machine guns rattled rifles cracked bombs crashed intermittently. It was our bombardment keeping the German sentries awake. Looking over the parapet we saw on the German front for about 100 yards a dense cloud of fumes dust rising in the light of the flares. As each new bomb burnt a fountain of earth parapet flew upwards the Germans failing to root out their tormentors by means of machine gun rifle fire sent their red green flares streaming skywards as an appeal for artillery aid. It came in the shape of shrapnel which gave our lines a good peppering with a final salvo from our howitzers, the night resumed its normal conditions.
