Although after this the wound gave signs of healing, the use of the arm did not come back, it appeared to be partly paralized with the 3rd 4th & 5th fingers so badly contracted & clenched that it was impossible to open them, with the greatest power, even half an inch.

On arrival they would be taken in hand by a woman representative of either the War Chest or YMCA (or some other) Australian fund & after the Theatre, would be given tea, returning to the Hospital about 8 pm.
After the first of these trips the Sentry having had his tea spent an hour interestedly watching the people passing in the street below, on foot & in vehicles.
