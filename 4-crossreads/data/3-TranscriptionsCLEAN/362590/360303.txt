I was exceedingly pleased to get yr letter of 15th Decr, & also with the news you sent me of the doings at yr end. I started to write you at Tel el Kebir, where we were in camp when I received yrs, but I got marching orders & correspondence had to stand down for the time. You will have been kept well posted of our armys I dare say by yr son since we left the Peninsula, & you wd know that the 20th were given the position of Honour & were the last to leave the trenches, & did the job entirely to the satisfaction of the Rear Guard Commander General Russell. For fear of you not knowing how the job was carried out; I may just give you an outline. The operation was divided into 2 nights. First night half the Battalion was withdrawn. 2nd night at dusk 250 men left; 12 midnight 85 men, this left me with 100 in the trenches 3 officers, & 40 men with 3 officers in support. At 1 oclock 33 men 1 officer withdrew at 1.50 another 33 men & 1 officer withdrew everything being normal at 2.10 the supports were withdrawn & at 2.50 the last 33 men & 1 officer left the trenches & before going to set Rifles & Bombs with time fuses at 5,10 & 15 minutes these he lit, all men had 2 prs socks over their boots to prevent noise, after the last men left the trenches & for half way to the barges 3 mines of explosions, 1 tin each, were blown under the Turks first, second, & support trenches. We were almost on board then but the Turks thought we were attacking & opened a terrible fire on our position, but we had all flown & no a [indecipherable] resulted. Provision had been made for 10,000 casualties.
