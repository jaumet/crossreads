<p>This afternoon we had an open air concert &amp; Y.M.C.A. flag day &amp; as you know this was the first time I had ever had the opportunity of buying a flag, sounds funny after nearly 3 years of war, but as you know I have always been in the thick of it &amp; never even saw such a thing before Lena Ashwells party gave the concert in "Candahars" ground &amp; we had a fine band &amp; all there it was a lovely afternoon &amp; I think everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves, &amp; at 7 oclock tonight the Australian Band is going to give a concert.<br/>17th. Walked over to Perham Downs to see Bellchambers for I heard that he had just arrived from Hospital, he was glad</p>
