 10.6.15 Thurs. 10th.  We did not fall in "to arms" this morning as we were too sleepy.  C Sqd. has been supplying sapping parties all day, we Sig's slept all the morning &amp; went for a swim after dinner.  The water was quite chilly &amp; the beach looked more like Manly during a summer holiday than in Turkey at the front.  The beach is packed with rations, ammunitions etc., scores of small wharves have also been erected all along the beach for unloading goods &amp; water, &amp; it is off these we swim.  We received quite a shock to-night when we were drawing rations, to find we drew half a loaf per man (of bread) &amp; it is quite a luxury after being on "dog" biscuits so long.  I gave my towel a rinse in the sea to-day.
