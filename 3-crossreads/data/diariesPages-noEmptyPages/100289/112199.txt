Fatigues at A.D.S. Again foggy. Fritz shelled heavily within a few hundred yards of us caught an A.S.C. depot.
Friday 24.11.16
Cold windy. Left camp about 1 pm to take up posts on line. Working out from Delville wood Le Beoufs. Quite a route march to farthest post which I was unfortunate enough to strike. Fritz shelled us on the way out again shelled heavily at about 8 pm. Very long distance to carry, but going much better than on the other front we worked a few weeks back.
