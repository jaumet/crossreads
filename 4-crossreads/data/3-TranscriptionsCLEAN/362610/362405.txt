  
 Saturday 8 July 1916 A rather threatening morning turning into a lovely summer day, distinctly warm in the afternoon. In the morning reported to Bn. H.Q. re my new appointment, & in the afternoon had a company inspection by the Colonel. Austn. mail up to 15 May received at afternoon teatime & specially good. Rode round to Sailly to see whether Leo was still there, word having come thro' that we were to move in the morning. It was a lovely ride, but found that Leo had moved some days previously. Busy in the evening arranging details for move : a particularly lovely sunset. Shaved in order to save time in the morning, & as far as possible got my gear together.
