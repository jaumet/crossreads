 No one spoke and they didn't find out till this morning. Now "Lady Barratt" has to have a heel-rope on in case she gets loose again. She kept me awake for about 3 hours and she missed my bivouac ( an   a waterproof sheet spread on flag poles) by only a couple of inches several times. And she wound up her performance by drinking some one's water in a bucket which the fellow had carried through the sand about half a mile and eating a couple of loaves of bread. 
  10th Dec  1916 Gererat SUNDAY 
 I went out with a special patrol to several places on ahead where it was reported "Increased enemy activity" we started off well protected by a screen thrown out in front we went to &ndash; and beyond &ndash; where the enemy were reported but no signs of Turks were observed at ABU ARTAA, EL MURRA, &amp; UM ZUGHLA. All was clear the last named place is about 10 miles further out than Gererat: portions of the town of El Arish were plainly visible. We started back for camp about 4 oclock and finished the journey in the dark. We were coming along at a good fast pace when a figure on top of a sand dune in front called out "Halt!" We  did  halt too. There is no mistaking that challenge. "Who are you?" "Friend"! "Advance one and be recognized!"
