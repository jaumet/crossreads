There were Destroyers flying about in all directions towing boatloads of Troops ashore were they are fighting for their lives. One can see the spits of fire from rifles &amp; bursting shells overhead. it was a grand but terrible sight. We are to take a crowd back to Alexandria who are wounded. A great batch of boys came aboard about 8 oclock with all manner of wounds, there was some awful sights to witness. We left about midnight for Alexandria, some of the boys were terribly smashed about &amp; before we reached Alexandria 10 of them died &amp; were buried at sea. We done our best in the way of looking after them , we were only 16 strong. The majority of them disembarked in Egypt with not even being washed the blood all over their uniforms but the majority were very cheerful. It was my misfortune to have been left on Ships Guard as nearly all my old pals were ashore, landing even before the Battn.
