<p>4.  Just while I think of this dear ones, you musn't ever be afraid of wires I mean cables, that come to you for fear they should contain some awful news, for if anything were to happen to one of our soldier-boys the news would not be cabled direct to you but to someone else to tell to you: I want to tell you too that just in case anything did happen, an acquaintance here, a Sergeant who is on the staff at Headquarters has arranged for me to get a cable also, without it interfering in any way with your claim as next of kin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather gruesome to talk like this, but of course I know you will recognise that it is only a precaution, and be glad to hear of it as such: I thought you ought to know of the arrangement.  I spoke of it to Walter and he said that he had meant to see about it himself for me but then they were moved off suddenly.  I was very clear on this point of it being quite separate from any news sent to you, &amp; it would in no way trespass upon or interfere with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sergeant I have mentioned, and his wife, Mr and Mrs Lyndsay are a nice young couple and have been out for some months.  He was invalided to Alexandria from Gallipoli &amp; cabled for her &amp; they have been here together since November.  They have been married for nearly three years though they look to be only a boy &amp; girl: though I scarcely ever see them to speak to they have the room next to mine and hearing their talk &amp; laughter is often company to me.  One evening I asked them in here &amp; another they asked me in there though it will not go much beyond that because we have not a great deal in common.  He is an exceedingly nice gentlemanly boy  much the nicer of the two: in looks she is remarkably like Doris Oakley &amp; though nice enough on the surface, even in the little I have seen of her, often lets forth a rather repellant arrogant selfish little manner totally unlike Doris.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still it is pleasant to be on speaking terms, &amp; the removal of their presence with all their happiness, next door to me would be quite a loss.  It is all very distinct</p>
