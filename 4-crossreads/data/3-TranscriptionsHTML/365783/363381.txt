<p>but made a hit &amp; guessed &pound; 2.10.   when you open the parcel I guess you will be surprised at how expensive things are here.   The value should have been declared at about 5/-.<br/>I am sending with this a few photos taken during the trip on the Kyarra.  I hope to send you some good ones of Cairo &amp; our camp later on.  I hope to be able to go out to Uncle Joe's camp to-morrow evening;  I had a letter from him to day asking me out to dinner.   Hoping you have had a nice pleasant trip &amp; that you are all happy &amp; well<br/>With best love,<br/>From your loving old man<br/>Will.</p>
