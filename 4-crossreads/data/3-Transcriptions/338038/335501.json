<p>[Letter from Genl. W.L.H. Burgess]<br/>[Edge of letter obscured]<br/>In the Field. France,<br/>27th Aug. 1918</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<br/>I am so glad to [kn]ow that my letter to you [was] of some help &amp; comfort [in] your sorrow &amp; loss.  I always feel when [wri]ting how very inadequate XXX are common words [and?] [phr]aseology in endeavouring to [conv]ey sympathy in sorrow such [as] yours.<br/>To know that they have [been] helpful, does much to [lessen?] this feeling of inadequacy,</p>
