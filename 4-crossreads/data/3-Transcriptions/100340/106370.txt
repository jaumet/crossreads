<p><u>BLIGHTY</u>  <br/>Birmingham<br/>Rubery Hill<br/>No 1 War Hospital<br/>4C Ward<br/>8/9/18<br/>My Dear Sis<br/>Just a short note to let you know that I am getting on fine. I was wounded at Mt St Quentin on 31/8/18 in the left leg, thigh  &amp; face. That is what no doubt the official list will say. Well my leg wound has completely healed up it was about 3 inches below the knee. My thigh wound has healed up inside but I think it healed too quick as I have to stop in bed today as a lot of matter came out this morning. It was about two inches deep  &amp; about as big as a penny. The wound is about four inches above the knee at the back.<br/>I had four scratches on the face the worst being at the angle of the jaw. They have all healed up but under the skin</p>
