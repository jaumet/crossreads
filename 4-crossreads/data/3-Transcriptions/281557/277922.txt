<p>works there &amp; there were plenty of Iron rations for Fritz in the making all sizes from whizz bango to the big monsters: women were mostly employed even on the coal heaps: Etaples is a large camp alright: got out a little past Amiens at 2 am &amp; marched off:</p>
<p>Wednesday July 12th <br/>marching through Amiens took nearly four hours &amp; it is a fine city: the roads were nicely laid out &amp; had the road in the middle footpath at each side with a row of large trees on each side of the footpath making four rows of trees in all &amp; they would be nice &amp; shady: the trams were funny little things: the river runs right through the town: the outer suburbs were a bit dowdy &amp; the people did not seem too much claso: passed miles of motor transports &amp; there were plenty of hospitals in the town: this is the Somme district: left Amiens behind &amp; passed through a little village: while resting a young woman came out with a jug of cafe &amp; handed it round. I got a cup &amp; it went well: passed through &amp; then along a lovely shady road for a couple of miles: the large trees met overhead &amp; looked well: arrived at Argoeuves about 8 am &amp; billeted: there was a rush for "scran" be we got a loaf &amp; a couple of dixies of milk each so done well: wash &amp; clean up &amp; then laid down: we struck a bit of a wire netting affair &amp; used as a bed &amp; it went well: up for tea &amp; went for a walk: had a look round the village cemetary &amp; it was full of wreaths made out of beads &amp; they did look well: met Barham Bolt &amp; Brown &amp; they look well: our plate of meat have had a rough passage the last few days &amp; we are a bit tender: these farms have plenty of pets, rabbits, pigs,goats, etc: our barn is not too bad &amp; electric light is all through the outhouses: Good luck to King Billy &amp; his white horse: it is two years to day since I went to board at Ethel's place:</p>
