 March off this even ; we have collect a band , and they led the way to the train . The old "rattler " convey us to a certain point , then we march across countri through hedg and across ditch till we came to this place ; where I am live under the Lill Road . The 2nd Brigad were here . They are a good mob to come in after . 26/9/16 . Was post as " " Gas Guard " , over a huge Strombo Horn , in the ground of a fine Chateau , now more or less ruin . We call it " Bedford Hous " . By the neglect pond and garden it seem to have been a fine place . But now the fine oak tree are splinter with shell and it rose garden is a cemeteri . About 3.A.M. some one start a gas alarm .
