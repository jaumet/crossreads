<p>a bullet torn flag wh. has done duty for us marking the end of our position for some weeks. Originally a red &amp; yellow signalling flag &ndash; the shaft shows many bullet holes. I hope you will get it.</p>
<p>An extra gust of wind has just torn my blanket roof &amp; taken it down the Sharia. We are road making &amp; our avenue running up is from 20' to 12 ft wide &amp; very good &ndash; (No trains [yet?] as they bring the dust so). I have a notice here on it "Jo Stamboul" to encourage the fatigue parties.</p>
<p>There are a few dead Turks within a couple of hundred yds from us &amp; Holman &amp; I are considering how we can together get their arms. &ndash; Am afraid their curios are past getting as they must have been here quite a time! My bivouac area I am trying to keep as clean as a peace camp, tho' an awful task as men throw food everywhere. However we have an incinerator &amp; all sorts of sanitary conveniences.</p>
<p>The gully is very pretty &ndash; hung with fir trees &ndash; lupins, oak bushes &ndash; purple pea like flowers &amp; the broom. &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
