<p>of 92 stretcher bearers in the Bullecourt that only 11 were not hit. My squad is no more. Two were killed outright &amp; one had two legs blown off. The chap who took my place was not hurt. I wonder if I would have come out of it but anyway it has turned out for the best. Had I not got appendicitis I would have been in the stunt as my hand was better by that [indecipherable]<br/>So glad you remembered my birthday &amp; I hope you got the card I sent you. I was confirmed Monday night  &amp; it will give me more strength to believe in Him for really dear I have learnt many things while I have been in France  &amp; the seeds that were sown in our young life have just began to spring up. Why one can't help but believe in God after going through one or [indecipherable] scraps &amp; never knowing whose going up next. Look I must not write like this as you will think I am very depressed &amp; I really am not but then its makes you serious when so many of your pals go under. Well dear old Sis I will close now hoping that you, Vol and N are in the best of health  &amp; all happy  &amp; contented,  &amp; sending you my fondest <strike>true</strike></p>
<p>love from your ever loving brother XXXXXXXXX</p>
