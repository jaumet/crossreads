2a bit showery here lately & the crops look A.1. - I milked a cow yesterday out in one of the paddocks not far from here, much to the amusement of some French people who owned the Farm. - They just take a three legged stool to wherever the cows happen to be & proceed to milk - & the cows just stand quietly - But probably you saw this often on your trip in the Car through France, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Belgium or Holland. - Are your sweet peas flowering yet? & has Will started getting men to prepare the paddock next the House for the planting of Fruit trees? - Some people say that June, July, Aug are the best months for planting fruit trees. - Alister Stobo was here several times lately, & sent me such a nice new Suit of pyjamas I wore them last night. It was quite a treat, for they are the first pair of Pyjamas I have worn for about eight months. - How are Will, yourself & all the children? By the way
