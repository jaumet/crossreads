Tuesday 23 July
Wet miserable all day. Up at Strazeele Station R.A.P. again where the English troops are holding the line. They are labour men are not fit to be in the line, little chaps old men! They are very funny but are getting quite a number of cases already. Australian officers N.C.O.s are attached to them to stiffen them our chaps detest the job.

A few carries last night, sick wounded. Wonderfully fine to-day to-night wonderfully quiet. These chaps are very funny here. Living very well indeed.
