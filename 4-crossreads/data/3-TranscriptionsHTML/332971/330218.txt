<p>you visit my home in England in 20 years time you'll see this tin on my mantelpiece.  I invited 8 Privates for Xmas tea from the camps (Adelaide boys)  Among them two Botting boys Frank &amp; Mark &amp; my two nephews.  In the evening we went for a long walk &amp; how pretty the Harbour looked c 3 or 4 hundred battleships. Troopships etc &amp; 10 Hospital ships all lit up.<br/>Though we haven't heard officially- everything points to us moving.  All the English patients have gone- The Austs as fast as they can &amp; each day sees less wards &amp; less patients- where to is the ?  Our Xmas mails have been held up somewhere.<br/>I must tell you this tit bit.  It happened a few nights ago in the small hours of the morning.  A Sentry with his gun was put on to guard some goods.  A Sister c Tommy Coat pajamas &amp; balaclava cap on had to pass him &amp; he thinking she was a man called out Halt (She) hurrying (he) Halt I say halt you in the pajamas <u>halt</u> (She) running now &amp; he after her  Then she turned &amp; indignantly said "What is it to you where I am going?" he absolutely flabbergasted stammered out 'I  be- beg  your par- par- pardon Sister  I thought you was a man.(exit)<br/>New Years Eve-  Such a week of surmising &amp; wondering when we are going &amp; where- Such a washing up of things &amp; packing- We are having days off &amp; nights off &amp; we are seeing as much of the Island as we can &amp; everyone appeared to be taking snap shots.  Since Xmas day the enemy Areplanes have been busy but have not heard of them doing any damage.</p>
