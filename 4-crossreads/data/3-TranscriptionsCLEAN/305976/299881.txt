  
 animals in the world the Mule wins. For a time after we were mounted there were Mules & the boys everywhere. The remount boys rounded us up again. Fine horsemen these fellows. Saw Tom disappearing over horizon on the neck of a Mule. One of the Mules [indecipherable] caught in Red's belt & he thought the Mule was trying to have a meal from him. Eventually we got into formation but all day these dam mules played up. They have a mouth like iron & have formed opinion that only thing to do when they bolt is to  sight  sit tight & ride them. Remount boys tell us they have just arrived & need breaking in. I believe it. Barnsfather would have found some good material for his sketches could he have seen us today.
