<p>Most of my work has been on sentry groups in the firing line worked 24 on and off with an occasional 48 on which is no trouble to us now. The men have got used to the night work and watching. We use periscopes and periscope-rifles a lot. They make observation much safer although today one of my men had a periscope rifle hit by a bullet, it was remarkable the amount of damage done busting the barrel and woodwork all roads. The enemy's bullet has a very this case which cracks at the least thing, and this hit him all over the face, fortunately missing his eyes. I counted 34 separate cuts on his face not to mention pin-pricks when he came back from the A.M.C., all quite small.</p>
<p>Most of us have secured pretty good dug-outs and made ourselves fairly comfortable, the nest thing is to see how they will stand wet weather, the soil is clayey and from what we can see of the effect of a few points it will be a hell of a place.</p>
<p>Later. We had a 75mm turned on us just before dusk last night which gave us cause to think, the first shot knocked a hole through the parapet next to mine big enough to wheel a barrow through, by great good luck noone was hit there , although I picked up one man who finished up in the middle of the debris, he said he was not quite sure for a second or two whether he was dead or not, they say almost everyone has that sort of feeling if knocked down by concussion. The next shot was more serious hitting further down the line and causing some casualties, they fired</p>
