 one of the band by the way Sis none of the cigar were broken . We are have glorious summer weather again as there is a canal lake right near us , we have a great time in the water . You would laugh to see the way we get about in just a pair of short boot sock , noth els sometim not even our boot sox . We are look just like black now but are all in the best of health . We are in the line again but our section is lucki as we are back in support . Well dear Old Sis there is no more news . Give Noni a big love kiss for me rememb me to all Vol 's peopl . Well dear Sis must close now so fondest love to you Vol from your brother Hal
