 Sunday Feb 9. The weather is quite cold &amp; the wind blowing almost a hurricane. The ship is rolling &amp; many of the Diggers are suffering from "Mal de Mer" already. The food is fairly good and plentiful. Our Deck (D) seems to be about the most comfortable on the Boat. Mon. Feb. 10. Most of the A.M.C. Staff are sick, &amp; we have a number of Patients in Hospital with Influenza &amp; prostration from Sea Sickness.  The weather continues rough &amp; there are many vacant seats at meal times. I manage to put in an appearance at every meal. I don't feel particularly brilliant. I'm not exactly  sick   but I do a lot of swallowing. The Hammocks are more comfortable than Bunks this rough weather. Big seas  are coming aboard &amp; all the Troop Decks but ours are awash. I'm going on night Duty tonight with "the Yank" as all the other fellows are too sick. The [indecipherable] Latrines were smashed in today &amp; the cook house washed out by big waves. Things are only "muddling"
