Set out from Sec-Bois in a Motor Bus at 10.30 A.M. Went to Hazebrouck; the Leave train left at 12.30 P.M. Arrived at Bolougne at 7 P.M. Marched to St Martins Camp on the top of a high hill. No crossing tonight; our passes will be redated to commence on the 16th. No leave from this camp except for Warrant Officers. Put my "crown" up, and bluffed my way out the gate; for not one moment of this liberty shall be lost. A splendid city this, clean and well ordered.

Got away from St Martin's early this morning. Embarked at 7.30 AM on the Leave Ship, "St Andrew". Sailed from Bolougne at 8.30.A.M. A rough crossing got to London at 3.30 P.M. Went to Australian Headquarters, Horseferry Road Drew money got fixed up. Went for a walk round the town. I feel like a wild man come to town.
