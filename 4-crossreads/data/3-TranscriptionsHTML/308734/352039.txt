<p>the hall is a magnificient stained glass window, (I saw it at its best as the sun was shining behind it) depicting James V, surrounded by his nobles, presenting the charter to the Abbot of Cambuskenneth, the first Lord President.  I then came back, past "the Heart of Midlothian", and the Statue of Francis Walter, 5th Duke of Buccleuch, up the Lawnmarket to "the Lodge" for dinner.  I then went, (after dinner) to Perth St, 3 PM went for a walk with Jean to the Botanical Gardens, alongside the Leith Waters, through Inverleith Park to the Fiddes [Fettes] College, then back to Perth St for tea, the gardens are very pretty, saw a lot of Australian natives there in the shape of Wattle and gum trees.  I went through the Hot houses, and saw some wonderful plants and flowers, they are well cared for.  After tea I went with Jean to Mrs Jim Young's place and saw her and the family, my uncle Jim died years ago, leaving 4 girls and 2 boys, after staying there for a little while Mrs Young took me to my father's brother's house and there saw my Uncles Robert &amp; George (Dod).  Robert is married, but has no family, Dod is not married.  I did not see John Young but saw his daughter his son was killed in France two years ago.  They were all very pleased to see me and had a lot of questions to ask.  Arrived back at Perth St 10.30 had supper, and then walked back to Ramsay Lodge 12 PM, and went to bed feeling quite happy.</p>
