From there we came back to Bapaume, thence to Fricourt and Rubempre. Four weeks we stayed there, then we came back to Bapaume in reserves for six weeks, then we entrained and came up here, where we are at present. St Omer. I don't know when we are going in the line again, from what I can gather we are a kind of reserve, to be rushed up into the line if anybody is in difficulties. Some job. What! Well Mick, I will draw this to a close else I will have to sent it per Rural Post.Bluey
