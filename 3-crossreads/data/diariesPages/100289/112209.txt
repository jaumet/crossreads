shell fire. Walked to Vignacourt for a bath, about 2 miles, but was sadly disappointed had to return without. Some of the lads fairly merry to-night.

Xmas Day. Special arrangements made for breakfast; also sat down to well prepared good dinner at 2 pm which had been arranged by the unit. All drank the health of the bearers who have just come in from the line. Plenty of beer flying around, but as usual refrained from indulging. Good tea served out at 5.30 we concluded the night with a first class concert; on the whole we had a very enjoyable day under the circumstances.
