<p>Fine but cloudy. We had a kind of exam on the buzzer and disc in morning and I had a good read in afternoon. The inoculation yesterday made me pretty crook so I did not do too well in the test. Warren &amp; Bill &amp; Jack &amp; Self went up to the pictures in the evening, but they were not up to much.</p>
