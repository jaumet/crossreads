<p>Friday 1.12.16<br/>Very cold night, icicles hanging from everything.  Never had a wink of sleep.  General Mackay passed here on a visit towards the line early this morning.  Fritz straffed front line very heavily at about 7 pm, all very anxious to get away from this sector.  Had very narrow squeak during morning; large piece of H.E. whizzed within an inch of my head, which happened to be minus a steel helmet &amp; landed at my feet.</p>
<p>Saturday 2.12.16<br/>Going all night.  Fritz caught 29th Btn changing over &amp; inflicted a great number of casualties.  Another sleepless night.  Relieved early owing to the heavy time we have had during the past two days, again very cold.</p>
