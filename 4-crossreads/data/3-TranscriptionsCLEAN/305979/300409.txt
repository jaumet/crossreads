We have company parades at 10 A.M. & 2 P.M. but so far the boat has been too wet amp; unsteady for drilling but we expect soon to commence physical training of various sorts at these parades in order to get us fit for our coming work. We go to bed early; lights out at 9.30.
We are not quite used to the sea and are beginning to feel as fit as fighting -cocks. We often hear the expression "home was never like this" but I guess it is seldom meant to be taken literally.
A good number of the boys have excellent voices and often at night, when the lights are turned down we are greeted with burts of song. Two boys just near me sing together so beautifully
