A Realistic Account of the Landing of the Australian Troops at a Dardanelles Sunday 25th April 1915
Half a boats length half a boats length onwardNobly our brave boys forced the shores and landed
Up the Steep Up the steepDashed our heroic AustraliansMachine Guns in front of themWire entanglements around themVainly impede their way
Storm the heights Storm the eHeightsShow the Turks how Colonals fightProud of the colors you bearProud of the khaki you wearBrave of Deed - Swift as steedOnward & UpwardDashing Australians
Up the Cliffs Up the CliffsOnwardStormed our BattalionFlashed all their bayonets bareIn the bright sunlight & glareOh the Brave Dash they madeAnd the Dear Life they gaveOh the rich Blood they paidAnd the great victory they gainedNoble Colonals
That was the way it was doneThat's how the heights were wonTheres not a mothers sonFaltered or failed.Out for the Empires goodFirm was their trust in GodBravo Australians
