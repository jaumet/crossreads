<p>September 1918.<br/>Tuesday 17</p>
<p>Bouvincourt and Bty Position nr. Poeuilly.<br/>Weather, very heavy storm accompanied by the heaviest rain I have seen in France. Had a fair pickle with tarpaulins.<br/>Left with guns for Bty Position at 6.15pm. and arrived in action at 10pm.<br/>Fritz planes across our lines all day.<br/>I have never seen so many Fritzies across at one time<br/>a regular series of showers of bombs. Very few shells and heavy concentration of artillery around the district.</p>
