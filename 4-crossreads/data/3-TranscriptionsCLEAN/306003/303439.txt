  
 22-7-16 Sat 22nd Stood to Arms at 2.30 this morning & soon after breakfast a Taube came on the scene & made us stand to our horses,  Our large battle 'plane lost no time in getting up here, but the Taube was flying exceptionally high & did not wait till the battle plane got up, but made back in a hurry; 
 At 3 oclock this morning B Sqd (of 1st Regt) left here & patrolled to Hill 110, they captured 5 Turks on the way;  The 2nd Brigade of L.H. & the Regt of New Zealanders that are still with us, went out to go to Qatia this morning, but found the Turks were this side of it & they have been having small skirmishes all this morning & captured 7 Turks early this morning. We have received orders to keep one horse feed strapped on our saddles, & water bottles filled ready to get out without notice, had orders to be ready to file off at 10 oclock tonight but it is cancelled & we go out after midnight
