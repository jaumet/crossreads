 Dearest Mother & Father, I expect this will be the last mail before Xmas. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. I only wish that I was there wouldnt we have a great time. Never mind I hope we are there by next Christmas. That will be the time. Fizz eh & plenty of Ale & wine. I might have a chance of spending Xmas at Hallstow If I do it will be great. It is nice & fine today & I went for a long walk through the country lanes. They are very pretty. I hope you are all enjoying good health. Best wishes & love Your loving Son
