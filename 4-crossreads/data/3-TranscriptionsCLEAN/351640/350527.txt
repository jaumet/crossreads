  
 Give my love to Maria.  Yesterday I posted cards & letters at Port Said which should find you in due course. 
 While in Port Said, with some nurses I was at the Egyptian Government Hospital.  It is managed by the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul.  The OReilly of Bathurst is a member of a branch of the same Order for men.  The Order is French.  The Chief at Port Said is an English woman.  The working dress is blue, with white collars & cuffs & a large spreading white head covering.  The two Chiefs of the Order, we meet with, are very well condition, others varied from fat to lean.  The Chief has been in Egypt for nine years.  Should you see Father OReilly, you may tell him that we were talking about him. 
 Plenty of Turkish women, with partly covered face, are seen in the Arab quarter in Port Said.  Mahommedan may be more correct than Turkish, probably they were Arab women.  I may have written in another letter about them.  The Nile, if you will look up a map, has mouths which open along the Mediterranean shore, from Port Said to Alexandria. 
 I wrote to Dr. Peck, & posted the letter, I think at Colombo. 
 A telegram reached me from P. Fiaschi, who is in camp at Cairo, yesterday. 
 Good bye my dears.  Thank you again Joe dear for your welcome letter. 
 My best wishes to all my friends.  Heaps of love & loads of kisses to my Car Joseph & Kitty.  Send some on to Molly when you write. 
 Your ever loving & affectnt Faree John B. Nash
