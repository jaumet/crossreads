<p>Thursday 8 February 1917 [7 February 1918]<br/>Saw Capt. Collins 9.30 a.m. &amp; arm examined, ex-rayed by Capt. McCullock 11 a.m.  By the way a strange sensation it is to see one's arm bones appearing on the screen.  Both Captains very kind.  Went town 2 p.m. with S. Saunderson &amp; saw mosques three in number &amp; one with pretty windows, others not impressive &ndash; then took 2 street photos then visited Arabic museum, very fine old glass &amp; ancient work, carvings &amp; brass utensils.<br/>Groppi's for 4 p.m. tea &amp; so back to 27th.  8 p.m. went to thank Mr. Belcher for drive to station when going to Luxor &amp; gave my photos to see.</p>
