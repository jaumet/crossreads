standing to attention, to do him honour. Sufficient for anyone, man or King. He seems to be a decent little man; this George.V. Returned to Buire. Pitched for the Main Guard.

The mob moved away today. I remain here, acting Corporal of the Guard with a prisoner. Turned out the Guard to the 3rd Brigade as they passed. This is my reward for being a "Senior Private" by the Grace of God; doing some corporal's work for him. They will say of me perhaps when I am pushing up the daisies; "He was a good poor beggar!"

Left Buire with the prisoner. Marched 12 miles via Bray-sur-Somme, to Maricourt; where we rejoined the Battalion in a camp. Will have the same procedure here
