  
 Anecdote 
 Jim Roach & Rose the Chemist. At a New Shop that Rose & his partner (McManus) opened in King St., it was desired to install a freezing plant for Cold drinks. A local man contracted for the Machinery. When completed the outfit was useless. Through patriotism the firm had it made locally. A lawsuit followed. McManus & his family being good Romans offered up, everyone, a Novena that they should win. The jury decided against the firm, though the members of the partnership believed the facts & evidence to be all in their favour. The McManus Snr was much chagrined that after their piety the case went against them, & he feared for the effect on his children. Roach said to him - "I know why things went against you. Rose is an unbeliever, a heretic. What esle could you expect?"
