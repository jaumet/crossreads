  
 Sunday 28th April 1917 [1918] A beautiful day, wind cold when sitting in grounds.  Really up and walking, a bit shakily it is true, around the premises.  2 S.A's to talk to Officer Gibbs newly married and Pte. Howard. Not up in time for church as new M.O., C. Rankin, visits. 10.45 a.m. cold & stiff, now I learn to appreciate the true gentleman C. Spencer is & the thorough doctor Col. Trout is.  One always finds out these things by comparison, it would seem.  This one merely shrugs re the swab & Sister takes it later on. N. Sister tells me she has R. Main, 10 officers including myself, 42 in Annex & 24 at other end Left Main, so not so bad for n. duty, most all convalescent. We hear all late leave stopped for 31 & Nasalie [?] Hosp'l's. one fair lady or two, coming home intoxicated!!!  Ah Sisters!!
