<p>Dec. 11 Saturday 1915<br/>In bed all day<br/>In our room are a mixture of Aus. &amp; English we get on very well together. It is interesting to listen to the Tommies telling their experiences. They had a terrible time landing a Sulva Bay Regiment after Regiment was cut to pieces, &amp; the horror of that advance must make a life long impression on all who took part in it. Another big blumer by some one.</p>
<p>Dec. 12 Sunday 1915<br/>In bed all day<br/>Got a letter from Major Fuller asking me to get certain things &amp; forward them on to him. It was good to hear from the old Boss who has done so much to brighten my life.</p>
<p>Dec 13 Monday 1915<br/>In bed all day<br/>2 men brought in with frost bitten feet from Anzac. They are in a bad way but the nurse is working hard to bring back circulation. The men are bright and cheerful</p>
