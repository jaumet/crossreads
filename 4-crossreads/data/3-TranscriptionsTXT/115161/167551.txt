 commerce, finance, music and arts generally, through sheer doggedness and determination. Look at most of our noted men. Yes! throw soldiering in as well, and you can but admit that the small man has made himself felt right through and forged his way to the top of the tree. Just walked over the big man. 
 After all no doubt when a wise Providence created man, he provided for this contingency, thus allowing the big man to have size and the small man to have brains. Of course exceptions have been made in isolated cases. 
 Then take the big man as compared with the small man in connection with the affections of the fair sex (bless them). A big man is - they say - pleasing to the eye, but the small man appeals to their finer feminine feelings. The small man makes a much better husband, in that he is usually bright and lively (and I tell you the fair sex like that), and he is generally determined and masterful (they admire firmness) and lastly he invariably (owing to his superior brain power) makes more money, and does not as a rule stint his wife&#39;s expenditure. He is invariably full of energy. 
 The big man on the other hand is invariably (or soon becomes) lazy and often a bully, is not of much value in commercial life, dull of intellect, and invariably when approaching middle age, runs to fat. The wife often is able to &quot;twist him around her little finger&quot; and generally treat him as an overgrown boy. The small man she respects, because he is usually the head of the house. 
 How often have you noticed divorce cases where the petitioner has been a big man and the corespondent a little chap. Why is this? 
 I think I&nbsp;might mention a case I was mixed up in once (not a divorce case), but I really think I got what I&nbsp;deserved that time. I was&nbsp;continually &quot;throwing off&quot; at a big fellow in camp, (the same one that took more than his share of sausages) &nbsp;made his life a misery, in front of the other fellows, (I used to be pretty good with my tongue) until he could stand it no longer.
