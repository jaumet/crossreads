December 1915were a lot of casualties.  On Saturday there was a big bombardment by the warships of the Achi Baba Ridge & I believe a successful advance followed
Monday 6th Decr to Sunday 12thThe weather during the week has been quite warm.  Things have been fairly quiet except for a few bombardments & artillery "hates".  On Tuesday we got some mail, both English & Australian.  I received a parcel from a cousin Miss Sutherland & also  letters from Doug & Uncle JD.  Also wrote letters to mother, Doles Blair & Miss Sutherland.  A lot of troops have been withdrawn during the week.  On Thursday several warships bombarded some new Turkish gun emplacements & it proved the biggest bombardment I have yet seen here.  Our squadron were out at Wilson's Lookout on Monday Thursday & Sunday.  Jean McCarthy of
