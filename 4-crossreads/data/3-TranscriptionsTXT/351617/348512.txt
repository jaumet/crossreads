16th First glimpse of Kangaroo Island 6 am10 am first glimpse of Dear old Ausie, 245 miles10 pm dropped anchor in Adelaide.
Next morning we had leave ashore and here we parted with some of the old boys who lived in South Australia It was a merry parting and next morning when we woke up under way for Melbourne we felt as though some great friends had gone.
The trip to Melbourne went very quietly and on the morning of the 21st July we disembarked at Port Melbourne and after saying goodbye to the Victorians we entrained on a Red Cross train for Sydney After travelling all that day and night we arrived in Sydney at 10 am on the 22nd
From the Central Station we went per motors to the Anzac Buffet where I found my Mother & Sisters and after 3 1/2 years of Soldiering I was not sorry when at last I found myself once more at home.
For the first week at home I felt that I had lost the world when I lost my pals & I hope if ever I take on another war I shall fall in with some of the same boys again as we were more like brothers than friends.
