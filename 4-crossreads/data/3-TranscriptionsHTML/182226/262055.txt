<p>Wednesday 2 February, 1916</p>
<p>Drill in the morning, half holiday in the afternoon, we played a draw at football with the signallers. Mac &amp; I were not playing. Mac had a crook leg &amp; a bad eye &amp; I was too shakey from Dysentery.</p>
<p>Our mail arrived today I got about 8 letters, one batch being mail that has been following me round for some time.</p>
