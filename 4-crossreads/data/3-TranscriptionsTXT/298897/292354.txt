 about it.  Then I went on to the road &amp; watched the transport going by &amp; it was not till 11.30 that I turned in.  Before I could get to sleep one of the others brought in the Q.M. Lieut. who was somewhat merry &amp; he sat on my bunk till about 1 A.M. telling all about the old Lemnos days &amp; how we worked together etc much to the disgust of a couple of the other chaps.  Was severely chaffed next day about it &amp; accused of being inebriated especially as the O.S. overslept &amp; made the parade late in the morning. 
 Wednesday 23rd August Went to the reinforcement Camp Sick parade in the morning but only had a couple of cases nothing doing for rest of day except that a friend visited me.  Received 7 letters which was good, also a parcel which was tres bon as they say here.  Very quiet on the front except that some big guns did a bit of strafing this evening near by causing the windows to rattle etc.  Fresh troops coming up, mostly Scotties, and heavy guns mostly long naval variety.
