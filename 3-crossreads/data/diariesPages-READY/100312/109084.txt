16/10/17 Steenvoorde
A day in billets. Took a walk round during the morning and found a good deal of room for improvement as regards stacking of gear and general cleanliness. Nearly all the men are now either Lewis gunners or signallers and the breaking up of the 6th. Division has resulted in the return to us of many old chaps who have been away ever since Pozieres and before. It is rather interesting to speculate how they propose to reinforce the divisions now that recruiting has nearly ceased and the supply of recovered wounded has been so fully exploited. We expected General Bob Smith to dinner but he did not arrive. Bunning and Davis both went on English leave tonight. After mess addressed the officers on the need for bucking up their men and so on. All impatience I await my leave warrant for 4 short days in Paris and thereafter hope to be able to work the oracle for Rome and for Naples.
