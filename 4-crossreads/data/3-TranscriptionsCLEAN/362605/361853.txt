 It is just over a week since I wrote to you.  Dick Toppin & Dave Lord came down to see me last week-end & we had quite a nice time together.  We have such a lot of snow lately but yesterday & to-day have been perfect & quite hot.  I went in to Salisbury on Tuesday to visit Ellis & my Friends.  We had a long talk about business but of course it is impossible to make any definite arrangements over here.  He will not be leaving England for at least a fortnight but He expects to go every day of course & is very anxious to get away.  I shall have to stay on for a few months yet but I am taking up Book-keeping so I am not wasting any time. 
 I am doing a fair amount of writing & studying but I am not straining my eyes over the work.  I get some recreation.  I played Hockey yesterday with the Civilian Girls hereabouts against the Tommies & the W.A.A.C.S. mixed Teams.  The score was 3 all but it was an awful game.  The Tommies were quite the dirtiest players I have ever met in any sport & "squeaked" about everything all through the game.  I have played for a couple of dances too, musicians being short & "anything old thing will do".  I only do it to oblige for if there is no pianist, well, there are about 250 disappointed people in the camp at least. 
 I tried to get a job 
 P.C's from Girls or Young Ladies in the Q.M. W.A.A.C's, with whom I have become acquainted through Dancing. I am not bringing either back as a souvenir.  They know just enough about me to want to know more but I am a hard dog to catch nowadays. Harry
