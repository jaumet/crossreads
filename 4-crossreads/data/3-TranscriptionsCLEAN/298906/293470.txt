should not be surprised to see anything happen.8th. Down at Littlehampton again & having a good time on the beach, nearly got run in through taking snap shots of the beach & harbour, but wriggled out of it neatly, the beach is crowded nearly all people from London, a lot of them have rushed down since the raid, got a bit of a fright I expect9th. Mr Duke & I went to Arundel Castle & Park this evening & strolled all through them the grounds are very beautiful & full of deer.Ran up to London later on & saw some of the havoc caused by the raid, not as much damage done as you would expect to see
