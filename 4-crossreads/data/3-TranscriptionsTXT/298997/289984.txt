a glorious day.  The dinner was quite good.  A lot of poultry had arrived for the officers & somehow we managed to get at least a flavor per man in our own dinner, which was roast beef & desert.  Any amount of plum pudding that we could eat followed, with, subsequently figs & custard - or what was meant to be custard & [indecipherable].Then we had a double issue of rum and an issue of Red Cross Comforts - Chocolate, cigarettes etc.  The C.O. Division sent round beer for each platoon; and the CO. Battalion did likewise - a big dixie full per platoon.  Then the O.C. Company got a brain wave & also sent round a dixie-full for each of his platoons; after which the O.C. platoon decided that it was up to him.  Then, of course, we shouted for ourselves & each other; and as the Battal Divisional Canteen had plenty of beer things became hilarious & noisy.
The noise had just stopped & things slumber was settling on the camp when the RSM C.S.M. woke us up by breaking in & telling us we were to sleep with our rifles & equipment handy ready to fall in, as Fritz was expected to attack in force.  I felt that "the moment had come" & lay awake waiting for it for some time, but when I went to sleep nothing disturbed me till this morning.
Dec 29thWe have been lately out on some queer fatigue each day.  We go out - one day it was to Messines
