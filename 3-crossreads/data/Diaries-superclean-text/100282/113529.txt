us to death at times, they do put a "barrage" over, don't we bless them.
4th Got up fairly early this morning for Fatty Gill I had to go down to Bailleul to get a prisoner no less than the notorious James of my platoon, the joker who was caught snatching the boots down at Meteren, we were to have gone down in our Mess cart but we chose to take a chance pick up lorries, so off we set, had to walk as far as La Clytte before we got our first lift this took us as far as Locre, hopped out here caught another one which took us into Bailleul, Jimmy I dumped our gear here, down in our Battn store went had a bonza hot bath in a private place after this the next item on the programme was to have some dinner so to a little tea room we rushed had some of the inevitable steak chips eggs, there's one thing that the French cant do that's make tea, of all the wishy washy stuff as ever you tasted well they make it, tastes something like slops is invariably cold weak
