  
 30 December 1918 Monday Commenced SQUAD!!! drill & rifle exercises again & the men naturally take no interest in such work now, but we must keep them employed-  Dolly writes that Mr Bertie  Austin & his wife called on her at Heliopolis- & were very nice I am so glad- As I may get an offer yet thro' them especially if they like the wife- Big dash of "Bolshie" in our men here last night a  Corporal  wanted to Order men to burn our Mess Tent down etc etc:- It is not safe to leave any article anywhere but it is immediately stolen & the language is appalling-
