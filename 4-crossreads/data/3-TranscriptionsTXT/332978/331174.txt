 December 7th maps to Chisholm. 
 Lecture by Col Williamson tonight on Evolution. 
 Very busy tonight saying goodbye to all my friends, &amp; obtaining their photos &amp; addresses. Finished with the main building at 11 pm &ndash; Then after I visited all rooms in our building I spent half an hour in our room &amp; had a drink all round after wishing them best of luck &amp;c. I adjourned to Chisholms room, where I was very enthusiastically received. All drank my health sang, he's a jolly good fellow, &amp; after exchanging photos &amp; addresses I eventually got to bed, feeling very tired &ndash; 
 December 8th Aroused 4 am. Had breakfast &amp; finished packing my hand bag then bade good bye to all of my friends. All saw us off. We entrained by 5.30 &amp; left for Heidelberg. It was rather a miserable journey, I did not like leaving so many good friends behind, they were indeed true friends &amp; their innumerable kindnesses to me I can never forget. 
 We were coached to the Station &amp; from Station to Heidelberg camp arriving there at 1 pm. Stingel accompanied us to Heidelberg &amp; as we were leaving that Station He said goodbye &amp; was I think sorry to depart with us. I know He thought a lot of me, &amp; if there is ever anything I can do for him, I certainly will for he is undoubtedly the whitest German I have ever met &amp; could wish to meet. 
 It is said that Freiburg is one of the best camps in Germany, this I am sure, &amp; I can always consider myself lucky that I was there so long, &amp; not drafted to Strohen Holtzminden, or any other camps in the 11th Army [indecipherable], where British officer receive extremely bad treatment &ndash; To bayonet an officer is quite a daily occurence &amp; when one hears of such unpardonable treatment as to leave British Prisoners in a burning hut &amp; make no attempt to rescue them, &amp; further more bayonet them if they dare attempt to escape thro the window, I think it is well time that we relatiated on German prisoners in England instead of treating them like Lords &ndash; 
 Had lunch &amp; idled about for a few hours after which we were shewn to our respective huts. Depended on Bosche food today &ndash;
