<p>Walked in Poperinghe through the rain &amp; mud &amp; reported at the station &amp; obtained a movement order by which we obtained a concession at Calais when buying the ticket for Paris. A tip to the train chap gave us a good seat and the train left at 1.35 A.M. &amp; reached Calais at 7 P.M. Here we had to change so left our bags with a Red Cap &amp; had breakfast in the town. Then we wandered round the town rather a fine place &amp; had a good view of market day, beach, splendid sands &amp; pier etc, bought some fruit,had a shave &amp;amp shampoo &amp;bought postcards views of the place &amp; then tram to the station catching the 12.30 train to Paris, tickets 6.20F each second class &amp; reached Paris at 10 P.M. Before leaving Calais procured tickets for dinner on the train &amp; entered the dining car at Boulogne there being no corridor getting off at Etaples, the train starting off again before we could get seated. This dinner was very good &amp; very well served costing 6 &frac12; Francs. Had an interesting conversation</p>
