<p>not much drill being done in the camp.  An instructor came out to give us some instruction as to how to keep fit during the voyage. With the medicine ball B Squadron beat A Squadron but B, our own troop lost to B of A Squadron.  Went into Sydney at night.  Got back to camp about 12 midnight.</p>
<p>Thursday 17th [Dec]<br/>Nothing much doing except to get the horses ready &amp; fit for the voyage.  B Squadron have been taking their horses into the bush every day during this week.  Regiment got paid.  My pay was rather short after deducting the fine.</p>
