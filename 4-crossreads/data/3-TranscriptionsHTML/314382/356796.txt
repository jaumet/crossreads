<p>cot and ten walking cases, so here again our anticipations were upset, leaving us still practically empty until we reach Port Said which is our next port of call.</p>
<p>October 27th: -<br/>A fearfully windy day during which rain fell heavily at times making it almost impossible to stay on deck for any length of time.</p>
<p>On ward duty in the morning but off for afternoon and night; the latter fortunately was perfect after 8 pm when the rain cleared off suddenly.</p>
<p>October 28th: -<br/>A glorious day throughout. Ship travelled at a great pace all day in perfectly smooth waters. Slept on deck.</p>
<p>October 29th: -<br/>Similar to the previous day, it being perfect. On ward duties all day but not very busy.</p>
<p>October 30th: -<br/>Arrived at Port Said at 7 am, the morning being fine &amp; clear. Took aboard 30 convalescent patients all of whom were sent to Wards F1 &amp; 2.</p>
<p>Sailed at 1 pm and at 1-15 pm we entered the famous Canal in which were passed several large steamers.</p>
<p>At 11 pm we anchored in the salt lake and remained there until 5 am as our ship had no headlight.</p>
<p>October 31st: -<br/>Sailed on at 5 am &amp; at 12 o'clock we arrived at Suez where we cast anchor.</p>
<p>Divine Service in morning and at 2 pm a joyous event took place for our mail was received; 47 letters was my lot along with a dozen papers &amp; the boys were in wild delight for the rest of the day.</p>
