<p>Move out of old camp at 8 am<br/>Find the track to our new position very hard to climb winding in   &amp;  out of the hills<br/>Reach new spot about 10 am. just as the New Zealanders are leaving<br/>We locate a position but it is nothing like the old one, the hill being too steep to allow of much digging</p>
