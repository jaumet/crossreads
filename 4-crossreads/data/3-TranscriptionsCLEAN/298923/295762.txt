  
 6 April 1918 Saturday (X to X crossed out) Carmelite Monastery.  Sent another Column to  Jericho  & now await Battery horses to move the last, X our Regt. are holding Bridgehead over Jordan, but come back in a day or so. X  Applied again for leave Cairo on finishing up job here- Keeping the men away from the diseased women has been one of my big troubles- I had a special Prophylactic Tent erected at gate, but the evacuations have been very numerous, as bad as Cairo in the early days- enclose you a P.P.C. letter from one of my Monk friends-   All rifles have to be handed in now & the monasteries have quite a lot.
