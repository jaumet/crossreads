I enjoyed the service immensely one of the best if have heard. Have never in all my life seen such glorious sunsets, words cannot describe the grandeur of this scene. We have sailed 276 miles to day, which is not too good when compared with our best days run of 308 miles. In the evening a short service was held in the Hospital    I presided at the piano with our famous orchestra again.
29th November.Discovered this morning that we had played our joke on Hancock too early, we were told on parade that we would cross the line at 2.30 in the afternoon. Father Neptune came on board at the appointed time & the usual ceremony was gone trough on the aft deck. I had a good view of the proceedings from the promenade deck. Every one was given a half holiday to see the fun. Officers Non-coms & privates were all brought before the Court & ducked in a big canvas bath, it was a great afternoon.  It was one continual laugh all the time.
30th November.Nothing startling occurred today, on ward duty again. Weather perfect. Sister Bob Roberts looked perfect in his short white britches & silk shirt.
