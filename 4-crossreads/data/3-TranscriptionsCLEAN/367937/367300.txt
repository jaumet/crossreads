My dear Mother,Enclosed are some pretty good photographs I got from a chap last night; the first one of the Egyptian ladies is taken in Cairo of course but the others are all taken round here and will give you a good idea of the camps and the class of country.I was very pleased to get some photos of home from Hal - You do all look toffy with the car; what an imprssion you must have created in Ulan when you were sailing through to the picnic at Reedy Creek.I don't think the paper the boys used was too good as the photos were a bit blurry, especially the one of the young rams, but some of the others were very good and you dont know how pleased I am to have them. Of the cards I am sending you, the fifth one is our camp and the place where I keep my horse is the left hand end of the back line in the middle; our tent is not there as it was taken before we came I think.Your parcel has not come yet but am still watching for it. I only wrote to you a couple of days ago.Love to Father and lots to your self Mother dear.I amYour loving sonRobert C. Wilson.
