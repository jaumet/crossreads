<p>France<br/>26 Oct 16<br/>My dearest Irene,<br/>It was so lovely to get several letters from you lately &amp; I have been unable to answer them &amp; we have been so much on the move. Expect you will hear of something, very by soon &amp; I will cable as soon as it is over. Did I thank you dear for your great kindness in sending me &pound; 15 per Nancy Norris. It was awfully good of you &amp; I am keeping &pound; 7 in gold in case of giving away. Hope you will like my Xmas present dear which I sent with my very best love &amp; wishes &amp; may the new year be Brighter.</p>
