Sunday 24 NovemberAt Avesnelles.  A walk to Quesnes which has been quite a decent little town with a fine church.  This morning some silly coot set fire to an old ammunition train and explosions have been going all day. Move again to-morrow to Solre le Chateau.
Monday 25 NovemberMove again to-day to Solre-le-Chateau, which is a decent sized town, about four miles from the Belgian Frontier. The steeple of the Church is rather imposing. Our billets, a one time German hospital are fine, all under one big roof. The march, about eight miles, was on wet roads but we had no rain. We are now in the area, evacuated by the Germans after the signing of the Armistice but even here the railways, cross roads & bridges have all been blown up by mines.
