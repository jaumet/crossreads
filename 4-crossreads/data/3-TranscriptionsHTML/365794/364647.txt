<p>Monday 2 September 1917 [1918]<br/>Cairo 4.30 p.m. &amp; took Laury &amp; Laddie Lawton to tea at Empire Club, bout Pt. 30 for cakes, sandwiches, etc., Groppis &ndash; very enjoyable little tea party under the old trees, then Laury &amp; I shop, brush for Mr. Lane, "the improved Englishman" as he says (brush Pt. 44) then back to 31st &amp; Heliopolis per motor &ndash; lovely evening light &amp; if only the hosp. were at peace, but never while this woman reigns I fear.  Pt. Lane after haem. from bowel (about [indecipherable]) is going on well &amp; malarias haem. from liver, bowel etc., it would seem, but too much like enteric stool for my fancy.</p>
