<p>previously occupied this region knew of this and kept up a certain</p>
<p>fire of shrapnel by day and night over the gully and more particularly</p>
<p>over the road.&nbsp; During the night we took over the section of the</p>
<p>front line held by one of our First Division battalions, the operation</p>
<p>taking all night to perform owing to congestion in the saps&nbsp;&nbsp; caused</p>
<p>through dead and wounded lying about, and carrying parties moving</p>
<p>along with stores and ammunition.&nbsp; In the morning after repelling two</p>
<p>half hearted German counter attacks we set to work to clean up the</p>
<p>trenches, a by no means small job.&nbsp; Bodies, equipment, rifles,</p>
<p>clothing, etc. lay about everywhere, and all a mixture of German and</p>
<p>our own.&nbsp; Outside the trench both to the front and rear not a level</p>
<p>or green spot remained.&nbsp; Great jagged, gaping craters covered the</p>
<p>blackish (high explosive shells turn the earth in the immediate</p>
<p>vicinity of the explosion black as though charred) ground, furrowed</p>
<p>and ploughed by every description of projectile and explosive.&nbsp; Shell</p>
<p>cases, bits of shells, chopped up barbed wire, &quot;duds&quot; (shells which</p>
<p>have failed to explode) and nose caps lie everywhere and it seems</p>
<p>impossible to realise that only a short time ago this had been a</p>
<p>peaceful cultivated field.&nbsp; It is hard to know ones position in a</p>
<p>land like this and anywhere it is difficult not to lose oneself.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>shell holes and wobbling trenches are as confusing as a maze and the</p>
<p>whereabouts of the enemy is not always easy to make out.&nbsp; Sometimes</p>
<p>he will be in a trench at right angles to your own, sometimes he may</p>
<p>be slightly in rear of your own trench an frequently he occupies the</p>
<p>same trench as yourself separated off merely by a sandbag barricade.</p>
<p>It was in the latter position that we found ourselves and it</p>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxx necessitated a whole day and night hand grenade fighting</p>
<p>to get the Boche out.&nbsp; There is perhaps no more horrible form of</p>
<p>fighting than bombing, unless it be gas.&nbsp; The range is so close and</p>
