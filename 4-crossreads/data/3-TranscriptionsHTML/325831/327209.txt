<p>Commanding Officer's' course at Aldershot for two months. I am very proud of Bas, he has done well. Travers is a Lieut-Colonel commanding a Battalion &amp; has also distinguished himself greatly.</p>
<p>I think I told you how young Harris of your Service did as one of my Engineer Officers. I tried to get him some distinction but have not succeeded yet. He is a most competent &amp; gallant officer &amp; deserves well of your Trust. I trust his service will be recognised.</p>
<p>I am so glad you saw my brave little daughter &amp; her fine son Billie. I have had numerous photos &amp; am very proud of the grandson.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear about poor old Norrie; give him my sympathy.</p>
<p>Kindest t=regards to Messrs Mance, Walsh, Smail &amp; Harry Williams. Best of good wishes to your good wife &amp; family &amp; heaps of good luck to yourself.</p>
<p>Your sincere friend</p>

<p>I forgot to say I am very well..</p>
