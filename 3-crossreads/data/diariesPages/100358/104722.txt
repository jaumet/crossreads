issue of coal is 6 lbs per man twice a week, 4 of which goes to the cook house towards the preparation of his warm food. This is just about sufficient to keep the stove going from 4 in the afternoon till midnight ? a real comfort. The sleeping is better than the Australian camps too. Three boards, about the width of a bed put together, rest on two tressles. A tick ? straw mattress ? and four blankets per man.

Little work was done for the first 3 days. On the second day a batch of 1500 wounded, but convalescent Anzacs, came into the camp. They were 3 months light duty men, all from Posieres and other parts of the Somme. We gave them a great reception as they entered. Everyone swarmed round them to inquire after friends.

These boys don't waste words they have seen too much and suffered the loss of too many good
