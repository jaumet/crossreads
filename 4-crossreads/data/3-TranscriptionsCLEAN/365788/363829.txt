  
 [Typed note] The enclosed letter was handed by Sergeant Parker a returned Wounded Soldier to Mrs H.E.Caldecott of Footscray Victoria, stating at the time that he feared the writer had been killed in action, and indeed went as far as saying he had. If such be true, possibly the sad news has already reached you officially. There may be some last message from the brave patriotic writer in the communication now forwarded. 
 28th July 1915.
