 
do not compare favourably with the Prussian Guard we read about early in the war.

It rained again early this morning but has since cleared up, although the sky still looks overcast and rainy.

Later
A terrific bombardment has started all along the front and the noise is terrible to have to endure. The shells go whistling along with an uncanny and sinister sound to strike the earth and explode with a noise like thunder.

At the present moment a terrible thunder storm has just eased off and while it lasted I assure you that it was not pleasant. The artillery fire never abated, and it coupled with the exceedingly heavy thunder claps made one think of home and mother. The rain pelted down in torrents and very soon the creeks and gullies were all running bankers. It was an awe-inspiring view to witness the vivid lightening flashes plainly siloutted against the devasted ruins of Albert.

It is now official that Roumania has thrown in her weight with the Allies and the million fresh bayonets that will be fighting will shorten the war considerably. Anyway we are all anxiously awaiting news of her first blows which will make themselves felt.
