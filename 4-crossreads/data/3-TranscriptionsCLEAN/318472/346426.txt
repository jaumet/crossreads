 Left Monte Video in Motors & went to Weymouth Station & left there about 2.30 P.M. Arrived at Bristol about 5.30 & "Avonmouth" 6 PM. and next straight on board of the Boonah. The country we travelled through from Weymouth to Bristol was very fine & beautiful - every thing looking at its best The country after passing Upway and again about "Freshford on Avon" & at Bath was particularly beautiful 
 Had a good time.
