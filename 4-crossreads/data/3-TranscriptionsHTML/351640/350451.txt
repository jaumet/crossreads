If such continues it will help materially to make our expedition the success which we hope may attend it at every stage of its progress.  If the individuals of a race be imbued with a proper pride in their forebears and relations and estimate at a high standard the value of their country, the material for those training them is of the best quality, and if the instructors be qualified for the tasks the result is bound to be of the best.  So it may be with all connected with No 2 General Hospital which is attached to the Military Division which constitutes the Australian Imperial Expeditionary Force.</p>
