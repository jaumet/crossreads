Notes of October
Just here it is as well to note that there is a peculiar disease flourishing throughout all Europe & has been for months past.  It is a severe influenza, or in French, "Grippe Espagnol".  It is more than influenza but how much more the medical men cannot say.England, France, Germany & Spain have been very severely afflicted & the troops are also suffering from the epidemic.  The % of mortality is very high & American soldiers arriving in England are liable to it. This month the Educational Scheme has become part of the daily routine of the Ambulance.
