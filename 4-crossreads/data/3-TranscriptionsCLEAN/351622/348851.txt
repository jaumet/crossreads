 29 June 1916 Thur Digging all day making two large grease traps. Received a long letter from Roy. Glad to hear that all is well & moreso to learn of his enlistment. I am getting sick & tired of this place one wants something new some excitement of some sort. The big bombardment started to night [text continued at top of page] 
 30 June 1916 Fri Bricklaying most of the day with Sgt Thomas. Had an early tea & went on a visit to the 17th Batt. Stopped at D Company where I met Wilbert Carrol who informed me of Norm Lewis death. I then saw Ronny & Mac adjourning with them to their billet where we had a good old talk & several of the best. 22 aeroplanes.
