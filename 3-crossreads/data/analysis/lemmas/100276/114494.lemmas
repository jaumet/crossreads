 Thing were fair quiet till near 2 oclock then old Fritzi took it into his head to send some of his pet bomb over the Minnewerf soon got busi but although they have a veri bad name I would for rather have them than shell for you can dodg the Minni you can see them as plain as day for that are just like one of those great big oil drum that you will see anywher , you can both hear the report when they are discharg see them come over they turn over over in the air go up hundr of feet high then fall anywher for happili they ca n't rang them too accur , I think they are more for moral effect
