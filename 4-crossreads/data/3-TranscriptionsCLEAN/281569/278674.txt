3 Steamers went through the canal today, one large, the railway is being pushed still further out every day.
Chas got his promotion today & is now down at the Sq H Qrs as, wireless officer, old Meredith is fighting ours & is likely to prove troublesome especially with regard to his own Regt who he wants as Sig Officer is Nelson, anyhow we hope for the best. Mail came to hand today one from Nell & another from Mother, Nell seems to be having a good time too good in fact.
Shelters arrive for here possibly for the Bde coming in, certainly not for us.
