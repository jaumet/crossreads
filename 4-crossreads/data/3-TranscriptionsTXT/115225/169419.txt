 Jan 30  th  &nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely day again &amp; no word of sailing. no hope of going ashore - we had no parades, spent the time lounging about watching the niggers &amp; eating fruit - some of the boys dived off the deck into the water for a swim but were stopped on account of the number of sharks about - 
 &nbsp; 
 Jan 31  st  &nbsp;&nbsp;We hear that we are to sail on Friday. the weather is beautiful not too hot. &amp; lots of fruit to eat. the paw-paws are beautiful - three sharks were seen cruising close to the boat - a party left the &quot;Berimar&quot; in a life boat &amp; also we sent a party in a boat &amp; they had a race -&nbsp; 
 Feb 1  st  &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing special doing&nbsp;&mdash; 
 Feb 2  nd  &nbsp;&nbsp;I was put on main guard in the morning (24 hour guard) We sailed at 2.P.M. Cornwall still with us. Whilst on my post at about 2 AM I saw Ursa Major (the great bear or dipper). &amp; also the Southern Cross at the same time 
 &nbsp; 
 Feb 3  rd  &nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is getting cooler every day. my cobbers wouldn&#39;t believe that the S. Cross &amp; the dipper could be seen together so I wakened them in the early morning &amp; brought them on deck to convince them
