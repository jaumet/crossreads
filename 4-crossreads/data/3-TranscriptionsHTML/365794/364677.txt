<p>Monday 1 October 1917<br/>1st Oct.  Daily routine the same.  We become more &amp; more limp, all who can manage it are out in mufti &ndash; any sort &ndash; soft collars etc.  One more visit to Hold for blue bloomers, etc.  Then "Johnny Walker" in all his fancy attire.  (Wallace's coat &amp; eye glass &amp; stick, tall hat &amp; swinging bottle.)  Rec'd "highly recommended".<br/>Waltzed a little, sang, talked &amp; then to sleep.  9 sisters sleeping up on deck, myself not yet.  We gradually become acquainted &amp; little friendships form which may last who knows for ages.</p>
