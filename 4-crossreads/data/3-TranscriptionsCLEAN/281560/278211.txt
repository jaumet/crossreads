  
 4/2/16. Far out at sea on a glorious day. We passed an Orient Liner today, she was a splendid spectacle, as she swept past not 300 yards away. The boxing tournament was continued this evening we are being treated to some fine sport. 7/2/16. Leiut Lenaham tipped that we would go to France; and tried to teach us some french phrases. He deserves decorating. The final of the boxing contest was fought and we had a concert in the evening. 8/2/16. Guard work again. Passed clusters of islands this morning; came abreast of Cape Guardalfure (Africa) in the afternoon. Somalie Land is a dreary looking hole. All sand dunes and thorn bushes.
