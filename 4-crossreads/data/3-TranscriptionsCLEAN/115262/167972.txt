  
 Tuesday 24 July 1917. 
 Reveille as usual. No riding on mules this morning as they are being inoculated. 
 Received local papers from home and "Bulletin" from Joy. 
  Kantara was bombed by a Turkish taube last night so report goes. Hardly creditable . 
 Rumors as to marching out. 
 Went to main Moascar Camp to see 99 Cpl. H. J. Brennan 4 A.L.H. who called about G. Kelley last Friday afternoon. Never saw him.
