 Wednesday 11 [10] July 1917 [1918] Long busy days full of nursing our boys.  About 60 and generally in a fine mess as a rule.  One prints photos for me, another writes up &amp; papers to help me, and one &amp; all always have a ready smile &amp; word. Every moment is lived when in the wards, &amp; out of them.  Well the Aust. sisters are friendly even if Miss G. is always taking me up wrongly &amp; speaking as though I were a terrible offender.  Very interesting is it to note change of heat &ndash; now moist &ndash; as the Nile floods, &amp; morning fogs occur. 
 Capt. Leach gives the pts. Dovers pdr. [powder] grs. x in preference to Asp. [Aspro ?] (which is very expensive).  Most pts. on Mist strych. 
 Qir. [?] grs. x 1 a.s. Mist &ndash; Alba 1 a.s. 
 [Note in margin] Officers ward.
