1915May. 5 Wed.In afternoon went out to Lunar Park Hospital at Heliopolis to see L. Cpl. Val Marshall who after getting being in the trenches 3 days at Dardanelles got a bullet in the shoulder - Discovered him after a great deal of difficulty & had an interesting yarn with him - as far as I yet know he is the only members of our Scouts Assn. who has been wounded although the casualty lists are not yet out.
