only for some carelessness or other with our transfer papers.  I suppose long before this reaches you you will have had a Happy Christmas.  I hope you get the present I sent & Father also.  In a couple of weeks we ought to be getting a big Christmas mail & parcels, it will be great when we do as we haven't had any for a good time & coming over generaly causes a bit of a delay.
