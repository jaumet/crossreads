Keith might be able to give some school particulars -
May 22
My dear Ferguson,The Hermes made such a rotten mess of the last notice. Page 1 enclosed shows that I sent page 1 + letters & the notice omitted everything of any value & spelt Edinburgh Edinbough. If the notices are [indecipherable] why not get Keith to initial it? It wd. be nice to have an old pal do it.
[indecipherable] for the material with my thanks. Hermes is not yet to hand I will return it in the mail.
[indecipherable]
Can you send me a draft?
