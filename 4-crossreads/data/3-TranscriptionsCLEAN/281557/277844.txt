  
 Sunday Jan 30th a fine clear day : cold in the morning & night : revellie 6 am : nothing before breakfast : chirch parade 9.45 am & very nice : we had made arrangements to go to the deadcity trip & had to meet the guide at 11.15 am. Just as we had got our tucker & water bottles out & ready to leave on our trip the "alarm" sounded & we had to double up  & turn out in full marching kit. The ammuntion &am; rations came out : It was fair dinkum this time : camel corps & light horse turned out : we were all happy with the expectation of having a scrap : the rumour was that the natives had risen : after a while we were marched to our tents for dinner & told to stand by our arms & equipment : had to turn out again about 2 pm for another "alarm" after standing to arms for a while : we gave the general salute which looked very pretty with fixed bayonets at the "present". This must have been rather "real' as the A.M.C. also turned out & the officers had their revolvers buckled on & aeroplanes buzzed around overhead. We were very disappointed at not having a scrap. It is a funny feeling no sign of fear : just a desire to be in it & doing something : I learned afterwards that  a riot of some sort had occurred out Mena way with the natives but I don't know whether it was a fact
