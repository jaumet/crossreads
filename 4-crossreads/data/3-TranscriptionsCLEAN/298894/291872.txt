  
 II. Ours is No 1. tent & full of decent lads.     Each one just a soldier with individual fads Herbert is the captain & sings a decent song He's made himself quite popular Though we haven't known him long. He's pretty good at tennis, in church he has some rank and serves the mess as treasurer, as experienced in the bank. 
 III. Greenwell is his neighbour, his place he proudly fills He's got a troubled stomach, so we designate him pills. He turns in pretty early & isn't long awake. He'll pass his time most pleasantly if sitting near a cake. 
 IV. Then we have Young Jonesy, a lad who's here to learn. He wants to get a cross or two then safely return. There's not much doubt about him, he's willing and  he's bright. We'll one & all stand by him & help him in his fight. 
 V. Brother Andrews - Padre bears a double Cross The red one on his arm & the other - Life's great loss. Today he's just a soldier with a dollar clear a day But his precept & example preaches more than he could say 
 VI. Gissing is our tallest mate a chemist & a sport Possessor of a camera (which hasn't yet been caught) There's no nonsense about him though above us all he towers He tells us that in sleep he likes to spend his full eight hours. 
 VII. Bingham is our baby & causes lots of mirth If he hasn't any funny jokes he'll promptly give one birth.
