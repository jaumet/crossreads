was indulged in, only now again a Gun would fire or a shell from Fritz would come over. As I worked a shift on Christmas Day I was given New Years day off until next Day at 16 oclock (4 Pm). I obtained a Pass in the morning for Poperinghe as there were a light Engine going into Peselhoek at 11-20 am I got a lift by it. On arrival at Arrival Farm a few mide about 1 mile from here, instructions were issued to the Guard on the Engine to Proceed into P.A. Siding a little further down to pick up any empty Trucks. This Siding has a large Ammunition Dump alongside it receives a large amount of Bombing Shelling at times, the British West India Boys do all the unloading of shells they don't worry the Driver not half for Coal, permission was given to two to fill their Sand bags soon the Tender was alive with Niggers, the Driver soon had to stop them or they would have seen emptied the Tender. On coming out of the Siding I was shown a Nessian Hut which a Bomb dropped by Fritz the night before had hit the Hut right in the centre made a complete wreck of the Hut, killing 5 soldiers who were inside at the time. A little further down I saw a Baru which also had been hit the night
