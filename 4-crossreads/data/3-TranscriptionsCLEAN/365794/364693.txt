Macdonald & strained relations exist.  Why cannot she leave us both alone as we do her? Day's routine same as ever.  Read "Nursing" 7 to 8.30 a.m., knit balaclava, read, play patience & quoits.  We are nearing the end of our journey & little frictions occur daily which once we are at work will I trust be less frequent - baths are daily source with some of them.  Daily the loss of someone to whom one could really talk & learn from grows more acute.  Moral - one should devote all one's life - if needful - to finding either man or woman with whom there is some understanding!
