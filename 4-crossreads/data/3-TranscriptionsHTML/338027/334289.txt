<p>Monday, 21st December, 1914<br/>Yesterday was the accession of the new Sultan, great ceremony, all Egypt decorated with flags &amp; bunting, big procession of British &amp; Aust Troops &amp; Egyptian Cavalry.  The [indecipherable] class Egyptians rejoice at the new regime under British rule &amp; there are only a few against it, these are mostly mercenary troops that may go over to the Turks.</p>
<p>This morning we rode our horses for the first time they all went well with the exception of a couple of harmless spills.  Sammy went well but a little too eager.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 22nd December, 1914<br/>In morning mounted troop drill ponies a bit rough mine especially.  We heard that there was to be a big parade of the Maadi Camp of L.H. through Cairo to salute General Maxwell the "governor" who is in command of all troops in Egypt.  There were only eight allowed to go out of all our section of over 50, &amp; I was one selected..  in order to make an impression we spent all the p.m. polishing our saddle bits &amp; doing up our harness &amp; it was late at night when we finished.</p>
