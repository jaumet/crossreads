Dear Dad,
I have a few of your letters to answer yet so will get a move on.  I see by Lock's letter that quite a lot of the men who struck have been having a bad time since they went back to work.  I'm glad indeed that you were not affected, altho' I see by yours of 11 July that your class has not got much out of it.  I am pleased to notice you are on full time, and I presume the 2/6 extra a week will allow of a few bottles now and again.
I see the Highland Society got a knock-back over the kilt question.  Personally I don't see why the Scotch should be favoured any more than anyone else, especially so late in the day as this.  I don't think the wearing of a kilt would induce men to come along any more freely.  You don't see too many of them over here at all.  One of our crowds has a Pipe Band
