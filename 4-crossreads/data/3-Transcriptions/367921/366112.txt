<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Shortly after arriving back at Munster I determined on faking some complaint, that, provided the German Doctor could be "bluffed", would prevent me from being sent out to work over the winter months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this purpose in view I reported sick one morning, telling the Doctor that I had had an epileptic fit over night and producing a mate to substantiate my statement.<br/>I fancy I must have looked honest, or perhaps the solitary confinement had made me look a mighty sick man, for my tale was accepted and I was classified as a man unfit for work of any kind and put on an exchange list for England - though I was under surveillance for some days.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Having achieved very much more than I had aimed for I was certainly not a scrap behind in giving the "fits" a further I flutter, always having recovered when the sentries put in an appearance.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I was very sorry to lose the pal I had attempted escape [with, for after we had been in camp about a fortnight he was sent off on a working party, and took with him the compass and maps that we intended using again, I also gave him the greater part of my civilian money, knowing that if I didn't succeed in passing the final board of doctors I would be sent back to the camp where I should have plenty of opportunities for acquiring all the necessary articles for another attempt for my liberty.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Three weeks passed and my ruse was still going strong, Life, generally speaking, in this camp was fairly comfortable, for thanks to the Red Cross there was a very fair library in the  camp, and this , with a concert or picture show once a week used to help break the monotony although field grey uniforms and barbed wire could not be forgotten.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The canteen in the camp run by Germans was a huge Joke, for all that could be bought were cigarettes (which used to cost  8 pfenigs, equivalent to 1d a piece) and were pretty rotten too<br/>at that. Swedish matches, all manner of brushes and tooth paste and once a week "vin blac" of a very inferior quality was  available at a cost of a mark for a small wineglass, but it was a rare occasion when any of us were financial enough to attempt I drowning our sorrows and tribulations.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Medical treatment in the camp was a bit of a farce, for  apart from the paper bandages the doctor's verdict for any kind  of minor complaint was "aspirin tablets" and "arbide" which meant work - both in the same breath.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I had been out of gaol seven weeks, having a good time  so far as good times went in Deutcshland, when one afternoon about 3 o'clock I was warned to get myself in readiness to move</p>
