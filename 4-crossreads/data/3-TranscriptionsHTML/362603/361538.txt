<p>Bulford<br/>30.10.17<br/>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,<br/>I wrote to You all last Sunday week.  On the Monday following I had to catch the 8.45 am Train to London.  I escorted a Patient down to Chelsea.  I passed the old Chelsea Barracks &amp; saw some of the old Veterans who live there.  I handed over My Patient &amp; then returned to London.  I went through Westminster abbey.  All the King's Tombs are covered with sand-bags so I did not see them.  I then took a Bus &amp; went up to St Pauls Cathedral.  Ugh, it is a tremendous place.  I thought Salisbury &amp; the Abbey were large but St Pauls is very large.  I climbed right up to the Top (627 Steps) &amp; had a look all over London.  It was very smoky but I saw a good distance off.  I went into the famous whispering gallery &amp; down into the Crypt also.  I will buy a Book about each place so that You will gain an idea what the places are like.  I then went over to Euston just in time to catch the 4 pm train to Liverpool.  I had two Ladies as travelling companions.  No one of us spoke until we reached Rugby some considerable distance out.  I wanted a cup of tea so I brought 3 &amp; even then it was about half-an-hour before we began to converse with one another.  One Lady got out at Stafford so I had the other Girl all the way to Liverpool.  We read &amp; slept most of the way.  I arrived at the Hotel at 10.30 &amp; went straight to bed.  The</p>
