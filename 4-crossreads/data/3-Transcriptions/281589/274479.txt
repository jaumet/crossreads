<p>We left camp at 9.45 AM, we marched behind a draft going to France, the band played us down to the station. We had to wait some time on the station, the band played tunes &amp; when the train left the station the band played Auld Lang Syne, such a send off for such a small party only 36 of us. It was 10.45 AM when we left Codford, had nearly an hour to wait at Westbury where we changed trains.
