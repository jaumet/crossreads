<p>At Beutin<br/>Usually daily routine .<br/>Weather fine.<br/>Played 53rd Bty a game of Rugby during afternoon result draw 5-5<br/>I went along to Etaples with Dick then to Paris Plage. The latter is in Peace Time a pleasure resort and is indeed a pretty little place.<br/>There are quite a number of W.A.A.C.s camped at the former place.<br/>Etaples is a peace time big fishing centre, and possesses a very large square, not to mention an electric tram service to Paris Plage.</p>
