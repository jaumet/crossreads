<p>Friday 18.5.17<br/>72 of us going out into line again to-night to do a further turn in.  5 men go on leave, very lucky to get away at such a time.  Left camp 5.30 pm, luckily got on[e] of the back posts; still Fritz made it fairly warm with big stuff around about, especially in the village of Neuriel near by.</p>
<p>Saturday 19.5.17<br/>Dug in for a bit of shelter, much quieter than when we were out last.  Fritz has been using a great number of gas shells &amp; has caught a good many of our boys napping.</p>
<p>Sunday 20.5.17<br/>Very few casualties coming through, much quieter since the "Tommies"</p>
