busy with typewriter and clerks. The amount of paper used in this War is something enormous and seems to increase. Returns and memorandums of all sorts everywhere - no wonder they are kept busy. Old P.V. Martin is in trouble once more and now in the guard room.  Put different specialist officers on to new jobs -  JA Smith on the Lewis guns, Greene on the Musketry &c and hope that these new brooms will sweep clean. Owing to so much business I have had no time to talk with the family here today beyond 'Bon Jour' and 'Bon Soir'. There is a decidedly good looking wench & full of blushes. The small one's a little flapper. A  dull raw day and fuel for fires is short.
