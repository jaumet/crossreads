The Canal is very deep and wide near TUKH- EL-KHEIL here. and there is only a rickety old plank bridge to cross on and in one place there only remains one plank the other two have carried away.

Then the cows and calves <strike>go</strike> have to swim  Sheep &amp; goats and donkeys go per bridge until they come to the place where only one plank exists. Then the fun starts. Sheep &amp; goats hustle each other for a foothold with the result that numbers of them always the weaker vessels so to speak get unceremoniously tipped into the swift flowing current. They are of course good swimmers as it happen but the experience is anything but pleasant because the poor devils will have to go to</p>
