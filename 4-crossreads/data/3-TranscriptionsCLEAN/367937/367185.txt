One great thing about this place is that there are hot and cold showers and My Word! they are great after only taps down at the camp - at Ras-el-din there are sea baths, a tennis court and all sorts of things, they say, so it must be a pretty good place.Monday 19th JuneHad great luck today.  Got on soft side of Sister Skinner and she went and saw the Matron and the O.C. and all the boss cockies and the result is  we are all off to see the Pyramids.  I got six of us to sling in and we are getting a car and a sister coming with us and we have got leave from 2.30 till 6.30.My Word it is great.  It will only cost us about 6/- each which is not much.I ought to get some great photos.Wonder how the rams are:  I am just aching to know how things are looking at home.It is most awfully against rules for us to go and Sister nearly got eaten for asking but she got it for a' that.Must go and tog now.Love to Mother.  I will write to her soon.I amYour loving sonRobert C. Wilson
