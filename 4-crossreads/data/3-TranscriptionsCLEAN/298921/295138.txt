June, 1915Wednesday 16From all I can gather from the wounded I do not think the Turks are mutilating our wounded except odd cases - I, among all the wounded in Cairo have not found one case so far.I have posted you some papers at different times & hope you receive them.What lot did Harry Phillips come with & Fred Knight, they no doubt are now camped opposite, but with so many troops one cannot find individuals - only an ant out here; & of small consequence.Weight 12 stone 6 lbs
