Had a good rum issue this morning and after breakfast C and D Coy's were all at work cleaning the mud from round the huts and carrying bricks and stone to make a dry roadway for us to walk on. I kept myself warm by the use of the old pick, picking out bricks for the boys to carry, we are getting our bricks and stone from the ruins of a part of Fricourt, you would never know that once there had been a a French village here for everything is levelled with the ground and the Germans have made big dugouts many feet deep under most of the houses using the bricks etc. in the building. 
We are now turning these dugouts to our own use the town Mayor of Mametz has his residence in one of them, some of them are fitted up nicely.
8th On a different fatigue today had 20 men with picks and shovels
