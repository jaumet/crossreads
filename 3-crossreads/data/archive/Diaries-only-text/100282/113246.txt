hope I am not too bad for we have a 6 miles march on the other side before we get to our Camp.
Jock Cocky have just come back from seeing about their whisky, theres going to be a row over it I think, it appears they told the officer that if he did not give them back their whisky, they would not go aboard the ship, the officer said he had given the whisky to the Major, that their conduct was practically mutiny he did not know whether the ship would sail or not tonight certainly not with Jock true enough itjust as we were getting aboard old Jock was ordered to go over see the Embarkation Officer he put him under arrest the last we saw of Jock was being marched off to the clink between 2 Sgts. Jock waved his hands to us, Curran Revelle wanted to go with Jock for they were equally guilty but the Officers wouldn't listen to them so thats how the matter stands for the present, I am sorry for Jock
