<p>Monday July, 30th<br/>Raining nearly all day. Very busy cleaning up all the old rubbish from all the other huts, it is being concentrated in my hut, &amp; a rotten job it is too. General muster parade held this morning, a chap out of this camp was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, for breaking gaol last June, forging passes, absent without leave, &amp; resisting arrest. His setence was read out on the parade, I suppose to set an example to the rest. He got all he deserved anyhow. Not feeling too well today.</p>
<p>Tuesday July 31st<br/>Not much doing today, nearly all the cleaning up finished. A new system of dining has been instituted in camp here. Separate huts have been set aside as mess huts, &amp; permanent mess orderlies do all the work. I suppose our mess will now be done away with. It will save a lot of bother though, as all you have to do is to go in &amp; have your meal &amp; come out again. The food is served up ready, &amp; the orderlies do the washing up after you. Raining again today. The Lieutenant Q.M. has apparently quietened down to his job, as he does not torment us so much now.</p>
