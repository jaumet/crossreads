<p>Saturday<br/>6/2/16</p>
<p>into a storm during the night. Just about starting of the Bight. Good few of the Boys Onkaparinga. Have 7 Nurses on Board, we get along very nicely &ndash; Capt Rhodes, Major Argyle are very nice &ndash; even when I call them at midnight. Bitterly cold.</p>
<p>Sunday<br/>7/2/16</p>
<p>Very cold. C. England service at 10 am <strike>R.C. 11 am.</strike> No sight of land, doing an average 12 knots. Quite a novelty to see a school of whales &ndash; some I should say 30 feet long &ndash; quite near the Boat, plenty of sharks.<br/>My watch has gained 35 minutes against ships time so had to put back. A huge roll on, quite a number of Boys off their "Mungaree". An average of 20 cases in the Hospitals, also some cases in the isolation ward. Still feeling fit &amp; laughing at the others &ndash; no saying for how long.</p>
