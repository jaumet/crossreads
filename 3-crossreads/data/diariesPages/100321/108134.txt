13/1/19 Gourdinne
A loafing day. Matthews left on English leave and will probably not return here. Afternoon there was only an unexciting football match to vary the monotony.
14/1/19
Again a quiet day. I made an inspection of H.Q. and found the Transport not too good but they had been having a great jollification on last night and all had sore heads this morning. The football match B v HQ was won by H.Q. Ryan broke his ankle while playing. Brown S.C. and Maier interpreter came in for a talk. Keith Sutherland was tired tonight and has been working too hard so I shall try and get him away for a little leave. A fine capable kid this and would work till he dropped.
