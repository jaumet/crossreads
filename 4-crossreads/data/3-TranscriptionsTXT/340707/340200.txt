It happened like this I was too late to be certain that buses would get as far as Whitehall so I went for Tube. There was a big crush but I got in & in train some gent whose little boy I had saved from being crushed advises me to go to St James Park which is inside the ring which procession makes & hence after this train is out of bounds This reasoning is good & we get an excellent view in Rochester Row.
Her Navy marches first after the visiting contingents of course Haig is very pale & as it turns out afterward is very ill. After all has passed I try to get out but policeman says only way is by 'plane but if I wait an hour at Tube station I may get in.
As I want something to eat having missed my breakfast I decide to wait but imagine my surprise when I walk right in. Everybody has expected the crush & avoided it. I reach town long before procession has reach town & dine in comfort as all the world is still looking at the procession.
At 2 pm there are several concerts in Hyde Park & rustic dancing including a revival of the old English dances
