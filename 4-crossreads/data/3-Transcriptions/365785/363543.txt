<p>get back to Egypt again.  I managed to get in the road of a Turkish bullet so was not on the Peninsular right up to the last but had to leave a few days before the final.  The wound was really nothing, just a clean hole through the left arm just above the elbow, but I had a rather bad abcess caused through an infection from a Tetanus antitoxin inocculation &amp; that kept me quiet for about a fortnight after I got back.  I am <strike>quiet</strike> quite better now though &amp; back at work again.  As you may imagine we are kept pretty busy now.  We have to go back to the beginning &amp; start again &amp; it is rather stale at times.  We don't know where our destination is to</p>
