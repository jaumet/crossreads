 It rained a little in the afternoon but it didn't matter as it was our half holiday. 
 We had some rather good tucker today, bacon for dinner also a ration of cheese & raisons. 
 We are very expectant today. We have heard that that a big mail is due tomorrow & that a lot of stores we ordered from the canteen is coming in the morning. To cap it all we have been told that leave for 48 hours to 3 %  leave  of the man is being granted soon as we are quite excted. 
 Bob Harris & Andy Luke went to hospital with mumps. 
 Our canteen stuff arrived tonight. Had a feed on the strength of it.
