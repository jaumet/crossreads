We had a lecture this morning from a gas expert. All the Batt N.C.O's had to attend with their helmets had to do all sorts of drill work in them didn't it make us swear all in our own time too.
Had a fatigue party this afternoon they were working for the Pioneers 
This evening I went to the "pictures" after that I attended a lecture given by Capt McNicholl on his recollections of the S. African War, it was very good the Y.M.C.A. was crowded, we have 2 "picture" shows each night in the same hut
