  
 26 December Sunday  1915 I am afraid my notes must be difficult to read & in future will endeavour to write more clearly - And so we return to Egypt - You remember the saying "Having once tasted the waters of the Nile one is bound to return to Egypt" I hope the same may apply to the old Murrambidgee - I love the Gum trees but the Palms & the Nile & the Desert have undoubtedly a charm. Arrived Alexandria noon Bright sunshine blue sea & all's well - The next move I expect will be Cairo - Transports Hospital Boats & Warships all following each other. Arrived safely Aerodrome camp 5 p.m. Monday
