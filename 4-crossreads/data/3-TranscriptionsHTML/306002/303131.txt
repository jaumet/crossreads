<p>5.5.15<br/>Wed. 5th.  The Regt. had dismounted parade today.  We were signalling with H. Quarters this morning &amp; played quoits after dinner.  This afternoon C Sqd. took back all the horses belonging to the reinforcements to Abbassieh, &amp; all spare horses in the Regt. were also returned.  I believe that 75&percnt; of the Regt. have to go to the South of Greece to guard Turkish prisoners.  The other 25&percnt; are to remain here &amp; take care of the horses.  After tea I went to Heliopolis with Arthur &amp; a couple of his friends &amp; had a good time.</p>
