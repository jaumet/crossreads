Inspected the church &amp; saw the door which the Germans prized open to gain admittance to the steeple. Went also to Meteren &amp; Strazelle doing altogether about 20 miles. Saw old trenches.</p>
<p>21 April 1916 Good Fri<br/>There were no hot cross-buns on the doorstep this morning. A very quiet day slept nearly all day. A very busy night kept going all the time. One poor cove was brought in with a temperature of 105 &amp; after getting to work for an hour I brought it down to 101. The search lights are watching for aircraft.</p>
