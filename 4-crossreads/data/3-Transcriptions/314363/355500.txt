<p>would have sold out for very little, there was a spit of land, which branched off into two  areas, a bridge to each, one of these bridges was broken &amp; the engineers were repairing it, apparent by the one we crossed by, had previously been broken, judging by the condition.<br/>We arrived at the far side safely &amp; found posies against a cliff with a hill behind. Here we remained all the night, the shell fire, heavy some bursting only about fifty yds ahead, some behind us, others fell into the water, throwing the water high into the air.<br/>The engineers were fine they worked through all this &amp; every moment I expected the bridge to be blown up again, however they completed the job, &amp; did it well.<br/>About 8 Am the next morning we moved a little more forward to the foot of another rise.<br/>The shell fire had not ceased &amp; the fighting ahead was hard, we were continually seeing wounded go by, I was beginning to wonder how I was going to live through the day.<br/>When we arrived at this new position, some of us got down into a dugout, but I sat down outside thinking it was safe.</p>
