I will endeavour to give you a sketch of our tent at night as we lie packed around the tent with our feet into the centre pole and the candle propped up on an improvised table near the door."Jim Flynn", whose proper name I really don't know, is the first on the right inside the door. He is only 19 and is held in admiration by the others on account of his reputation as a beer drinker. He is only a little fellow and very quiet out here, the only evidence of his past prowess being his often repeated wish for 1/2 dozen pints or a vividly expressed determination to put down a dozen quarts as soon as he hits town. No beer being allowed in camp. He stares hard with an amazing fixity of gaze, at a point on the tent pole in front of him for hours at a stretch without showing any sign of interest whilst the others talk about him and crack jokes at his expense. I don't know what his former occupation was, but he seems a decent hearted little chap.Next him comes "Christee". He is very cock-eyed, very rude - no manners at all, a real glutton for his meals, and a terror to swear. He is a fair size, weighs about 11 stone, but is not very tall. He was formerly a butcher boy. He is always on the cadge for something and is as lazy as sin.  No. 3 is "Bob". He is a very decent little chap and a great wag. He is good natured and as a consequence is much imposed upon by the others. He is always losing some portion of his kit but never crumbles and professes to be quite satisfied with the remnant.
