<p>I heard a good description of a camel the other day. "The camel is a four footed quadruped, which eats dirt and spits bricks &ndash; hence the Pyramids" One of our Corporals is a "Keystone" too. Was drilling some of the men a few days ago, and was so pleased with the way they drilled, that he told them they were "just like a bit of mechanicism"</p>
<p>I have seen quite a number of Lindfield boys over here. Allan Gordon, Os. Mutton, Les Wynne, "Polly" Burton, Jim Coy Les is in the 11/B and camped right alongside me. The way I met Jim boy was very funny. Was down the Pay Office obtaining some &pound; 700 to pay the men, and who should hand it to me but Jim. He has had some marvellous escapes from death while at the Front, and no due expected him to pull through. He looks pretty well now, though he is not as bulky as when he left Australia. Last Sunday week I went out with him for a stroll round, and had some real good games of billiards at the British Recreation Club's Rooms.</p>
