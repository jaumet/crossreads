stock of knowledge concerning bombs & explosives & etc. In the afternoon all the bombers & Trench Mortar people had an hours ceremonial drill, at this school officers and all have to carry rifles & it was dead funny to watch the antics of some of them, after this a march home & a lecture on German bombs to finish the days work They have a number of German prisoners working on and around this school & they will eat anything the poor devils can't be too well fed judging by their wan looks & what they eat, I have seen them picking the scraps out of the slop tubs & eating them greedily, our chaps always give them what is left off the tables & you should see them dwelling on this.
