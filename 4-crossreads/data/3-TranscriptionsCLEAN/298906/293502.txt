  
 however I shan't forget "Pozeries" for I was one of the very first over the parapet on that fateful morn; & even now I can see the awful flashes of thousands of shells as we swept forward, & our objective seemed to be miles away, but we reached it alright & hung on through the awful bombardment that followed shortly afterwards. I never thought I would come out of that "Hell" for it seemed impossible however it was a great victory & one which we can always look back upon with pride, & a certain amount of regret, when one thinks of the many fine mates he lost in that inferno. Been a nasty muggy close heat today, I can't say as how I care much for English weather
