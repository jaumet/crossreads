I gave 5/- to it. Also a German and an English message form. Think that all. I was rather amused the other night. I took some letters of mine up to a Capt to get them censored. As he was out I left them open on his table for him. When I came back afterwards I got into an awful row. He wanted to know if I thought he was a blankety-blank letter licker for me, and said next time I left letters for him to censor to leave them sealed! Of course no decent officer ever reads letters once he knows a chap at all, but you generally hand them in open for politeness sake.
