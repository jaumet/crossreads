26/3/18 ? La Basse Ville
Rather late before getting up. An officer of the M.G.M.'s came in and reported himself and I gave him a very rough telling off that quite upset him and will lead most likely to his Battery taking a more active part in operations in the future. The B.M. called in with Coglan of the Engineers. Our patrol last night found a demolition charge evidently carried by the Hun raiders the other night. It was covered with blood. We had 2 men wounded slightly last night. The enemy is wonderfully quiet in front of us and has evidently thinned his front system very much.
