<p>Sat. Aug. 4th<br/>3rd Anniversary of the War.<br/>It has rained now for 4 consecutive days.  Last night it came down very heavily, &amp; its just as bad now.  The poor devils in the Line must be suffering.  At Breakfast I met Bill Lancaster.  Like me he was not lucky enough to get to Blighty.  He looks real sick.  The Breakfast was very rough.  Weak, cold Tea.  A small piece of Fat Ham, &amp; dripping in place of Butter.  Last night went to Y.M.C.A.  It is a fine building with Billiards &amp; all kinds of games &amp; 2 pianos.  It was absolutely packed.  I had a cup of Tea &amp; some Biscuits, also procured a few sheets of paper, so now I can do what I've wanted to all the week &amp; that is write   Letter No. 28 to old B.E.</p>
<p>Dinner was fairly decent. Roast mutton &amp; Peas &ndash; Plum duff. After dinner went over to Church Army Hut. It is a very fine building, would seat about 1000. It has a fine stage, &amp; I believe they have a very good Concert Party &ndash; permanent. <br/>For Tea, Bread &amp; Butter, &amp; weak greasy looking tea &amp; some raisins. After Tea went to Y.M.C.A. Hut, where a very good Concert was given by a party of Ladies. It is still raining heavily &amp; shows no sign of easing.</p>
