  
 France 26 Oct 16 My dearest Irene, It was so lovely to get several letters from you lately & I have been unable to answer them & we have been so much on the move. Expect you will hear of something, very by soon & I will cable as soon as it is over. Did I thank you dear for your great kindness in sending me  15 per Nancy Norris. It was awfully good of you & I am keeping  7 in gold in case of giving away. Hope you will like my Xmas present dear which I sent with my very best love & wishes & may the new year be Brighter.
