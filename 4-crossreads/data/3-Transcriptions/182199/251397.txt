<p>we had was employed in digging and the order of the day was dig, dig, dig. There were 9 officers in my&nbsp;trench at the start and at the end there was only myself left to control about 80-100 yards of trench. On Thursday at midday I was relieved and returned to the beach. The rest of the battalion were relieved the previous night. It was great getting down to comparative safety and quiet. On the way down I passed the First Field Ambulance so I dropped in and stayed to lunch with Kay, Wassell, Welch (St Vincent) all of whom Ken will remember &amp; [ ] [ ].&nbsp; &nbsp;I had tea bovril &amp; bacon, the first hot meal I had tasted since leaving the ship and I don&#39;t think I have ever enjoyed anything so much as that lavish meal. When I got back to the battalion it was the first time we were able to make a reckoning and it was a sad task. Burns our adjutant, whom you have heard me speak of, was shot dead at my side on Sunday afternoon. We were observing together at the time. Wilson was seriously wounded almost in the same place - also MacFarlane and Goldring.</p>
