They'll sweat and toil and curse the while
They'll booze and riot, but fight like Gods
And starve and freeze and burn, but smile
Cut out the wowsing! Whats the odds
War's not a feed of milk and buns!
Its Hell let loose! and devils work!
So cheer the "bad boys" at the guns
But shut the mouths of saints who shirk.
