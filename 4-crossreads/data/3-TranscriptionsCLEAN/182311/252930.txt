 Dear Peters, 
   
    I send you my heartiest congratulations on the award to you of a  Bar to the Military Cross  in recognition of your very good and gallant service in our operations near Bony on 29th September last.   X  With great dash and determination, you led your company across ground swept by intense artillery and machine gun fire, and "mopped-up" two enemy trenches. 
   
    Later, another company was added to your command, and you succeeded in establlishing yourself on the final objective.  Through ^  out  you displayed very high qualities of leadership, and by your marked courage and devotion to duty set a splendid example to your men.  X  
   
    With kind regards and good wishes, 
   
       Yours sincerely, 
   
 (SIGNED)     W.R.BIRDWOOD. 
   
 P.S.   I much regret that it is only now I have received official notification of the Award, otherwise I should have written much earlier.
