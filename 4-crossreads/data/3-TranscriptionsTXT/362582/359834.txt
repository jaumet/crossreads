Many Happy Returns of the Day & I hope you get plenty of presents & I hope you get plenty of presents & heaps of Good-Luck & joy, also that I shall be home for your next. We are still fairly quiet & the weather is much improved, so our staff is feeling much happier. We are still in the same position & think shall remain so for some time. Things are to be very, very busy here in a few days. Hope it will be the last for our Boys. Somehow I don't think I shall be allowed to stay here much longer, so many others want to get here & I've done 6 months. I shall be awfully sorry to leave here. We are getting very comfortable
