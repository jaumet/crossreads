Nov 20th - Monday
Usual reaction & feel properly done up & stick to bed till late, keep quiet all the morning. Visit of the Duke & Duchess of Connaught & Princess Patricia, which we all agree is a blessed nuisance. Don't visit our ward; so we have a look at them. Still raining & miserably cold.
Nov 21st - Tuesday
Rain cleared off, but still cold. Heavy "London fog" descends & even here it is thick. Lights & heat off at 7 pm as a result we are in bed early. Freezing cold all night.
