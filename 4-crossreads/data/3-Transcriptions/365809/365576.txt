<p>Dear Judge,<br/>This is just a line to let you know I received your letter of 20th July O.K. and I am sorry I have been so long answering it. Call it pressure of work strafing Fritz. Your gift of chocolate turned up last mail and it couldn't possibly have turned up at a more opportune time. We were cold and wet and miserable but for this feeling</p>
