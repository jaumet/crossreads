<p><u>29th Wednesday 1916 ARNUSSI Wed </u></p>
<p>Having a rest today clipping horses, Butler was sent into Mazar to fetch back 2 bags of telephone wire and as usual he did the wrong thing and brought back two <u>COILS</u> ! instead of the two bags. Extra duty on the telephone for that.</p>
<p>30th Nov 1916 ARNUSSI &ndash; Thursday. &ndash;<br/>Nothing to report-</p>
<p><u>1st December</u> 1916 ARNUSSI &#126; Friday &#126;<br/>This proposed shift of ours seems to be long deferred for some reason or other For my part I am not "bursting" to go. All our horses are being clipped and shod probably that's the delay. Very cloudy today yesterday afternoon a Taube came over and hung around Mazar about 4 miles back and it seemed as if he dropped bombs. However our anti-aircraft guns opened up on him and there hundreds of puffs of smoke in the sky where the shrapnel was bursting around him. Some went dangerously near. It is a very difficult matter to shoot with any degree of accuracy at these "birds". They twist and dive "every which way" as Mark Twain said.<br/>There is no doubt "Tempers does Fugit" here we are in the last month of 1916 and the war still goes on with undoubted rigour. It seems as if it will never end.<br/>It was a grand sight yesterday afternoon to see our planes chase the Taube just like a lot of eagles after one but the Taube had got too</p>
