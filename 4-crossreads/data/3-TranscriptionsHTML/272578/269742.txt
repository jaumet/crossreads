<p>17th January 1917. Early morning stables. Got ready for moving off to firing line. Left at 12 and arrived at Armentieres at 6 oclock. Went right up to the gun pits, which are situated on the outskirts of the town. Stacked the shells from the wagons in the house behind the pits. The guns were put into the pits. The Tommies pulled out. The wagons &amp; spare gunners made way back to the wagon line about 5 miles from the guns and a rotten place it is too. Got back late &amp; slept in some sort of a hut. This was my entry into the firing line, rather an <u>inglorious entry. Quite a coincidence to note that it was twelve months today since I went into camp.</u></p>
<p>18th January 1917. Got up at 8. Spent a very uninteresting day in the mud &amp; slush about this camp. Still snowing heavy. This makes 3 days continuous. Yesterday was very cold &amp; today not much better. Wont I be glad when I am out of this rotten country. Rations very short and I got a hunger up today. Went down to a wayside shop tonight &amp; had some  eggs &amp; coffee.</p>
