<p>Sing me to sleep where the bullets fall<br/>Let me forget the War and all<br/>Damp is my dug out &amp; Cold is my feet<br/>Nothing but biscuits &amp; bully to eat<br/>Sing me to sleep where the bombs explode<br/>And Shrapnel bursts are A La Mode.<br/>Over the sandbags helmets you find<br/>Corpses in front of you corpses behind</p>
<p>Refrain<br/>Far Far from Turkey I long to be<br/>Where Turkish Snipers cant pot at me<br/>Think of me crouching where the worms creep<br/>Waiting for someone to sing me to sleep</p>
<p>Sing me to sleep in some old shed<br/>Where the fleas are jumping around my head<br/>Stretched out upon my water proof<br/>Dodging the rain drops through the roof<br/>Sing me to sleep where the camp fires gleam<br/>Full of stale bread and "Cafe a L'eau<br/><strike>Somebodies</strike>  Dreaming of home &amp; nights in the West<br/>Somebodies hob nail boots on my chest</p>
<p>Refrain<br/>Far from Gallipoli I long to be<br/>Sights of old Sydney I'd rather see<br/>Think of me crouching where the worms creep<br/>Waiting for someone to Sing me to sleep<br/>V E</p>
