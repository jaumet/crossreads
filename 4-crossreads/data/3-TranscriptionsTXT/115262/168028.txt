 Tuesday 18 September 1917. 
 On despatch messenger once again and today a deal of fooling around&nbsp;business. (Mismanagement again.) A busy day &amp; late into evening also. 
 The dust today is terriffic, the worst day in this respect since arriving in Egypt. 
 At 8.30 when I took latest despatches to Brigade Hd Qrs the searchlignts of ours (Allies) could be plainly seen sweeping everywhere. 
 3 rd  &amp; 4 th  Brigades moved out to the other side of Tel-el-Farah on the Waddy. Gazzeh. &nbsp;Moving all day. 
 Geo. Kelley called on the way out with 12 th  Regt. 4 th &nbsp;Brigade. I was out again on duty and missed him.
