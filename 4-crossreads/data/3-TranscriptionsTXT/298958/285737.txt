Half an hour after this  the Sydney ceased firing and to our great indignation she turned round and steamed full speed away,  an unworthy act for a victor to do,  as we all expected help for our wounded some of which urgently required amputation of legs and arms,  and many had their limbs hanging down smashed and connected by sinews with their bodies,  which was covered with blood and dirt.
Nearly all articles used for bandages were destroyed and we had to use our shirts to dress our wounds. Some cut their mangled limbs fully off with a knife and dressed the stumps with rags torn from their underwear. Not even fresh water was available as all our water tanks were smashed also the destillating engine.
Parched with thirst we drank our  own wash water left in the tubs from in the morning.It was a pityfull sight and no help from anywhere. Here and there scraps of human flesh were strewn all over the deck.
