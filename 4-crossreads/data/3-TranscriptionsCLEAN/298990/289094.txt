Returned to billets about 11a.m. and had the rest of the day off.  An inspection like this has a great smartening up effect and I noticed that the saluting in the street is excellent and cannot be bettered.  Pedler came over for lunch and we had fierce arguments over duration of the war etc.  Later the M.O. and self went down to a football match between our lads and the 2 Brd.  The latter won.  The days are exceedingly short and it was quite dark at 4pm.  Yesterday we passed a funeral procession - tiny boy acolytes in little surplices and a French soldier in his kepi wearing a stole.  Followed a rude cart with deal coffin and a number of French soldiers in horizon blue.  Today saw the village Cure wearing a black cloak and a biretta.  Held orderly Room at 5 pm but have had very few offences lately and no drunkenness at all.  This village as usual is situated right down in a hollow and you are on top of it without being aware of the fact.  Issued orders for move of the transport in the morning to our new area.  We follow by train the day after tomorrow.  Phonographs out in the billets and some gift books add to mens' pleasure.  Judged "D" Co to pick the cleanest platoon and chose No. [indecipherable].  They get all leave to Amiens tomorrow - a boon much appreciated.
