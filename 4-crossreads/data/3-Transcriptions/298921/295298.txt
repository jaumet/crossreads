<p>1916 December 5<br/>Sunday<br/>A cold bleak day &amp; service in the lea of a Hill, with bullets &amp; shells whistling over, but we are quite safe in our position &amp; the men sing as tho' they meant it especially God Save the King  -<br/>A motley crew unshaved in mufflers &amp; blackened from the smoke of their fires (cook) so different to the KIWI polished L.H. of Egypt &ndash; one of the men who used to be working on Mulberry gang gave me a Hay Grazier today<br/>Just warned [indecipherable] of Court Martial for tomorrow. No Mail has reached the Peninsular for 3 weeks we get Wireless news of the outside world.</p>
