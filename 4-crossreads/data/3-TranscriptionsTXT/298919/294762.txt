 Went ashore after dinner to make some purchases.  Accompanied Purser to Transport Office where he was informed we would be going back to Australia in a few days time.  Good-bye hopes of ever seeing England!  Coming out in boat we had some ticklish navigation to perform to dodge the host of sailing craft, motor boats etc that were out to bid farewell to two transport loads of Italian reservists who were leaving for Italy.  We managed it however without any accidents.  The transports, as they steamed down the bay, flew the British Ensign from their mainmast French from the foremast and Russian from the mizzen-mast.  Great enthusiasm was displayed aboard the t.s and the sailing boats that accompanied them down the bay.
