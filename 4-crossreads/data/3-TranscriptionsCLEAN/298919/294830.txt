  
 paper states that the steamer Firth was torpedoed & sunk off this place yesterday afternoon & four of the crew died.  Paced deck from 8pm to 9.  Tuesday 26th[27th] July 1915.   Passed very restless night, subs on the brain I think. 2 oclock almost came as a relief.  Weather rather chilly, warm clothes essential.  This the North Sea through which we are now travelling is perfectly calm, & not, as I imagined it would be, turbulent.  At 7am we were abeam of Flamborough Head, when a slight fog seemed to raise itself.  Several fishing boats can be seen anchored, the occupants engaged in fishing.  Ever since leaving port we have passed fleets of trawlers to or from the fishing grounds.  At 7.30 off Faley we passed a fleet of Admiralty trawlers travelling south on patrol work.
