very hot & took my coat off, & carried on I was getting on fine when one of the men in charge of the floor came across & told me I had to put my coat on it appears it is against the rules to take your coat off & I knew nothing about it however it made no difference I shoved it on & continued skating, there are plenty of girls down here & we had a fine time with them
I'll bet their arms are stiff this morning with dragging me round & holding me off the floor where I used to have violent struggles trying not to sit on its greasy surface, a fellow feels as helpless as a kid once he's pushed out on to the floor & he gets carried wherever his skates care to run, that is except when he isn't throwing his legs in the air like a bucking horse & coming down with a thud & a silly grin on his face.
