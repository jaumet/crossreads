17/9/17 Westhoeke Ridge Ypres
hung like a curtain and as they started to creep started to touch him up and he sent up his S.O.S. The retaliation was partly on our front line and partly on the supports. Greig was killed by a shell burst. The shell came through the parapet and burst back on him. At 9a.m. our casualties were for about 12 hours 1 off killed, 2 OR killed, 30 OR wounded. A few direct hits on this pillbox. Dreadfully foul smelling place. Opened all curtains got a draft through the structure. A little party took the poor bodies of Greig, the R.S.C. officer and a private soldier and buried them in a shell torn waste beyond Bellevarde ridge. The shelling continued more or less active during the morning. This pill box on further inspection proves to be a very substantial place and quite extensive. Solid concrete and iron rails. There is an O.P. on top of the dugout. War is getting too much for flesh blood ?how can one stand up to a barrage of steel. Poor soft bleeding limbs torn and shattered
