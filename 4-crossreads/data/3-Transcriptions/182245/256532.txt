<p>JANUARY 1917</p>
<p>17 WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Had a heavy fall of snow last night</p>
<p>&amp; this morning it was four or five</p>
<p>inches deep. Snowed lightly all</p>
<p>day. Bill Constable &amp; self went</p>
<p>up to Armentieres with a G.S</p>
<p>waggon load of stuff for H.Q.</p>
<p>We left Strazeele at 1 AM &amp; got</p>
<p>to Armenti&egrave;res at 6pm. We got</p>
<p>good stables for horses &amp; billets</p>
<p>for ourselves. It would be a very</p>
<p>pretty drive in summer with</p>
<p>all the trees in leaf. Things</p>
<p>were very quiet last night with</p>
<p>the artillary but the machine</p>
<p>guns were at it all night. We</p>
<p>were within a mile of the front line</p>
<p>trenches. It was a very interesting</p>
<p>ride, seeing all the country &amp; the</p>
<p>old customs.</p>
