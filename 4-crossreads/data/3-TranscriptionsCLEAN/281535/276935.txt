  
 27/4/19 Wiesbaden the pretty gardens of the Nerotal to the Neroberg. Climbed once more to the top of the tower and was rewarded by a truly magnificent view of all the Rhine basin round here. The Taunus mountains of adjacent slopes are heavily wooded and the cleared spaces are a vivid emerald green. One can see as far as Bingen, can look down on Mayence and Wiesbaden and can look back as far as the Vosges. Came back to hotel and at 5 pm went to a magnificent representation of "Lohengrin". Had an interesting talk to the German in the same box as me. The Opera was wonderful. My French Lieut friend turns out to be Comte Hentri de Boisgelin of 5 Rue Masseran Paris and 86 [indecipherable]. Had dinner at the Cercle with the Count and a few others - a happy little party.
