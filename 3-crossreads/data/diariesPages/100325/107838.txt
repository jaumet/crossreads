Back to camp. Passed over desert through mess sheds. As soon as we were discerned by the men they gave three rousing cheers and continued for some time. Quite an ovation! Got company commanders and had pay issued within a quarter of an hour. Great excitement and many "furpheys". All tents ordered to be struck at 6 am tomorrow morning and returned to Ordnance. Have to see Brigadier at 6.30 pm tonight for further orders. A typical Egyptian day, very hot and enervating during the noonday till about 6
