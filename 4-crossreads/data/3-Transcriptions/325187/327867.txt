Hope to see Nowel tomorrow<br/>This Court Martial has been a complete change to the Desert &amp; Patrols &amp; a treat to get away from the Dust &amp; Flies-<br/>There is no use any lady coming to the front unless in really good health, they only go sick and then it takes 2 sound men to look after them<br/><strike>I am glad Harry [indecipherable] has gone back he was quite [indecipherable].</strike></p>
