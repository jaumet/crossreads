  
 6 Oct, 1916 Bally Bunion I went down by the 5.30 train from here to Ballah.  A little oil engine is what they use on the road.  The Gippoes are making a splendid road along side the Railway line.  its funny to see them, about a dozen in a row accross the road each with a stamper, they sing a song & keep a slow beat on with their stampers to the swing of the tune - I got to Ballah in time to be invited to "dinner" with the A.S.C. boys whom I knew at Anzac, they dished up roast beef & mashed spuds & some jam tart to top up with.  This morning it was some bustle with the rations & I had to pull their officer out of bed before I could get properly fixed up with fodder & I caught the six thirty train by the skin of my teeth.
