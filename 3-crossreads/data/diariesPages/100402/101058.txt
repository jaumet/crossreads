Wednesday 17 April
Fritz is shelling heavily all round this morning we have now learnt that he attacked heavily but was beaten back. We are now up the line, plenty of work but things have quietened down again. "We are living in a farm" which has been left by the owners with all their property in kind chattels all over the place we have prospects of living on pork, fowl, etc. Our front is somewhere about Merris, Ballieul, Meteren is covered with roaming stock, cows, goats, etc. It makes one heart bleed to walk through the deserted rooms of this house where everything is topsy turvy, see little articles of feminine fancy tossed in all directions, visiting cards, etc. I thank God that Australia is where it is.
Thursday 18 April
Things to-day have been very quiet indeed we have been at the R.A.P. since 2.30 a.m. have had no case. Meteren, or the vicinity is on fire the shelling on the left, French front, has been heavy. I cannot get any definite information as to who holds Meteren. The French 75's are very busy just now. Ninety per cent of the Boche's artillery is small 4.2 77's. Two prisoners last night, one officer a corporal. No news from any other part of the front. Living well.
Heavy winds to-day.
