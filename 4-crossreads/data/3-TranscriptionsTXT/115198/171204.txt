Nursing was quiet in Vancouver, but after doing the rounds of the Drs. we eventually got busy. It was harder work than on the Islands as we had more help from the natives.Vancouver, I think, is the nicest place in which to live in Canada.The Marine Drive is well planned with beautiful spots all the way.Victoria Island is most pleasing and a special place to retire.In 19 14 when war was declared I decided to join up. I called on the Recruiting Officer for Nurses (Major Hart) if I remember correctly - who said I was an alien and their own nurses would be taken first. I immediately contacted Drs. and any influencial friends I knew to wire Ottawa on my behalf. It was on 18th January, 19 15 I was called up to join reinforcements for the first contingent of nurses. On 21st Jan. we 3 other nurses, I left for Ottawa. We passed through the Rockies -wonderful scenery, I had never seen anything like it. We got out at several stops along the way but it was too cold. Through Calgary with the scenery changing with the beginning of the Prairies and the immensity of the land was almost unbelieveable. On arrival at Winnipeg at 7. 30 a.m. it was 32&deg; below zero. It was there I got my first chilblains, which were to plague me all through the war. Near Kenora we passed through some beautiful country, dotted with hundreds of little lakes.On 26th February we finally arrived at Ottawa. Following our inoculations we were taken to the Chateau Laurier were we stayed whilst in that beautiful city. Saw a lots of sports there that I had never dreamed of. It was there I met Col. S. Hughes and he asked who the Australian was who was so determined to go to War. I stepped forward and he said enough wires had been sent to send a regiment much less a small nursing sister. There was much laughter.February 4th we went along to the opening of Parliament -it was all very interesting.Left Ottawa at 11 p.m. and arrived in Montreal and travelled around the city in a sleigh, was interested in everything as it was all so different to life in Australia. Arrived in Halifax on 8th and sailed on the S. S. Zeeland for Liverpool. Enjoyed our trip and lots of boat drill. After leasing Liverpool we travelled through a very peaceful country with no apparent signs of war. Nice green fields - all so clean &amp; tidy. Eventually we arrived at Euston Station. We booked in at Thackeray Hotel.
