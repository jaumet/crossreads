Fatigue duties during the day.
Work hard while it lasts but not regular at present & but not regularly at present from what information I have gained it seems that when a charge is on from Shell Green the track goes down a very steep gully, up a mound in the gully, down & up to the opposite ridge.  Thence it runs through a sap in front of a gun (4.7) & down an incline to the 2nd L.H. I. & [indecipherable] where we leave the patients.
Total distance nearly a mile.
Own Art.have the track
