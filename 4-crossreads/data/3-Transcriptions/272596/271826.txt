<p>a gang of men,  another plan I fancy sometimes is of getting a job for a year with some successful farmer in the district I decide to settle in &amp; keep my eyes open &amp; learn the methods &amp; at the same time look out for my land.  I don't want to rush in blindly &amp; grab anything,  I have made up my mind to waste no time holidaying a couple of weeks in Tasmania &amp; a week in N.S.W. will satisfy me</p>
<p>I am going to combine pleasure with business as much as possible &amp; all I ask is for my discharge from the Army &amp; let me get to work, if ever any one is sick of this loafing about it is me, I am itching to get to work once more</p>
<p>God only knows how fed up I am with the Army, it would break my heart to be compelled</p>
