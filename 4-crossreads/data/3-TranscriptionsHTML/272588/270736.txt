<p>Thursday 11 July<br/>To-day some of the 1st Battn. found Fritz asleep &amp; went out and collected eighty of them &amp; brought them in with only one casualty.  They say it was done so quietly that the Germans in the rear are ignorant of the event, 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Friday 12 July<br/>Wet and windy all day.  Ye Gods the 1st &amp; 4th Battns. are taking Bosches galore &amp; the total is not about 150 and our casualties are very slight.  In fact there is very little fighting over the matter at all.</p>
