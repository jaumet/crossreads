Thousands of donkeys are for hire in the streets; the animals bodies are shaved by the natives in such a way as to leave fancy designs on the legs &amp; snout which gives the donkeys a peculiar appearance.</p>

Their homes are of mud bricks, &amp; donkeys, dogs &amp; fowls seem contented living in the same rooms as their master &amp; his family.</p>
