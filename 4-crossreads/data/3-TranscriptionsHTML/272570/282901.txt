<p>Hamelet &amp; Corbie, &amp; at La Neuville got a lorry to Daours. It stopped there, &amp; after a while I got one to Rivery &amp; arrived about 9 p.m. I turned in at 10.30. feeling none too like a big stunt, as I vomited what I had for tea again.<br/>7 Aug.<br/>Five of us set off on our long trip up to Bn. this morning. We got separated, the traffic on the road is simply enormous, lorries in thousands, &amp; it is going to be a tremendous stunt. We got a lift up the road as far as an  ambulance car was going &amp; walking along blowed if I didn't strike Cobcroft sitting by the wayside. He is a Lieutenant in the 1st Bn. &ndash; the 1st Division has just come down south after a long stay on the northern French front. He was asking after Boo. Finally, after various terms of walking, a ride on a different transport, I arrived a Vaire where the B'n are. All issues, rations, bombs, etc. are being completed in preparation for the great stunt to be launched tomorrow.   A letter from General Monash was read, saying it was the first time the whole of the 5 Australian Divisions have gone into battle together, &amp; the biggest thing they have yet been in. A Canadian Corps will be on one flank of us &amp; 2 English Divisions on the other, &amp; tanks, aeroplanes &amp; artillery will be in a colossal scale. Lt. Parsonage explained the part our platoons of D Coy have to take. Oh well, one can only trust in Providence. Our Vaire Wood &amp; Hamel stunt on 4th July will be a baby to this. The weather is fine today, it's hard to realise it's the eve of a very big battle. I got my gear ready at 8 p.m., then read Boo's letter &amp; the "Daily Mail". Early in the morning, hell will be let loose. Had a lie down in my clothes at 9 p.m., &amp; had a snooze till 1 a.m., when we had breakfast.<br/>Thursday 8 Aug.<br/>At 2 a.m. we</p>
