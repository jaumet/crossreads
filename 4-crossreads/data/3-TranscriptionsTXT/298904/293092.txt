 How it makes you sick of work And its pity help the Turk. Who bumps you in the next fierce bayonet fight. 
 The smiling faces meet you And hearty laughter greet you When all discuss the news of their home town How it makes a man feel small If he's cared for not at all And no one cares a rap if he goes down, 
 So show him you really care And when you have time to spare Just drop a line to him who bears the brunt, Its not a great deal to ask And will ease his heavy task, Theres someone waits your letter at the front
