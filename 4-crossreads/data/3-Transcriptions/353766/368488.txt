This is Chatham Island.<br/>Dec 5 We search the group &amp; round Albemarle is. and then N &amp;  NE for Perlas Is. (Dec 6) "Aid" to go on to Panama to pick up stores if possible.<br/>G.Q's every day with range firing exercises on Jap ships. On &amp;  on we go.<br/>Dec 8 Monotony broken by light on starboard bow. Newcastle sent off in chase. Turned out to be the Trafalgar, New York &ndash; Melbourne. Home again! No chance for poor me. Excitement not over yet. Curious shapes attract our attention. Everybody swears "Ships". A porpoise making</p>
