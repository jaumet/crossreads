Saturday 4th Sept. 1915

Later intelligence re "Southland" is that when torpedoed the men took to the boats. They afterwards retook to the steamer wh was able to steam to Mudros. The Brigadier died from exposure & the casualties totalled only 19.

I am now surrounded with Generals, Colonels, Majors and all the elite of Military officialdom.

Gens. Chauvel, Russell, & Godley met last night & had a exchanged confidences. The breezy chatter of these gentlemen reached my ears frequently & Gen. Chauvel was not loth to borrow matches from me for wh he thanked me with abundant courtesy.

I caught the following excerpt from a little breezy humour exchanged between Gen. Chauvel & a few other of his contemporaries.

Gen. Chauvel: Have you got any matches.

Russ: No (turning to me) Rhodes just give the Gen. some matches will you.

Ed Essen – How are you getting on for feed Gen. – oh – so & so – I could relish some juicy roast beef & green peas.

Chorus: Ha Ha Ha

Dodd – What has happened to all our correspondence & "billet doux" lately.

Russell – I am afraid mine have perished on the high seas.

The Major: I received several petit brochures today.
The Major: Received several parcels today, no
