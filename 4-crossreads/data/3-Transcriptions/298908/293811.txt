<p>Got a small batch of Aussie mail this morning which was very welcome.<br/>Got mixed up in a slight accident this morning, a few of us were fooling about with a German flare, we thought we had taken all the explosives out &amp; Munch threw it in the fire around which we were sitting yarning.  No one thought any more about it when all of a sudden there was a bang &amp; a flash of blazing colors flying all round.  Some of the fragments lobbed on my puttees &amp; before I knew any more had burnt holes through &amp; through, so that means 10/- for another pair this afternoon.</p>
<p>24th.  All our Camp went for a short route march this morning.  We dodged round a few of the old Devonshire lanes with their high hedges on both sides &amp; blackberries hanging dead ripe everywhere.  Went down to Devonport in the evening &amp; had another good bath then went out &amp; met my fair companion.  We had a stroll round the town &amp; then</p>
