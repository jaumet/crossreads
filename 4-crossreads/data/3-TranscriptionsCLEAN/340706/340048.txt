I return to city & then out on other side opposite Petit Quevilly & above Croisset on slopes of Mt Bidoret where there is a monastery with beautifully wooded grounds even thicker & more natural than the forest. I remain here for some time with a glorious panorama of Rouen at my feet & in no hurry to move.
Finally I start my now weary legs in motion & start downhill for the tram covered
