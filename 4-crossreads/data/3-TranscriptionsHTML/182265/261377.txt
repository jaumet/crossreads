<p><u>7 Oct </u>- A cold miserable rainy day - raining all day long. A tremendous bombardment is going on up North. Everywhere everyone is soaking wet, but still we carry on while skunks at home stab us in the back by &quot;striking&quot; against their Government while we are over here. I can understand people striking against private employers or against a<s>n</s> Governemnt that does not represent the Majority, but against a Government where we have universal suffrage &amp; at this time! I am sure they cannot possibly appreciate the position. I have been censoring men&#39;s letters, most of them unionists, and they unanimously express disgust against those at home striking against the Government.</p>
<p>Read &quot;The New Magazine&quot;. Heavy bombing took place several times during last night, several bombs striking fairly close to us. Three of my men have Dysentery.</p>
