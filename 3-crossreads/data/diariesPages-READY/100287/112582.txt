Sat up to about 11 oclock as usual playing "bridge" last night, we have played this game constantly ever since leaving England it never seems to grow stale it has helped us in a wonderful way to break the monotony of the voyage, cards when properly used are a regular godsend to kill time, nearly every table on the deck has its little crowd who always play together, some play bridge others crib, whist, 500
