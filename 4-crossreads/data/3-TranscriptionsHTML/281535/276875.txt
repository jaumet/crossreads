<p>Marcinelle<br/>11/3/19<br/>Up at 7 a.m. and had breakfast with Harold Smith, Howell and G. Hughes. Then met M. Peters and he took us down to the mine at Marcinelle Nord near which there is an ancient Roman tumulus. At the bureaux of the mine we were presented to the chief Engineer who agreed to take us down. Went into cubicles and changed all clothes dressing in ones supplied by them. Rough shirts dungarees and neckerchief. To crown all a smart skull cap and a leather helmet not unlike our steel helmets in shape. Then drew miners safety lamps and went to the pithead. Here girls in breeches were slaving pulling trucks out of the cages and running them along tracks. For 10 hours daily (or 12) they work thus and get a wage of 3/10. Crouched</p>
