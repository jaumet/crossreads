B.SquadronSept 1st 191[indecipherable]Darling Mum,I hope you got my letter card safely. Say aint this swagger paper - what? - a part of our camp. We have moved into 2 different tents since I wrote last & we are settled again now. We are nearly full strength now - that is the whole Light Horse. We have been issued with our rifles & bayonets water bottles & bandoliers & I dont know when we'll be issued with uniforms. Some fresh horses came in to camp to night
