<p>Dear Miss Clark</p>
<p>Miss Warner has written to me telling me of your kindness to her during the week end which she spent at your home, and she said that you would like a letter from me about what I am doing.  Well here goes for a few lines.  At present I am in charge till Tuesday next of the catarrhal Camp here.  I have only 10 men in at present and the job is fairly easy, but all the same I will be glad when I get back to my section.  I have to take these 10 men for Medicine at 9 a.m., 2 p.m. or 4.5 p.m. &amp; 7.30 p.m.  They all have sore throats, but are a decent lot.  Last Monday &amp; Tuesday week we were at the Range doing Musketry.  On the Monday I did not do well at all, but on the Tuesday I did very well and when I shoot for the qualifying Exam I hope to get my Marksmen's Badge.  I can always do better at 3 &amp; 400 yds that at 200 yds.  Tomorrow 3 Pals &amp; I are going to Melbourne for the week end and we are invited to an evening and promised a good time.  Melbourne is not too bad</p>
