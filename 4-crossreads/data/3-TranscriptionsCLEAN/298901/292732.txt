  
 We scored 3 M.Ms  out of our Daours stunt one going to J Sturrock, a man who never had a chance until I took over the section, being in fact up before the O.C. twice, one to an 8th man who was helping us & one to a Motor Driver.  Sturrock well & truly deserved his for previous good work but the actual deed for which he & the 8th man got it for, was being in the operating theatre when a shell landed outside, it was the one which nearly got me.  All they did was to carry the stretcher away to a neighbouring cellar whilst I held the door open for them to go out, so, that decidedly their luck was in.  Methinks that the M.S.M. supposed to be coming to me was deemed my reward for which I am glad as I would hardly be satisfied to get an M.M. for such a trifle.  However my section is very bucked up over it & I, for one, would not have it otherwise.  There is more than a suspicion abroad that the two officers who were present at the same time, were making sure of M.Cs
