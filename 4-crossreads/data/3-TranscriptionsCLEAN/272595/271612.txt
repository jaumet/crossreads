  
 never left off yelling the whole trip, we had to change at E. Croydon & again at Brighton but this infernal woman stuck to us like glue, & I only lost her when I changed for the last time at Ford, trains over here run anyhow nowadays & its pretty rotten travelling,  I arrived at Littlehampton towards evening & made straight round to Mr Dukes, we then had tea & he & I & Mrs Elliott went for a stroll round the promenade it was a glorious evening & the place was crowded, there were hundreds of Yanks taking the air, they all come from the great aerodromes which they are putting up down here, by this time I was beginning to feel pretty rotten, & when we got home I was jolly glad, we stopped up fairly late yarning & when I eventually climbed into bed I was done to the world.
