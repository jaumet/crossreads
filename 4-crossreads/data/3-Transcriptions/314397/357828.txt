<p>think. Would be doing the French a good turn, 'cos then they might be able to make a decent town of the place. As it is now, it is only a filthy hovel.</p>
<p>Thursday 3.10.18.<br/>Same old routine. 8am Brekker &amp; then wait till 9.30 for roll call &amp; then down here to the club. Read, have a shave &amp; then at 11am have a cup of Coffee. Wait here till 12.30 when we go back for lunch. Its a pity to go back too 'cos the meals are very poor. After lunch we come back here to the club. Do nothing till 4pm when we have tea &amp; then carry on doing nothing till 6.05 when we go back for dinner. After dinner we go for a stroll &amp; then go back to bed. Bill Cowper came along today. Brought a letter from the hospital. Went to the pictures &amp; they were rotten.</p>
<p>Friday. 4.10.18<br/>Club all the morning. Went to Paris Plage in the afternoon &amp; we all had a game of tennis. Im very poor at it now tho. Nothing startling in the evening.</p>
