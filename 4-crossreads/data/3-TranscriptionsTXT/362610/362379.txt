Monday 12 June 1916A wintry day with no sunshine & drizzling rain most of the time. No early morning parade but at 1/4 to 9 the exams in the ground covered during the school were commenced. Nothing very difficult in them & got a "Very Good". The squads of men were not completed until nearly 3 o'clock when we fell in & moved off to the firing line near Fleurbaix. It was drizzling as we marched out & the slush & mud on the cobble-stone roads made marching heavy & difficult. Met Capt. W. Hindmarsh (Vet. Sci.) en route. At Fleurbaix picked up a guide from Bge. H.Q. & was taken thro' the shell zone to the start of the communication trench, & here again the walking on the slippery wet duckboards was very heavy & difficult. At one spot we were stopped by an artillery observer because the enemy were shelling the commun'n. trench further along. It was abt. a mile over the duckboards & then we suddenly came upon the front-line breastworks arriving abt. 6.30. After tea went out into Noman's Land for a little way, but awfully wet & muddy. Raiding party meant a bombardment & standing to. Received Aust. mail.
