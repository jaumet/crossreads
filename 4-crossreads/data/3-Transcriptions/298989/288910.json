<p>19/12/15<br/>As the valley and the rear of our position were absolutely deserted and all the usual throng and bustle there at ordinary times was absent, we were especially anxious to avoid aeroplanes of the enemy and our planes in consequence kept aloft all day. It was rumoured that a German submarine was about. The enemy had no idea of our intention to evacuate I am sure and being prevented from aerial reconnoitring by our planes, they thought rather by the activity of shipping and so on that we were bringing in troops and preparing to attack!. That we were clearing out never struck them apparently.</p>
<p>During this afternoon a terrific bombardment of Achi Baba took place and continued till next day. The hill was white with shell bursts and the continuous rattle of a heavy rifle fire told of a battle down there. We heard later that some Turkish trenches were captured. We held our line with about 450 men all day. At 2300 about 140 left and all the rest except 60 men left at 0100.</p>
<p>20/12/15<br/>From that time on we held the line with 60 men only against heavily reinforced enemy stated by our intelligence to be 2200 strong.</p>
