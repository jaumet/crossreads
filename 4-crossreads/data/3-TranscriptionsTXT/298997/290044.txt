understand not receiving an answer to my application. Any amount of men would rather be with the Salvage Corp. than the battalion, but I feel the other way.  The Germans have been throwing big shells right back in Bailleul  L Clyste,, Poperinghe etc. and doing a lot of damage.  All night we hear the big shells singing overhead; and also the drone of the planes, ours & theres, laden with bombs.  We get a bomb or so ourselves, & some shells.  Our own artillery is getting stacks of ammunition ready; and the rumour is that there is to be a 36 hour barrage laid on to open a stunt.
One of the men from the Company was sent back to Corps Headquarters at Bailleul the other day, and a transfer that roused the envy of the rest of the Company, which is getting strained with living in these tents, subject to fire.  When that town was being shelled with the Huns long distance guns, he & four others got into a cellar.  The motor-driver of the Salvage Corp wanted to get in to, but was told there was no room.  Just as he had turned away an armour piercing shell broke right through into the cellar & killed all five men!
