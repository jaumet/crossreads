9/6/18
Moniff was badly gassed and wounded in the face. No one got to bed until dawn. I went up the line after lunch made for the right flank where our Newtons had blown Fritz's post about very much where our chaps raided last night. Soon they had to evacuate the place. Our chaps and the 28th had their rifles laid and ready on the parapet ready to pot any who ran out. The I.M. shooting was splendid and several landed right on the post. The M.W.s sent over in retaliation landed close enough. Walking along the trenches and intervals we struck a smell and crowds of large flies who evidently had a feast of sorts outside the parapet. Picked up a blood stained Hun cap and took it back to Bn H.Q. No Mans Land is pleasant beflowered ground. On the right where we propose railing are the artillery OPs.
