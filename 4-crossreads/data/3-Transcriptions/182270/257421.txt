<p>SATURDAY, APRIL 19, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Went over to see</p>
<p>Mum &amp; Dad in the morning.</p>
<p>Saw Sisters Lynam &amp; Fraser on</p>
<p>the way &amp; they gave me a lift</p>
<p>to Carnarvon. Mum &amp; I went</p>
<p>down &amp; saw Aunt Janie before</p>
<p>lunch. Aunt Millie &amp; [M<sup>r</sup> Sauter?]</p>
<p>came to Carnarvon for afternoon</p>
<p>tea. I came back here for dinner.</p>

<p>look out after.</p>
