<p>Dardenell's. Would have liked to have been at the landing. Must have been pretty lively. I don't think these boats will ever go through the canal again. Don't know what I am going at next may join one of the Australian transports as a couple of those went through this time. Dident I envy them their luck. Well Father dont feel too good tonight so won't write any more. Will be abel to give you full particulars when I come across will only be a few days after this arrives.<br/>All love &amp; best wishes<br/>From your<br/>Sincere Son<br/>Clyde</p>
