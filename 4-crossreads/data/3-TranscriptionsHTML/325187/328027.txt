<p>Matinee Laura<br/>Neill made me a member of the University Club London, very good of him.<br/>Laura came with news of Ralph Arnolds death- I'm sorry for Lorna.<br/>We go Matinee at the Empire this afternoon.<br/><u>Later</u> very enjoyable but I rather regret spending all this money now but everyone assures me I have married a rich woman (altho' I did not know it) the wee girl certainly dresses beautifully, you should see the Undies &amp; things &amp; has been very well educated.<br/>Love from Both to all</p>
