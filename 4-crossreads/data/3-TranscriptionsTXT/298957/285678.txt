 Parade 5 pm to 6 pm &ndash; Tea 6 pm. This is on account of the Hot weather. 
 16th May (Tuesday) This was a scorching hot day, worse than yesterday. In Cairo the temperature is 115&#176;. Here  it registers 130&#176; in the shade. I was on piquet and even the blue glasses I have been wearing to counteract the glare, are not sufficient to protect the eyesight. The piquet has been doubled so as to shorten the hours. The push for water at the taps is awful. Inspection of camp by A.D.M.S. &amp; D.D.M.S today and "A" section were specially complimented
