Thursday
Light rain this morning breaks up parade. Do nothing much all morning. Fatigue work in aft. Tony falls into creek. Joy unbounded. After tea write to Miss Barbara send postcard to Cis. Also wrote to Edie Watts.
Take our usual stroll round beach. Weather somewhat cold. Sergt. Barr reads us extracts from an officer at the Front to his people. Very fine literature full of human feeling. Barr a good reader.
