<p>looking &amp; feeling excellent &ndash; It is just like good old times together.<br/>The evening spent most pleasantly with Mr. &amp; Mrs Scales &amp; Anita &ndash; A hard parting from my "little friend".</p>
<p>May 15th<br/>With rather a heavy heart I take my farewell from Mr. &amp; Mrs Scales "Elm Bank" &ndash; One day perhaps I may be able to express the deep gratitude &amp; sacred affection due to my dear "English Mother" for her kindness &amp; maternal interest in my humble self &ndash;</p>
