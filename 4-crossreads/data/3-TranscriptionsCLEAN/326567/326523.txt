I am sorry to say that my companion the 1st A.M.C Officer had to go into Hospital on Wednesday Evening, he had been aching for 2 or 3 days & finally went & saw the Dr who pronounced his complaint as Trench Fever & ordered him at once into Hospital. & now I have to handle the A M C work on my own, I devote all my time to the work having been releived of the position of Sanitary Engineer temporarly until my Mate returns, which I hope will be soon.

The Bombardment still continues
