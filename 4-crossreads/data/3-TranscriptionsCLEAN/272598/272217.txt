  
 Tuesday 14.8.17 Left Camp by motor at 11 Am for Ebblinghem station where I caught the leave train at 1.25 pm, arrived Boulogne about 7.30 pm from where we marched to a camp to remain for the night prior to embarking for Folkstone.  All in good spirits at the thought of 10 days leave 
 Wednesday 15.8.17 Had a very poor night without a blanket; reveille blew at 3 Am & all hands were up preparing to get away.  Fell in at 6.15 Am to have our passes stamped & again at 7.30 Am to march to the pier at Boulogne.  Left pier at 10.15 Am & buzzed across to Folkstone where we arrived at about 11.45 Am.  Entrained at 12 noon & arrived
