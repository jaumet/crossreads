<p>there, and so being Australians we naturally traveled 2nd Class all the way down. 1st Class is reserved absolutely for officers. I have a greavance against that train though and one I&#39;ll never forget!! They did me out of a dinner!! You see there is a dining car on the train for the 1st Class passengers and 2nd Class is allowed in when the 1st have finished; but 3rd are not allowed in at all! We being in 2nd naturally went along, but were told that the 1st had not finished, <s>and</s>&nbsp;so we waited a<s>n</s> bit, but next time we went along everything was finished and packed away. We were wild! We got to Port Said near midnight and had a job to find a pub that was not full and when we did get in one, all we could get to eat, and that after much buckseech, was a piece of brown bread and a glass of beer. I made up for it next morning at breakfast though! We came over tot he hospital and were temporilally attached to the staff <s>and</s> with nothing to do, except keep the dentist&#39;s appointments and there is leave to Port Said for us daily from 10 AM to 10 PM, so its not too bad. There is the sea to swim in - good showers and plenty of tennis courts over at the rest camp Port Said, and a whole lot of chaps down from the Regt so things look very good. I was talking to Mrs Granville this morning. She is such a nice lady and knows the Trelawnys well; I told her I knew Capt Trelawny well and she said I should certainly go and call on his sister-in-law, who is staying in his house. So I think I&#39;ll go and do it this afternoon. Capt Trelawny wont be home for a week as he is away somewhere down the Red Sea. our Sig officer Mr Tomlins is down here and his sister is a nurse here, so there are tons of people I know</p>
