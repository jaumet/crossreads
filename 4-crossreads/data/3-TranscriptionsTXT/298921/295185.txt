August, 1915Monday 2We are more settled today but the ship is very dirty & we have 200 more men than room for.We change into destroyers & mine sweepers tomorrow night -Just washed a shirt so as to be clean. What men want training in in Australia is Rapid fire Musketry & Trench work.I was sorry to leave my horses but glad to get away from the Desert & into the firing line.
