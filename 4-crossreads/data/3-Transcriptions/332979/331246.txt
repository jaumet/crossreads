<p>20/2/17. Tuesday<br/>As we were having breakfast next morning we came into the Harbour &amp; tied up to the Wharf, although it is only a small harbour the way it is constructed it can accommodate a large number of boats, and it was fairly crowded with overseas Steamers. Parade was ordered for 11 am &amp; at 11-30 we were marched ashore &amp; up to the Town &amp; before we were dismissed we were told off in parties of six &amp; instructed to remain together all day which was not carried out. The Wharf Lies about 1&frac12; Miles from the Town proper. As soon as <strike>th</strike> we were dismissed we all strolled up the Main St. called (Adderley Street) which is fairly long but not wide. The Trains start from this Street</p>
