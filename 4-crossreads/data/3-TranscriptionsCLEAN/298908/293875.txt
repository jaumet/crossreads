  
 27th.  I had a rare bit of luck in one way last night I went down to "Moons" in Plymouth to book some seats for tomorrow nights Concert which is a grand affair the Orpheus Male Choir & Packmann the famous pianist are giving it in the Guildhall, well I just got there at the critical moment & the Manager was just going to close the door when I put my foot between the door & the wall.  The old chap looked at me & said, you are too late Sgt. we close exactly at 6 & you are too late.  This ought to have squashed me but no fear, so I said now look here I have been on duty all day long & this is the only opportunity I will have of getting down for you close at 1 tomorrow, (Wednesday) besides I may never have another chance of hearing this musician & I particularly want to see him.  He looked at me & saw I was in earnest so he said, well all right Sgt. I'll stretch a point & let you in but mind I don't make a practice of these things
