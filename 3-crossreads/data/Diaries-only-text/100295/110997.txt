by which light transport may be facilitated. The animals used are practically all mules, on account of their remarkable staying powers their being able to undergo great privation. The Major has devised many ingenious schemes for quickly loading unloading, whilst at the same time making the load comparatively flexible. I anticipate leaving Hazebrouck tomorrow for my new quarters at Steenvorde. I regret to some extent having to withdraw from our mess, at which interesting discussion always took place, more to the point, the meals are excellent and only cost us an additional 3 francs a day. We pool all our rations, the cook prepares the excellent dishes the insignificant expenditure covers vegetables miscellanies. At Steenvorde I intend that the cooking shall be done on the premises.
Great artillery activity this evening.
