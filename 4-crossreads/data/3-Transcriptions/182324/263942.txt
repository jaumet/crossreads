<p>of the &quot;brutes&quot; that rode at such a fearful pace. I often wonder what some of those old people would think if they could be suddenly brought back to, say, George St at 5.30<sup>pm</sup>. They would want to go back quickly. This &quot;rushing&quot; business applies to us all. I suppose you too have to fall into line, in fact I know you do, by our conversation over the phone.</p>
<p>Well I suppose there is no help for it but to &quot;Carry on&quot; &amp; do our best</p>
<p>I leave here on Sunday morn so will be in Sydney on Tuesday but I cannot see my way clear to make an appointment until I arrive as I do not know how long we shall be there before we go to Melbourne but I will certainly do my best even if its only to see you to shake hands with you &amp; we will look to a better opportunity in the near future of cementing our acquaintance better &amp; now again thanking you for the copy of the &quot;Yandoo&quot; with kindest regards</p>
<p>I remain<br />Yours Sincerely<br />RH Wynne</p>
