  
 1916 October counted as lost men.   I noticed the boys doing some deep thinking, and made a mental note that if "first wavers" were wanted, I would not be amongst them. 
 Our band had an early morning habit of playing tunes immediately after reveille, so as to keep everyone awake.   Their usual tune was "By the sea".   We stood it for some few days, hoping that they would learn another, but as they did not, we counted them out one bright morning.   By the next day they had learnt "Australia will be there".   Ted Merriman's wife came to see him one week end, accompanied by three or four young ladies.   We had a good time with them.  They stayed the week end at the hotel.   I was unfortunately on guard (for the first time) on the Saturday and so missed the pleasure of their company for one day.    This gave me a dislike to guard and ever after I tried to avoid, very often with success.  Mac Cameron
