<p>4 &ndash; much I shall tell you but can't write. I wonder if you have seen Col. Dick. I believe he arrives in Sydney today. I have not had letters from you for a month at least &ndash; and long for news. Lawrence has not written since &ndash; the day before I left Sydney 14 May. But I saw him in a group of Lieut training at no 2 officers school in Sydney. I wonder if we shall meet out here?<br/>I love your letters dearest Mother &amp; Father too. I shall write him a letter tomorrow night about money &ndash; devoted love to you both. I hope you are well. I know what a fearful strain this time is for you both &ndash; so far away from us here in the centre of danger. The girls &amp; Gibson &amp; myself &ndash; But think we'll come through alright &ndash; and then your worries at home. Oh Mother, I do wish I could help more. I'll soon be able to pay my debt to Dad however that'll be one relief.<br/>Your daughter Betha</p>
