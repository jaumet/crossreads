  
 Saturday 30th March 1917 [1918] 8.45 a.m. went Company's Office & Capt. Grant initialled my pay book for the sum of 1/3 to be stopped for the thermometer, what trash and red tape it all is.  After the khamsein of yesterday peace reigns today and the wind quite cool. Wrote Dr. Falkner yesterday and told him that something in the air of old Egypt or meeting these men in a different way has wakened me a little from my long coldness as regards the opposite sex & though did not tell him so, made me afraid for the first time.  1/2 day  Off duty 5 p.m., go town meet Frank & get negatives from Kodak, arrange for church 5.30 p.m. tomorrow. Feeling very "off" these last few days, no appetite & headache - T. 101.
