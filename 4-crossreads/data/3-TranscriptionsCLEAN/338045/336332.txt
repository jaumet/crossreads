1916night & again to-day.  Cold winds.  No parade at 6-30 a.m.  Walking about in mud & rain very unpleasant.  At 2 p.m. I take a party to the Quartermaster of about 50 men for equipment & this takes up all afternoon.  Rain clears off at night & turns freezingly cold.  After a brisk walk to canteen, bed at 8-30 p.m.  Expenses 1fr.  Very little news from the front.
Oct. 20th - FridayAlmost frozen last night (3 thin blankets).  A real corker.  Awake at 2 a.m. trying to get warm.  Parade 6-30 a.m. & a wash before breakfast, after which my hands are absolutely numb with cold for half an hour.  Toes are without feeling for hours.  Beautiful
