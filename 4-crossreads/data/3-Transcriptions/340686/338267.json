<p>Very windy and miserably cloudy day and rained a good deal. All work of all kinds seemed suspended but we went on as usual and nothing to denote Christmas Day. Went out at 12 and we are now apparently working on a new system. Our section did all the work on the dugouts &amp; Fritz shelled fairly close. Two old "Anzackers" each of about 5 weeks war service came out with us to see the war. Another bombing attack developed right on our front and machine gun fire &amp; rifle fire active apparently Fritz's raid. Guns silent but he put over a good deal of shrapnel. Dave in charge and went silly again and ordered us to do half an hours extra work</p>
