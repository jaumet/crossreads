<p>On thinking about the announcement that Ramsay Smith had been struck off the strength of the A I. E. Force, it occurred to me that it may mean nothing more than that he has ceased to be a member of the force and that he has returned to his civilian duties.

Yesterday afternoon I made an excursion into the dessert to find a botanical specimen for her, it was posted last night, with hopes that it is the correct thing. She expects to have her University degree before the end of the year, giving her the right to have B.Sc. placed after her name. She must have great capacity for learning, as the percentages gained in her class examinations, at the advanced subjects have been high.</p>
<p>Herewith is a cutting from a paper sent to me by Hyman, the final paragraph contains the opinion of Ashmead Bartlett on some aspects of the war. He has had opportunities for seeing what is happening, beyond those of most men.</p>
