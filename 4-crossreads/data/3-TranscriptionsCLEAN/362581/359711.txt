My Darling Eddy,
Sorry I have not been able to get any P.C. of this place but by next week I hope to get a few. I am wondering how Santa treated you this Xmas. XXXXXX  I have just received a p.c. from Phyllis   &  John Balfour with their photos on it. They are very good indeed. Taken at Cainsborough-Prahran. Ask Mummie to take you there. Heaps of love   &  kisses.  From Auntie Eadle.
