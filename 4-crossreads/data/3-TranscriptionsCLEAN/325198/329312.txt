  
 31 May, 1916 Hill 70 Yesterday morning I had to get up at 4.0 & go on a fatigue of building stables.  The old segeant some how got an idea that I would suit him on the job so for me to be on permanent so I took it on, it's a change, work 6 hour per day & exempt from other duties.  I received a pair of sox sent to me by the Red Cross & also a parcel of cigarettes & chocolate from Madge.
