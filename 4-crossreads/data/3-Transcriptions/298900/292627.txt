<p>Friday &amp; Saturday 9th<br/>    Issued some drugs etc to outside units &amp; also sent stuff to B. Section.  Cold developing rather badly pains in the head, in for a bad time.   Piano still in the Mess so have some music occasionally.   Trying hard to get a go on with French again but its difficult, I'm not in the mood.   More mail arriving but no home letters.</p>
<p>Sunday 10th<br/>   Feeling very off colour Neuralgia having developed to some time.   Kept quiet during the day &amp; out of the cold wind when possible.   Church service in our mess at night the hymns being played by a tommy Sgt we dug up nearby.   He turns out to be some hit in Music being a Doctor of Music &amp; after the service we had a great treat.   Capt Stevens of Melbourne singing several songs.   He is wonderful indeed &amp; his Toreador is a wonderful effort.   After that we made an evening of it &amp; I turned in about 1 A.M. being at peace with the world at large.</p>
