<p>[23rd  Nov. contd]<br/>a beautiful glass looking building.</p>
<p>Friday 24th  [Nov. 1917]<br/>At daylight we were put shore at Havre and a cup of tea was made for us.  At 10 we moved off again and arrived at a Rest Camp about 2 miles away in due course.  Saw plenty of German prisoners huge broken guns and war necessities en route.  At the Rest Camp we met some Australians back from the "Somme" and other "Tommies".  Put into bell tents (10 in a tent) and somewhat crowded.  At night we visited the YMCA in the Camp and chatted to a Scotch lady who was working here for a few months.  Also chatted to a Belgian soldier.  He was wounded at indecipherable] &amp; was at [indecipherable]  &amp; Antwerp and after making munitions in England was now employed at same work here.  Into bed as best we could and rain in night made things very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Saturday 25th<br/>Reveille at 6.30 am.  Still raining heavy.  Pack up kit &amp; cup of tea etc and at 8.30 we were ready to move off again.  March to station and packed into cattle trucks &ndash; 35 in each &ndash; still wet through.  Then followed a dreary time prolonged by delays en route.  We passed Rouen at midnight.  Tea at [indecipherable] but could not sleep as we were too cramped.  I sat up all night and generally spent an uncomfortable time.</p>
<p>Sunday 26th<br/>Our train pushed on rather slowly and only covered 75 miles during 15 hours.  However at about midnight we arrived</p>
