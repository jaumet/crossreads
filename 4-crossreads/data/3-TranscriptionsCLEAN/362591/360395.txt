  
 have tried to prepare Cairo for the reception of the troops but I've heard it suggested.  Anyhow after pleasure came the pain & the sufferers were placed in barbed wire enclosures and treated as criminals.  Many people thought that the real criminals were not in the enclosures.  Thirsting for revenge a few, very few, including N.Zers & English & Australians started one night to smash up one of these houses & threw some furniture out of a window into the street.  It was a holiday night & as crowds will a crowd collected to the number of thousands.  Then came the English Military Mounted Police & fired on the crowd.  Things immediately became lively.  The E.M.M.P. galloped away.
