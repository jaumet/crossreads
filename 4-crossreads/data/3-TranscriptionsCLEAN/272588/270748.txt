  
 Saturday 3 August At Racquinghem, into which village I went for a walk this morning.  This afternoon I went into St. Omer & walked round but the town is fairly dead. The gardens are very pretty.  Very wet at intervals.  News of a brilliantly successful attack from Rheims, the French retaking Soissons & I think that that front is our destination. 
 Sunday 4 August Fine to-day. A walk round the country this afternoon & the country is beautiful, cropped heavily & nicely timbered in the valleys.  The view from the hill to the south includes Cyere Lillers & the slag heaps of Bethune.
