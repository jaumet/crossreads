Store of 3rd nucleus Battn. caused five casualties. We go up to Borre to-night. News is to hand to-day of the re-commencement of the German offensive he has attacked the French between Soissons Rhiems. He had initial success, but I cannot say to what extent. Also North of here he attacked but only on a small front, where he penetrated our line. On this front our guns were busy last night but nothing happened.
