<p>Ships in this vicinity &amp; are now taking a Westerly Course, in between the Arabian &amp; African Coasts.<br/>It is a common sight to pass Arab "Dhows" they call them as much as 10 miles out at Sea.  They are very fierce looking men, but I suppose quite harmless, although I would not trust one of them.  They all carry knives in their Belts.</p>
<p>The African &amp; Arabian Coast Line is nothing to be compared with the Australian.  It rises abrupt from the Sea to a height of about 700 feet &amp; is inhabited by Arabs &amp; Blacks respectively.  The Water here has a kind of greenish colour, so different to the Pure Blue Colour everywhere in evidence round the S. Australian Coast.<br/>There are myriads of Flying Fish here ranging in size up to 3 ft long.  We can now see about 5 or 6 Transports ahead of us.<br/> In all 56,000 men are leaving Australia, forming the 2nd Division and are strung out between Sydney &amp; here in batches, what a haul for a daring Submarine, but hurrah for British power, the Seas are swept clear of these pests in this vicinity.</p>
