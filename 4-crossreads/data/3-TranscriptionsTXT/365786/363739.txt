 [indecipherable &ndash; page torn.]  for the following reasons  There are many reasons why we should vote yes &ndash; our Empire is engaged in a mighty conflict &amp; we in Australia are a free people  only so long as we are part &amp; parcel of a united unconquered British Empire.   What has kept us safe so far?  Britain &amp; The British Navy!   But if we do not stand by  Britain  the Empire now, how can we expect Britain to stand by us later on?   What is it are we asked to decide?  We are asked to keep up our A.I.F. of 100,000 men to its full strength.  To do that we require reinforcements  to the number  at the rate of 16500 men every month &amp; under the voluntary system now in vogue we are only securing 6000 men per month.  What does conscription mean?  The dictionary tells us that conscription means "obtaining recruits by compulsion".  Well that is what we have to do.  We have tried the voluntary system &amp; it has failed  &amp; now  so it remains for us to decide whether we shall honour our promise or let the name of Aust.
