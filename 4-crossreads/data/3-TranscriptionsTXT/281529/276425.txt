Waterloo
Behind a crest the Guard was massedThe Guard!  Supreme hope &amp; supreme thought!"Go! give us the Guard", he cried And lancers, grenadiers with gaiters drillDragoons who Rome had taken for legionairesLifeguardsmen, cannoniers who trained the thundersWearing black colbeck or Polish head-dressAll, those of Friedland &amp; those of RivolcUnderstanding they were going to die in this feteSaluted their God standing upright in the tempestTheir mouths with one sole cry said "Live the Emperor!"Then with slow step, music at the head, without furyTranquil, smiling at the English fireThe Imperial Guard entered into the furnace
Alas, Napoleon leaning on his GuardWatched and as soon as they had debouchedUnder the black cannons spitting jets of sulphurSaw one after the other in this horrible whirlpoolMeet these regiments of granite &amp; of steelAs melts a cinder in the breath of a brazierThey went their arms sloped, erect, grave stoicNot one returned.   Sleep, heroic dead!
Victor Hugo(The Punishment)
