Got this song from a friend
Till the sands of the desert grow coldTill the infinite numbers are toldGod gave thou to me and mine thou shalt beFor ever, to have and to hold.Till the story of judgement is toldTill the mystery of heaven unfoldI'll turn unto love to thee my shrine thou shalt beTill the sands of the desert grow cold
The hot winds that come to theeOer desert sands all blow from theeI bid them to tell thee that I love theeSpeeding my soul to theeHot sands burning, fire my veins with passion boldLove I love thee, till desert sands grow coldLove me! I'll love thee
The desert a burning seaA barrier stands 'tween thee and meAll The love fast as light hasten to theeQuenching my thirst in the Noon suns finds me, far beyond the caravanDeath there warns me how vain is the strength of manLove me! I'll love thee.
