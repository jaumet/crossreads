<p>In the following year, during another visit to Sydney from Adelaide, Tristram James was admitted to the Prince of Wales Military Hospital at Randwick where he was a patient from Saturday 26 March 1938 to Friday 29 April 1938. At the time of his retirement in 1931 he bacame an honorary member of the Officers Mess of the 1st Medium Artillery Brigade at Avoca Street, Randwick, N.S.W. By this means its members kept in touch with him. So on this occasion, probably on Saturday afternoon 23 April 1938 a few members of the Mess, including myself, visited him at the Prince of Wales Military Hospital at Randwick. I can now recall that he was dressed in a suit and that we sat in chairs placed in horseshoe fashion and among the things we talked about was the forthcoming Anzac Day March in the City of Sydney. One of the few things that I can now recall about this talk is that he said that he did not himself take part in Anzac Day Marches. I have no recollections to-day of the ending of the visit on this occasion to the Prince of Wales M11 itray Hospital at Randwick and of saying good-bye to Tristram James who was a man who did not like any kind of fuss in respect of himself. But in taking our departure it could not then be known that we would not meet again.<br/>It has already been mentioned that Tristram James commanded the 7th Brigade, A.F.A. of the A.I.F. in action in the War of 1914-18. In the post-war era the 7th Brigade, A.F.A. was located in the Sydney suburb of Willoughby. Later in 1938 I attended this Brigade&acute;s annual camp at the Port Stephens area near the City of Newcastle. It was my own farewell to horsed field artillery. I mention my association with this peacetime 7th Brigade, A.F.A. merely to say also the I have no knowledge that Tristram James did or did not take any interest in this peacetime Brigade - as artillery regiments were then designated - at Willoughby N.S.W.</p>
