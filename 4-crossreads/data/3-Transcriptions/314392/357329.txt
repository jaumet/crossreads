<p>about 8pm.<br/>24th Cold and miserable at 12 noon I went out to Flers where I worked walking tracks over which the mules could walk. The road, which was under water during the wet weather is now solid sheet of ice &amp; although it is strong enough to bear the weight of an animal, it is impossible to walk on it owing to the slippery  nature . Fritz was shelling fairly heavily around us but no one was hurt. One of our 18 powder guns had a premature burst   blowing half the barrel of the gun within 20 yards of where we were working. Returned to camp OK. Freezing all night</p>
