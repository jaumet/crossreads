<p>a military point of view that even by unbiased minds, it was looked upon as likely to prove invincible, no matter how hard the task cet.</p>
<p>With this Hunish idea in view a glance at the map will clearly show the hopeless state of both France &amp; Russia if ever the Huns should decide for War.</p>
<p>A matter of a few months &amp; France would have been completely over run, ruined, then Russia could have been crushed at ease with all the Huns accummulated power. Snow &amp; Ice, devastation &amp; desolation would never have stopped this hellish horde. With Russia laid low would this blood lustful fiend's ambition have been so completely satisfied to have rested contented with his, to him gloriously won honors? As Ruler of all the land in Europe, content to stand equal to Britain as Ruler of the Seas! Not for a single moment!</p>
<p>Every gun &amp; every man left would be turned on British borders. The British Isles, India, Egypt, &amp; Africa, would have had to bear the brunt of an attack from millions of murdering wretches whose delight would have been to vie each other in villainy &amp; frightfulness. What matter to their purjured, lying Leader if millions paid their just debts by dying in their villainy, so little would such a vile thing in human form think, that were it possible their worthless bodies would be used to float across remaining millions, so that his bloodletting ambition be attained.</p>
<p>This Self appointed Trumpeter of all the Virtues, perceiving all the Entente Nations quite fully occupied with internal troubles, &ndash; Russia with her labourers, France her Army, &amp; Britain on the brink of an internecine war &ndash; became a seer with a clarity of vision most pronounced, &amp; through his degraded satellites, provided by means of a devilish scheme, a cause for war.</p>
<p>With Hunish money murderers</p>
