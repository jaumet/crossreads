<p>soldiers from France I think had been running down the YMCA, and as I <s>have</s> was at a YMCA concert up till about 8.45 this evening I think I&#39;ll give you our opinion of the YMCA over here. The returned soldiers said that the YM did not reach them in the front line as the War Chest and other gift funds did. Of course YMCA and gift funds are very different afairs. The Gift funds do send us stuff out the front line some times, about once in 3 months but the YMCA is with us if ever we are out of the firing line at all. Take this camp for instance, we are not in the firing line but we are within about three miles of the Turks and we have here a YM. marquee with a piano and free <s>iced</s> lemon squash and biscuits for all hands all day - just help your self. The ice come all the way from Cairo I believe. We had a rough sort of concert here last night, given by artists in the regiment - but when we go back to rest where we can run</p>
