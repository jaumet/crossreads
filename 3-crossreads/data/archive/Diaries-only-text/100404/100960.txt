In wishing you greetings of the coming New Year
I wish you all joys and I wish you good cheer
And as years roll on you will never falter
To remember your patients at Xmas in Malta
When war grief are over
And there are smiles instead of tears
And you are in dear old Ireland
In happy future years
I wonder if you will think Sister
Of Malta nursing times
And those awful Australian Patients
And the one that scribbled Rhymes.
