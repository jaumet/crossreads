Aug 1917(Boxing today)morning. At midday she started fireing & manuvering fired about 17 shots at what most of us took to be a target. Some are convinced it was a Submarine. In fact the yarns go so far as saying 2 were sunk & at night one or two men I know moved there hammocks nearer the steps to be able to get out quickley. I have a good position so can afford to laugh
