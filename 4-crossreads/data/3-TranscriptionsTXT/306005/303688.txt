8-1-17engaged a room, had breakfast & a brush up, engaged a "garry" & drove toTewfik Bay interviewed the manager of the P&O Line & was told the Kaiserhind has not left Aden yet & to call again tomorrow. I found him very obliging but they are not allowed to give any information concerning the arrival or departure of boats to any one. When leaving the P&O office I met Mr Wint he is stopping at the Bel Air Hotel & I decided on putting up there also but found it out of bounds to Troop as it is reserved for Officers; However I had a hot bath there; took a couple of watches to the watchmakers for repair & some films to a photographers to print & had dinner at the Windsor where I am boarding.
