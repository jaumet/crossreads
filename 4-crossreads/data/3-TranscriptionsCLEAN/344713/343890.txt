was - Myself (shock); Brown (shock) Anderson (shock); Crockett (Killed) Skelly (Wounded); Murray (Wounded)  Gould (Killed); Smith (arm off); Jenkins (Killed) Moody (wounded)  & a couple of  strange machine-Gunners (Killed).After getting the lumps of burnt tree & half the trench off myself & making sure that they were only artificial stars I saw, got help & the wounded away to dressing station. After a couple of hours lie down am alright again.
Tues. 25th July.Bombardment still going on & we are just in the right place to catch things now that we are in these support trenches just a short distance from the front. When we were close to the relief last night I was one of those placed at intervals along the blown -out trench to keep up communicating with "C" Coy on our right & to close up the gap caused by the demolished trench. We were kept busy with a "banjo" & sandbags trying to put up a bit of cover for our stay.The officer (Pugh) who took over the Coy after Captain Pearce was evacuated came along the trench to tell us to be prepared to move when the relief came & he said "Wake those men up & tell them to get ready" But the poor fellows around were beyond the waking process as they were the killed of the afternoon.
