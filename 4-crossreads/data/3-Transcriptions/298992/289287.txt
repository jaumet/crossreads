<p>"Morinda" 7.</p>
<p>5th November 1914.</p>
<p>The Manager,<br/>Island Department,<br/>Messrs Burns Philp &amp; Co. Ltd.,<br/>Sydney.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Following on Mr Kennedy's report.</p>
<p>The Woodlark Island cargo was finished at 9 a.m. on Saturday the 24th October, and the "Morinda" sailed at noon, arriving at Samarai at 6 on Sunday morning. The tide not being suitable the ship did not go alongside the Wharf till about 9 a.m.</p>
<p>After sending the mail ashore, I went and saw Mr. Aumuller, and showed him your radio message re the price of copra. He told me he had a little, but was going to keep it at Samarai till the "Marsina" same along, to see if a better price was offering. I then went and interviewed Mr. Faris of Messrs Whitten Bros. He had about 26 tons of Copra in Samarai, but I could not induce him to sell any to the steamer &ndash; he has consigned it to Sydney, by this vessel.</p>
<p>Mr. Clunn of Messrs Clunn &amp; Sons likewise would not sell any to me, thinking he would be able to get a better price in Sydney, but has shipped some 10 Tons as cargo.</p>
