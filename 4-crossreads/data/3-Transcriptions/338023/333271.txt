<p>agrees with my appetite if it does make me bark a bit. Am getting as fat as a toad &amp; (ashamed to admit) the color of a Pommie. Re the things I mentioned  in an earlier letter &ndash; I have not yet sent them on, as I am waiting an opportunity to pack &amp; register properly. A few more of the 'old shipwrecks' blew in to-day &amp; didn't we give them a few rubs. They've had a time of it, though, &amp; wish they'd come with us. By the way &ndash; there's an old ruin not far from here built by one Lutegar before woad went out of fashion. Some building &ndash; flint rubble &amp; natural cement. The one remaining window has been altered (built in) so many times that its quite a dictionary of architecture of the ages. Of course I'll  send some of the ruins along as specimens &ndash; some day I may like to recall how we cooked a chook in Lutegars castle. It's going to freeze again tonight &amp; there's plenty snow getting ready for us somewhere. Snow is the best thing they have in this country &ndash; it covers their slush and beautifies the hideous landscapes &ndash; Thus we don't mind it any. Must post now, so au'voir &ndash; Love to yourself &amp; all from Harry</p>
