<p>Paris<br/>13/3/17<br/>taxi down as far as the gates of the Bois de Boulogne and walked round the avenues.  The grass looks very green in among the thickly planted tree trunks &ndash; some trees on the verge of bursting into bloom.  These trees are all  under about 40 years of age for a clean sweep was made here in '70 to prevent the wood being used as shelter by the invaders. [Franco-Prussian War].  Fronting the Bois in both directions are high walls of stone &ndash; part of the fortifications of the city.  There were not many people in the Bois but those who had come out were very chic.  A few were riding up and down on fine horses.</p>
<p>The whole park is intersected by magnificent roads of ashpalt which converge near the gates.  Walked along the avenue of approach as far as the Arc of Triumph.  General Castlenau was riding on the tan. Took taxi home and then walked out alone at 1 for the Cafe Weber and some lunch.  After lunch with E. took a taxi to the Gare du Nord to find out about  tonight's train.  No RTO here so an M>P> informed me. <strike>After</strike></p>
