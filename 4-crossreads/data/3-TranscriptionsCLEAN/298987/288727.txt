  
 Jan '18 old hands who have been to France before & are bent on all the fun they can get out of the last few hours on this side There is a good deal of drinking allways is traveling  & all moves in the army to quote Omar Khayyam "What without asking hither hurried. Whence. And without knowing, Whether hurried hence" or I think that is it 
 Wednesday 23rd Had a very light breakfast of Bread & Bacon at 6 a m & marched back to the Boat & straight on board & anchored in the harbour all day. Southampton seems a fine place what little I saw of it. There are a lot of horses on board & a fair number of troops. There is no sleeping accomidation. Hunted all over the place & could not find a decent posie It is a dead calm night so no sickness Have done well for tucker could buy bread & tea or cocoa from the sailors & had plenty of 'billie' The engins have just stopped 4.15 AM so suppose we are at Le Harve
