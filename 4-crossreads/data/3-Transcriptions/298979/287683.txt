<p>and entrancing pictures so vividly, that his very soul would crave for more, yet this same London is almost a perfect blank, a dreary tiresome waste, to many with eyes without a flaw, London, where for a whole day the mind of a man can be raised to transcendental heights without moving more than a few hundred yards, yet to reach its outskirts from a centre necessitates a journey of twelve to fifteen miles at least. London Motor buses &amp; on the River front the trams also trains &amp; tubes, afford ample means to visit every part of the city &amp; its surroundings at a very moderate cost &amp; to take one trip by every line would take a considerable time.</p>
<p>The traffic, not nearly now so congested as in pre-war days, is still handled in a manner that has caused the fame of the London Policeman to spread the whole world over, and gained for him the highest praise for tact skill civility &amp; courtesy &ndash; It is very fine indeed to see a Policeman hold up his hand to momentarily block the traffic to enable a blind, lame, or elderly man or woman, or even a little child, to cross a crowded street. It seems a state of chaos but all traffic is wonderfully organised the raised hand of a Policeman is sufficient to stop the highest &amp; the lowest &amp; may block the traffic for a mile back, the lowering of the hand again sets the crush in motion, without a single word &ndash; from him &ndash; being spoken.</p>
<p>Apparently not a single "earthly" wish or whim, but what can be gratified in London if the necessary money is forthcoming. No scheme too huge, no article so valuable, no delicacy so rare but given the requested price &amp; time, London will secure it.</p>
<p>It was with exceeding regret that London with its wonderful sights, Theatres, Music Halls, Institutions Resturants etc, was left behind</p>
