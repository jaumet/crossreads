We passed through charming country to-day. The largest town we passed was Dijon which we reached at 10 p.m.
Sept 28th
When we awoke early this morning we found ourselves at a place called Germaine au Mont D?Or. We left the train at this part and were marched a short distance to a well conducted rest camp where we had breakfast and a hot bath. A few managed to get the hold of some liquor and made fools of themselves. Saw some troops coming back from Eastern parts. They looked physical wrecks. 
Left Germaine au Mont D?Or at 12 mid day. Next stop 20 kilos away and is the city of Lyons.
At this station most of the troops amused themselves throwing pennies, cigarettes, etc. to children on to the streets below the station. This was the cause of a great deal of sport.
We then went rapidly through most charming country by river, hill dale. At some parts we ran parallel with the wide river Rhone.
When I passed this way two and half years ago it was spring time, now it is autumn and the trees have taken on their varied autumn tints instead
