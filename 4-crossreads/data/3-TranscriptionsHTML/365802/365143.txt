<p>From Lieut.Myrton T. Allen killed 27 July</p>
<p>COPY</p>
<p>My dear Peter,<br/>Was ordered to rejoin the Battalion the day after I wrote my last letter to the Mater and after some hours in the train and some more hours on foot was sent straight on into the trenches ( I nearly wrote "drenches" but they are not too bad now as we've had a few days fine weather). Had to go a dickens of a way through saps in the dark down Queer Street past the White City and on through Safety Alley to Nonesuch Hall off Sniper's Alley, but don't use that as my address as the Post Office people really know very little geography..</p>
<p>Had a very cosy little dug-out with a nice soft mattress made of wire netting. First two days things were very quiet &ndash; only an occasional bullet whizzing over or a shell going back to the billets, and by covering our tin hats with sacking it was quite safe to look over at Fritz provided you did not keep  your head up too long.</p>
<p>The trenches here are not at all like what you read about but are really earthworks ( you could not dig more than a couple of feet down without hitting water ) and consequently one has not too much earth behind to keep off the back-blast of the shells. Fritz, who was about 300yds. Away stuck up a notice one day "Advance Australia ! if you can" and when one of our patrols struck a trip wire that night they fastened a string to it and brought it back into our trench. We then jerked the string which rang a gong in Fritzie's trench and you should haved seen him wake up. He filled the air with flares for the rest of the night .must have thought he'd overdone the joke and that we were taking him at his word. He was a bit jumpy at that time as a few days before I got here he'd tried a gas attack and when he heard our gongs and horns blowing the alarm he thought we were using them like he does to call the stretcher bearers, and lined up his trench for the attack. Then our artillery opened and caught him beautifully and to crown all the wind changed and blew the gas on him. We're pretty right as we've two gas helmets each besides the goggles for tear gas.</p>
<p>Things have been quiet like this ever since the Australians got here until the third night after I got here. Then they started. It was just dusk and I'd gone down to the end of the Company to see that they were standing to arms and was talking to the sergeant watching them drop a couple of shells on one of our saps. Then I saw a bomb coming and we ducked; then a shell and we slipped into the shelter of one of the bays in the front trench. After that they lifted the lid off hell &ndash; bombs, rifle, grenades, shells coal-boxes, weary &ndash; willies and whizs-bangs all bursting at once. They made some noise but the thing that impressed me most was the tearing rending sond they made like gigantic hail tearing along  before a thousand &ndash;mile-an-hour gale through an orchard. Then in the middle of the rumpus word came that a machine gun near us in the next company had lost their magazines. We had some empty bays between us and our reserve gun so I had to hop along. You would have laughed at me doing the snake act close up against the front wall and every now and then flopping into a pool of green slimy water and then when I hit the traverse where there was no bank in rear waiting till I heard one burst, and then sort of flying round. When I finally got to the machine gun places I found that the crew of the gun which had been blown out had come along before me with their gun. I finished up the rest of the show in the M.G. dug-out.</p>
<p>Among the crew I struck young Doyle who was in Short's bank in Newcastle and came sailing with me sometimes. It's wonderful the number of chaps I know that I've struck here. Even the guide detailed to lead my party into the trenches was an old schoolmate of mine.</p>
<p>After the bombardment was over I had to go along to B.Coy. next to ours and see how they were. It was deuced tough going  - there were hardly any duck-boards (these are the wooden footways</p>
