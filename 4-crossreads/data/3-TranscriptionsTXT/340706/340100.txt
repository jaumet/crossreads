17-5-19 (Sat)No new has so far arrived so I decide to finish my leave. Exchange a hat & start off for station - find that I have just missed the 10.36 & must wait till 1.5. Then arrive at Salisbury & porter takes charge of my gear, & I buy some pc to replace those I lost. Met a NZ & we drink several vermouths the only drinks I have on this leave, arrive in London & find my room kept.
18-5-19 (Sun)Intended to go to Brighton but do not rise till nearly 3 pm & then not knowing where to go I ask a policeman & he puts me on to Hampton Court As this is [Chestnust] Sunday the day
