<p>Tuesday 18 September 1917.</p>
<p>On despatch messenger once again and today a deal of fooling around&nbsp;business. (Mismanagement again.) A busy day &amp; late into evening also.</p>
<p>The dust today is terriffic, the worst day in this respect since arriving in Egypt.</p>
<p>At 8.30 when I took latest despatches to Brigade Hd Qrs the searchlignts of ours (Allies) could be plainly seen sweeping everywhere.</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> &amp; 4<sup>th</sup> Brigades moved out to the other side of Tel-el-Farah on the Waddy. Gazzeh. &nbsp;Moving all day.</p>
<p>Geo. Kelley called on the way out with 12<sup>th</sup> Regt. 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Brigade. I was out again on duty and missed him.</p>
