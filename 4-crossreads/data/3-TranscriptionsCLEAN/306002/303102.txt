7.4.15Wed. 7th.  Another Regimental scheme to-day & had a good time of it;  we were working by the pumping station, & had dinner there arrived back in camp about 3 oclock.  The supply of tucker has fallen off the last few days, & we appear to have a short allowance now;  leave was granted for Cairo to-night, & Nelson has taken advantage of it & gone in.  Nelson has been working with H.Q. the last couple of days & "Penny" & I have been working C Sqd. on our own.
