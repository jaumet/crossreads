On Tues. we relieved the 15th at Fleurs support where we were posted on Mon. and Tues. When we arrived we found them huddled up in an old gun pit, as they had been shelled out of the dug outs on Tues. Fritz dropped a shell just outside and dug up a couple of dead Indians. All along the track to the trenches are thousands of crosses. 
Monday 23rd to Thursday 26th
A man is buried just where he drops and a cross put over it and either his shell helmet or a shell put there as a land mark. The ground is strewn with shells, rifles, bayonets overturned guns equipments etc. But it is useless to try and describe things here. Sometimes as we are struggling along with a stretcher case, a star shell will light up and the wooded crosses and dead bodies lying around make things look very weird. In spite of it all our crowd are keeping up heart wonderfully and although the humour is very grim, we can still manage to raise a smile. On Tuesday I got a very pleasant surprise by getting 2 letters and 2 papers from France which were mighty welcome. Poor old Mac is in a bad way because two of his patients have died on the way in. Things are mighty rough for us, but how the poor devils of Infantrymen stick it is beyond me. There are about 20 of our men sick and suffering from Shell shock. It is an awful strain on all of us. Doherty fell in a shell hole and rolled on a dead German and has felt very queer ever since. On Wed. night besides Serg. Roberts and 8 of us bearers we had Capt. Nance, Irving and a new officer in our dug out and it was very crowded. We are working in 6 hours shifts. 600 went on from 2.30 till 8.30 then we rolled in our blankets and tried to sleep sitting up but it was a dismal failure as it was so odd and Billsy, Snowy S.H. and I are 1 party and Mac Bert Hunt, Bluey Riley and Jack Keen are the other. Berry is in charge of the other 2 parties in the next dug out. It looked very funny the crowd wrapped in their blankets huddled in a heap to try and keep warm.
