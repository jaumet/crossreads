<p>selves out of the line of fire, I can tell you it was not a pleasant sensation you could hear just a word&nbsp;hear &amp; there but orders seem to be all jumbled up, the tension and suspense was awful I think the waiting for the order to charge was worse than the actual charge itself at least thats how I felt. Final instructions came at last. i.e. charge the first line then the second and so on and use the steel well, I thought my Coy would go in first being A Coy but C. Coy went in before us, it was about 150 yrds to the first trench and when I got out on that flat piece of ground oh God I will never never forget the sight, they had machine guns everywhere and we were enfiladed from all sides you had to jump over the dead and wounded which were lying in heaps. my mate and I had run about 30 yrds or so when a shell burst right between us and the next thing I heard was my mate cry out Jack I&#39;m hit poor fellow I stopped with him gave him some water I tried to put on his field bandage but he died before I got finished he just said dont forget to tell Mother. I do not know how or why I got to that trench</p>
