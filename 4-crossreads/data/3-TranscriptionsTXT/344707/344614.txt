I do not know who composed this but must send it
IEgypt land of sin and sunsets,where my footsteps pause a while.Where the dusty sore - eyed ArabBarters fruit with native guile.Half the world we've crossed to reach you.Hearts were light and hopes were highThinking that we came for fightingBut we're only "standing by
IIMay be when our limbs are feebleAnd our heads are bending lowWe shall tell our children's childrenOf the days of long agoHow, with patriotic fervourMen came in from far awayAnswering the call of freedomThis includes the "standing by"
