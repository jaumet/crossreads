<p>Marseilles  &amp; had no time to take in stores.<br/>Of course I understand we are merely soldiers &amp; the war might have finished without us if they delayed a few hours to get stores in.</p>
<p>Sun.  26th. March<br/>Some talk of calling in at Malta for stores.<br/>Aboard are the 4th Bn, Artillery Hdqrs, &amp; Field Bakery Corp. also Engineers.<br/>1st 2nd &amp; 3rd Bns. left a day ahead of us.</p>
<p>Thurs. March 30th 1016.<br/>Landed at Marseilles at about 2 P.M. think we are off too Havre. Plenty of German Prisoners working around the docks &amp; railway here.<br/>Entrained &amp; started away on our journey.</p>
<p>Fri. March 31st.<br/>Still on our train journey &amp; think we will have another night of it. Lovely scenery &amp; splendid cultivated land.<br/>White roads winding about the green fields with red tiled houses of the villages scattered  around completing the colour contrasts.<br/>Best country to be seen &ndash; South of France &ndash; especially after having an overdose of Egypt - &amp; it is inhabited by a most courteous race of people.<br/>Feeling is very bitter against the Germans.  They have the saying "After the War is finished; <u>We</u> Begin"</p>
