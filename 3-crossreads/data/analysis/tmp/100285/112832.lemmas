 ward is n't it ? ! Made out an applic for leav this afternoon think I will go down into Wale for a chang . 7th . Veri hot sultri today look like more rain brew , the hot weather over here is much wors to put up with I think than our Australian heat but the reason may be whi we feel it so much is on account of the heavi close cloth we wear , there is practic no air circul through our cloth I often wonder how on earth we are go to take to work when when this war is over . As you know my hand are as white as snow as soft as a woman I have done no manual work these last 2 year to speak of for a Sgt live the life of a gentleman is general wait
