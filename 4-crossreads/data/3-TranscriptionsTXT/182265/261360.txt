24/8/17 - Rather a quiet day; interspersed however with bursts of artillery over us, both our own & enemy.
I cleaned, examined & reset 8 boxes of Mills bombs & Rifle Grenades. They were caked in mud to such an extent as to be hardly recognisable. I also inspected new place for Mule dump. The mule train brings up rations every night to a dump & my party then man-handle these to cook houses, which are situated in German Cement block houses. Casualties about a dozen last night. Received letter from Gladys. Writing home to J. 
25/8/17  Heavy straffing of our right front line by enemy artillery, to which ours replied in retaliation, three times today. Luckily very few casualties.
I cleaned Bombs & Ammunition. Three Enemy planes over us this evening. We fired at them with Lewis Guns &
