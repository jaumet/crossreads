 If I return and sit at last Besid some hearth-fir safe and sound , Mayb I ll send some tale around About our do of the Past Of stair that twist from musti lane Weird den of sin with lattic door Fierc gasp fight in corridor Slave market wall with rusti stain . Peach-color dawn with opal mist , The snaki camel-train that steal , Past oxen plod round the wheel , Gold bangl load women 's wrist . The flash of anklet through the dust Veil women round the villag well ( What dark eye say no tongu may tell Of hate of hate , of lust of lust ) A hundr breed of men that meet And strive with tale in broken speech , Sad tale of home far out of reach Barbar music weird and sweet Huge tomb of priest and dust of king Rise beneath our careless tread , While bristl kite swing overhead A thousand thousand wondrous thing Still heap beneath the outspread flag The wolf-lik captiv plead eye The fire parti plod by Quiet head beneath a bloodi rag Are heap of cloth that clutch and sprawl And ghast boy who fight for air Old twist mouth , wide eye that stare Blue sky and sunshin over all . If I return to sit and weav These tale and watch the homefir burn When I return ? if I return Do you believ that they ll believ .
