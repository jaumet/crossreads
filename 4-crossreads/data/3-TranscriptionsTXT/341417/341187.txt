 [Written on the back of the postcard on the previous page, showing High Street, Brightlingsea:] April 1917. 
 You should see the crowd that collects round Lucas' window. In my spare time I have caricatures of everyone of note in the town from the commandant to the local butcher (a great sport and like Jack a musician and my best friend) 
 Love to all at home Vasco
