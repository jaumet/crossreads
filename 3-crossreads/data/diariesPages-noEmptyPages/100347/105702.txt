Sunday
 May 18th at Sea
Church in morning on deck : calm warm day
Monday May 19th at Sea
calm warm : plenty of flying fish about now also a few sharks : concert at night
Tuesday May 20th at Sea
calm warm : hard work trying to keep cool I reckon we'll feel our Aussie summer for a while : passed plenty of jellyfish of a purplish hue with a pink Sail set up which caught the wind thus provided the means of propulsion : pretty to look at : inoculated for "flu" : dance at night
