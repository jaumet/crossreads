<p>Dec; 19th.<br/>Hut inspection &ndash; camp like a quagmire. Break camp again, meet Waterhouse lady, visit Melbourne Gallery  together. Unfortunately she does not understand art.</p>
<p>Dec; 20th.<br/>Pack kit &ndash; camp still like a quagmire &ndash; no leave granted. Again visit Waterhouse lady &ndash; wish she had not got a husband &ndash; so does she.</p>
<p>Dec 21st.<br/>Pouring with rain, shall soon have to swim in mud. Must find an excuse to get back to Melbourne to see Waterhouse lady.</p>
<p>Arrived in Melbourne, lady out. -   -   -   - I entered the Vienna Caf&eacute; to have a cup of tea. Look across the room &ndash; see the Waterhouse lady. My luck seems to be quite in.<br/>6 p.m. Heavy sky, pouring with rain; Waterhouse lady comes to see me off, am leaving for the Front this night. Arrive back in camp, a desolation of mud and slush and rain &ndash; very few men in camp. I go to get my pay from Captain Margoline, have a little chat with him &ndash; then to sleep.</p>
<p>I mentioned to Margoline how glad I was we were leaving the camp in the morning. Margoline said, " So am I, Silas, I think we all have had about enough of it."</p>
<p>Dec;22<br/>Still pouring with rain &ndash; the mud and filth simply awful. I leave my kit at the end of the line as directed &ndash; a few minutes later it had disappeared &ndash; expect the "Fall in" to</p>
