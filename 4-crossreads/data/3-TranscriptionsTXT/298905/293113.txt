are still understrength.The mobile gun is quite close to us again this morning & tearing into old Fritz.16th. At last the weather has taken up this morning is a beauty not a cloud in the sky, it is an almost perfect morning the sun is shining brightly, birds are singing gaily, while the whole countryside is nothing but a mass of green & leafy trees sweet flowering hedges blossoming fruit trees, & the paddocks are a riot of wild & garden flowers & the incense arising from all this mass of beautiful colouring is something lovely for you know it is Springtime here & we have all heard & read about this part of the world & the beauty of it for 6 months or so, & it quite deserves its reputation, but the other 6 months has a different side to it, "what oh".
