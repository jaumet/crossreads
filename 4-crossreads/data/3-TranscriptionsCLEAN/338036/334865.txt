  
 [20th Jan. contd] I made a bit of a fire with furniture & making some water hot fixed up the pump which had frozen. 
 Sunday 21st Water carrying & some heavy work.  At 5 pm I went on Gas picket (watching for gas attacks) but my shift did not start until 3 next a m so had some sleep in the meantime.  On sentry from 3 to 7 am & very cold.  A "stiff un" was brought up for Harry the grave digger just before my shift commenced. 
 Monday 22nd After breakfast slept until midday  Then pack up blanket etc and off up trenches to Reg Aid Post.  No sooner had we arrived there than two cases came along & later two more.  The trench duckboards are terribly hard to walk on as they have a thick coating of ice of a weeks duration.  Therefore we preferred the roadway for taking our patients notwithstanding orders to the contrary. Things went well until night time.  Jack Arkins [John O'Connor Arkins] & I were resting on the roadway near Suicide Corner when up went a   searchlight  star shell & after a few seconds bang bang bang & then a whizz ------  We didnt wait for more but Jack was down on his face & I made headlong for the gutter
