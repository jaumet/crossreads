Entering the harbour we found it practically deserted with the exception of several troop-ships.  Everywhere seemed strangely quiet & peaceful.  The city, lying at the foot of the steep pine-clad hills seemed from where we were to be dead, & scarcely any life was visible on the foreshores or in the beautiful parks surrounding the red houses which  were  nestled at intervals among the groves round the water.  A few ferry boats containing mostly women passengers went by us with the usual cheering but beyond this we saw nothing of the inhabitants.
