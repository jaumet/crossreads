7/10/18 Villeret
passing trenches and strongposts and positions ravaged by War. Came back through Villers Brettoneux and passed all the woods and trenches so familiar to us. Pulled into St Roch station and marched off down the boulevards with band playing. A group of Frenchmen gave us a great ovation. It was impossible to help feeling a thrill of pride while marching through the town Australian men had saved. A long route march in the dark brought us via Ailly-sur-Somme to the poor village of St. Vast. (En route today we passed an enormous N.S.W gun train and also a most luxurious camouflaged train of an Army Commander). All were tired out on reaching St Vast and soon tumbled into billets. At night the tramp of troops resounded through the village. Our transport delayed on another train meant there was no food or no blankets here.
