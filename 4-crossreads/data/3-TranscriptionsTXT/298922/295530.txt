Wednesday 8 August 1917
Alexandria.Arrived 1.30 p.m. or 13.30 as we write it - sent to No. 10 Convalescent Hospital, a fine building taken over from a HUN, cotton Merchant facing the sea, in nice grounds. Here I expect to stay one week then back to Palestine.
Am feeling fitter but very slack.
A mixture of Tommy Officers & Australians are here, they do not always blend well. But Scotties & Colonials do - it is the younger English pups speak so disparagingly of our folk - However!!!  A lot of them bring it on themselves.
