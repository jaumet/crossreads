An enemy 'plane came over again today flying very high; 12 of our Aeroplane left here yesterday morning & Bar [?] Sheba received the full benefit of the bombs they took out, the aeronauts profess to have made a mess of the enemy aerodromes there; McLaughlin (commonly known as Gin Gin) is batman & groom to Jack Wright (RMS) & keeps us well amused at meal times being one of the hardest doers I have yet met & any arguments that crop up during the day is settled after tea with the gloves
