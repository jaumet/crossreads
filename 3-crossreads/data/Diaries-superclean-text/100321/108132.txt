11/1/19 Gourdinne
Made an inspection at 10.15 while thereon engaged the General came along and after a walk round came to my sitting room for a yarn. Rien de nouveau. Walked over nearly to Nallines after lunch to see a Soccer match between ourselves and the 24th. It resulted in a draw. A very cold and raw day and the bare woods looked repellant. After dinner I walked round to Kennedy's billet and there found Yvonne Legait. With Raoul Marthe we had a most pleasant evening. It is good once more to meet a good pleasant girl. She can speak no English but we managed alright in French. She teaches in a school near Charleroi, is 22 and only wants a manicure and coiffure to make her a beauty.
