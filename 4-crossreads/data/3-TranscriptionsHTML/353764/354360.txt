<p>19th Dec. 15<br/>We are still at Anchor &amp; likely to be so for a while.<br/>I saw this morning one of the prettiest sunrises I have ever witnessed, it seems to be a regular thing in these parts.<br/>One of the N.Z. Transports has gone over to the wharf &amp; is unloading Troops &amp; baggage now.<br/>An Indian Transport came in last night, loaded with Troops, &amp; is at anchor not far from us.  There seems to be something "doing" up the Canal as 3 Warships went up this morning.<br/>The "Natives" are all round this Boat selling things &amp; it is funny to see our Chaps take them in.  They want Sixpence for a Newspaper, but some of the boys give them a Ha'penny, snatch the Paper &amp; run.<br/> We held Church Service on board &amp; it sounded very well on the Harbour.  We seem to be the only Boat with a Band on Board.<br/>Some of the Egyptians are the biggest thieves unhung, it is just as well that they wont let them all come on board.<br/>This afternoon the Boys knocked one of the Egyptians over as he was carrying a bag of oranges on board</p>
