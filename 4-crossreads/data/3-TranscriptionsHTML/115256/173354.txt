<p>Monday 5 April 1915</p>
<p>Once again we have had the pleasure of one of those enjoyable dust-storms.  This time however, the dust was twice as bad as last week's little blow, and there were no locusts.  Sand and dust everywhere &ndash; in the tents, in the food, it even penetrates through solids and gets into your water-bottle.  I was on picquet to-day &ndash; duty in camp to see that the naughty little soldier-boys did not violate hygienic principles by drinking out of the tap and that they did not waste the water!  Dam farce, these red-tape picquets!  At any rate, I got my full share of the dust but not as much as those who had to go on parade.</p>
<p>Rapid moving of the battalion was practised.  The men, at short notice, packed their kit bags, rolled up their blankets and waterproofs, and were ready within a very short time to march off with full pack up.  We are now hourly awaiting embarkation orders.  And I am right when I say that ninety five percent of the troops will be glad to quit this infernally dusty hole.</p>
