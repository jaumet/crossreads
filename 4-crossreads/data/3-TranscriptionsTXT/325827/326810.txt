 5 prospects of a winter about here. 
 It is a muddy hole and will be quite wet all the time. i prefer Moore Park in winter. 
 One source of amusement we get is a mule in a paddock. When shells drop near him up go his head &amp;  his tail together like those working models of a bucking horse. He is developing good neck and tail muscles. 
 I am afraid if we dodge about much my work will be a bit disorganised and I don't appreciate that much as you may imagine. However some time or other that sort of thing must happen and the sooner it does will perhaps mean the sooner the finish of everything. 
 I am quite well &amp; fit and all is well. I have met nicer things than a German 4.2 or 5.9 shell, and have heard better noises than whistle through the air. I think it must take some tones of metal to finish a man off as it is remarkable
