<p>All I've seen reminds me of North Qld  =  There are fertile patches for sugar &ndash; bananas &ndash; Citrus fruits &amp; Coco plantations  -  there are fine plantations to be seen all round  -  The Union Jack stands for freedom, justice &amp; fair play &amp; colonists of any race will prosper under us  -  This may sound high falutin but I feel &amp;  we all feel very strongly that 'this bit of the world belongs to us' &amp; we want peace &amp; plenty in it  -  There are 2 Jap flags &ndash; a red ball on a white ground - 'A fried egg Sailors call it' flying at the fore peak of 2 schooners  -  They are our allies  -  A Chinese flag   -  <u>horizontal</u> stripes - yellow, white, blue, red &ndash; flies close by  -  You bet I'm looking round, talking &amp; getting any amount of jolly experience  -  It's a man's game &amp; these chaps are men &amp; real good chaps  -  You shd  see a bally contraption made on board to slide a torpedo into the sea &amp; let her fly in case we'd been bailed up  -  The Protector wd not be much good &amp; so these chaps determined to try &amp; have a slap on their own  -</p>
