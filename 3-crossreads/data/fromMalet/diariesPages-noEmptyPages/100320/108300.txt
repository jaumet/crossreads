Not much sleep again. Rose at dawn more rain. The people of the house up and for all their £10000 fortune Mme & Mlle were working the separator or "turbine". Batmen busy packing up and putting valises & blankets on the wagons. We marched out of the village at 8.30 colours flying and band playing. There was a gleam only of sunshine. Plugged along the main road and then turned up to Castillon. The clouds now came over all and we had driving showers of hail and sleet. The roads covered with a soupy creamy mud. The weather cleared just as we passed General Rosenthal who was lying in wait for us. Came up to Rognie marching well and [indecipherable]. From here we made for Thy-le-Chateau a big place alongside the railway but with factories from which all the machinery had been removed.
