<p>how he liked the Jericho heat and told him we were rugging our horses up there in the mountains. Well by the time he gets the letter he is up there and I&#39;m down here but I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll write and sling off at me because by the time I got the letter we shall most likely have changed round again. It is just a nice two nights ride from here to our mountain camp and when we are relieved I expect we will go straight back up there again.</p>
<p>10th June I did not finish this yesterday Mother, because there seemed so little news to tell you and there is just about as much again to day. The paper mail is being sent down this afternoon but I don&#39;t think the water bag has arrived yet - however a person does not really want it here as the camels bring us plenty of water - it is out on a stunt that they are so handy. We are living pretty well here at present as we are able to carry a little wood up here and have plenty of time to cook it. We have porridge for breakfast, lemon sago for lunch and fried stake or stew with potatoes and onions and tinned beans and tomatoe sauce, and sometimes tinned fruit for dinner. I am quite some cook I can tell you! I will take the job over from you Mother first shearing after I get back, and dish them up with all sorts of wonderful dishes made from bully &nbsp;biscuit mixed. Nothing more this chirp! Love to Father and Fred and your self. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson</p>
<p>P.S. Just before we came down here I received a jolly nice parcel from Miss Dawson and Mrs Grace. I must write and thank them for it. Enclosed is a snap for Fred.</p>
<p>12th Did not get a chance to post this before Mother - so will add a scrap to it. We have just been issued with jolly fine mosquito net bivvies; just like small tents one to two men, and they seem a great success. Believe there is another Australian mail coming in tonight! Rob.</p>
