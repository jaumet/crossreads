<p>2<br/>very glad to hear you are all well. Papers also arrived. Many thanks.<br/>The weather is getting very hot here and sandstorms are rather too frequent to be pleasant. There is a beauty blowing today. Everything is covered with dust and it is impossible to see for more than about 100 yards.<br/>There is nothing given out yet as regards our future movements but we are under orders to move out at any time.<br/>The general impression seems that we are to go to the Bosphorus but I don't think anyone really knows. Personally, I am not at all particular but I would very much like to see some fighting in Germany if we are to see it at all, before it is all over.<br/>I met Mrs Rabett (Sen) last night. She and her daughter are going on to England tomorrow week. Quite a lot of Australians &amp; English people out here now.<br/>I expect from now on all our correspondence<br/>(3)</p>
