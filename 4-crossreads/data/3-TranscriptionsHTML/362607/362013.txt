<p>Bulford<br/>10.3.18<br/>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,<br/>Devonshire Cream has been commandered by the Food Comptroller but I had some cider. It was horrid stuff like beer &amp; I did not like it a bit. Devon is lovely. Although it was winter time the views were grand. It must be lovely in Spring &amp; summer time.  The soil is a browny red hue. We are used to chalk cliffs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; it is so strange to see anything else. Ellis has gone out for a stroll  but I am on Duty &amp; can't go. Best of  Loving Wishes.<br/>Harry</p>
