<p>June 1917<br/>went yesterday.   The fine weather still continues but we had what we would call in Australia a "Southerly Buster" at about 5 P.M. (but it came from the West.)   Last night some of Fritzs planes came over &amp; "presented" us with a few bombs.<br/>7th   This morning the company went out for another route march with full packs &amp; transport.   It was for a distance of about seven miles &amp; when we returned to camp a "bathing parade" was held at Bapaume.<br/>8th   The big bombardment up north started last night &amp; it is expected that a big push on that end of the line is about to take place.</p>
