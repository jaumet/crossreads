<p>His head was frightfully mangled.  Others were killed &amp; injured elsewhere.  A few chains down the street from here there is a small Belgian church severely damaged by shell fire, &amp; all the interior fittings have been destroyed or removed.  A school across the road is also badly damaged.</p>
<p>Thursday May 3.1917<br/>A fine morning.  Last night and again this morning there was artillery actions by our Batteries at intervals but I did not hear much of it, for I slept very soundly.  I generally sleep well when there is a bombardment on unless it is very violent, or shells bursting close.  Fritz again put over some shells and "duds" this morning.<br/>This morning two anti-aircraft guns mounted on motor lorries arrived and set up alongside our cook house, and started shelling German planes.  The concussion brought down the plaster &amp; dirt from the ceiling &amp; the walls in the cook house.  The shells there fired were nearly 3 in in diameter &amp; some of them were High Explosive, H.E.  After dinner they fired another volley at a hun plane, packed up &amp; departed much to the satisfaction of our cook.</p>
