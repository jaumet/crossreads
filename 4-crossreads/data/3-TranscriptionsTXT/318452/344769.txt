but missed it by 10 minutes so turned towards St Omer about 85 miles distant I had not gone far before I got a lift in a fine minerva car, right ot St Omer. Here I found there was nothing till 8.30 it was now about 4 oclock. As I did not want to wait so long, I got on a Horse Hospital train (350 Horses, wounded & sick) & reached Calais at 8 PM. I stayed at Hotel Sauvage till Saturday.
Friday 12Visited Hospital & found Col Green had returned to England I then visited the other hospitals in search of any of our men It was showery all day. Calais is rather a nice town & its beach is very nice.
Saturday 13returned to unit rainy all day
