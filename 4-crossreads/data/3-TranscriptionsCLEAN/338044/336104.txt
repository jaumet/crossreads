  
 Jingling donkeys. Howling noisy dirty slums. Rotten old Egyptian bazaars. Lanes where all sorts of muck &  filth congregate. Old men     indecipherable   sit outside taverns smoking big pipes which they hire. In the better class portions you sit in the street drinking soft drinks    &  eating whilst music is played.   Indecipherable   We had trouble in dodging boot boys who will not leave us until we hit them with sticks. After wandering all around the city, first in side streets &  lanes - where the poor classes eat all sorts of concoctions of rice foods, meat cooked while you wait etc, sold by vendors - to the well-lighted, tram run streets through gardens &  squares, we caught the 9-30 pm train back to camp.
