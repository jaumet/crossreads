<p>Friday 26 January 1917</p>
<p>Just handled 2 Turkswho <strike>took</strike> gave themselves up &ndash; I lifted the Cap of one &amp; found he was simply crawling, one man may be lousy, but not like those fellows. They say at <strike>Saliel</strike> about 25 miles on there are 3000 Turks, 4 Guns &amp; 23 machine guns &amp; no wire entanglements so its not a bad job ahead.</p>
<p>Jim Ayre is in my tent doing the Cash Books. Re LICE &ndash; The DELOUSING machines we have are German ones captured from the Turksat Magdaba, so they know the curse in spreading disease. Glad to hear Charlie Tyson has the Military <strike>Cross</strike> Medal. Must write him.</p>
