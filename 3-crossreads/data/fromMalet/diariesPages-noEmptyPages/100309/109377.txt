9/6/17 Contay, Rubempre Amiens
Leaving Contay the road commenced to ascend hills until Herrisart was reached. From there across to Rubempre was a pleasant ride ? the fields looking rather dry and many women working in them. From higher ground the number of woods scattered round was very striking and in one I noticed a fine chateau embowered in the trees. Rubempre is a village of ordinary type. Went to D.H.Q. and saw Colonel Relph about the accursed movement order. Went across and had a talk with General Smith and arranged for a ride into Amiens in the Brigade mess cart. With 3 days drove in via Perrigot Rainneville to Amiens. It was pleasant to see the country folk going about their peaceful occupations and passing us on the road. A striking thing going along was the close settlement ? the churches steeples showed up from each village at one time about 8 were in sight. Some of the churches are surprisingly large and they are always on the highest point in the village.
