 14/12/17 Mt. Kemmell Battalion parade in full marching order in a hedge enclosed field. Practised the general salute with our buglers. Two little Belgian kids wandered on in the middle of the show and had to be carried off by a blushing Billjim. Later one toddler about 4 was noticed to be  carried  carrying a rifle grenade. When this was taken from him by a sergeant major he promptly turned round to him and said "f  - you!" Carried on with close order drill &amp; saluting and had a smart parade. A Scotch mist was prevailing during part of this parade. In the afternoon carried out more close order work and training. The flash of shrapnel bursts could be plainly seen over Ypres way. We had 116 men killed in our last 3 tours of duty &amp; sent crosses up today by Kohn. After mess I lectured the officers on their duties regarding the care of their men.
