<p>This is a pretty good definition of an Anzac I copied it out of the "Rising Sun" a little paper issued bi-weekly by the A.I.F. in France,  it is a bright cheery little journal &amp; has some funny articles in it.<br/><u>"What is an Anzac"</u><br/>An Anzac is a resident of England or of a Base Camp. It wears an Australian uniform, but the habitat of the English variety is mostly in London. It invariably insults men on leave from France by asking to which camp they belong; &amp;  feels insulted when the "bloke" spoken to replies "The Somme". It wears Kiwi leggings an officers uniform a wounded soldiers face, about 8 gold stripes &amp; a G.S. wagon load of ostrich plumes in its' hat. Also generally wears the Batt. colours of some unit</p>
