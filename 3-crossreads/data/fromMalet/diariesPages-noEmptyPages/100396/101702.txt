My Dear Mother
I suppose you are just about wondering how we are getting along. well we're as right as pie so far, but are clearing for action. last reports offer for 800 of our picked skins were so unsatisfactory. that we have decided to do a break Our roads will be in different directions this time Chas has a sort of half offer of a job but will not know for a couple of days if there is anything in it. It will be cattle work on Yetman. I hope he gets on there. he has a fair load to hump about travelling for graft out here at such a time as this is nothing but a gamble, one might draw a winning ticket first go you might travel on till your horse nocks up gets poor silver all gone. For myself I have mapped out a pretty big order as our friend William has also done. He looked out over the world from Potsdam then drew the sword which he cannot sheathe without victory or honour went forth to conquer. he apparently did not look toward the little island where the bulldog lives. Now, I can see as far as England amp if I have exceptionally good luck I'll get there. there are a few big obstacles in the road, the closest naturally the largest looking being my big pony.
