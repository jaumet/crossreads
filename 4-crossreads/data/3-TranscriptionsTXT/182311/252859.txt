My Dear Ones,
   I have seen Les, and he looks very well, how glad we were to see each other, why, it was the supreme moment in many, many weary months.  Yes, I had notes from Les, telling me "Slowly moving up" - "Soon will be near you" - and I kept in touch through official channels with the movement of his Division.  Then I learned that they had come within about twentyfive miles of our position and one fine Sunday while "out" of the trenches I decided to look him up; the decision was made at 1 o'clock p.m., by two o'clock I was provided with a pass and on my way; the first stage of the journey was accomplished on foot, three miles to the town of Baillieul where as I expected, a motor lorry was found travelling in the right direction, and then by changing to a mule cart and again to another lorry I was transported to the point on the main road nearest to his Division's billets, then by country roads I walked the next four miles and was so fortunate to get right to his billet and to find a knot of Divvy.Sigs standing outside; a figure detached itself from the group and walked towards me and then for the first time in two years I saw old Les.  Of course we were feeling very enthusiastic and personally I would like to have given him a big hug, but for the sake of appearances we shook hands in a somewhat listless style and enquired very casually "How are you taking it" and agreeing too, in the same style
