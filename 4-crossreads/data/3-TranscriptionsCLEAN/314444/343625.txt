 France May 21st 1918 
 My Darling Sweetheart 
 It is with the greatest of pleasure I take this opportunity of writing to you hoping to find you in the best of health as it leaves me at present. Dearest Violet, after I wrote my last letter to you saying I had received several letters & cards dated Feb & March I received three more letters a few days afterwards dated Jan & early in Feb. The mail was delayed somewhere & of course they arrived late but Dearest letters from you are always welcome no matter if they arrive a year late. The last letter I wrote to you was not very good I am afraid because I was in the line & it was hard to find a good place to write  so Dearest I hope you will not mind when you receive a letter like that. We came out of the line on the 18th after being in for 15 days. The weather was nice all the time but you cannot always have a wash or a decent sleep owing to being so close to "Fritz". When we come out for a rest we generally have a camp 3 or 4 miles back from the line & a weeks spell does us a world of good. Today the general came around and complimented all the boys on the good work that was done. Some of the boys won military medals & of course the general made a nice speech & the Band played & everything passed off O.K. I am always thinking of you Darling & wishing I could see you again even for 5 minutes & that would be better than seeing all the Kings & Generals in the World.
