24/6/17 Beaulencourt
A day of rest. Church parade 10.30 am at which the Lt.G.M's M.G's were present ? a pleasant sunny morning with stirring breeze. Rode to BdeH.Q. and saw the General and the B.M. back to lunch about 1.30 p.m. and pushed off on foot to make a reconnaisance for tomorrow's work. Returned about 4 and found a conference ordered at 5. rode down and we were in close council till 7. spent the evening lecturing the company commanders writing official correspondence, drafting orders and a hundred other things. These last few days have been some of the busiest imaginable. Groves is ordered off to the 6th. T.B. and a few others too. Greig's supersession by two others has evidently much upset him. There are some very unpleasant jobs to be done in this life and one gets callous about them.
