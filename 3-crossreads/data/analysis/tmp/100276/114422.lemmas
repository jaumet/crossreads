 The follow is a parodi " on " Sing me to Sleep" is a great favorit among the boy Sing me to sleep , the bullet fall Let me forget the war all Damp is my dugout cold is my feet Noth but biscuit bulli to eat Far far from Pozeri I want to be Where German sniper ca n't pot at me Think of me crouch where the worm creep Wait for shrapnel to sing me to sleep Refrain Sing me to sleep where bomb explod And shrapnel shell are la mode Or the sand bag in front of me behind me you ll find Corps 's in front of you corps behind Refrain
