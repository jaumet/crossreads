<p>14<br/>To my darling Esme and Stella and little Beatrice I must write<br/>Also to Mother</p>
<p>By this mail I send heaps of postcards I have addressed them to everyone but you can all arrange what you like about them</p>
<p>My reason for sending them is that they give a good idea of some of the places and are almost as good as letters in that way</p>
<p>Thank the dear old children for their fine letters to me for this time I fear there is no time to write to everyone.</p>
<p>I thank my good old friend Wallie [Courthope?] once more his great goodness and will write</p>
<p>Much love to you all my dear wife and to my Mother</p>
<p>Geoff</p>
