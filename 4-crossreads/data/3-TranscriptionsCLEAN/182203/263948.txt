so will be very careful. Both Dorothy & I are going to save as much as we can to spend afterwards. I wonder where we are off to & when I shall get another letter from home. Give my love to all friends. Tell dear Mrs Barrie that I shall write her a long letter & send it as soon as I can. Not just now, must hurry or will not get this home. Fondest love & kisses & hope you are all well & happyFromYours lovinglyEdith
