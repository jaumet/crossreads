14/9/17 Dominion Camp Awakened at 4 am by Hunt and got up and had a bite of breakfast in the dark.  General Paton called for me with the Divisional General's motor car and we pushed off first of all to the Chateau Belge there picking up Major Fussell.  Our run to Ypres was fairly quick and there was no shelling and no gas.  We left our car at the Birr Cross roads and collected the Bde Intelligence officer prior to reconnoitring the firing line.  The road had a few dead horses on it and showed signs of heavy shelling from the night before.  We went up towards Hooge and had some heavy shells landing round as close as dam it.  Went through Chateau Woods on duckboards with Taubes flying overhead in squadron formation.  Our machine guns firing at them.  The Wood is all smashed about and in wet weather must be morassy.  Noticed a few sabots lying round, relics of happy homes and civilisation.  The Etang de Bellevarde is a lake about 4 acres in dimensions.  Pioneers were hard at work on a road running
