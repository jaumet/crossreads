6/9/17 Campagne
At breakfast received orders for a Divnl operation which involved quick thinking cancelling existing orders and the issue of new ones. Moved off to the position 5 miles away at 10.30 am taking our cookers with us and marched by winding roads to the Foret de Clairmarais a thick wood where we halted and had lunch in the shade of oak trees. At 2pm we jumped off from a position in rear of the wood and followed on the heels of the 5th Brigade. The 7th followed us and eventually passed through us. The trees were close together and the undergrowth thick which made keeping direction very difficult. On each flank was an officer with a prismatic compass. Early in the operations received a message that the Brigadier had become a casualty and for me to take over the Brigade which was simply a matter of sitting down at Brigade HQ. There was far too much noise going through
