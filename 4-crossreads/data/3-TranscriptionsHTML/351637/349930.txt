I at once replied that they had never ceased to rub it in to me that the Navy had shelled the Gourkas off and that this cause alone prevented the retention of Chunuk Bair. I was subsecquently able to produce extracts from Nevinson's diary and my own showing that Hamilton had himself in an interview made use of these words but that also it was I expressly stated in the offical account of these operations issued to us by the General Staff. All this information I supplied to Keyes in a letter.</p>
