We are about 3 miles behind the firing line here and are comparatively safe except from an occasional shell. I have been reading all day "A Soldier of the Legion" by CN Williamson and it is very good altho I have read it before. There are one or two very fine girls here in this billet, but we have to be very careful with them as all these persons are suspected spies. It is a noticeable fact that some billets are shelled and other not

This unfortunately is a very common occurrence and might easily be avoided Later on the O.C. of this particular Battery was wounded and I wasn’t a bit sorry for him.

We have two new reinforcements for our reduced staff. Got back from F.O. about 9 a.m. Nothing doing today. On duty on telephone from 3 to 7 p.m. Hardly a day goes bye without a gas alarm but nothing ever seems to come of it. There is to be another stunt of some time tomorrow and I understand we are moving camp again. They seem to like keeping us on the move General Christian was round today.

Lieutenant Cullen has proved an absolute failure and been sent back to waggon lines. Lieut Gatcliffe has also applied for a week’s leave which is pretty rotten considering he only left Sydney this year and only 10 days in action. The week in trenches and week out published in papers is all a myth when one gets here, except that they put them in for a few days in one place and then move them to another.
