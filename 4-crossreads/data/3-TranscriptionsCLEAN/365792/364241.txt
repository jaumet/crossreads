  
 June 10  a good long yarn about N.S.W. & the boys. Arthur met me at the train & we walked to the nearest tram & then home. Ethel is rather jolly & I like her, but I decline to go visiting - (Later) Ethel & I  do  go visiting but the people are really jolly & I enjoyed it no end. Also saw Isabel (in fact we stayed there for tea) but I was rather disappointed in her. "Such is life - &and: photographers". Caught some rain but only a little. After tea Arthur & I strolled through the main part of the City & then trammed back, called at the Liberal Club for an hour or so & from there home. Leeds is far bigger than I thought it was (pop of 400,000) & it isn't a very dirty City. The tram service is good, & of course they are all double deckers & not single like Sy trams. 
 11  Up at 7am & went for short stroll & bought a couple of papers & some chocs. After brek we all went to Church & I'm sorry to say! Giggled muchly, but such is life [in margin]  Sunday
