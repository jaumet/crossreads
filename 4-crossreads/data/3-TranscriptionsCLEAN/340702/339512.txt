because men were going away after 7 & 8 months. An order has come out to Sandbag all the huts
2.10  The fine weather has now broken up. Slight rain & wind howling a treat.
7/10 Sunday Fritz dropped a terrible lot of Bombs around here last night. There must have been at least one hundred that I heard. The old hut fairly shook. At intervals a shell came from one or other of the two Guns that bombard here. I can't hear the heavy Shell coming. Only the explosion but I can hear the smaller (about 6") one all the way also the report of the Gun. I got a pair of underpants & a shirt yesterday. After a row with the Q.M. & Lieut. Smith. Put sliding light in the Office yesterday. Raining & bitterly cold today. Sent 5 cards & a Handkerchief to Jersey Road. We put the clock back  8.10 Monday  one hour last night (Daylight Saving)
8.10 Monday.  A few shells lobbed rather close last night & one of a few others lobbed still closer today. I think the lining of the Gun must be becoming worn causing the shells to drop short. Previously they went over our heads I hope Fritz notices it soon. Weather fine  & Windy. A couple more shells in the field alongside of us, Killed 5 head of cattle. 3 others hit the ration dump & the Hospital both about 200 yds away. Supposed to have killed 25. This is making it rather lively.
