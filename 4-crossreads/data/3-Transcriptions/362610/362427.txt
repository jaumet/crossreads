<p>Sunday 30 July 1916<br/>Up fairly early to get ready for the move. A gloriously fresh morning followed by a bright hot summer day. Left Bonneville about 9.30 a.m. &amp; had a dusty march through the usual class of fertile country through Canaples to Pernois, a village on the Nievre, a little stream in which I later enjoyed a wash. My billet was a specially good one, by far the best I have seen. In the afternoon Leo came along &amp; stayed yarning for a while, &amp; later Oscar Gosling of S.H.S. &amp; the H.A.C. &amp; now with A.S.C. came along. Took things very quietly during the afternoon. To turn into a good bed with snowy sheets was indeed a treat.</p>
