Mametz
Word arrived that we are to move up tomorrow and this morning will shift to Becourt Camp The snow still lying thick on the ground but the thaw has commenced to make everything slushy. George Norman experimenting with a bomb thrower, had an accident and will probably lose 2 fingers. General Howe was there at the time. Left Mametz Camp in search of 6th Ambulance dentist at 9.30 and walked through the wood noting many graves both German and our own. On arrival at Fricourt Camp found that the Ambulance had gone on trek and the whole place was deserted. The 5th Brigade were shifting out of the adjoining camp. Pushed on down to Becourt and saw Colman and then with Archer arranged the billeting. McLennan was there with his machine guns and had just last night returned from the front line where things were not too good, the 4th Divn being pushed back with losses and tanks proving very slow.
