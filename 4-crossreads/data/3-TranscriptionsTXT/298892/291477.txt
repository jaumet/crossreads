 Tuesday C Company Reinforcement *(to the) 19th., Casula. 
 Dearest Mother/. I received your letter of the 11th. Instant to-day. We are quite settled down at Casula now and I like the place very much. We are all buckling down to work in a more businesslike manner too as we are supposed to have got over our first awkwardness. A number of our Officers have been changed and the new men are making us put more vim into our work. I like our lieutenant very much and the Captain is also a real good sort. The Y.M.C.A. tent has not been erected yet so I am constrained to write in pencil.
