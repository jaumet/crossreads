  
 5th September:- Tuesday My birthday and enjoy the advanced age of 23 to-day.  The pouring rain has cleared, but very dull & signs of plenty more. Take a brisk walk to work. Drizzling rain at lunch time & having brought no greatcoats get slightly wet. Cold wind & rain all the afternoon. At 5.30 pm a rush home & hurrying round buying some things to drink etc., & as we have a little party of Legge, Pal Madame, Madamoiselle & I & it's the prettiest little arrangement one could imagine. Madame has done the whole business thoroughly & we three (the old Irish Contigent) enjoy the most pleasant evening for a long while. After a most enjoyable dinner & talk to the tune of some grand old port wine we adjourn to our room, leaving the ladies    & have a great talk
