 17/7/18 London &ndash; Edinburgh Caught the 10 a.m. express from Kings Cross taxi-ing there and got a corner seat. A long day travelling and did not reach Edinburgh until &frac14; to 8 pm. The country all the way was looking much more heavily cultivated than I have ever seen it before. All along the line are fields of vegetables. Harvesting is in progress. The country is looking very well. England's distinctive feature compared with France seems to be its many trim hedges and its luxuriant irregular woods. Durham seen from the train seems a oldfashioned medieval looking city. From Berwick on good sea views. Reached Waverly [Waverley] station Edinburgh at &frac14; to 8 and took a cab out to 27 Abercromby Place where Mrs Craig and Sheila received me and after dinner we had a great yarn.
