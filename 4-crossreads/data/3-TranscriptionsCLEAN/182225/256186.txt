 JAN.   MONDAY 31   1916 
 Fine & hot. Had physical drill before breakfast & Lieut Rorke took us for Morse signaling after breakfast. Paid in afternoon so did no drill. Got the 20 past 4 train & got to Lisheen early. Linda & Self out on tennis court after tea, had a long talk over things & promised ourselves another before I left. Late leave was cut down to 4 per subsection so did not get late leave
