After I had the field dressing put on I hurried around the aid post, which was near our first position over the Somme.<br/>As they they were attacking again, by this time the prisoners were comming  back in groups, in making my way round to the aid post I kept close to the hill, I heard a large shell pass over my head which made me drop down, this shell landed in the middle of a group of german prisoners about forty in all, it could not have been a better shot, they were only about thirty yards away, it got about fifteen of them I was told later.<br/>When I reached the aid post I thought of waiting for a car, but when another shell landed close bye I decided to make my way out on foot, as quick as possible. There was a string of prisoners going out some carrying wounded. I arrived safely at the Field Ambulance, 10th if I remember correctly, then was taken by motor lorry to another field ambulance. At the first place I had an injection of serum against tetanus, it was in the arm, did not hurt much.</p>
