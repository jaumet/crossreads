20/6/19 London
as we had a steady driving rain and low black clouds which made the thronged streets look like pitch. Back to Piccadilly and round Charing Cross doing some shopping. After dinner went in to town again and first of all to Covent Garden and then to Drury Lane. Saw Robert Lorraine as "Cyrano de Bergerac" a one-man show rather touching. The rain had kept a lot of people away and you could not call the house good by any means. Lorraine has a peculiar way of bowing when he takes the curtain. There were few people round Piccadilly and the Strand owing to the rain. There is something charming about the quiet old churches one runs up against sandwiched among the modern buildings. A good view from the Thames enbankment of London under rainy skies.
