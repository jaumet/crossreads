  
 July, 1915 Sunday 4 Thank all for letters & papers. Here we are in July & still living in hope - Heard that the 2nd LH & 6th L.H. had a big fight last night, wounded still coming in, all happy - Dalgetys letter re Dungalean clips just received good prices good report up to 13 1/2 you see I can't get away from the sheep - Here one sees only mixed lots of fat tails Persians  & Xbred goats. The milk supply is delivered on its own legs & warm & fresh from the cow & calf driven to your door & milked in the street, but one had better  not  drink milk in Egypt - Camels is strong -
