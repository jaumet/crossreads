France 22nd Oct.
My Dear Mother. Your Letter that you sent to Mrs. Horton reached me Safely, also a couple of others, that were posted in July. The home mails have been arriving a little better Lately than they were some time ago. I have given Bet most of the news that I can think of, but decided to send you a line as well. When I last heard of Jack Howell he was well, but since his unit went into the line I have not had a chance of finding out how he was. I was in camp for a couple of weeks with Jim Elder, when he last heard from Eric.  E. was well, and had a job in camp in Blighty, I expect that he is still over there France will soon be in her winter garb and truly I think that it will suit her best at this particular time, for nearly every french person one sees, is in mourning now, and out on the front there could be no scene more desolate. Broken forests just the bare trunks of trees standing
