<p>13 April 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>Revielle at 5.30<br/>Light horse are now at the bayonets for all they know &amp; reinforcements are up to their eyes in work in the morning I had to go into Cairo first to the Garage &amp; then to the Base Records arriving back at 12.30 for lunch. Chas Cox &amp; myself pull our machines to bits &amp; Charlie's is in an awful state. I got the long looked for photo yesterday from Nell &amp; it's a beaut. Nothing could have pleased me better. The MP make a raid on Heliopolis &amp; capture about 60 Inf who missed their regiments when they embarked. Our reinforcements arrive &amp; are of no class as usual. Today has been very warm &amp; oppressive &amp; next week we are to get helmets. Mick has fractured his shoulder. Men down with dysentery. Bed 10.5</p>
<p>14 April 1915<br/>Wednesday 35 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Revielle at 5.30<br/>Signalling for &frac12; hour previous to stables then I was sent over to [indecipherable] for attestation papers of new men they were in at the Base so whilst there I meet Joe G out again at lunch &amp; then am again sent in with C. Cox we held the long awaited race &amp; I won both heats. Charlie broke 4 tapid rods laid off for repairs for the time being we left the gigger at Cairo &amp; he came home on my scrap. The first fruits of the Regimental funds came to light haversacks [indecipherable] etc. J. Wills has added to our menagerie by purchasing a white rat. The 3rd Brigade &amp; 4th Reg are to shift camp over to here from Mena so goodbye us leaving this hole for some time yet. [indecipherable] has his scrap down at last. Bed 10.30.</p>
