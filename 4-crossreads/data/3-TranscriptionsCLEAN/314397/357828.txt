  
 think. Would be doing the French a good turn, 'cos then they might be able to make a decent town of the place. As it is now, it is only a filthy hovel. 
 Thursday 3.10.18. Same old routine. 8am Brekker & then wait till 9.30 for roll call & then down here to the club. Read, have a shave & then at 11am have a cup of Coffee. Wait here till 12.30 when we go back for lunch. Its a pity to go back too 'cos the meals are very poor. After lunch we come back here to the club. Do nothing till 4pm when we have tea & then carry on doing nothing till 6.05 when we go back for dinner. After dinner we go for a stroll & then go back to bed. Bill Cowper came along today. Brought a letter from the hospital. Went to the pictures & they were rotten. 
 Friday. 4.10.18 Club all the morning. Went to Paris Plage in the afternoon & we all had a game of tennis. Im very poor at it now tho. Nothing startling in the evening.
