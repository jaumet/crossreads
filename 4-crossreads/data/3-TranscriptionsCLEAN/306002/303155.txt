20.5.15Thurs. 20th.  Left the 2nd L.H. trenches early this morning & made a very comfortable dug-out on the eastern hill which took up all the morning.  I believe the New Zealanders captured a line of Turkish trenches yesterday afternoon;  shortly after dinner Smithers, I & some others went to the beach & had a very enjoyable dip in the sea.  A little before sundown, we were having tea & hearing cheering & as all firing had ceased, we looked out to see the cause, & found the Turkish trenches lined with unarmed men & white flags flying.  Apparently a parley is going on between our officers & theirs, & the Turks are busy getting their dead & wounded away, also rifles;  I believe they asked for 3 hours Armistace to collect their dead & wounded, we conceded 1/2 an hour & as soon as the half hour was up they rushed Quinns Post & got a very warm reception.  Hailstone (B Troop) wounded.
