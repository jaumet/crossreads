<p>Saturday September 1st<br/>Done guard from 8 till 9 am, so we only done five hrs guard <strike>at</strike> in twenty four. Dismounted guard at 9 am. Very windy &amp; wet again. Went down to Portland this afternoon. It was very quiet down there though. Nearly killed me walking up the hill home.</p>
<p>Sunday Sept 2nd<br/>Went to church in the Gym, was lucky enough to get an arm chair (supplied by the Australian Red Cross) &amp; slept nearly all through the service, a thing I have never been guilty in my <strike>life</strike> advanced life before. Went to Portland &amp; back via Easton this afternoon, both places are very quiet. A very fine day.</p>
<p>Monday Sept 3rd<br/>A lovely day. They are the biggest messers about I have ever seen, in this camp. Two muster parades were held today what for goodness only know. It is a dreadfully camp. Colonel Spencer-Brown (the C.O.) inspected the camp this afternoon. There are about 2500 here, but a lot of those are B1B &amp; B1a class. Boat rolls are the topical conversation in camp.</p>
