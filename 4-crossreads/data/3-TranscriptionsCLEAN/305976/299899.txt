  
 In evening had walk round Native Quarters & took tram ride to Rod El Faraq situated on banks of River Nile. We hired Felucca & sailed over to where there was a very large Melon patch. Sunset on the Nile sets one dreaming of Ausy. Monday Aug 6 Back to our old friends the Camels. Riding, Grooming Feeding etc. Wrote mail evening. Tuesday August 7                                       Went into Cairo. Saw Egyptian Wedding. All concerned seemed wildly excited over the event & dressed in Gaudy clothing, Might add that higher class Egyptian is entirely Westernised in his mode of  address  dress. My remarks
