gentleman who showed me the way to it. He was a garrulous bird very courteous in his manner but I had to be guarded with him for this place teems with spies.

The Battalion is for a new stunt tonight, having to lie in camp during the next three nights, resting on our arms so to speak. Each man has 100 rounds of ball ammunition, and orders to be ready to march off at a moments notice. An old precaution against a "rising" I believe. I hope something happens to make it worth while for there will be no excursions during the next three. It is my idea that these coons will never kick against the british rule, they know when they are well off, and have never seen such prosperity as they are enjoying now.
