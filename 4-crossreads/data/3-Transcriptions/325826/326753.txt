<p>Pension Wales&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recd 15.5.16<br/>Cairo<br/>April 7th. 1916.<br/>You dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>What a wicked wretched person I was in my last letter to make a fuss about the lot of letter-writing I find I have to do, I, with all the time I have at disposal for such things.  I have just received two lovely letters from each of you, hence my illumination and this outburst!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father darling were you in Egypt or where when you headed one of them "5th May"?  Anyhow I judged it to be meant for March, and the other one of 6th March bore out my judgment.  Yours Mother darling were of the 5th &amp; 6th of March also.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fortnight to the day when I received the last Australian mail and when you look at the date of my writing you will agree with me that they have come pretty quickly this time.<br/>Dear me I was glad of them, I just soaked in them as long as they lasted and I still feel the glow caused by the soaking.  There seemed to be quite a lot of news too in various ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It must be very disappointing to Lawry this attack of rheumatic gout or rather the upsetting changes that it brings with it.  I can understand that the cold climate would be bad for it though it seemed to suit Lawry's health wonderfully, I never saw him look so well as since he went there to live.  As for not suiting Elsie's health, that seems funny for she has got quite stout since she went to live there, she put on a stone and a half I remember her saying.  However perhaps plumpness isn't always a real sign of health.  Lawry seems doomed to never get a chance to settle down.  I am wondering if he will try again his chances of enlistment.</p>
