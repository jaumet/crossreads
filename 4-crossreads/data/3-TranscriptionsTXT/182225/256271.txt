1916   FRIDAY 2   JUNE
A beautiful calm warm day. The first decent day we have had, I was on bosuns fatigue ie swabbing decks, but Bill Hunter & Self were not wanted so we lay in sun all day  We are due at Durban tomorrow & there is great speculation as to our Chances of getting ashore. Had a life belt parade in afternoon. Our brigade were ready in about 8 minutes but I got up in 1 minute & I bet I halve that if a torpedo hits us. Went to bed full of expectations as to our landing at Durban
