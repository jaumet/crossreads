<p>22nd November (Wednesday)</p>
<p>All our unit on fatigue work.  Fine air sights.  3 planes brought down, two at least being Germans.  It was a grand bit of sport.  One Plane came down headlong &amp; the other rolling over &amp; over sideways.  15th Fld. Amb. relieved the 14th in the trenches.  The 14th didn't like the idea of carrying Grenadier Guards out as patients because of their great physique.  Fierce bombardment and machine gunning till after midnight.</p>
