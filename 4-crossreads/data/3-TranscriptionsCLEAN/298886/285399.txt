  
 Lamp practice tonight from 6.30 to 8.pm.Plenty of practice is required yet. although the majority of messages went through rapidly and accurately. I go to town tomorrow to pay another visit to the dentist. I shall be glad in a/way when the job is finished although as things are it furnishes me with an excellent excuse. "Pharoah" my horse was very lively and headstrong this morning although I took him for a long ride and I also went on a much longer ride yesterday. He improves with hard work I think. Much better to have a horse with some life in him than to be mounted on some wooden horse where one is continually "legging" them up. So "Pharaoh" and I get on remarkably well in that respect. Wilson had him for months before I got him but he was always bolting with him and he never seemed to be capable of holding him. I have no trouble We now have our  own  canteen which is opened in our own Camp the nearest one before was at Wardan Station, and quite 10 minutes walk through the soft sand. Sgt Bruce paid us a visit from Heliopolis he went back this morning also Sgt McLennon from Alexandria he also went back.
