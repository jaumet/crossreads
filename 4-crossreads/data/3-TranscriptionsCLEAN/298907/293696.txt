been ringing you up on the phone & they want you to go to Snow Hill telephone by 2.30, now this sounded fishy to me for I thought that either McGuire or the nurses were getting a joke up on me, for there has been a lot of this flying about of late & I jumped to the conclusion that they were trying to get even with me.   So I laughed & said yes I'll go nurse bet your life, of course I never went near the place went skating instead & we had a glorious afternoon made the pace that hot that the 6 of us nearly got warned off the rink for reckless skating, we were joining hands & racing round at a tremendous pace, put the wind up a lot of them to see the mad Australians trying to break their neck or someone elses
