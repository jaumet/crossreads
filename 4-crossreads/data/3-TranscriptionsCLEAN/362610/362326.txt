  
 Thursday 20 April 1916 Very heavy rain was falling at & before reveille, followed by a glorious burst of sunshine which put quite a fresh heart into one. Unfortunately it was merely a break & at 8.30 when we marched out to the Training Ground the sky was quite obscured & a little later the showers again commenced. During the morning was at a bombing class, followed by machine gun work. The afternoon was fine & was spent in company work followed by a short walk on the beach with Prescott; after tea practised bomb throwing with stones as long as the light lasted. More N.Z. artillery going up N during the day. The height of the Spring tide was very noticeable.
