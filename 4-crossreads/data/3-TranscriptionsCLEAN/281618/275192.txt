16th Steaming N.W. Many sick aboard mostly suffering from "low proli" - a funny complaint; they get very weak, suffer from pains in the head, particularly about the eyes & often collapse. In the latter case they go the Hospital trip up three ladders feet first to return looking as if they wished they didn't. Some of them can do nothing but hang on to their heads as tho afraid of losing them.To add to their tribulation, we are under orders to go nowhere in the ship without a life belt. This applies to all on the ship. We must parade with our belts, drill with them, take them to the mess table & the shower bath , and finally use them as a pillow at night. There's one ship in this squadron that annoys us. She ought to get the knock. Every couple of hours she gets up a big pressure in her boilers & not being allowed to get ahead, she runs rings round the other ships and does snaky turns in & out of the line. Occasionally she lags behind for the pleasure of catching up again  passing round the head of the lines & falling astern on the opposite side. The exhibition of so much pace naturally gets on our goat, & then we dont like to see the flying fish disturbed so much.
