<p>March 1917<br/>29th.   Only fifteen of the section arrived yesterday, (the remainder are at <strike>Vaylule</strike>Velu about 4 <strike>miles</strike> Kilometres further on, and at MillerSon) &amp; seven of us went on with Cpl Moore to clean &amp; make ready for use old wells the advance party have found in Velu.   I stopped behind &amp; fixed up the cellar, &amp; also with a couple of sappers, hunted around the village, salvaging material for use by the section in our work.   The village is in a dilapidated state &amp; every house is in a mass of ruins.   Every well has been destroyed &amp; the fruit trees &amp; many ornamental trees have been cut down by the Germans.<br/>During the afternoon the Flying Corps brought up an observation baloon which is to be stationed in a paddock opposite us.</p>
