<p>February 22<br/>181.<br/>Dull, and fine faltering rain, cold and a little wind.</p>
<p>Mail brings Ralph Hodgson's "The Last Blackbird" and "The Bull", a Flying Flame Chapbooks.  If "The Down by Moonlight" were the only poem of "The Last Blackbird" it would be worth every penny of 4/6, it suggests it is almost the inspiration piece of his "Song of Honour".</p>
<p>Also Christmas "Land and Water" &ndash; W &amp; N sketch book &ndash; a most abominable specimen, and six Venus Pencils from Mrs. H. for which Dear Mrs. H. a million thanks.  Now I'll be able to try hard a lining of Lyttle's fascinating face.</p>
<p>Basil and self were last night yarning of the fascination of faces.  I asked him to name two of the unit who still lacking perfect features, held in their expression and manner a beauty lacking in the remainder.  Almost pat came his reply, "Well Lyttle certainly! &ndash; and Macdonald!"</p>
<p>Letter from Gerald:  in Blighty Act. Adjt. at some Aerodrome.</p>
<p>February 22, 23<br/>Loaned Clarrie's "Guy &amp; Pauline" &ndash; half read, but reading Maarten Maarten's "The Price of Lis Doris".</p>
<p>February 23<br/>182.<br/>From early last night till just before dawn heavy gun fire beating &ndash; and a fire that ended in a terrible roll.</p>
<p>In the evening's mist with Basil to Bailleul:  the great square beautiful with its fantastick tower lording its grey openness.  To quarter moonlight its loveliness would be full.</p>
<p>Spent there about 10 F. in Magazines for Rec. Hut &ndash; from "Gheitz" money &ndash; and B. sends this morning the remainder &ndash; about &pound;1.10.0 to London for Musick.</p>
<p>183.<br/>Now thanks to a slack morning, I've written to Mrs. H., Aunt Louie and to the Poetry Bookshop.</p>
<p>184.<br/>In "Aussie" No. 2 &ndash; the first published drawing of Frank Dunne &ndash; a caricature of Sapper Smedley of "The Sentimental Bloke".</p>
<p>Drawings Frank shewed me yesterday are evidence of the enthusiasm he's put into his work, but he fits well in cartooning.</p>
