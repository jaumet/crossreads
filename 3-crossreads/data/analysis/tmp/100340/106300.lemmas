I suppos you are spoil it too . Oh no , of cours you would n't , neither would Vol . But as you say , I onli hope it wo n't be long befor I will be back again but still it doe n't look too much like it yet . I will be reclassifi this week will then be sent back to Franc or put on a job here in England , all depend on what the quack say . I veri near went west the first coupl of day after my oper but I am real well again
