<p>Thursday 26 April 1917</p>
<p>SHEIKH-NURAN</p>
<p>Marched at 3 A.M. as enemy threatened our Flanks, did not require a Blanket last night &amp; the dew is not so heavy. Water is still our trouble. I have not washed for 2 days &amp; never had clothes off since this scrap started. Guns always firing from 60 Howitzers &amp; 18 po. Field guns. Horses are still very fit I am glad to say.</p>
<p>[The following sentence crossed through.]  Received letter from Laura April 2nd. All's well, but England is really awakening to the fact that a war is on &amp; I was disgusted with a lot I saw at home.</p>
<p>I have no INK for Fountain Pen so forgive pencil but don't send any INK I could not carry &amp; must wait.</p>
