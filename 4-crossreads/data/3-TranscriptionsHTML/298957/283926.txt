<p>in old buildings last night. More dug-out- digging today. We are now temporarily attached to the 1st. Division (Aust.). For some time there has been some doubt as to where we will eventually go. We have been with the 10th Indians for a time. Other Australians wanted us as we are yet unattached <u>definitely</u> to any particular division. It is thought that we are to be part of a new division consisting of the 4th &amp; 9th Brigades and a new brigade composed of reinforcements from round Cairo. If so we shall most likely be going to France first. Turks</p>
