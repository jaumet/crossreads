<p>12-8-19<br/>All day in bed waited on hand &amp; foot by Brise who is making a slave of herself for me, nothing is too much no journey is too long. Food is her greatest worry what will please me most &amp; in these day there are big food troubles</p>
<p>First the consumers refuse to buy then the suppliers refuse to supply Often she has long walks to get anything &amp; all the while humping the big load she has already bought. She has a heart of gold, &amp; that refined.</p>
<p>13-8-19<br/>Still in bed but making great strides towards recovery. Still the same patient &amp; careful attention. Was ever man so carefully &amp; thoughtfully tended I wonder A cousin arrives &amp; stays the night</p>
<p>14-8-19<br/>Recovery is rapid. I do not put foot to ground. Breakfast is shared on the bed with me. Now I change rooms at night for the two girls. Tomorrow is Brises fete &amp; she is the recipient of many flowers &amp; letters &amp; a Salome by Wilde.</p>
<p>15-8-19<br/>Fete de l'Assomption &ndash; a great day &amp; once Napoleons day but now used by worn out city people to take a holiday into the country &amp; owing to the rush the papers wisely comment that those who stay in the city show best sense for the struggle to get away is too much.</p>
<p>Save for Church services</p>
