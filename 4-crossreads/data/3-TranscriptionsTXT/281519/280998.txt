 Needle Tr: 23/12/16  In the dark they commenced to arrive and we fed them in through the mud and water. Nearly all new men there were very few who had ever been in trenches before. A quiet night. Fatigue parties passed with material for higher up and we sent some from here. Saw Forbes &ndash; he has never been any further forward than here but has sent Duggan on ahead. This is a large deep German dugout &ndash; unfortunately dripping water tonight and is crowded with batmen, sigs and A.M.C. All the officers turned in and stood by the 'phone for the first part of the night &ndash; a very long and cold evening. Only the sound of heavy breathing is heard &ndash; flickering candles gutter on the walls. From outside comes a low muffle of guns. All of us are filthy I am mud up to the waist and wear a cap &ndash; balaclava like. Alf the Sea Lion. Filthy but happy. We eat army biscuit and pork and beans. Turned in beside Dooley after midnight and slept soundly
