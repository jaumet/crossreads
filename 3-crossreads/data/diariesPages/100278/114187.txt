well into their feet, this whale oil is a very fine thing, though it is inclined to make your feet soft for marching, by this you can see the Sergeants have no easy time while in the trenches for this is only one of the things we have to look to.

5th The frosty weather broke last night and a little shower of rain fell but this morning when we marched out she looked alright, instead of physical jerks they introduced the football instead and the whole mob got onto it and I can tell you we had some fun. After this we had some Coy drill and then extended order work. About 10.45 a heavy shower of rain came on and we marched home, among this shower there was mixed a lot of snow and wasn't it cold.
