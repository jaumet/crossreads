<p>This is a fearfully wet place we are in. All low lying country with canals &amp; moats every hundred yards or so. Not nearly so interesting as France, although it is just across the Border. The French people seem better agriculturalists and their country is as pretty as a picture. Our fortnight out of the line was put in at a little place called Lumbres, just near St Omer.</p>
<p>I managed to get into a fine chateau just by chance, together with Capt Percy Ross from Qld who commands the 41st Battery of our Brigade. The Family who lived there, named Canoune, were most kind, and made us awfully comfortable. We had plenty of tennis &amp; croquet &amp; I am afraid were very loth to leave when our time was up. I have sent Mary a snap taken there which no doubt she will be showing you. It is a wonderful relief to get among some decent society again.</p>
<p>There is not much local news. The General is going strong. Rabett &amp; King are also well. <strike>Their</strike> None of the other</p>
