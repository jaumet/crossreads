Nothing doing no BLIGHT or wound.
I write this going on covering party for Royal Engineers who are using Gun Cotton & doing great destruction to Bridges culverts Railway Stations etc. 30 miles from our Camp. We rode all night my Squadron in the advance. The enemy had evacuated but many Bedouins here. Much Wheat burnt by us. Now 9 a.m. We leave in a few hours time for Camp again & expect some opposition from Beersheba.
The Power that rules these things gave us a cloudy day so enemy planes have not yet discovered us. Country stonier down here & better water. Germans had built a Mosque etc. etc. to gain Kudos here among Bedouins.
