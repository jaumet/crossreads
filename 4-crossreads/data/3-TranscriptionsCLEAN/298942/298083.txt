  
 its steeple missing.  Another familiar and pleasant landmark gone! 
 As we went out on the case last night there were flares & gun-flashes everywhere, & all noise, so that it was one continuous noisy firework display.  Many flares & gun reports over the direction of Kemmel, told of heavy fighting there.  It is impossible to say who holds Kemmel.  The latest paper reports say Fritz does, but countless rumours & definite statements by French & English soldiers say we have counter attacked & driven him out.  I hope so
