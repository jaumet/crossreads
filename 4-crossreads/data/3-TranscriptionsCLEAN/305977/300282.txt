November 1915Turkish position in one night.  Several times we heard the Turks yell when one got home.  On Thursday night the Queenslanders (5 LH) advanced their line on the extreme right & met with some opposition from the Turks.  Things were fairly lively for a couple of hours, bombs mostly being used.  The Turks must have had a good few casualties the 5th had 3 killed & 12 wounded.  The Turks gave us a bit of a shelling on Friday & at night time we proceeded to make it hot for the Turks  Several were blown to pieces with bombs.  Our artillery howitzers & field guns also took a hand.  On Saturday morning the 5th LH had a good line of trench & barbed wire out.  Saturday night bombs were used principally & the destroyer also shelled the enemy's trenches  Sunday morning both our guns & the enemy's opened up, but most of the Turks shells fell short.  Some were indeed much closer
