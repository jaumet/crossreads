men to a Tent. This Camp is situated right on Top of a Hill is well laid out. The Tents are all let into the Ground down about 18 inches the Earth is banked up around the sides the Tents are raised up the sides are secured on the Bank by Pegs, so when one is laying on the Boarded Floor there is about 3 ft of earth all around, of course this is done for the purpose of protection from Bomb's, as only a direct Hit would do any harm to one sleeping inside. There are about 4 rows of these Tents. After placing our Kit in the Tents we all went along to the Dining Room for our Dinner, each man receiving two Plates a Pannikan, went inside in single file to a counter was served with some Roast Beef Potatoes also Rice Raisins some Tea which I enjoyed. I passed the remainder of the Evening strolling around the Camp in the Canteen. Before turning in all hands received one Blanket, all hands turned in at 10 Pm. Reveille was sounded at 6 am after returning our Blanket we had to march again in Single File for Breakfast which consisted of Porridge one slice of Bread Butter and an Egg, which all hands enjoyed at 8 am the Boys were paraded at 8.15 am marched off for the Boat arriving there at 8.45 when we were given two Scones each then in Single File on to the Boat,
