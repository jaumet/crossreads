  
 January 1918 Sunday 13 At Beutin Gun [Gunn?] returned, back at stables. Marched to Church Parade. Divisional sports decided at Longvillers Battery one Tug-o-War, Broad Jumps, 400 yard championships , and Corbett was beaten by an inch in the Sheffield. The weathr throughout was rotten, - raining hard, and making everything sloppy.  Received a letter from smith who is in Paris. He seems to be having a pretty decent time.
