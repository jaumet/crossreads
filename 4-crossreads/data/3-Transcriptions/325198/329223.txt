<p>23 January, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>We had a nice comfortable sleep inside the tent last night, most of the boys were on pickquet that was why I slept in the tent. I think I will sleep in side tonight also as it looks like rain.  The chaps came in &amp; woke us up half an hour early this morning &amp; the language in the tent was vile for a while.  Went on Church parade this morning &amp; this afternoon went up to see a couple of [troubs?] at the Remount Depot - coming back I met 'perkie' he is in the 7th Reg.  I got yarning to him &amp; as a result was late for stables &amp; got a burst about it from Bill &ndash; I found that while I was away my mare had got caught in a chain &amp; had hurt her leg &ndash; I am sorry about it &amp; hope she soon gets right.  Weston was out to see us to day &amp; Doug Kenyon arrived back from Malta &ndash; he looks well on it. Weston brought some things out with him so to night we had cake, chocolate, peaches &amp; oysters, a fine mixture but its wonderful what a chap can stand.</p>
