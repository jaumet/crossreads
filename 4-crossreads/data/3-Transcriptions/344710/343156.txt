<p>5.12.17<br/>Had a small party last night.  Two rum jars of beer from the canteen two or three miles back.  And very nice too!</p>
<p>6.12.17<br/>Hooray!  Two letters from home.  Sept. 28th and October 1st.  And all you people well, thank God!  It's a good day, and getting letters makes it better.<br/>Got the 'oil' that our guns are to put up a stunt tomorrow some time.  Having a go at his 'Minnie Positions'.  Claude Farmer told me, &amp; he should know.</p>
<p>7.12.17<br/>Well:  the stunt didn't come off, for some reason.  On the other hand the gentle Hun put over a very big shell or two quite close to us, at Lunch Time.  That's unusual for him.  I hope its not going to be a habit.<br/>Our crowd go in again tonight Late.  More and more guns are being put in on the ridge.  They are arriving every night, but few of them ever fire a shot.</p>
