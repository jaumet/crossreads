<p>[Postcard of a cartoon of three kittens in and on a kit bag with a sticker on the bag saying "To Blighty".  One of the kittens has a ribbon in the red, white and blue of the French flag.  Alongside is the first line of that lovely old WW1 song:]<br/>Pack up your troubles in your Old Kit Bag and<br/>Smile! Smile! Smile!</p>
