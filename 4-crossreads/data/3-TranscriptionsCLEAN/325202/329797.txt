  
 It was read out on Parade tonight that all leave to England is stopped One knows absolutely nothing but there is a feeling of anticipation that we are on the eve of the biggest British effort yet attempted. Things have been too quiet this last month 
 But the artillery has been increasingly active these last few days. Last night was the heaviest bombardment I have heard on our immediate front I was on horse picket from 10 pm till 2 a.m and the roar of the guns big & little never ceased for a minute while their flashes lit up the sky like an aurora
