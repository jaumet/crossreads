<p>After passing "Cassel" the road led down the hill on to the level ground &amp; here we passed some beautiful mansions set back from the road in a patch of green trees, &amp; round all of them there were beautiful lawns &amp; fountains playing, &amp; most of them had a fine stream of clear water running past the lawn &amp; over &amp; along these little streams of water hung lovely spreading trees some thing like what we read about on the South American rivers, I think &amp; with the exception of the South of France this was the finest part of France that I have so far seen.<br/>The Germans had been for a short while round this part for I saw the marks of their shrapnel in several places, notably on the gasometer.</p>
