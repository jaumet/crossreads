<p>Cairo 31st G.H., 5/9/18<br/>And what a changed place from the hosp. where I began my military nursing, very little work on n. duty but long tedious night &amp; noisy days with Gippos shouting all day long at their work in the kitchens.<br/>Paid Pt. 90 each for 2 night gowns &ndash; pretty but not very good material &ndash; still, what would you have in a country where one pays Pt. 10 or more for unbleached calico!</p>
