  
 Getting through this stunt, we are expecting to go out of the line again for a few weeks which will be very pleasant at this time of the year, weather warming up nicely & no rain for the last fortnight. 
 Will drop a line again later when opportunity presents itself. Meantime with all hopes for your's and the dear Mother's health & with love 
 I am your [affestace?] Son Terence
