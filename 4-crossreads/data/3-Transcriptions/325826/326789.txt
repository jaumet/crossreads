<p>being nearly so soon.  Sorry you have had to put in so much time visiting Dr Forsyth, it is most uninteresting, uncomfortable, unremunerative, and a few other "uns."  And I was so surprised to hear that you have had still more rain.  Why, we haven't had any over here since that first week up at Sassafras, and I believe that was during the first few days.  I am eager to see the garden again &amp; see what it promises to show Wal, but I know you will be looking after it most carefully and almost anxiously.  Isn't it too wonderful to think of him being home in a few weeks!  My but I'll squeeze you when I get home to let you know how I feel about it &amp; then you can show me what you think of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Mum she must have had a big wash after the visitors, I am glad you both liked Miss Morrissey, I was wondering if she would be as nice as Harry had said.  W Lelean of course always has been very nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was glad of the copy of Wal's letter of 13th Dec. that was so delayed by piling up to Sassafras &amp; back here.  So his arm is broken!  How mysterious it all is.<br/>Hope you received my wire yesterday in time to save you a walk up the village, that was really why I sent it.  The money <strike>pa</strike> will do nicely on Allotment Day, only please Father, also keep out the little bit that I wanted to leave behind in the shape of Miss Butler's help.  That will be four weeks now.  <u>I really will be hurt</u> if you do not, because you know she is my innovation into the home &amp; I believe you half promised you would too.  Ask Mother to persuade you for me!<br/>Doris &amp; I had a delightful drive yesterday afternoon through the country for a couple of hours &amp; then went to the home of these people &ndash; the Frasers- for tea &amp; were joined for the evening by Mr &amp; Mrs Oakley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a nice letter from Mr Leckie yesterday &amp; am going out there to-day for the afternoon.<br/>Saturday we spent the afternoon &amp; evening at the brother Harold's.<br/>Very much love to you all,  Lovingly Your daughter<br/>Olive.</p>
