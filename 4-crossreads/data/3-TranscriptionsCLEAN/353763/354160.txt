  
 I got notified of my appointment as a Naval Surgeon from Aug 22 by the Naval Board at Melbourne - temporary service - 6 mo certain  -  You know this game suits me splendidly  -  I am absolutely at home in it & the whole lot of us officers get on splendidly together  -  Not a single cross word have I heard on the rotten old sink of a ship called the  'Upolu'  since we left Sydney   -  That's something I often think how Rawdon wd  -  love to see all this - our diver - our motor launches - our jolly men   -  the natives & their funny hair selling coco nuts  -  I got a Betel nut for R from one to day  -  I'm off the the shore - 2nd trip  - 
 I've returned - not much to be seen of men save pickets  -  I walked about & noted the Bird life & was pleased to see the black and white Fantail - our old familiar  -  Also a Kingfisher  -  Bird life in the harbor does not exist - not a gull or tern  -  Birdless  -  Its dry - very dry - no springs nor water supply - tanker only -  We are on an allowance per diem - 2 gallons for everything  -  Trees have been planted along the avenues - Casuarina avenue - Poinciana avenue I've christened them  -  A white Cedar - Mangos - Hibiscus - Croton - a Polypodium fern - a composite new to me was very common  -  Papaws do well & I saw an Orange tree  -  No gardens anywhere as we understand the word garden  -  No [indecipherable] beds  -  Shrubs like Bougainvilleas
