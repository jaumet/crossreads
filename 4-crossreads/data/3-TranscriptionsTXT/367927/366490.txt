19-8-72Now please forgive my silence &ndash; I have had this flu wog for the last 6 weeks and I can assure you I have been in no humour for writing to anyone. I am going to make a suggestion &ndash; my son lives in Petersham and in a week or so I should be well enough to go down. Would you come across or down from Lindfield and we could talk the matter over &amp; this letter could go on &amp; on and then we might miss something. Drop me a line as to what weekend would suit you. I would come down in the Friday afternoon train and return on the Sunday night &ndash; 7.10pm.Trusting this would suit youYours SincerelyAlan Armitage40 King StMBrook2333
