3/2/19 Gourdinne
Again cold. Inspected the Transport at 11 a.m. and found them good on the whole though their morale has altered since armistice. At work on the history again and using plenty of paper in its typing. Afternoon walked down to Thy le Chateau ? a dull dirty village this cursed by ugly factories. Snow covered and bleak. Received a preface tonight from General Birdwood for our book and Gorman got his Captcy. Had a talk with Fernande at the Brewery and he is full of what he did on a recent shooting hunt after wild boar. Plenty of money and food - he leads an idle life. Evening a good deal of writing and again historical work. Joy and singing in estaminets rum issue and balance of pay.
