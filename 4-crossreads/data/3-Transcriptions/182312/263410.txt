<p>though they would capsize, and then off they go in another direction</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must have had nearly 1000 men on guard duties on the ship.</p>
<p>It was estimated that with every porthole closed, the quantity of</p>
<p>air thus imprisoned in the vessel would have the effect of keeping h</p>
<p>her afloat half an hour longer than would be the case were she tor-</p>
<p>pedoed and all portholes left open.&nbsp; In consequence of this a</p>
<p>&quot;Porthole Guard&quot; was put on one man to each two portholes.&nbsp; This</p>
<p>guard was on day and night and their duty was , in the event of an</p>
<p>alarm to screw down the ports and then get on deck.&nbsp; This acted very</p>
<p>well, the whole ship was inspected at each alarm and we never found</p>
<p>a porthole left open.&nbsp; I dont know how many portholes a big passenger</p>
<p>ship like this carries on either side, but I should imagine that it</p>
<p>necessitated a guard of about 400 men.&nbsp; At each lifeboat and raft,</p>
<p>day and night were stationed three men with loaded rifles and fixed</p>
<p>bayonets.&nbsp; They were there in case of a rush on the boats and their</p>
<p>instructions were very short and to the point.&nbsp; Each Officer was com-</p>
<p>pelled to carry a loaded revolver to be freely used in the event of</p>
<p>panic.&nbsp; Guards provided with glasses were placed at numerous points</p>
<p>on the deck to watch a given sector of the ocean for periscopes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By night, not a light was allowed anywhere where it could be</p>
<p>seen from outside.&nbsp; The first night out the men were allowed to sleep</p>
<p>on the decks, but despite warnings, they would strike matches to light</p>
<p>their cigarettes, consequently they were all bundled down below and</p>
<p>never again allowed on deck after sunset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We touched in at Malta for a few hours but did not go ashore.</p>
<p>The town of Valetta is situated on the steep rocky slopes of the</p>
<p>South East corner of the Island and consists of buildings of a severe</p>
<p>square type without verandahs or balconies.&nbsp; The harbour is partly</p>
