  
 this unit, chiefly because I have felt & am quite certain that I have been deliberately pushed in the background, which is hard after 2 yrs service. Went on 2 days leave last Sunday at reveille, but to return in time meant catching 5.40 from Waterloo on Monday afternoon, so I left it till Tuesday morning & was given one day 2nd Field Punishment - quite normal & also perfectly fair. Had an evening at the theatre for my trouble.
