MAY   FRIDAY 26   1916
Very cold again & windy  I would give anything to get a bit of sun again  I have missed it more than anything. I was on parade for the first time today for a bit, but was too weak to do much. There was to be a concert in the evening given by the Queenslanders but it was too cold & wet to give it.
