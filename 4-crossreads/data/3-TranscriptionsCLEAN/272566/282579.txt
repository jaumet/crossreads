 Showery but otherwise very warm.  Successful day on the motor bike.  Fritz threw a few shells on the road near our camp.  The chief event of the day was a brilliant piece of work in the air to Fritz's credit.  A plane flew over us at about 7000 ft. high - Our guns fired at him but didn't seem to hit him.  However he pretended to be knocked and fell over & over sideways until he came very low.  Meantime we were all yelling with delight.  Suddenly the plane righted itself and made off home followed by our battleplane. The opinion has been advanced that this plane intended to dive at one of our balloons by means of the joke.
