Town decorated on a/c of celebration of some special days of giving bread to the poor. Went thro' St Joseph's R.C. Church. Very intelligent kiddie about 6 yrs old following us & explaining their customs. Number of people in church praying. Soldiers not allowed to sit down in a restaurant & not supposed to enter hotels. Both can be done if worked properly in outskirts of town. Landed back at "Ausonia" at 10 pm after spending a thoroughly enjoyable time in Valetta. 17th - Packed blankets in bundles to be sent ashore to be cleaned & sterilized. Maltese came aboard & thoroughly scrubbed & disinfected berths. Wrote in afternoon. 17th - Also posted post cards to Grandma Jeannie & Molly. All excepting 6 of corps went ashore about noon. I was one who had to remain. Left at 6pm. Had good feed Apple tart at Duke of Connaught's home for soldiers. Home is a fine building erected for use of soldiers & sailors Boyle & Pauley went their own way "Bill Adams" & I went ours. Inspected several bookshops etc. searching for ink tablets. No one seemed to have any. Eventually we found a bookseller who had two 6d each, but who could not open them. We offered him 6d for the two & after consultations 'tween him & his manager, he accepted. Guess we well get the open. Bought several maltese lace collars & crosses also pc's at 2d a dozen, good p.c's at that. Took every dealers & shopkeepers card, promising to recommend him to our friends. Had a cup of coffee
