 Tuesday 2 May 1916 A dull grey day with intermittent showers. Did not get dressed but stayed in pyjamas censoring letters, reading &amp;c. A foggy night, but I heard next morning that the instruments on Etaples hill had recorded the presence of a Zeppelin during the night. Alone &amp; with a sore foot made my first attempt to smoke a cigarette before turning over to sleep. Outward mail for Australia.
