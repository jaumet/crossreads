  
 Altered course slightly making for Pinas Bay in Columbia, just to afford the admirals the opportunity of a confabulation. Jap. R. Admiral boarded us with his staff. Very capable looking little men. Jolly good allies. One cannot help thinking that the Australian contempt has a big dash of dread in it. The admirals say goodbye. We signal message to Jap commissioned officers.    Crews  Ships companies gather on decks. Comdr. Hyde calls for 3 cheers for Japs, who reply with even heartier banzais. Push off after an hour's stop. Panama tomorrow & stop Jamaica. I am learning geography, I reckon. We are only 120 miles off. Dec 11. Land ahead 8 a.m. Yes, that's Panama & entrance to the Canal. Shall be there now in ten minutes. Hullo! What has happened. Why, we've turned round & are going back, & we are not stopping. Message has come to say we cannot go thro', owing to slip in Culebra Cut. Bitter disappointment for second time in two
