<p>sleeping along side of one another we often talk for hours of a night &amp; wonder if we will ever return to tell the tale.</p>
<p>Sunday 22.11.14. Last night it came on a very heavy shower of rain so we threw a tarpaluan over us so we were alright &amp; never got wet. This morning one of the boats broke down &amp; one of the cruisers went to her assistance this morning is much cooler &amp; also the <strike>y</strike> days are getting shorter just fancy 8 am here &amp; its dinner time at home this afternoon passed away very enjoyable to hear the band &amp;  also some Piano and Cornet playing</p>
<p>23.11.14.  This morning we sighted land on the East coast of "Africa", we could just see it in the distance I suppose its 20 miles away we have noticed an Island on the coast its very barren looking with sandy hills behind.</p>
<p>25.11.14.  We passed Aden this morning &amp; we expect to call at port "Said' which we will reach in about 7 days</p>
<p>26.11.14 we are getting close to the Red sea now while in Aden which we did not expect to see</p>
