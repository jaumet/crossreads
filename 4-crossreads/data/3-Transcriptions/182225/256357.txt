<p>Showery all day. This is a cow of a climate all right. Signaling all morning &amp; I read all the afternoon. Went up to Larkhill &amp; got my watch in evening. It had been overhauled in Edinburgh&nbsp; Also got a parcel with some of Pitts&nbsp;wedding cake in &amp; some for Pat Rutledge. Wrote some letters in evening.</p>
