 Col [Slane?] Col. Read are both desirous of forming a band for their Battalions & I feel certain they will form good bands quicker, than under the present method; & although they may not be so efficient as the present band, I am sure the moral effect will be felt throughout the four Battalions of the Brigade & will lead to keener competition 
 I trust you will let one know your decision soon & that it will be favorable to the wishes of the Battalion 
 Yours sincerely
