<p>If your son is consenting party I could induce Federal Government withdraw him from firing line &amp; give him duties elsewhere. Would he consent?</p>

<p>Would be much relieved if son employed for present on staff or similar duties, but he must decide. Would not feel justified using pressure.</p>
