 Dear Dad, Mum & George, 
 I've about a dozen letters from you all unanswered.  I have been trying to write since Saturday & now Tuesday has come round & I'm still going to write.  I played Hockey this afternoon & after a Bath, shave & general clean up for the morning it has gone 8 p.m. 
 I am only just writing to let you know that we are all well.  I will answer your letters later on.  I am enclosing a couple of P.C's that I wish you to put with my others as souvenirs of the great war.  One is from Billy Ali & one from a little Girl at the shop who sends me parcels & letters very regularly.  I have not met Her.  I am very careful how I write so do not be concerned about it.  30.1.18 
 Well, Here's another night nearly gone & I'm on Duty all alone as the Sergeants are holding a Dance in a Hall near bye.  It is nearly 9 p.m. now & I've to stay on until
