over him, he could scarcely do enough for us, we got the best of everything he had, so tonight I have a clean change of clothing, the first for a long time, & how nice it feels to be clean once more.
There is plenty of nice cool clean water here for a little creek runs quite close to us & I can tell you it is well patronized. There was sports here again to-day & the band was playing. The trains are still pouring through, all loaded with troops, guns, & the various articles connected with the Army.
