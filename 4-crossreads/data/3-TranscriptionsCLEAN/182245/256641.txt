 1917 MAY 
 6 SUNDAY 
 Fine, but cool & windy. There was 
 a church parade in morning 
 but I did not go. We had to 
 shift all our harness from 
 the stables to the harness 
 rooms & it was inspected by 
 Lieut Waller. We had a half 
 holiday in afternoon & were paid 
 in evening. We played the 
 "Pommies" soccer in evening 
 & it was a draw.
