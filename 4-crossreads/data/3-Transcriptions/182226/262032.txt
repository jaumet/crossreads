<p>Monday 10 January, 1916</p>
<p>We were cruising around all night &amp; ran into Alexandria at about 9.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Lay in the harbour all day, we are very anxious to get ashore which we won&#39;t do till tomorrow, we are lying near the entrance to the harbour &amp; have some fine scenery to look at.</p>
