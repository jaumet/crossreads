<p>June 2, 3<br/>179.<br/>A Patrol note ..</p>
<p>12th Btn.  Night of 30.5.18.  Sgt. Turner &amp; 10 O.R.  Object:  To raid enemy post located at E11. D.46, and to get identification if possible.  Report:  Enemy post was scuppered.  Three huns killed and machine gun captured.  The enemy shewed resistance, and would not surrender, so they were all killed except one man who ran away before the post was rushed.  He gave the alarm, and heavy M.G. fire was brought to bear on the party, and reinforcements were seen coming up.  Party had not sufficient time to get identification.  The M.G. was brought back to our lines.  The party reached lines without casualties.  Time, 12 midnight.  Return 2.45 a.m.  Patrol Leader, Sgt. Turner.</p>
<p>June 3<br/>180.<br/>The raid at 1 this morning a compleat success:  for the area regained &ndash; a 500 yds. depth on a small front merely to straighten out part of the line, a big bagging of prisoners and guns.  Five Officers and over 230 O.R., 40 Machine guns, a T.M. [Trench Mortar] Battery, and an Anti-Tank gun and its crew, our casualties comparatively light.</p>
<p>Today's official report of the stunt cold and even quite uninteresting.  I'd have given a pound to have heard the tales at the A.D.S.</p>
