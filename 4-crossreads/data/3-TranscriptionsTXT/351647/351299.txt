Dear Mrs. John,
Of course I've missed the mail & am dead sorry but I have been so rushed the past few days that I simply haven't been able to settle to write letters.  I simply hate having a big job on my mind & while I hate starting it, I simply can't do anything else except perhaps nothing.
Anyhow now I think I have the main things done & I'm sitting out side my office & official residence (built of ammunition boxes & roofed with sort of hessian that lets the rain through in a beautifully fine spray) watching the mules having kicking competitions.  They are brutes of things & I hate them, the row they kick up.  In fact I'm not loving things at all today.  Its one of my very bad days, the weather is being rotten, showery & windy & cold & my papers flutter & the ink pencil runs over the paper & my particular pals have just left & consequently I'm hating things.  The flies are stupid & sticky & will persist in refuging here.  But enough of troubles & worries.  I suppose we should be glad
