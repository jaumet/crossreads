 In the Afternoon we visited the Zoo. It is much prettier and cleaner than the Sydney Zoo and they have some very fine specimens of animals. Their Seal, Polar Bear and Tiger are particularly fine specimens. The two latter I snapped with indifferent success and I enclose the prints. After a hurried rush through the Zoo we took a tram ride round the Berea, and then visited the Marine Parade and the Beach. I am sending some snapshots taken there but unfortunately they cannot convey an adequate idea of its beauty. Grass terraces, beautifully green, run almost right down to the sea, and in the background overlooking the sea are fine large stone Hotels. Durban is by far the prettiest town I have yet seen. The native element lends it a degree of newness and accounts for a great deal of its interest to strangers. The Zulus are a fine body of natives. I don't know whether the Richshaw men are a picked body, but every one of them is of splendid physique. The native police too, come up to them in this respect. After leaving Durban our next Port of call was Cape Town. There again there were a number of natives, known as Cape boys, who coaled the boat. They could not compare with the Natal natives
