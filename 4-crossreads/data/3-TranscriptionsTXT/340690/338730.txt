hot and dusty and warm pace.  Arrived about 11 at Villers Bretonneux and rested while pontoons were being discovered.  Loaded up & got some tea for dinner and had to go some distance to get water.  About 20 H.V. shells fell in town and caused some disturbance amongst Tommies & our wagon bolted.  Off at about 1 and down to river at Vaire arriving about 3 and had dinner and afterwards swim, very enjoyable.  Camped in open under canvas trench tent  not too comfortable.  Bed at dark after getting mobile.  Fine & warm.
