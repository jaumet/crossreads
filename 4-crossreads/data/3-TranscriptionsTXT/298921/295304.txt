Saturday December 11 1915The Hospital Boats always look so comfortable & close, we can hear the hours being rung on the Bells while on our Beats and in comparison to our darkness on shoreThey show up brilliantly - green lights with a big Red X amidships. This morning 4 Battleships & 2 Monitors bombarded one night, with Salvoes which made the hills tremble I guess Johnny Turk must have had some casualties poor beggars but what about the Armenians - fortnight to Xmas Day!!! I note you & Day are sending Billies, which we all trust will arrive especially as we are on half rations.
