 My dearest Mother   &  Sisters, 
 I'm still here but expect to leave shortly. Sister Pilkington left Southwell Gardens last Wednesday for Australia via Panama Canal. 
 Isn't she lucky? She will call on you   &  hope you like her, I'm very fond of her, I'm very fond of her, she is very jolly. If it is convenient   &  you like her. I should be pleased if you invited her to stay a couple of days. Her mother is in the country   &  living with a married brother, so poor little Pilkie wont have a home to go to like me. 
 I'm longing to see you all   &  feel tired waiting to sail. 
 Have not had any Aussie mail since Alice's of Nov 1st 1917. Expect some this week.
