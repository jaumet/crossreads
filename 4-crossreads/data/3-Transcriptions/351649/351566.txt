<p>to England again, but perhaps the war will end.</p>
<p>So little John (Graham) says a prayer for me, does he?  That's just sweet of him, and you tell him that his Uncle Jock often says a prayer that Graham will grow up into a great big strong fellow, so big &amp; strong that the Germans will always after <strike>being</strike> be afraid to fight us again:  I shall notice a great change in him, I suppose, &amp; also in little Tom.</p>
<p>Children alter so much more in a short time than grown up people.</p>
<p>John seems to have been busy buying and selling &amp; trying to keep the ball rolling generally:  I am expecting a wire any day now in end of April saying the season has broken and all looks well for the grass to grow a bit before the hard weather in June:  its up to the seasons to remain good for another year or two still.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I've simply rambled on in this letter, Mrs John, with all the things I'm thinking about:  and I haven't been polite as I should be and inquired after your health &amp; all you've been doing.</p>
<p>But anyhow I've liked writing you this letter, and when I get up to the front in a day or so, I'll write you again, next time probably pencil writing.</p>
<p>Goodbye, best love to John, little John &amp; to you.</p>
