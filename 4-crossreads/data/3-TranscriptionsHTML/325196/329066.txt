<p>Having a good time on board here &amp; are getting into warmer weather. Had a very decent Xmas dinner for soldiers; roast Beef &amp; peas, soup &amp; pudding &amp; Meredith proved a sport &amp; treated us to a dozen cases of wine (1 bottle to 4 men) A New Zealander died on board today from Meningitis  One would think by the amount of Crown &amp; Anchor played on board that this boat was a "gaffing school" &amp; they would not be far wrong;  Two torpedo boats came close up to us this morning apparently patrolling for submarines but have seen no sight of them since; Hot water baths are turned on for the troops &amp; quite a treat they are to  us feeling a little squeamish tonight &amp; am sleeping on deck</p>
