<p>Jan 12"  (Wednes)<br/>Our establishment of Officers has been brought up to date &ndash; 2 new Lieut. Colonels &amp; several Majors have been appointed or promoted.<br/>Not feeling too good at present &ndash; touches of asthma, sore throet &amp; cold in head. Long hours in the Colonel's office and cold, misty damp nights are not too healthy.<br/>Jan 20th (Thurs).<br/>Feeling pretty fair now but it could be better for me if I could get more exercise in the open.<br/>Get up in the morning about 7.15 &ndash; just in time to be ready for breakfast at 7.45. Commence work about 8.30. knock off at 12.45 pm for dinner &amp; start again about an hour</p>
