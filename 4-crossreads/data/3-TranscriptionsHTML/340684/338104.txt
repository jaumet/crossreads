<p>389<br/>Thought you might like to see this. JOL [Written sideways above address]<br/>New Zealand Hospital<br/>Walton on Thames<br/>4th September 1915</p>
<p>Dearest Joker and Bobbie<br/>Many thanks for your letters and am joly glad to hear you are having a good<br/> time -  I wish I was there to row you about and carry things etc. The rotten<br/> stuff my eye is dressed with twice a day has made the eye inflamed and<br/>very painful &ndash; They are going to make the stuff weaker so hope this<br/>evening I won't have to go through the torture I had this morning &ndash;</p>
<p>I have written to &ndash;oult as having her over here to go punting &ndash; She said in her letter that her mother was going to Walton so I hope she  comes along too &ndash; She also sent me a number of snap shots of Lea which were good also one of myself mashing potatoes &ndash; Charlie is very fit but we are both a bit cut up over the casualties in the Dardanelles. Our regiment left Auckland with nearly 700 men &ndash; There are only 140 alive today &ndash; I am the only one out of my tent alive</p>
