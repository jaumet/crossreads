<p>&amp;it does seem to be a bit tough but I hope things will settle a bit or I'll get a bit more used to it.</p>
<p>I haven't seen Alison or anyone for ages nor had any word from you either but hope to soon.  I got the socks &amp; the mufflers, thanks so much, they will be most welcome &amp; Graham's photo is simply splendid.</p>
<p>My love to Mac &amp; the Boss &amp; Graham.  Tell Mac to write.</p>
<p>Much love to yourself.  I wish the war were over &amp; I were back at Tog.</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Wilkie</p>
