bless them, about a mile on from here we struck "Spoil Bank" which is on the edge of the Ypres Canal, we were now in country with which I was familiar for we were holding the line in 1916 round here, one would scarcely know the place again, but the big Canadian cemetery is still here, these men were nearly all killed with the German gas attack in 1915, later on the terrible fighting round "Sanctuary Wood" which is quite close, this is the place where the Canadians made their great name justified the faith placed in them although they were only volunteers, all round here along Middlesex Road the 4th Divison are putting in field guns getting ready if ever the Huns do succeed in breaking through, but I should not like to be among them if ever they get this far back, what a time they will have crossing the ridge, we pulled up at last after a walk of 4 hours just outside the famous Hill 60
