the first & third I just spoke & in the second, I read a paper on "Love & Mr Lewisham".Outstanding men in the circle are Hall, Barlow, Rickson, Dickson, Staff, Parlay, Betram, & Reynolds. Barlow has given us some good stuff both in papers & speeches. The circle has grown considerably & is officially recognised, with a couple of representatives on the central committee. What I have had particularly in mind in all both these affairs is now assured. No harm will be done either the Circle or the Concert Party by the secession of one man, for it & each has a strong constitution.
