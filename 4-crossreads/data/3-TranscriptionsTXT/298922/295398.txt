Robertson should get something for his coolness in the job we all think. Had a drink with A.B. Paterson & saw Col. McLeish of Yea at Remount Depot. "Banjo" has written another thing called WALK THAT HORSE. Have you heard the song.
"There's a Trail that leads to home" a corollary to the "LONG, LONG TRAIL" which no doubt is in Australia ere this. Stanley Braim seemed really pleased to see me, he was going up for an exam in the flying Corps but told the usual YARNS.
