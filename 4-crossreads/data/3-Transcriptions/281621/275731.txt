<p>Monday 31<br/>Fine day &amp; snowing at night.<br/>Artillery activity is marked &amp; a Fritz plane has been over.<br/>The gathering in the hut is complete &amp; among them there is much licquor. Bagpipes, songs etc are the orders and it has eventually ended at midnight with "Old Lang Syne" &amp; an orgy. I myself am O.K. &amp; have put a few of them to bed. The officers lost any <u>spark</u> of dignity they ever possessed. Welcomed the men into the mess for the New Year.</p>
<p>When I look back at 1917 I find it has been adventurous &amp; educating. The winter on the Somme was bad enough &amp; the Battles of Bullicourt &amp; Ypres rank among the most severe on the front. Two trips to England have in me satisfied a great desire [indecipherable] to see &amp; as well as possible that country.</p>
