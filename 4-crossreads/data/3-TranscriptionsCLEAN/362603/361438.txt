Have a good time while You can & don't join up till You absolutely have to whatever You do stick to the A.M.C.  You will have to work with M D's who are much more sensible & reasonable than the ordinary Military officer.  Remember Me to Os Merrett & the Club Boys & Mr Love.  I have been going to write to Mr Love 100 times & yet have delayed. Tell Him that I do not forget Him though I do not write Heaps of Love to LIL & yourself Harry
