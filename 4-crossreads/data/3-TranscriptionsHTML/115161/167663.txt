<p>Everyone as &quot;mud&quot; <s>as</s> compared with this officer.&nbsp; I mention this incident as the visit of this &quot;staff officer&quot; played a very big part in my future life in the A.I.F.&nbsp; This day was destined to in many ways improve my army existence, but did not by so doing necessarily reduce the risks of losing my personal existence altogether.</p>
<p>This staff officer became my &quot;boss&quot; from this day, and for a greater combination of all the ingredients in the formation of man it would be impossible to find.&nbsp; A gentleman yet a &quot;pig&quot;.&nbsp; Ability, cleverness, artistic to a degree, a musician of no mean order, a sportsman, - a linguist successful writer, a fine-looking, athletic, well-set up man, and a decided favorite with the fair sex.&nbsp; This is the man who occupied that &quot;staff&quot; car and issued that order to the lorrie driver, in a tone which demanded instant compliance with his wishes, or failing would result in trouble for the driver.</p>

<p>I had visions of always having a comfortable bed, and&nbsp;&nbsp; good clean</p>
