 Tuesday 19th Assisted in office for an hour or two in morning & then wrote letters 
 Padre "marched out" on a cable wagon drawn by 12 horses the chaps lining the road. At places brooms etc were used to "present arms". He was a good sport & very sorry to leave us 
 Rainy day except evening when I went for a walk. 
 Wednesday 20th Office works, application for leave to Birmingham fixed up 
 Spent evening in camp 
 Thursday 21st As three days' light duty was up I paraded sick again and was put back on duty - The chaps have for the last two or three days been doing route marches & today I went out also. We marched about 1 mile past Clop Hill & then returned doing about 9 miles. During an 1/2 hour spell at Clop Hill I visited the flour mill which is worked by water power in a very businesslike manner. The mill was very quiet & interesting. 
 After dinner we marched another 5 or 6 miles and felt pretty tired after doing I think
