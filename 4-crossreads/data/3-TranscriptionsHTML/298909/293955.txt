<p>Our Kits only came to hand today &amp; about 6 Kits have been cut &amp; anything decent or valuable taken out, the guards caught one man in the act, so we hope they give him 5 years. One of my boys L Penfold lost everything, &amp; they must have changed &amp; left him the dirty change, but they were careful not to leave any names.</p>
<p>16/  Sunday</p>
<p>Very hot &ndash; nice &amp; cool after sundown. Went about 2 miles across the Camp to Church at 7-30 am. The C.E parade was a fine spectacle &ndash; About 3,000 men &amp; perhaps 150 Officers were arranged up in a square, the Minister in the middle, together with the Band. Had charge of a Guard all day &ndash; just posted them &amp; gave them their shifts &amp; M.Oed. Went over to the 14/2nd L. Horse Camp, but Lt. Trickett was out, it is about 2 miles away &ndash; alongside are the Indian Lancers. They are very knatty &amp; very clean &ndash; they kill their own meat, they have a lot of Goats yarded up in a barricade to be killed. One thing</p>
