<p>Tuesday, 21 September, 1915<br/>Big sick parades I did more dressings than the Dr did cases.</p>
<p>A mail in.  I went around to the Amb. for my letters and on receiving them got the cruellest shock I have yet had for I rec bad news that dumbfounded me, I was like a man in a dream all day but plucked up towards evening making a firm resolution to carry my burden light heartedly, when a man gets bad news from Aust in this place it knocks the stuffing out of him, he has enough &amp; sees enough here and wants only good news from Aust to keep him cheerful.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 22 September, 1915<br/>A German taube flew over Anzac in the morning and dropped three bombs with the intention of wrecking the new pier that has been built, they all dropped harmlessly in the water, I went around to the [indecipherable] to-day to Lonesome Pine trenches where the 1st Bde charged so splendidly during the big advance, the trenches here are always being shelled by the enemy, if a sandbag  is put up it is immediately knocked down again.  The nights now are getting bitterly cold this is the first touch of winter.  We hear there has been a big movement on the extreme left but news is very scanty.  One of our men got shot through the heart by a sniper whilst digging to-day.</p>
