<p>&amp;cycled home again.</p>
<p>Saw some beautiful Belgian lace but it is very expensive.  Another afternoon the Colonel took me out for a long cross country walk which I enjoyed.  He is a most entertaining man &amp; was not at all uppish but very nice &amp; affable &amp; we got on O.K.  Both he &amp; the Adjutant are really very nice to me &amp; say they are glad to have me &amp; that I am most satisfactory.  You won't think it swank of me to tell you these things but you know how I like to be liked &amp; it has made me feel much</p>
