 Franc 2nd 8th .17 Dear J. Its near time I sent you a line to let you know that I am , still on the List , and have an averag chanc of remain on . I dont feel much in the humour for write , it has been a rotten day , all togeth rain , and cold wind , and there ani quantiti of mud outsid , one good thing we are at present quarter in a fine larg barn which has not had ani troop in it for 6 month so we are a littl better off than we might have been . Where we will be and what we will be do in the next 10 day is a matter for specul , rumour predict that we will be out look for stouch , or fritz . just at present we hear tale of vain search for the enemi yess ? we heard the same just befor Herm 's but when we went up he was there allright , we arriv up here last friday about 3 a.m. detrain and march straight out to Billett , as per usual everi place that might prove of interest is label out of bound to all troop , and we are warn that if caught therein we will be Sumarili dealt with . such is life out on a coupl of rout march we have been abl to see a littl of the countri but onli a littl . The crop look O.K. in most case the wheat especi , but a lot of the oat crop have been laid low by heavi wind and rain and look like be spoil alltogeth , potato crop look healthi , but rather too much top on then , Beet crop also are come on nice other miscellan crop , Bean french , Broad , pea . . Maiz , etc . all look well veri differ to the crop down where we were last billet , there were a few decent patch of wheat there , but the major was poor on account of the chalk which was veri close to the surfac . We can purchas plenti of egg , and Butter here first name 3d . each second 3/ - per lb . so anyon who want it , and had the need , can get it without ani troubl , at time it is harder to secur the cash than it is to get the other thing , but we are paid at fair regular interv . Was make inquiri about Ted Mackinson a coupl of week ago , and found that he is now with the 1st Inf . as Lieut receiv his Com some time ago . have not been abl to see anyth of Jack Howel so far and have not heard from Harri for some time , he was still in Blighti when he wrote last but was expect order to move at ani time , so he may be over here by now .
