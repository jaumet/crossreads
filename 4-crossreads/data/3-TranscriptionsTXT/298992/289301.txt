 as I do not mind the heat. At night we all sleep in hammocks, slung from hooks in the roof, each man having about 16 to 18 ins of space. The place is simply crowded, all the hammocks touching each other, and when one moves or rocks we all do. Have to be in bed &amp; lights out at 9.30, and up at 6 am, so we get plenty of sleep. 
 They are feeding us like kings. Plenty of everything, &amp; well cooked. We can even pick &amp; choose. For dinner yesterday we had, fish, roast mutton &amp; potatoes, pickles, bread &amp; jam and BUTTER, tea and stew. Isn't that pretty good? We all sit down at tables which is an advance on Liverpool. I don't think anyone on board is sorry that we have left that place &ndash; not now any way, yesterday when they were all sick it may have been different. 
 We do not have any drill on board, it is far too crowded, and all day there is nothing to do but lie on deck &amp; read or smoke or sleep. I guess we will all be as fat as pigs when we lob in Egypt. Have some 6 or 7 weeks to go yet.
