MAY   FRIDAY 12   1916
Fine & very cold, the sea as calm as it possibly could be, and very few sick  I slept on deck and it got very cold towards morning. We had no parades today as we go on duty at four oclock. Came up very cold in evening got my bedding up and went to bed early on deck.
I wonder what Linda is doing to-day, and if she is worrying very much. I hope not as there is really no need as I am fairly comfortable and we could not possibly have a smoother sea or a steadier ship. There is practically no vibration
