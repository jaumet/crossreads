In fact every house in the village has its representative there; most of them are bereft of the head of the household and the wife and four or five children are left at home to subsist as best they can on the miserable military pay. The English tommy only gets his 1s/1d per day with an extra allowance of<br/>16s/10d for his wife if she lives in London and 12s/6d is she lives in the country. They are also allowed an extra 5/- for one child and 10/6 for three. The french soldier is even worse off and only gets three-halfpence a day - his fighting is true patriotism. Until recently he only received a half-penny per day.<br/>The people in these villages, which are dotted over the countryside within a mile or two of one another, are very old fashioned. Most of them never move out of their own little township and some don't even know the name of the next township but one. They are also dreadfully pecuniary, through necessity I daresay.</p>
