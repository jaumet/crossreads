<p>as I expected to see one large University it consists of 24 Colleges scattered all over the <br/>town.<br/>We saw St. Magdalens Christchurch and all Souls etc.  Most of these were built by <br/>Wolsey.  We also had a look at the Thames and its tributaries where rowing takes place.<br/>It is a lovely place.  Each College has an elaborate houseboat to which the boats are <br/>moored while the men change.</p>
