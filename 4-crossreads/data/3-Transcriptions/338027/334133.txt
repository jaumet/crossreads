<p><u>Cont</u><br/>receive our mail from home a fortnights.  I got a few letters but it is the next mail I am looking for.  Sammy gave me a terribly rough ride he has cultivated every vice imaginable, he rears, bites, kicks and bucks, and reefs your arms out the more I fought him the worse he got, if he does not improve I am going to get rid of him.</p>
<p>Thursday<br/>Exercising horses all day by riding then we rode over to the pumping station &amp; had a look over it.  It was a magnificent sight the engines are the largest I have yet seen, then we went through a beautiful palm glade called Kafr-el-Tamon</p>
<p>Friday, 12 February, 1915<br/>In the morning we went out with the brigade, sham fighting, but we did nothing, only looked on at the attack from a secluded view.  I rode Mary &amp; Henry to-day, am giving Sammy a spell.</p>
<p>The artillery shooting of the N.Zealanders is magnificent altogether the 1st Brigade is doing fine work.</p>
<p>Issued with tunics and underclothing, caps to arrive shortly.</p>
<p>Our reinforcements arrived to-day horses in a day or so.  I know one of them they seem a decent lot of chaps.</p>
<p>Went to Heliopolis at night and had a look round.</p>
