<p><u>8th</u>Today I am orderly officer again. Whilst inspecting the food at one billet in "C" Company and asking for complaints I received a couple. It is an extraordinary thing about the diggers. Unless an officer asks for complaints they will grin and bear a great deal and be it said to their shame many officers abuse this fine trait in their men. On this occasion I was informed that the tea was too black, undrinkable almost and a sample was thrust under my nose. It certainly was black. The other complaint was that "the bacon was of the Lance corporal variety and hardly discernible". Promising</p>
