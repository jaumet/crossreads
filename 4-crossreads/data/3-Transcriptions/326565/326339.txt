<p>Pitched a few tents, then rested the remainder of the day.  Turned very cool towards evening.</p>
<p>Wednesday 5/4/16<br/>Cooks fatigue for the day.  Much cooler than usual. Hospital tents pitched &amp; commenced to take in Brigade sick.  Dysentery rather prevalent among the troops camping here; water apparently the cause.</p>
<p>Thursday 6/4/16<br/>Rather warm again.  Very little work carried out here during the middle of the day owing to the heat.  Flies very troublesome.  Walked across to roadhead about 1&frac12; miles</p>
