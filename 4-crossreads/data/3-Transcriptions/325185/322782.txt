<p>some long distance guns up &amp; opened fire on a town about twenty miles behind the line. Of course the civilians had to clear. Well there were old &amp; young walking along the road some women carrying young children. There were about a dozen (Ink finished) civilians wounded. One shell hit the corner of one of our Hospitals. It made one feel thankful the war isint in our own country. This is a thing one could never describe. It has to be seen to fully understand it.  Oh well Fritz is getting his tail jammed now pretty hard. As for the war being nearly over well that is a big thing to say as far as we can see it is going to last awhile yet of course time will tell. Well Father I shall have to close No more news just now. Love &amp; best wishes to all</p>
<p>Your sincere<br/>Son Clyde.</p>
