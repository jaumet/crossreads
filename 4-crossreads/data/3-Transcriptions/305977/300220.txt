All day the Turks were very quiet &amp; part of the night but early in the morning the Turks blew up a trench (disused) on the left &amp; there was heavy scrapping till about 9am.  Our chaps took portion of a trench which will strengthen us considerably.  Jack Culley had 2 fingers shot off during the night.</p>
