  
 you I feel very proud of it. I went over the bags on the 23 of August and took part in the taking of the monster gun (15 inch) by the Australians, also two thousand prisoners. Well Miss King we are soon going to have a long rest and I think it well earned dont you? I will be going to England any day now and I am looking forward to a good time. I am pleased to hear of the good work you good Australian people are doing for us boys and I am sure we are rewarding your efforts by continuing to make name for our dear homeland.
