 number of shells were sent over to find the trench positions.  and there were, also mortars &amp; bombs. May 23 Our relief arrived promptly at 10.30; and we dropped back to support trenches, in which our positions were simply portion of the trenches roofed with boards etc.  Just before we went a severe dose of gas was given to Fritz. May 24 An attack on our line is expected.  Supports were heavily shelled; and, when the heavy shelling was over, Lt Wilkinson  who  was wounded by a chance burst of shrapnel.  Usual fatigues. May 25 Very heavy shelling in the morning, during which the fire scorched the whole neighbourhood.  Phil Knight is again in charge of the platoon.  Shrapnel wounded another man -  Beesly  Beesley &ndash; while he was standing in the trench.  More sickness, though it didn't keep me off fatigues.  Action appears to benefit me; it is lying in the trench that hurts. May 26 The boys in the line repelled an attack easily.  We "stood to" but were not wanted May 27 Fritz makes every fatigue a nightmare by sniping reserve lines with machine guns. He seems to have all our tracks well marked.  On a front line fatigue nine out of sixteen of us were hit and getting the wounded out was strenuous.
