<p>left again on Thursday 26th Nov &amp; on the same day went through hell's gate to the red sea on our way to Suez. Aden is a very desolate looking place no vegetation growing at all it being all desert &amp; barren looking rocks. The Red Sea was very calm &amp; the weather very mild from Aden to Suez. We arrived at Suez on Tuesday morning 1st Dec &amp; after waiting our turn till 10 o'clock the same night we followed the rest of the boats into the Canal on our way to Port Said. The Canal is a wonderful sight. There were troops consisting of Sudanese, Sikhs, Gurkhas a batch of Manchester Engineers patrolling both sides of the Canal. After 14 hours steam up the canal we arrived at Port Said on Wednesday Dec 2nd. Port Said is a fairly large place &amp; the sight as we passed each boat &amp; Cruiser which were in port (both French &amp; English)</p>
