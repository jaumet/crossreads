 Nov. 5 Up Zonnebeke 'B' track to close supports &ndash; only a few isolated posts constituted front line, a continuous trench being a thing of the past.  Wiring party in No Mans land 2000 to 2300.  Gas Guard 0100 to 0300.   "Stand to" 0500. 
 Nov. 6 Hid in hole all day.  At nightfall made a little overhead cover.  At 2200 went out &amp; dug a strong post in rear of outposts.  Fritz was wise to our proceedings &amp; sent over barrage of gas shells &amp; we were glad to get back at 0330.  The sergeant major, platoon sgt. &amp; 3 corporals who were not on fatigue with us were blind drunk, having soaked the whole rum issue, so we had to turn in wet through &amp; chilled to the marrow.  Lts. Hawke &amp; Balcombe &amp; L/Cpl. Thompson wounded by shrapnel.  Hawke killed later on whilst being carried to the rear.  A real white man. 
 Nov. 7 Gas guard 1600 to 1700.  Fatigue improving strong post 2300 to 0230.
