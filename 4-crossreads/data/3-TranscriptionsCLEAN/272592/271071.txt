  
 3rd.   We had no less than 3 gas alarms last night, you could hear the horns for miles & miles they kick up an awful row, but each one turned out to be a blank. 
 There is great aerial activity this morning & our chaps are busy shooting their anti-aircrafts at them & chasing them back over their own lines, & old Fritz is spouting up into the clouds hundreds of shells at our battleplanes Tucker is still pretty crook a slice of bread & jam for breakfast only & no tea so far. 
 This morning broke nice & sunny & for a while it was bonzer but it looks very much like rain this afternoon, it is muggy & close.
