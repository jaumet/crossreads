<p>will have passed. Reg Bridge was thoughtful to write home and ask his people to care for you. I must write to him a short note.   London is an attractive place for any kind of man with capacity for thinking.<br/>Nothing had been done at Queen's Square before I left.   If artistically developed a scheme for its treatment should produce one of the most beautiful of the kind in any city.  It is pity if it be done by an ignoramus or the otherwise incompetent.</p>
<p>I have not seen Pierro Fiaschi lately. I hope that Joseph enjoyed the races.  Penshurst looks well from a distance as a home fit for any one to live in.</p>
<p>Joseph dear: / Yours of the beginning of April.   The photos by Doris.   Many thanks for them.   What has my Kitty done to her hair.  I did not know her in the new style she has adopted for carrying her cheveux.   The jakaranda, the corner of bricks, &amp; the greenery behind Kitty make a picturesque background for two girls of the best.   Kitty near the peltate leaves [shield-shaped leaves] and the filter is somewhat dark.   How well the fern &amp; other plants have grown Joe dear.   Why they quite envelop you seated in the corner.  And Non looks ready for bed with dishevelled locks and white robe.  Kitty &amp; Doris are shaded by the Jackaranda.   Very pleasing to me all.   Thanks for them.</p>
