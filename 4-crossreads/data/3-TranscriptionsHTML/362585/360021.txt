<p>is like at home.</p>
<p>31 October 1917</p>
<p>I suppose Keith is beginning to fidget again.  I don't know whether to think he is lucky or not.  There are some goods points in being over here.</p>
<p>I have just written 5 letters and am feeling a bit exhausted with the strain.  Thanks very much for the last parcel.  Best love to the Judge, Dorothy &amp; Keith.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately<br/>C. R. Lucas</p>
