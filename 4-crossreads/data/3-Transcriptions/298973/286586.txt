We were all issued with dark glasses, but the trouble with them is that when you take them off, you notice the glare more than ever, so I have not used mine at all.I am keeping in the best of health, and have not had one sick day since leaving Sydney.I had a great surprise by the last mail, in which I received the news of Hazel's marriage. I was very disappointed indeed at not being able to be there- I never thought I was going to miss that event.   And Dene engaged too!
