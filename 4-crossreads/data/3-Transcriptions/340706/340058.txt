<p>104<br/>wish. The gilding of the Dome has entirely disappeared. The Tomb of Nap 1 was not open to inspection this day In fact I am making a flying visit only in order to place everything in a proper perspective &amp; not to minutely examine the treasures that await me &amp; many of which are not yet restored from the secure depths where they have rested during the war.</p>
<p>From Place Vauban I pass into the Boul des Invalides by Av de Villars along to Rue de Sevres where I double back to Av de Breuteuil which offer an imposing of the Hotel des Invalides &ndash; a rising dome dominating a broad strip covered with lines of trees</p>
<p>Then I pass by Rue Vaugirard to the Jardin du Luxembourg reaching it by Rue de Gunemeyer [indecipherable] Rue de Luxemburg. Here I repose in these gardens which are much the same as our gardens with quiet recesses &amp; deeper thickets. A multitude of chairs lie around not yet in use as Spring is not properly here yet &amp; many a private cosy corner where lovers may whisper confidential trifles.</p>
<p>There a few lawns &amp; less flowers. The trees in the avenue sprouting out of bare soil unrelieved by any green but there are plenty of spaces where children can play &amp; so the whole family comes here &amp; enjoys itself. Madame knitting &amp; Pere reading his paper. In centre is a large basin surrounded with balustrades &amp;</p>
