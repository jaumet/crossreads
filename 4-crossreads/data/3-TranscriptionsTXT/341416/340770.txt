The fiery reservoir that rides the vaultA spendthrift spending ever yet unspentUpon this earth man's floating tenementWith life deriving showers makes his assaultWith life imbuing light makes his assaultTransmutating With the properties of transmutation charged imbuedHe spreads the coloured galaxy belowThe dull hued earth crops forth in goodly painted showFrom bankrupts nought to beauty's wealth enlargedAnd floral vestments clothe the barren nude.Potential powers to culmination adoringAnd multiplying increase to bounty breaksObservance hides the skeletons of deathAdmirer's profits further profit'sAtones remote from sight world aspects change
Sunday 14/3/15 Mena CampIt is now considerably over 2 months since I made any entries. In the interim training has been going on in the usual fashion. We have got thoroughly used to marching over the sand. One cannot march nearly so far as on a good road, but the hard road, after training has been constructed on the sand for some weeks, blisters the feet and tires the muscles and jars the joints. After a 15 or 16 mile march over the asphalt one day a great number were unable to go out the day following. We went out a week or so ago to carry out an attack and bivouac. We left camp about 4.30 and began the attack about 6 p.m. Our coy were in the support and did little firing. We had tea about 7.30 and mostly did waiting after that. Eventually and by slow stages we retired. We bivouacked about 12:30 and were up again an hour before dawn. Distant firing showed that the battle was not all over but we did not participate; and after waiting a couple of hours marched back to camp. We had only our overcoats and rubber sheets. It was pretty cold during the night and twice I got up and walked around
