control my feelings at times, it was all about a young girl marrying a man who had veneral disease & the terrible results for all parties that followed, it was very very sad but so true, in one way I thoroughly enjoyed the piece for it was well played. the place was simply packed as is usual for these plays with women & girls & I don't believe they ever trouble themselves about the moral it points out, only come to hear a bit of plain speaking, I have not too good an idea of a large number of these English girls, they are very flighty
After this was over another chap & I went for a long tram ride through some very pretty suburbs & residences after getting off the tram we started to walk up the street home, & run into McFarlane with a girl, we just nodded & walked on but Mac called me back
