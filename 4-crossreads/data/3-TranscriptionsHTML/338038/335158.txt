<p>My dear Father,<br/>Many thanks for letter of 19th Sep and diary up to that date to hand yesterday, also Heralds of 11th 13th &amp; 18th Sept.<br/>I am sorry to hear you had not a letter from me for that week as I don't think I have missed out a mail; in any case, I always send a card so no doubt delays in the post offices are responsible.<br/>You are quite near the mark in imagining how welcome the papers are; I can tell you I don't leave many parts of them unread.<br/>I don't think I commented on a certain enclosure in your last regarding Caleb's misbehaviour &ndash; Rather decent of Mrs Johnson I thought. He must certainly be a great dawg. Ask Pat what he thinks of his narrow head now &ndash;</p>
