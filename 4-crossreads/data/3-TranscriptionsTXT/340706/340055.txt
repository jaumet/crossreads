the Peace de la Republique once occupied by a bastion of the old fortifications swept away by Louis XIV & now embellished with a stature of the Republic with three figures Liberty Equality & Fraternity
Thence I turned into The Boulevards - by streets but hardly sufficient to accommodate the crowds that throng it Passing the Porte St Martin & then Porte St Denis - the latter as dear to my memory from the song & then on through the fashionable Boul de Italiens to Place de l'Opera.
At end of which stands the Opera House an enormous structure covering nearly 3 acres of ground & costing for building alone 1,460,000. On opposite side of square is a large hotel containing over 1,000 bedroom -
I then follow on the Boulevarde de la Madeline to the Madeline itself - a building in style of a Roman Temple intended for a Temple of Glory by Nap. 1 - it has no windows being lighted from above & is built entirely of stone.
So far I have had no luncheon & am becoming tired so proceed back to Hotel passing Palais Royal built by Richelien & after occupied by Anne of Austria & the birthplace of Louis XIV.
At Hotel, I take off my boots & rest my feet & find a big blister under one of my toes. After about 1/2 hour we set off for Montmartre via the Metropolitan passing Trocadero on our way. This my first experience of Paris Tube is much more to my taste
