Next night the 6th I was again detailed in charge of wiring party after a few minutes work in the moonlight Fritz stopped our job we had to finish for that night. Our next moved was on the night of the 7th when we went as far back as reserves from here we had to do front line ration fatigue which meant a trip at night one early morning. I came a very big thud on the 13th when I was detailed with right half company to go back in the front line to occupy a pill box known as Hall farm for 48 hours. Our duties here were outposts etc had to patrol to 2nd Battn on our left the second night in we had a very heavy snow storm. Next night the 15th rain set in very heavy after waiting a few hours we were releived it was one of the darkest night I've ever experienced I led a small party out had to wait collect gum boots at the brigade store. After waiting there till the small hours of the next morning only half the party had reported I took leave set off to find the battalion who had moved back to Wytschaete. After wandering about on my own for a couple of hours I gave it up till daylight turned in for forty winks with a platoon of the 4th Bn. About seven o'clock I got up after enquiring wandering for another hour I found my platoon found that half the boys were not home who were in the Pill box with me.
