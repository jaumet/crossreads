<p>on Bourke &amp; the other, this evening,  on dialect words in dictionaries &amp; in relation to Standard English.</p>
<p>Christian work is proceeding along the lines of unity laid down by the Padre.  Tonight, the usual order was named by a Salvationist taking us in the manner &amp; with the hymns of his sect &ndash; in short nonconformist.  Despite my antipathy to the type of hymns I found the meeting just as helpful if not more.</p>
<p>Rumours of the week: (1)  Ceramic not far behind us, &amp; should pass us on the way shortly (2) We are to be transhipped to Ceramic on account of the unreliability of our boat (3) Propeller gone bung entirely.</p>
<p>Sports have been continued during the week, and there has been the usual band orchestra &amp; concert entertainment.</p>
<p>Kit inspection today.</p>
