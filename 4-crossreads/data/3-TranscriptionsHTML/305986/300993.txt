<p>"Our Billets"</p>
<p>Our billet is "airy" Our Billet is "sweet"<br/>You can smell the dam place as you come up the street,<br/>A manure heap in front, a manure heap behind,<br/>Why, man, you're in clover, that is - of a kind</p>
<p>The place is quite "Holey", and oft unawares<br/>The wind comes whistling with various airs,<br/>It is a bit draughty, but, then, you are told<br/>To live in fresh air, keeps one clear of a cold.</p>
<p>The straw that you lie on was laid on the floor,<br/>When France was at war</p>
