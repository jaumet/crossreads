<p>Tuesday 17th Nov<br/>Convalescent. Got paid.  One of our police boys was killed by the cannibals &amp; eaten a few miles out in the bush.</p>
<p>Wednesday 18th Nov<br/>Spent two hours at drill in the boiling sun</p>
<p>Thursday 19th Nov<br/>Went for a route march to the Gom River. The heat was terrible &amp; as I was just recovered from the fever did not do too well. However I succeeded in continuing &amp; we had a swim in fresh water on our arrival.  After dinner two of us went down to the ocean beach two miles away had a very acceptable surf     .  Coming back we thought we would take a short cut with the result that after blundering through the scrub for a few hundred yards we found ourselves bushed. We wandered &ndash; if it is possible in such bush &ndash; for an hour &amp; completely</p>
