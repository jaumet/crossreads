The ruins of the town of Little Anafarta were miles inland and a tall tower stood here for a while, but as it proved to be an observation post for the enemy it was shelled and brought down.  Near the Salt Lake were the Chocolate Hills <strike>and</strike> where I witnessed a heavy attack <strike>there</strike> one night.  It was a grand spectacle of skyrockets, flares bursting shells, burning scrub, and flashes of rifle fire;  <strike>and</strike> one might have enjoyed it, if it were not for its awful meaning;  many a participant never saw the light of day again.  The Turks suffered heavily but the burning scrub impeded our advance, so the objective was not reached.</p>
