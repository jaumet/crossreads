 about themselv and their dwell is an air of squalor and wretched that I have not seen equal in ani other part of Palestin , foul and insanitari and squalid as most of it nativ villag and inhabit are . A batch of prison went by this morn , about 30 in all , two Turkish Officer at their head . They were a most nondescript look crowd . Our poor unfortun hors are feel the cold keen .
