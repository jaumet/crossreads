In the afternoon, we were paid.  I drew 28/- being 2/- a day.  Got 2 letters from home.  Got ready for pumping station guard & went on first post at 6.15pm.  Its a good easy job.  Had supper at the Nile caf&#233. 
 Thursday 25th Had a good morning on guard.  Was taken off at 12 oclock as I had to do my musketry.  Was down at the Territorial Barracks in the morning, where they have the Turkish prisoners.  Didn't do much good at the 500 yds snap shooting, but did fair at the 500 yds independent & 300 yds trapping.  Wrote a letter home. 
 Friday 26th Went out marking at the 500 yards in the morning.  Also about
