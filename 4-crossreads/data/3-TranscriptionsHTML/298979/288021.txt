<p>How this news reached the men it was hard to say but certainly "color" was given to the report by an order being issued soon afterwards that even "down below" even with every port closed no lights whatever were to be allowed after Sundown</p>
<p>Of course there was the usual growling amongst the men who naturally complained at having to go to bed in the dark when the chance of rays of light being seen from their quarters, with an iron plate screwed over every port hole, was simply impossible whereas any man standing on the deck could easily see quite a blaze of light coming from Officers quarters on the Bridge deck, every time a door opened &amp; one cabin was noticed with only a movable hanging curtain in the door way through sides of which light could be seen at any time.</p>
<p>The complaints became so bad that the Officer commanding the troops had to go below to try to soothe the angry feeling of the men.</p>
<p>At one time it looked as if a very "nasty" situation was likely to be created, for the reception given to the (O/C) officer was anything but pleasant &amp; as this officer at first completely lost his temper, if he had continued in that way he would surely have lost what little control he had over the men.</p>
<p>Luckily the incident passed without either side being forced to take a determined stand, but the officer did not gain anything in the esteem of the men.</p>
<p>Upon hearing a rather pertinent interjection, the officer worked himself into a terrible rage &amp; rushing to the side whence the interjection was hurled, defiantly challenged the man who had spoken to stand up before him as a man &amp; "fight", at the same time striking an attitude just similar to that of an ordinary School boy, which the officer had probably copied from force of habit, as he was</p>
