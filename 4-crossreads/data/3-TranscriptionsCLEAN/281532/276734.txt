 Spent nearly all day at work on my report on operations and Honors & Awards. The Battalion paraded under Kennedy on some ground just outside the village. The village church was busy with white robed little girls having their first communions. 
 10/10/18 
 Another hellish busy day on recommendations and honours. Rather drizzly and cold. Spent most of it indoors and did not have the troops doing much work. Jack came in for dinner and afterwards the little mademoiselle at the billet played some pieces on the pianoforte. We then adjourned to my billet where I nursed the little girl and Madame prepared a cup of coffee for us. Drinking this coffee slashed with rum is some ceremony "A la votre" "Bon Sante" etc. The little girl is named Yvette.
