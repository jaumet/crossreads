 4/11/17 Florence A lovely day. An old man called as guide and proved very good being an Englishman. Went first to San Lorenzo church the front of which has never been finished. Inside a mass was being said. Saw some statues by Michael Angelo. The cloisters open into a pretty garden where many cats used to find a refuge until they became too fat and people ate them. Entered the Mausoleum of the Medici &ndash; a truly magnificent place lined with the most costly mosaics. The whole decorations consist of small pieces of precious stone let in &ndash; coats of arms &amp;c just as if they had been painted. Walked up to the Palazzo Vecchio and found some of the statues here sandbagged up in case of air raids. In this square is the spot where Savonarola was burnt &ndash; a circular bronze slat marks the spot. The copy of Michael Angelo's "David" is here. Saw the Loggia
