Dear Mother,
I am afraid you will wonder what's coming over me not writing the last couple of weeks but we have been very busy & have not had a chance to do any writing at all for some time.  You will understand us being busy at this time of the year when there is so much doing.  In the last three weeks we have been here there & everywhere, but are both keeping well.
