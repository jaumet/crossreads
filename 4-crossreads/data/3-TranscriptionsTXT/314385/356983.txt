 Thur Sep 21st Still on same duties, we have about 150 patients sick. French flu &amp; boils etc also influenza. 
 I &amp; another went into Popge in after noon &amp; had a good look round. The people look rough &amp; coarse. Went to a picture show in the evening. 
 Fri Sep 22nd Got a half day off and again went into town &amp; found a shop run by Crosse &amp; Blackwell where tinned goods of every description could be obtained from a rump steak to partridge. I invested in a tin of Pork sausages &amp; took it to a resturent &amp; had it warmed. Found them a great relish. 
 Sat Sep 23rd Nothing unusual in morning life seems rather flat. 
 I have many games of chess &amp; Solo whist with the boys. A football match took place in the afternoon between two ambulances which resulted in a conquest by our team. 
 Flying machines are plentiful. 
 We had gas helmet drill by our new O.C. he is very keen on this &amp; it seems probable he is preparing us for action
