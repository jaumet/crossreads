 Just remembered this was Leap Year, but nothing doing yet- s'pose there will be after WAR Court Martial today 2 men got some rotten whisky & threw their Rifle & Clothes into a Canal, practically went Mad- MUMPS very prevalent in Camp 18 men out of this Squadron alone have gone to Hospital since we left Heliopolis.   Thank you for Pastoral Times & Australasian- I am afraid there is going to be a bad time ahead for everyone to pay all the Taxation- but it is necessary- better pay up quick, & finish the job then be finished- It's a like a big drought if we got the Backers & the , S D we can see it through.
