<p>Saturday 16 [15] June 1917 [1918]<br/>S. Leed's day off, 40 pts. in ward &amp; all or most in bed, day goes off quietly.  Matron very nice as usual, asks me why windows not closed, "it is an order", raised eyebrows.  "Yes Matron &amp; very sorry but too hot", laughs &amp; goes on.  Cairo 5-8, hear from C. Garland the awful news that we are to be sent to 31st!!, fly home &amp; interview Matron 7.45 p.m.  "Yes you people are all to go very sorry".  I appeal, no use, Miss Oram can do nothing, try Col. Dawson.  Evidently we were all to come to 27th but Matron says she is too tired to take us on.  In this remark &amp; many others, I learn how we are regarded in Egypt &amp; some of us have been trying, I am afraid.  Go to be sorryful but no use fussing in the Army.  Am gradually hearing that, and lots of other things.</p>
