<p>From Minister of Defence to Administrator - With reference to your telegram 23rd September.&nbsp; As terms are thoroughly familiar on which surrender actually taken place they must be adhered to so far within scope of your authority as Officer Commanding capturing force. Although you now say no guarantee given that facilities will be afforded for return to Germany of Governor and Officials, your telegram 20th September says no obstacle return to Germany.&nbsp; Such undertaking on you part appears beyond scope Brigadier and whether it will be ratified is question will have to stand over till prisoners reach Australia and actual written terms received.&nbsp; Naval Board.&nbsp;&nbsp; (2035)</p>
