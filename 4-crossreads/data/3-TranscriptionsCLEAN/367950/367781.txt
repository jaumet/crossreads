  
 out the proceedings of a Field General Court Martial on Pte G.E. Jarman who got 60 days for being insubordinate to Major Birkbeck One of the best officers we have in the regiment and he certainly didn't deserve what the fellow called him but there is no limit to some peoples cussedness. However he has got 60 days to think matters out. 
 14th January 1917 El Arish Sunday Church Parade I do not know what is going to happen one of these Sunday mornings if a Taube suddenly appears in the offing and starts to drop bombs. I am inclined to think that there will be a scatter of great magnitude. A Taube  did  pay us a visit but some time after church parade but he did not come too close no shots were fired at him and he made off again. By the way these machines are not Taubes but  are   Aviatiks. The Germans use 3 classes of planes (1) The Albertross monoplane (not seen much much) (2) The Taube and (3) Aviatik 
 (A drawing of two planes, the one on the left labelled TAUBE and the one on the right AVIATIK - both have iron crosses drawn on their wings)
