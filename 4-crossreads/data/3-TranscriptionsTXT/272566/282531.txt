Thursday 29 March
Rain came through the roof on to our bed all night.  Got up at 11 a.m.  Orders that all men must shave today.  58th Batt. hopped the bags the other night & captured 2 machine guns, 2 searchlights etc., a very successful raid.  The 2 machine gun crews who were captured were taken to Bapaume for examination.  On passing the Town Hall these Fritzs laughed at the sight of dead bodies being carried out from the ruins.  Australians on the roads rushed them with picks & could only be kept off by a strong guard.  The Aust. demanded a chance to get at the Germans in order to nail them to the crucifixs & riddle them with bullets.Left in party of 6 & moved off to Bancourt after tea, arriving there wet through.  We are here to take casualties from the 55th Batt.
