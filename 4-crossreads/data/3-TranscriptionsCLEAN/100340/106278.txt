  
 till we got to Freemantle but since then it has been remarkably calm. We have plenty of sport on board  & generally a bit of a concert at night. Well Sis there is really nothing to tell you for you can see that there is not much to happen on a boat worth writing about, so you must excuse short letter & can only repeat again that you will have every happiness & no trouble when the event occurs. With fondest Love from your Brother.
