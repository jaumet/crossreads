Left the School this morning and caught 8 a.m. train. Got to Hazebrouk about 9 a.m. and had to wait for next train at 6.26 p.m. and not a brass farthing. A beautiful old town too. Got back to Div. Hdqrs. about 9 p.m. and found Bty. had moved to Armentieres, about 8 miles away. Went as far as 52nd Bty. near Fleurbaix and slept there.

parcel of chocolate and biscuits from home. Armentieres is or was a glorious old City at one time We have any amount of beds crockery and furniture in our billets and I would be satisfied to winter here if need be. Capt Prior has gone away with appendicitis and Lt. Kennet is in charge.
