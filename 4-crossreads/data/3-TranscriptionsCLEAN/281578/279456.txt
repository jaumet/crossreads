Bn band dispensed some very nice music. It is an excellent band & played catchy, up to date music, instead of all regimental marching stuff. It was very enjoyable, they played "Yaaka Hula," "Tonight's the night", "The Girl in the Taxi," & other pieces. We had an easy afternoon, short arm inspection by the M.O., the quickest I've ever seen in the army; instead of filing past him, we stood in line out in the wind, "presented arms" & he walked along. Aubrey arrived here yesterday some hours after us, he & a party were looking to the rations, I was put in D Coy, & he is in B. He has had to take down his 3 stripes now he has joined the Bn. In a way I am glad as he is too conscientious for an N.C.O., & was continually running about for others; now he won't have the chance to. I had a yarn to him & some of our chaps after tea, they are in tents, but it was so bitterly cold & airy there, that I soon came back to our warm shed. The big gun fired several shots in the evening, it is in the hollow near us & is 5 miles behind our trenches. The chaps from the line are all writing a lot of letters now they have the chance. I am a section commander, & it's not all beer & skittles; issued the rations
