<p>the night.</p>
<p>Tuesday 31.10.16<br/>Pleased to see daylight as nights are now very long &amp; shelter very poor.  Hundreds being brought through ill; its wonderful how any of the men live under such conditions.  Moved out to furthest post at 2 pm to an old German dug-out.</p>
<p>Wednesday 1.11.16<br/>A number of the 60 Btn attached to us as bearers.  Had plenty to do during the night &amp; all to-day.  All anxiously looking forward to relief from this part of the line.  Stunt postponed owing to bad weather &amp; poor condition of the men.  Relieved at 2.30 by 14 F.Amb.  Appreciated getting between the blankets after being crouched up</p>
