<p>on lovely green grass &amp; clover fully a foot high under the shade of a fine old apple tree, in front of me the old &amp; grassy orchard runs for about 200 yards &amp; finishes up at the end of a reserve of lovely <strike>breech</strike> beech trees &amp; at the foot of the orchard runs a lovely little clear river with plenty of fine trout in her, every here &amp; there little coloumns of smoke are rising up toward the bright blue sky showing where the boys are camped &amp; are cooking their breakfast, I can see them sitting round about in the shade, &amp; doubtless a good few like myself are silently contrasting, the difference between Egypt &amp; this lovely land</p>
