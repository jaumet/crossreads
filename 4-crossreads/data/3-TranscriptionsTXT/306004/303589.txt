 7.11.16 we had the line finished to Geisi by mid-day &amp; connected up   We found a steep sand hill here very high, (an ideal Sig Station) &amp; found Watson in touch with stations in every direction. New Zealanders in front, Tommies &amp; our own troops on the flanks &amp; rear; I received orders to send another Sig out this morning &amp; sent Teddy Mann, &amp; have decided also to send Edwards out tomorrow as there is plenty of work for two good helio. men, &amp; I can see a busy time ahead on this post, we arrived back in Camp tonight before sundown &amp; found a large   English   Australian mail waiting for us.
