<p>Novr 1918<br/>anything lying about. Not much excitement. Fancy 4 yrs of war has settled most of that. However once we got aboard we soon got settled, the weather very hot &amp; sea very calm. 2nd day out I was commandeered for hsptl. Quite a number of sick, most of whom were sick before leaving but would not report being afraid of missing the boat. Chiefly infl. &amp; malaria recurring. Troop deck almost unbearable, heat stifling. Deck (main) hot but much better. Stokers must have a warm time. Boat supposed to be doing about 12 knots &amp; expected to be tied up at Port Melbne 7am on 21st. So far, food fairly decent. On night of 11th we were aboard the ABBASIEH anchored off Tripoli when sirens, whistles from trawlers in shore started screeching &amp; blowing quickly followed by lights 7 rockets<br/>Novr 1918<br/>of all colours. We soon guessed that the cause of it was that Germany had accepted the armistice. Our boat then went mad too. On confirmation of it being received, several cases of whiskey were given to the troops &amp; they celebrated also, some well &amp; some wisely. Peace is a foregone conclusion, Germany after carrying out terms of the armistice not being in a position of offer much resistance or show fight. It took over four years to do but by jove we did it, &amp; everyone satisfied to go home &amp; hoping to be there for Xmas. <br/>Arrived Colombo on 29th departed on 1st &amp; Fremantle expected to be reached on 14th &amp; W.A. troops disembarked. Did not arrive Fremantle before 16th Reported strong wind blew us out of our course &amp;</p>
