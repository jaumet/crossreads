<p><strike>Thursday</strike> Friday May 11th<br/>Was up very early as we had to get ready &amp; have breakfast by 7.15 am. After being inspected &amp; fooled about waiting for our passes etc, we caught the 9.5 am train for London. It was a lovely journey. We went right along the South west coast of England, &amp; the scenery was beautiful at places. We arrived at Waterloo station about 1.30 pm &amp; marched through the city of Westminster to Horseferry Road, Victoria, where we received a ration allowance of &pound;1.4.6 for the fourteen day. Had a very good meal at the war Chest fund's club, for which we paid a shilling. Went per underground train <strike>to</strike> from St James Park station to Bow Rd station, &amp; walked out to Mr Robinsons place at Lifevre Rd Bow. They are very homely people, &amp; made me most welcome. Their unmarried daughter is staying home with them.</p>
<p>Saturday May 12th<br/>Went down to the meat markets at Smithfield with Uncle. (I call Mr &amp; Mrs Robinson uncle &amp; aunt) this morning. There wasn't very much there, &amp; what there was, it was very dear. I was very tired when we arrived home. We had to walk the biggest part as all of the busses were too full. Went to Miss Farmers place at Ilford this afternoon. Miss Farmer is a very great friend of Tal's (Miss Robinson) Spent a very pleasant afternoon. It was a lovely day. Had a very rough ride home on the tram, it was very jolty. looks like rain this evening.</p>
