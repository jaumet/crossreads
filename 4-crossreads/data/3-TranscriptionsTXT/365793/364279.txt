June 29  to wait until Tuesday for that eye. Went (with several of the boys in a drag) to a sort of garden party, & it was pretty decent too, only the rain pelted down when things were going strong, & the wind blew like one thing. Yes - its great weather for summer time! Five more chaps are living with us now, so guess our family looks promising
30 H.O. today. All except A class men leave shortly for Monte Video Camp - which is another mile or so from town. Went for a nice long walk over the downs & along the beautiful lanes
