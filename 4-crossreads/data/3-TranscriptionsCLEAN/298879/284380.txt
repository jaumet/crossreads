May 1915Monday 24Raining Slept well last night. Feel very weak. Had to leave hospital to make room for other patients  HMS Triumph torpedoed by a hostile submarine. Very quiet day. Wrong date
Tuesday 25Fine. Great relief to see the sun come up on a clear day. Left hospital today to make room for other patients. HMS Triumph torpedoed by a hostile submarine. She turned over and sank in about 10 min. I with others of the Batt. saw the whole catastrophe. It was an awful sight. The submarine as far as we know has not been captured or sunk.
