"War is lost" but fiercely resented our laughing at the matter. He said the morale of his men is no good. Other prisoners also kept arriving. I now received orders to again attack at dawn and drew up issued orders. This meant going up personally into our newly captured ground and seeing Greene Proudfoot to whom I personally issued orders. Returned then to Bn H.Q. getting a few shells round our ears. Ordered the RAP up to a Copse now about our front line and sent up Anderson to make a report centre there. We had a long wait before rations turned up and found that Burrage had been wounded in the leg and sent away. Settled down to arranging details and was very busy over the telephone for quite a time. At 6 a.m. the barrage opened and is to continue for half an hour. It seems a good one.
