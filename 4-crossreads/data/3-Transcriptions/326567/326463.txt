<p>came back to Camp &amp; turned in.<br/>Thursday 14th 6/17<br/>During the Morning I wandered about the Bush which they call here Woods, I was charmed at the numerous Flowers especially the Wild Honeysuckle which is very plentiful &amp; smells very sweet. The Brier Rose grows everwhere also wild violets, As for Bird life there are several kinds, they are very numerous, one Bird whistles like a Canary they are everywhere also the Cook Koo he calls out now &amp; again, especially in the Morning early he is at his best. As I am writing these lines I am sitting on a Box amongst the Honeysuckle &amp; Briar Rose &amp; the birds are flittering about me everywhere, as the weather is fairly hot there is plenty of shade. After I had Dinner I had a bush bath. I got a Bucket of water from the soak &amp; took it into the bush &amp; stripped off &amp; had a good sponge, of course bye and bye we will have all these conveniences provided. Every night there are trucks of Timber arriving so it wont be long. As I was booked on Duty at Midnight which they call here 24 oclock Driving</p>
