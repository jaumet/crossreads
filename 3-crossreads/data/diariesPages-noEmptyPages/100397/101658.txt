well back when our fighting squadrons are about. I saw one brought down a couple of weeks ago. he came down like a meteor, but unlike one he left a Trail of black smoke across the sky. an air fight is rather exciting but it not exactly pleasant to watch a plane, coming down in flames, or to see the wings shot off it even. it falls like a wounded bird ? but its all in this game I suppose. I heard the other day that Jim Elder was back on this side, but so far have not had time to look him up. Eric I also heard had gone to a Machine Gun Coy.
Sorry to hear that W. Selkirk has taken up arms again, and hope that he will not be able to come across. I guess he wont like the place when he does get here.
When J. is over again will you please thank him for his letters and tell him I will write as soon as possible, but cannot do so just at present, also thank Harry for his, will write him also when opportunity occurs.
