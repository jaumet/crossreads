<p>Saturday 20 January 1917</p>
<p>Regiment gone on Reconnaissance, &amp; stayed in the first time on record. I've missed a Stunt for sickness but gland not too good, making use of time to write some letters, have posted you a Gippy paper re Rafa. [The following sentence crossed through]  I hope you &amp; Day &amp; Dot are now out of the heat for a bit, &amp; change is very necessary &amp; don't worry about me, I'm alright &amp; will soon be marching home again I hope. Did I tell you the simple way the gunners hide their guns from enemy aircraft &ndash; simply a nett like a Tennis net or what I had over the fruit trees at M. Any distance up quite a blank &amp; so light &amp; easy to carry.</p>
