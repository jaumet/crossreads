My dear FriendsYes, we are still here.  It does seem very dreadful - 92 Sisters in idleness for a whole month but we can only wait in patience.  We believe the shipping is the great difficulty.  You will know how dangerous the seas are at present - when even Hospital Ships are being torpedoed.  I wish we could wait in the country - and to stay away a night is not permitted.  London is very fascinating & there is always plenty to do & see - but the weather is cold and disagreeable & snows every day.  Every one says what an exceptionally severe winter it has been.  I go out very little, but always take advantage of the sunshine when it does appear and then usually go for walks in Hyde Park & Kensington Gardens.  I know them rather well now & its interesting watching the riding in Rotten Row.  I don't think the majority ride well and the horses are poor.  I love best to watch the lovely children one always sees in the parks with their nurses & by the river where the children go to play is the sweetest statue in bronze of Peter Pan.  The dog's Cemetery is near there too, with the little Tombstones - and when I read the inscriptions on them & look at the fresh flowers that are on the little graves of these bygone pets.
