<p>When the boys come home</p>
<p>We are proud of our boys, our brave boys<br/>who for their country are fighting<br/>Not for the sake of conquest or gain<br/>but for the wrongs that needed righting<br/>For the sake of the lands that lie ruined <br/>For the sake of the homeless &amp; sad<br/>For the sake of the loved ones in homeland<br/>They have given up all they had <br/>We think of them there in the trenches<br/>In the cold the mud &amp; the rain<br/>With the fiery shells bursting round them<br/>While they fight with might &amp; main<br/>But what keeps our brave boys so steadfast<br/>with courage that never gives way?<br/>The Lord stands beside them to help them<br/>and he is their strength &amp;  their stay</p>
<p>But where did they learn of this Saviour<br/>save from the lips of their mother<br/>or from some comrade who loved him<br/>who spoke of Him one to another<br/>But some had forgotten this Saviour<br/>Till danger, death &amp; alarm<br/>(when the comrade fell dead beside him)<br/>made them fly to his sheltering arm</p>
<p>But what about you in the Homeland<br/>Is this Saviour precious to you<br/>Do you pray him to keep these dear lads<br/>&amp; commit them to him anew.<br/>are you keeping your promises to them<br/>are you helping with all your might<br/>To comfort cheer &amp; help them<br/>who have bravely gone to the fight</p>
<p>When this terrible war is ended<br/>&amp; the boys &ndash; the brave boys &ndash; come home<br/>come back to loved ones - &amp; mother<br/>ah! what will they find when they come<br/>a world where all is against them<br/>a struggle for life to begin<br/>or their loved ones &amp; dear mother <br/>awaiting to welcome them in.</p>
