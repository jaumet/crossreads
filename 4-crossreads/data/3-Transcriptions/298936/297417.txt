<p><strike>Saturday 18</strike></p>
<p>Up early &amp; found we were still in mid stream anchored near a French warship.</p>
<p>Paraded &amp; took a squad at physical drill.</p>
<p>Nothing else to do today. Still anchored when we came up from dinner.</p>
<p>Hospital ship just in.</p>
<p>Rumours of torpedoes outside.</p>
<p>Left at sundown just as a transport from England absolutely crammed with soldiers arrived.</p>
<p>Out of sight of land at dark.</p>
