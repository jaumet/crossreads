<p>16/1/16<br/>From here could see the Pryamids of Giza and those of Sakkara too. Returned and pulled up at Groppis there one seizes a plate and fork and walks round the shop taking as many cakes as one wants. Pay at desk and then into teagarden to eat them. Plenty officers met Kingie and Billy. Took the latter home in the car. Found on arrival there Gerrand had gone to hospital at Palace.</p>
<p>Back to Shepheards, Fogarty &amp; Co in possession of 391. Sundry drinks and then to dinner. Moet et Chandon all more or less 'so so'. Liquers after. Shepheards not half the place it previously was, the dinner very inferior. Notice posted up in vestibule that all officers have to rejoin their units before 2200 tomorrow. Something doing?</p>
<p>A true specimen of Eastern sensuality to be seen here. In the bar is a fat tarbousch with pendulous jowl, lack lustre eyes and a growth on his neck, eating all the time. Plenty of money &amp; ministering solely to himself, disopbeying the law of Prophet prohibiting liquor. At dinner he gorges and gorges ravenously, sinking into a kind of lethargy or sleep of repletion in between the courses. Awakened by the waiters he sets to again tickling his palate until at the conclusion of the meal he can just lean back in his chair like some satiate beast. Between meals his huge stomach breasts the bar and he stands or sits like some filthy beast. His nights probably are likewise devoted to himself.</p>
