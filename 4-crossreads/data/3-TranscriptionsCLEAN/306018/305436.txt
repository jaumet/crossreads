  
 June 1917 Wednesday 6th Men who were away on leave came back & a few more went, only 2 from B Sqdn.  We are moving from this camp in the morning.  Got more papers & parcels. 
 Thursday 7th Reveille at 3.45 am.  Had an early breakfast & were on the move about 7 oclock.  We only about 5 miles to travel.  The New Zealand Brgde passed us on their way to our old camp & we occupied theirs.  We were all settled down in the new camp before noon.  We get a fair bit of dust here & no swimming.  The days are warm still but in the afternoon there is always a cool breeze. Saw a few French Algerian troops, I believe there are a good few here now.  Enemy planes have been less active.  Ours have had a few successes lately, so they are not so keen on coming over.  Artillery on both sides are very active & we heard the Turks had made a local attack without success. 
 Friday 8th Got more papers & parcels.  Quite a good supply of stuff came from the Comforts fund  & there was also a couple of bottles of beer per man.  Wasn't feeling so good at night.  Had a lot of stomach pains & no sleep 
 Saturday 9th Had a bad day.  Bowels in
