<p>Wednesday 31st October 1917</p>
<p>Dolly stayed in bed. I went to Red Cross &amp; took Dolly to see Mrs. Granville for lunch who is also going to Egypt &amp; is our O.C.'s wife. We sail on Monday via HAVRE, MODERNE, TARANTO in ITALY.</p>
<p>Had dinner at Frascatis, Oysters, Steak, Partridge, Sweets, ices etc. so you what rot food restrictions are but you must pay for it. I write this as a Raid is on, special Constables blew whistles &amp; everyone goes to the Cellar or ground floor if possible.</p>
