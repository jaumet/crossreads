<p>Everyone is kissing in the streets &amp; no one seems ashamed of it, procession after procession goes by singing &amp; beflagged roaring its way towards the Square &amp; the "Hoe".  A piper comes past followed by dancing crowds of young chaps with their girls, &amp; Boy Scouts are out in their glory the restaurants are packed to the ceiling &amp; hungry crowds wait outside.  Aussies climb all over the horses &amp; wave their flags like fury shouting &amp; yelling the while.  At last I reach the Hoe &amp; this beautiful &amp; historic place is crammed with people all laughing &amp; shouting.  I pass by old Drake looking stolidly out to sea &amp; wondering if his spirit which is in the people of Devon will ever be called upon to rise &amp; inspire old England.  There was a great crowd round the old hero's statue, Drake is just idolized in Devonshire he was born here &amp; just close by our Camp is the Church where he used to worship &amp; was married.</p>
