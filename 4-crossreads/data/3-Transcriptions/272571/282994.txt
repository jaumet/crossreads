<p>in mud. We left Sarpi Camp for No 3 A.G.H.  In order to avoid the muddy roads we sailed over in small boat across a bay in which there were a great many brightly coloured boats of the sailing type presumably fishing boats belonging to the islanders.</p>
<p>Dec 22nd Wed.<br/>R &amp; I went for a walk around the villages which were widely scattered and built any old how. They were out of bounds to troops from twelve till five oclock. Later we saw a number of windmills situated on a raised part of the island. These windmills were built of stones and do not seem to change their position like the windmills that I have seen. We went over to the church which stood on the outside of the village. We could not get inside it but peering in through the window we saw figures painted in gaudy colours like those in R.C. Churches. The grave-yard surrounded the church and in the corner of the churchyard was a small house into which the bones of those, after they have been a certain time in the earth are thrown. This little house was half full of human bones of all kinds. Rather a strange custom and gruesome manner of doing things. A military graveyard begun</p>
