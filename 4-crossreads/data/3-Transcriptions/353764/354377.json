<p>I stayed in Camp all day to enable the W.O. to take an all day trip to the Barage. Uncle Charlie came down to my tent to-day &amp; we had a long talk.<br/>To-day I heard unofficially that we were to train so as to be sent to France, but will find out the truth later on.<br/>The Turks have been sighted within 12 miles of our advanced posts again to-day but they do not seem anxious to attack.<br/> I will review our position as far as I know it.<br/>We have been here a fortnight &amp; are not yet recognised as a Unit.  I have also heard they are forming a 2nd Australian Division in Egypt for the purpose of sending them to France but I do not quite know the truth yet.  We have reverted to our original Corps now viz 20th as the former 20th have taken up their original Corps the 14th.</p>
<p>10.1.16<br/>To-day has been an important one as I paid a visit to The Virgin Marys resting place on her flight</p>
