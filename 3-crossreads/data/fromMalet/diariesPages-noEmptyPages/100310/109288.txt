29/8/17 Campagne 
Again wet and threatening. At 8.30 am moved to a stubble field just outside the village and sat down. The concentration of the Division started by different roads and at 9.30 we moved on to the Divisional parade ground following in rear of the 21st with band playing. Pegs and markers were out and we were in position in good time. The 5th Bde was in front and the 7th Behind. After a stand easy F.M. Haig rode up with an escort of lancers flying the Union Jack On the signal from General Smythe's pennon we presented arms together ? a fine sight 14000 men and the bands crashed out a few bars of ?Australia will be there". The slope and subsequent order were done by flag also and we stood easy while Fighting Bob's brigade was looked at. After riding right along he came down to us and called me up. Asked about strength officers etc and commented on the good turnout.
