 23rd Eight of us were taken for a motor-launch trip, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We went miles up the Nile, which is now in full flood.  Saw a few quaint old water-wheels, and a lot of Cook & Sons tourist steamers, now lying idle and deserted.  We passed numerous feluccas and native rowing boats toiling slowly along.
