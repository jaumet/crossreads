6th. The shooting match was resumed this morning, the shooting was only average right through, but I could do no good at all my black eyes settled me, at 300 yds I missed the target 6 5 times out of 7 I could have sworn I held it steady true but my damaged eyes were deceiving me. Len shot very well again.
C.Coy. won the "best Lewis Gun team" by  a point from A pretty close going. Starkey came back from Paris last night this morning he went to Hospital. Voting day today for Conscription or otherwise, I voted "yes" this time I am sure that there will be a big majority in favour of it this time how ridiculous unfair it seems that all those under 21 are not allowed to vote, this privilege should be granted at once, if a man is good enough to risk his life all for his country why in the name of all thats holy shouldn't he have a vote.
Sending 3 parcels of souvenirs over to Mr Duke by one of the chaps who ar is going on leave tonight, hope he gets them over safely
