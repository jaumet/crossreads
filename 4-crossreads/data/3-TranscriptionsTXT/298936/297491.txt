December, 1915
Tuesday 7
Still shelling.
Howitzer started again in the afternoon &amp; smashed a dugout near our ward.
I felt pretty " perspirey" laying helpless on my back.
Hurried orders to send walking cases to the sap, &amp; stand-by stretcher cases.
3 more shells &ndash; whistling slowly towards us &ndash; the terrible suspense!
Then they burst further away &amp; all was quiet again.
Egyptians mistook bomb for [indecipherable] &amp; six brought in Hospital ship.
