25/5/17 Bouzincourt
A warm day. In the morning fell in marched to the Divisional School for gas experiments. Several clouds were released from the cylinders while we had our gas masks on and a good deal of smoke was released from smoke bombs making a good show. The men marched well and we had the Band out. During the afternoon Capt. Bunning took charge of the Battalion and Stewart and myself rode over to the Brigade Horse Show where the General others were. A good turn out. We got four seconds. Afterwards rode down to Baizieux and saw Matthews. The German prisoners live in a pleasant place here. What a lovely place France is in Spring time!. We rode back through beautiful country like a garden where crops were all green and lovely and where women were working in the fields. Fruit blossom was heavy on the trees, the woods were thick and shaded with many colors of green and such a peaceful scene one could not well imagine.
