July 1st 1916  Saturday
Very cold last night - slept beautifully - very nice day but on the cool side - On Guard all day - C Section busy fixing up a hospital for clearing purposes only. About from 5 till 9 pm, we witnessed in the distance at Ypres - an aeroplane duel also heavy firing - went for a stroll around the Village - quite a treat to get a glass of fine beer 1 [centime] per glass - Tea - coffee - cocoa 1 [centime], postcards 3 [centimes] per dozen, the people generally are so natty & clean to a fault almost. (2/7/16  Sunday)
Nice cool day - Got permission to go to the Cathedral for 11 o'clock Mass. It was a very nice service & happened to be High Mass, they finished up with a procession of the of the Sacrament around the Village, they carry out Catholicity to the letter here. The Cathedral was erected 1821 & beautifully finished inside, lovely carving etc. Father [blank] speaks English very well altho the sermon was in French. In the afternoon I went for a stroll thro some of the lanes & thro the farms. The Germans were in possession of next Village Hazebruick for 3 days, the Tommys & Australians came & drove them back to Ypres, the women tell me they had all their stuff packed to clear out &
