 The weather is very threatening today with thunder so suppose we are in for it at last and the prospect is very unpleasing no provision whatsoever has been made so we can look forward to a wet time. I have had letters from Burmac [?] things seem to be pretty well right there, what a pity it is for prices to be so high in such a good season, it is to be hoped that the papers are right about the coming harvest, that ought to releive the situation a lot. Our usual water ration is a gallon a day but a hitch occurred somewhere and we have been drawing as low as 1/3 gallon, pleased to say that things are back to normal today. All our water is brought up nearly to the top by pack-mules from an Indian Transport Corps, and our own men carry it the remainder, practically everything is brought up by mules, there are hundreds of them here and everyone good, they are nearly all pony-size but of great strength and activity, they apparently dont take the slightest notice of things that would drive a horse balmy. 
 You are pretty close to being correct when you said this was a tough nut, we are in hopes that it will smash all of a sudden but as far as we are concerned there seems every prospect of a long struggle. 
 Will stop now with love to Annie and the family from Yours sincerely R Mackenzie
