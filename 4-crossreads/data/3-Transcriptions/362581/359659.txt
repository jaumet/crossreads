<p>My darling little Eddy,</p>
<p>It will Gun's birthday in the morning. How I wish I was with you. Anyhow I shall think of you   &amp;  picture the morning greeting to dear Grandma. Hope to be with you next time.</p>
<p>We have travelled some this   week   &amp;  seen most beautiful country. The crops are really excellent about here   &amp;  cannot imagine it is a war country. Of course it is very quiet here after our last place.</p>
<p>the only thing that reminds me of war here is the Troops marching through,   &amp;  the guns being out onto trains.  Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. From Auntie Eadle.</p>
