Posted Diary yesterday at Gibraltar still here- There was a Bull Fight on the Spanish Main, but we could not go in Uniform or should have been interned-  Diabolo is the great game here among the children, & they are very skilfull at it.At 6.30 pm everyone has to report back & if from neutral ground go home.We shall be here for some days yet repairing ship I am pleased to see so much of Gibraltar-  Had lunch at the Mediteranean Club & saw the Cathedral, an unpretentious building-  Cigars & Tobacco very cheap here & good.Am Changing my Cabin mate as he has been drunk for 3 days   Some firing in the Straits  * it is reported we have got an enemy submarine.
