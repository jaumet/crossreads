<p>laid out so enraptured am I that I have taken plans &amp; intend to copy it if I can when I get home.</p>
<p>The back with its formal garden &amp; rectangular paths, square plots of grass &amp; ornamental yew flanked by hedges &amp; yew gateways is very pretty whilst in the centre a huge hornbeam gives a lovely shade where afternoon tea is enjoyable below is a terrace &amp; then lower still the tennis court flanked by 6 scotch firs 300 yrs old &amp; then the river or rather back water &amp; in the distance the far stretching field though not too far for Surrey is always hedged in</p>
<p>On left is a wilderness full of Rhodendron &amp; azaeleas in full bloom which has completely caught my fancy for in a small space it has very long walk &amp; 4 rustic bridges over a lake full of water lilies. The very fact that it has gone wild adds to its beauty in my eyes.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Miss Heaton Ellis &amp; Miss [Pinches] come over &amp; we start off with tennis for which I am very much handicapped having no slacks. Then follows afternoon tea in the shade of the thick hornbeam in the formal garden &amp; the cool breeze that comes across while we recline in easy cane chairs reminds me of our cool breezes</p>
<p>The weather is delightful here. Bright sunshine &amp; cool breezes, hot if you are working but pleasant if you are loafing around.</p>
<p>Tonight there is a dance &amp; although I do not intend to dance I go &amp; meet</p>
