<p>12 th December 1916 Gererat  Tuesday</p>
<p>Made a "diagram of Communications" this morning showing where our telephones are situated on the outpost line. At 12 noon the Taube paid us another visit flying very high but did not drop any "Iron Rations" on us much to our relief. But I think he dropped some back further. The guns opened up on him and he was seen to escape through a patch of smoke puffs. I am thinking that he will lay with the cat till it scratches him so to speak. One of these days he will assuredly come to grief.<br/>Bought a camera from Probert a No 2 Brownie quite new so I have got a new toy now.<br/>OHalloran came back from the Signalling School yesterday that makes our total strength 19 men.</p>
<p>13th Dec 1916 Gererat Wednesday</p>
<p>I have been on a lookout Signal Station looking out for signs of a patrol of ours which went out this morning. Rather warm work sitting in the sun all day. Our aeroplanes have been active all day flying in all directions ready for Fritz But he did not appear today luckily for himself. The patrol which went to UM Zuglar was fired upon by Turkish outposts. Long range shots only but shots nevertheless.</p>
