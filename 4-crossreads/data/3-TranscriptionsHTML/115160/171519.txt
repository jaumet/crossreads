<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>I have a few of your letters to answer yet so will get a move on. &nbsp;I see by Lock&#39;s letter that quite a lot of the men who struck have been having a bad time since they went back to work. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad indeed that you were not affected, altho&#39; I see by yours of 11 July that your class has not got much out of it. &nbsp;I am pleased to notice you are on full time, and I presume the 2/6 extra a week will allow of a few bottles now and again.</p>
<p>I see the Highland Society got a knock-back over the kilt question. &nbsp;Personally I don&#39;t see why the Scotch should be favoured any more than anyone else, especially so late in the day as this. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think the wearing of a kilt would induce men to come along any more freely. &nbsp;You don&#39;t see too many of them over here at all. &nbsp;One of our crowds has a Pipe Band&nbsp;</p>
