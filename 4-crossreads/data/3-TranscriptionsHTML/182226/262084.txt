<p>The sand is everywhere as the wind has sprung up, we were out digging in the morning &amp; were almost smothered. In the afternoon it became so bad that we couldn&#39;t be taken out.</p>
<p>The sand flies about just like rain, cutting our face &amp; hands not to mention filling our eyes &amp; ears.</p>
<p>Gambling is going on hot &amp; strong 50 piastre notes (&pound; - 10/-) floating about all over the place. All is fine form. I am going easy myself as I have leave to go to Cairo tomorrow &amp; do not intend to lose that over a game of cards.</p>
