In addition to the foregoing, Herr Gustave Weber, who acted as Judge here under the German Administration, is still residing in Rabaul, where I have promised he may remain until the end of January, on account of his wife's condition.  Herr Weber was one of the Officials whose services I temporarily continued in an advisory capacity, and the assistance he had rendered to Captain Manning has proved invaluable.
