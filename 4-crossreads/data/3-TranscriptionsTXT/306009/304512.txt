1915Nov. 26 Fri.The Egyptians (or Arabs as they should be called) are a very poor race.I always have a mistrust of & dislike for "Gippies". They have no backbone at all & are sly & cunning. Guess their army would not win many "scraps" & the Gippy soldier is always on the lookout to "hum" feloos off one of us.  The lower classes are more like animals - running about in filthy rags & living in smelly little mud hovels - the poultry living on the roof of the latter & the domestic animals (if any) occupying portion of the "Mansion".
