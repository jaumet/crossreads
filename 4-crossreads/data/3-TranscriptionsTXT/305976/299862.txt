No leave granted but promised route march in afternoon.Major               OC. Transport gave lecture. Several Queenslanders made a break for shore and about 50 broke through guard. At 2pm route march to North Fremantle. All hands angry on walking. People gave us fine reception & gifts of Fruit & Cake very acceptable as food on transport could be better.One notices the quietness of places like Fremantle after Sydney even Melbourne.
