<p>leaving Hobart. Teddy could not be persuaded ashore at all but eventually he gave way &amp; we went for a walk. About eight o'clock he turned back "for bed". His opinion of Hobart was not worth 6/8.</p>
<p>30th September Things were getting very slow indeed. The Chief Engineer had the boiler fires "banked" &amp; there was no word of leaving. A Naval officer examined the life saving gear &amp; inspected the men at fire drill.</p>
<p>3rd October. The Second Officer called us up to the chart room &amp; seeing that nobody was hanging about he showed us the Naval instructions regarding the use of Wireless Telegraphy in convoy. That night we went to the pictures &amp; in the interval the apprentice Roberts noticed some girls he had been to the pictures with a few nights before. They ignored Roberts however, so being rather hot-headed he blurted out "You don't know me now but you ate my chocolates the other night." It was rather rude I admit but we had to keep him quiet. The people of Hobart are homely &amp; oh! so homely. In fact they look like a lot of wowsers to be expressive &ndash; they are not all wowsers by any means. They are like Teddy in retiring to roost at 8pm &amp; arising with the advent of breakfast.</p>
<p>4th October  Chief Officer, Teddy, Apprentice &amp; myself decide to go for a  sail so on being granted permission we got the coolies to lower the cutter, &amp; hoisting the sail</p>
