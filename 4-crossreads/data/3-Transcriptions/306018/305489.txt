<p>February 1918<br/>report.  He is taking me back to the Regiment, told me I would do better for myself if I was with the Regiment.  Cpl Marriott I believe, will be sent down to relieve me.</p>
<p>Wednesday 20th<br/>Went to the Kursaal to see the "Million Dollar Girl".  The play was very well done &amp; is one of the best I have seen the "Scamps" perform.</p>
<p>Thursday 21st<br/>Have been fairly busy these last couple of days.  A boat went to Australia on the 15th taking quite a number of troops mostly wounded in the recent fighting.  There is a good deal of work to do clearing up their Records.  Had some rain at night.  Went to the Obelisk Cinema at night.  Posted photos to Todd &amp; Philip</p>
