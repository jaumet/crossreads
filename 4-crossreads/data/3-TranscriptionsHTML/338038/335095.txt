<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother<br/>As I have been some weeks away from all postal communication I am sending you a cable today to say that I am quite well.<br/>Where we have been the last few weeks, things have been pretty hot. Am just down here for a few days spell and am expecting to go back there at any minute.<br/>Censorship regulations prevent me from giving any news. Sufficient to say that our boys have made good. To use the expression</p>
