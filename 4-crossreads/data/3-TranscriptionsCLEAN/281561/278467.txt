  
 This is her first commission since she was raised and there is some arguement, about whether she is seaworthy. I am certain we will see more dinner times than dinners for there is not suffient accomodation for half the men. 26/4/18. The Colonel has refused to sail until alterations are made in the accomodation on board. We drew alongside the wharf again and had general leave from  9.A.M. Went to town and went for a spin in Norwood's car. Spent a pleasant evening, and returned to the ship at 11 oclock. 27/4/18. Leave again, all day. I guess I can say a long while in this bonzer burg. Motoring with a chap all the morning. Called on the Norwood's again. They wandered back to the ship. Where they are.
