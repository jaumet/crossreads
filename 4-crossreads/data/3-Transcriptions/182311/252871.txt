<p>My Dear People,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I am back at the big war again but able to look back on a very good time at Base; the six weeks I spent there were perhaps the best since I left Australia and certainly since I came to France.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Living conditions and mess at the C.T.S. were of the best and quite a reasonable amount ofliberty after school hours was allowed.&nbsp; This gave one time to make little tours to Rouen, that famous cathedral town, to Trouville, one of the most famous of seaside resorts for Parisians, to Etretat, a small and highly select resort among picturesque cliffs and crags, and to Octeville again at the seaside where there was an area which we used, a French machine gun range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All these little journeys I made a fter school hours or at the week-end, they took me to or through the most interesting county and my oftenest expressed wish was - &quot;Oh, but I wish I had my camera!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Blake, A.I.F., Capt.Claude Furze, London Rifles, and myself secured week-wnd leave, a formidable looking pass-port, hired a car and one Saturday at five o&#39;clock set off for Rouen; we travelled first alongside a canal running at the foot of cliffs and it was there that we had our first check, a blow-out occasioning our stopping for twenty minutes, and being eaten at by an enthusiastic horde of mosquitoes.</p>
