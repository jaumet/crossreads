they are now after him, but I think they will be lucky if they ever get it, for to the majority of men a bottle of whisky is a very tempting thing to have thrust into your hands to look after.
Reached Southampton after a run of an hour a half I am now sitting on the wharf writing, within a few yards of me lies a big ship they are embarking horses men for Egypt, while the great cranes are swinging big guns about as if they were blocks of wood so easy do they handle them Southampton at the present time is full of shipping the harbour looks crowded it is a nice day.
They have fine big assembly sheds here it is crowded with all sorts, soldiers of scores of different units, sailors, civilians, Flying Corp men, yes even plenty of Japanese a lot of the crews of the boats are Japs.
We had our dinner here or rather tea for it is now 4 oclock, the boat sails at 6 I believe wonder how I will stand the run across the Channel.
