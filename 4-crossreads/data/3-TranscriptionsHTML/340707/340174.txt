<p>This is the first time they have played since the commencement of the war. Then I press forward &am; see the plenipotentiaries off &amp; get into the different courts by assuming I have the right to go there &amp; the soldiers let me go &amp; finally return to town.</p>
<p>At night the town goes mad The Boulevards big as they are are impassable save at a snails paces. The crowd form processions &amp; barge through one procession consists of a Union Jack &amp; 2 Australian flags probably the most conspicuous procession in Paris Place de l'Opera is crowded &amp; one of the opera singers sing to crowds ending up with Marseillaise &amp; crowd dont join in the chorus. How unlike Australia &amp; this in the highly temperamental nation of France.</p>
<p>Everywhere street dancing is in progress. Wild groups dance hand in hand &ndash; carry the girls shoulder high &amp; do all that the thousand &amp; one mad freaks that can be done in moments of excitement &ndash; at 3-30 pm I have to lay down as my heart is giving signs of knocking up.</p>
<p>I reach home about 7 am the following morning &ndash; tired &amp; all that but still it is the only time that a peace like this will be signed in ones life &amp; that one will be at Paris.</p>
