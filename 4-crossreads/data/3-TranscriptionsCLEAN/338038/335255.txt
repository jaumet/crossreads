After 3 weeks without mails, needless to say was delighted to have your letters of 3 Sept. also Adam Lindsay Gordon's poem illustrated from the Pater -Strange that in neither of your letters is any mention of hearing from me, but I see you are in possession of the address 111th, so take it some of my letters must have found their way along. By the way, my Brigade is still 11th, only the Battery number was changed -
Had also a letter from Mr Broughton this mail
