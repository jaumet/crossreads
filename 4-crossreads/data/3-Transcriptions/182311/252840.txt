<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve just been sitting in Frank Fairweather&#39;s billet, he has quite as good a fire as we have and the mess waiters brought up a cup of coffee and some gingernuts, (you know how much I like gingernuts) we talked of this and that and then decided to finish our letters and go to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With best wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from</p>
