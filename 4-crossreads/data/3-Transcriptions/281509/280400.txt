<p>1916 June 26<br/>Monday</p>
<p>First news this morning is that 37 have been picked to go forward up the line. Tony &amp; Bob omitted self chosen. Two former put in names to go. Staff Smith dies not want to let any of us go. Consents ultimately. We had a soft easy job on the wards &amp; could retain it if desired, but we decided it was our duty to go forward. Rest of day taken up preparing for departure in morning.</p>
