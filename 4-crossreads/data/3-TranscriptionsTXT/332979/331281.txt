After we were instructed how to Load we had to Fire one round after repeating the orders given by the Officer Commanding. At 200 yds naively. One round at the Horizon & when he blew his Whistle it was the signal to fire. Then we were ordered to load again & repeat same orders again & then fire. After firing two rounds we were to fire the three rounds left as rapid Fireing. This was duly done but not altogether as a large number of us was new to the game & at a bit nervous for the first time. Then we were dismissed until 5.45 Pm. After having Tea & a Smoke & rolled our Overcoat we paraded at 5.45 Pm. The Guard Consisted of 3 Sergeants 7 Corporals
