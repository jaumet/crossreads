 Semakh June  May  7th 1919 
 Dear Mick 
 I am writing form Semakh which is a railway station a picturesque conglomeration of not more than usually dirty Arab huts and a few tents &amp; horses of the occupation people on the Shore, southern end of the much famed Sea of Gallilee. 
 It is really very beautiful here the Sea or lake laps very pleasantly against the warm grey face of the edge about 10 to 20 feet high &amp; bathing morning &amp; evening is most enjoyable. 
 I am much better than I thought I could be and tearing out pictures by the yard. 
 I visited &amp; sketched Tiberius  to  a motor ride of about six miles from here.  Tiberius is really lovely &amp; if one could only begin Palestine from this end instead of the Desert it would give a much better impression. 
 Round about here there are wonderful subjects just now.
