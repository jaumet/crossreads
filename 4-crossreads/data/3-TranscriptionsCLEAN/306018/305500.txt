March 1918board.
Wednesay 13thThere is a fair bit of work coming in especially on Wednesdays & Thursdays.  An Australian mail was delivered today.  Got 1 letter from home, one from Doles & 1 from Edna Ferguson.  I believe there is another boat arriving in a few days time.  There was a social at the Australian Soldiers Club.  Quiet a number of nurses were there & we had a nice little evening finishing up at about a quarter to 11.
Thursday 14thThe day was very warm & windy & dusty in the afternoon.  Nearly everybody is putting up blue & red stripes.  A soldier leaving for active service in 1914 can wear 1 red & 3 blues.  Then there are good conduct stripes turned down on the left sleeve & As on the colour patches on your shoulder for Gallipoli service.  I havn't taken to wearing any of them yet.  Some of the chaps will be stripes & colours all over if the war goes on much longer.  Put in for a pass for a week end leave to Alexandria.
