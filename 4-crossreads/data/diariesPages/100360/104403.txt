Monday. July 16. Jacko, Towny & I got busy & made a new Grease trap. It rained lightly at intervals during the day. The mob are going for a Route March tomorrow, but thank the Lord, the Sanitary Police are exempt. Received a nice long Letter from Mrs Jack B.
Its about time we got some mail from Sydney. Some of the Nightbirds" are out on the track of a Piano. The horses they had in the Amb. waggon bolted, & they nearly came to grief. Blanton was aboard, so we can look forward to a full account of it in this next issue of the Tattoo 
The Piano arrived after Tea & we had a sing-song & Buck dance in the Mess Hall. It was quite one of the most enjoyable evenings we have spent for some time.

Tuesday. July 19th. We got going today for a Concert at an early date. There is plenty of new Music, & we ought to put on a good programme. Payney came back from Warloy. 3 new men have joined us, & Billgy May is with us, so our prospects are bright. Last night our Soccer Team played the 8 Mac. Gunners, but were disappointed, as they expected a win, but the final result was Mc.G. 6 – us - 0
