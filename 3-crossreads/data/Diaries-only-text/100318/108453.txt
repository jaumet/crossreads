Boulogne
been on leave at Penzance. Having been in both places soon got deep in conversation and we fought many old battles over again in the smoking room over a glass of port. Walking round to the other club I met Bateman took him around to the R.T.O. fixed up him to travel by the passenger train tomorrow. Returned to the Club and there had a yarn with a little mademoiselle who came in to close the shutters. She spoke no English but could follow my bad French. The streets were thronged with soldiers of all kinds. Before going to bed walked along the darkened streets and up the quay.
