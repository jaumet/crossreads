<p>folk are having a holiday, but I haven't heard of anything in our camp.</p>
<p>Well, dear mother, there is but little news, so I'll finish, hoping to write a longer scribble next time. Don't get down in the dumps. I am all right and well and always lucky.</p>
<p>God bless you. Tons of love and a big kiss from<br/>Your loving son<br/>Ken.<br/>X X X X X</p>
