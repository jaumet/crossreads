but the shortages" are always treated as a joke in the Army."This over we were dismissed & then the football was produced & soon all the boys were up to their neck in it oh" how I would like some of my people to see this lovely country I am sure they would love it as much as I do for it is so beautiful, & I believe every man is better in his heart for seeing & living in it.We got a lot of lollies this morning from the "Comforts Fund."Had a short parade this afternoon & had to get all the men's name's who have passed their shooting test before joining the Battalion  They also got all the mens signature's who had put in for the "Anzac Book" it cost us 5/-.
