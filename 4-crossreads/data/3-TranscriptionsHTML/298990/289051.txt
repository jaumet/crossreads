<p>L'Etoile 25/10/16 old and who has not been in residence here since the war having another place at Boulogne.  This is a new fashioned chateau and is rapidly going to rack and ruin.  The walls are tapestried and the room we mess in has some very fine original oil paintings.  One is a gruesome thing depicting a huge gallows tree all hung over with corpses dangling from its branches.  Some are new some are old and a rank vegetation growing luxuriantly beneath the boughs sprouts through the skeletons which have fallen.  Crows pick the bones.  We unearthed a pianola and have revelled in Strauss, Wagner and selections from all the operas.  There is a fine ebony table in this room &ndash; made of ebony cunningly inlaid with mother of pearl it is worth a great deal. All this good stuff is much knocked about and the good carpets are deep in dirt and rubbish.  I have a sitting room which is excellently furnished with a fine writing table and chairs and a bedroom containing bookcases full of standard French novels.  Tried four cases at orderly room and dealt out 14 days F.P. to some drunks.  This curse of drink commences as soon as we get into billets.  We are about 15 miles from Amiens but if Smith gets back in time I hope to have a run in there to feast the eye once more on the carved dream of stone that is the exterior of the cathedral. All the clothes I had in the wash have been stolen and in consequence I have no change in underclothes.  The French are deplorably weak on sanitation.  Latrines are on the pit system and the reek that ascends from the decomposing excreta is enough to turn the boldest stomach.  Life in a little village like this must be a simple thing devoid of excitement.</p>
