24/6/19 Bath. Sutton-Veny
taken. Then with Davis to the house of a Dr Scales where we had tea with the family. A good view from here of wooded gentle uplands all hedge intersected. Round the Bath streets are many invalids and peculiar old bathchairs drawn by individuals quite as odd in appearance. Some of these chairs are even carried to the expense of having glass covered in front and look like mummy coffins as they are pulled along. As a "bad" I don't think Bath is in the same street as Wiesbaden. Caught the 6.30 train back to Sutton Veny flying out from Warminster in one of the many cars plying for hire. Missed dinner but the mess cook knocked up an A1 omelette. Found a few things to do before bed.
