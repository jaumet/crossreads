 set in a clump of nice tree there was a fine old castl , I could have look on the beauti landscap for hour , I was so wrapt up in Franc , howev I was brought back to earth by a basket of French cake biscuit be thrust under my nose by a littl French girl , these were veri welcom for I was veri hungri . The Major let us rest here for near an hour , he recognis the beauti of the place , gave us the full benefit of it , from here the road led down a pretti steep hill into the town itself , where the French or should I say the Flemish peopl were all out to see us march through their pretti littl town
