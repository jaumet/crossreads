<p>27/9/18 Cappy<br/>Moving day. Knowing the rubbish and salvage that accumulates after a 3 weeks stay in any one place I ordered a full marching order parade &amp; piled arms and dumped kits out on the grass. Cleaning parties then went through the lines. At midday I made a close inspection and found some lines good and others distinctly bad. After lunch all the salvage was collected in a heap and it will take a limber to shift it. Tried covertly to keep our football team out by putting them on a guard but Anderson innocently referred to footballers being kept out so I cancelled the whole thing and ordered every man Jack of them up the line. We do a night march and concentrate 10 miles away near Peronne before dawn. A busy</p>
