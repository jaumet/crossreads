Hope you had a very Happy Day
My dearest Mother.
I'm on Night-duty again, so writing first thing on your birthday. Things are very quiet here   &  find it hard to keep awake. Shall get all my letters up to date if here long.
Sad to say two of us are here for Temporary-duty   &  not liking it, miss all our friends.
