 Sunday 16th April:- I have been lucky enough to make the acquaintance of a very nice French family living quite near the camp in Vieille Chapelle. In the family are the father &amp; mother, 3 sons &amp; 3 daughters. The father is a Lieut. Col. in the French Army and is supposed to be at Soisson; one of the sons is at Verdun, and the other one is missing while the 3rd  &amp; youngest son (aged 13) is at home. There was another son but he fell earlier in the war. One of the daughters is married &ndash; her husband is also fighting. Does not this show one the seriousness of the war &amp; the vital importance of winning it, is to France. We have had a peculiar combination of weathers since arrival &ndash; one day fine, 3 wet, 3 fine, &amp; then the last 5 as windy as could be &ndash; a cold, strong wind blowing off the ocean.
