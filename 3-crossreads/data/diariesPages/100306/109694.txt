7/2/17 Rouen to Amiens
sightseeing. From here to Boulevard de Belges (fine wide streets these French boulevards) to Base Commandant's office and found no one in attendance all being out at lunch.

The outside is of stone like that in the Westminster Abbey and is turning white with age. It is beautifully carved and some of the stonework seems as delicate as lace. The towers are odd and the Tour de Beurre is fine. The tall spire rises from the centre of the church. A beggar woman opened the door and received a sou for her trouble. The interior is magnificent and excellently lighted and well kept. The pillars are massive and well carved ? over the entrance end of the church is a fine rose window.
