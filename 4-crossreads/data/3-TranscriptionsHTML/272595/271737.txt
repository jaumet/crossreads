<p>despised "Aussies" this war would have been over long ago, its very foolish of English papers talking in the Chronicle strain for it only sows resentment among the Colonies, that little article which appeared in this mornings papers has set the whole Camp talking nasty things, &amp; speaking for myself makes me boil with rage for it is such an untrue &amp; false statement.<br/>7th.  Very misty &amp; dull this morning but I think it is going to be a fine day after the sun breaks through.  Lindsay Graham is going to the O.T.B. today so I will be left on my own for the rest of the Sgts are a pretty lot of heavy drinkers &amp; their society don't appeal to me in the slightest, I don't think I will ever get over my hatred of drink</p>
