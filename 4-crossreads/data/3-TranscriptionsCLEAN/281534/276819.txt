It continued to snow after dark and lay inches deep over all - walking along one's feet sank right into it. At mess who entertained a dreadful loquacious "May God Bless the Reading of His Holy Word" person from the Y.M.C.A. who afterwards tried to give a concert & failed. I am rather fed up with them. Took Jack round to Legaits and we put in a very pleasant evening singing and talking - I acquire more and more facility daily. Yvonne has Percy in chains that may become permanent unless he takes a pull and asks for leave or something else to get himself away quietly.
