  
 Thursday, 14 January, 1915 Every thing seems to point that we will move shortly our horses being fed six & seven times daily, whilst our saddlery is being well rubbed & cleaned. 
 Entries closed to night for our sports meeting to be held on Sat. week.  A fine programme has been arranged and I expect to run well in the V.C. race with Sammy and also in the relay race.  They are the only two I have entered for.  More stray mails received. 
 Friday, 15 January, 1915 We have received a lot of gifts from kind donors such, as rice, tea, cocoa, chocolate, raisins etc. which are greatly appreciated. 
 There is plenty of Aust. news circulated about the camp now, as we have rec. a lot of Aust papers it seems that they know as much about our movements in Aust as we do, and our letters are three weeks late with the news. 
 Issued with extra pair of blankets to-day, I now have 5 and an eiderdown. 
 Rec. a letter from E at last to-night dated 11/12/14.
