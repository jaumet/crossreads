<p>Fritz the big gun would let 3 or 4 shells go, I'll bet it made Fritz mad<br/>1st July. Another month started &amp; we are going downhill to Xma's, but I firmly believe the end of the year will see the finish of this gigantic war everything to me seems to point to it &amp; I only hope I am right, for I am full up of it, its not so bad if we were on the move all the while, but its the sitting back in the trenches that kills, the constant drudge day after day, for there is very little difference between one days work &amp; another, except perhaps we might work 20 hours one day &amp; 24 hours the next, people have an idea I think that a soldier lives a life of comparative idleness, what a shock they would get if they tried it on</p>
