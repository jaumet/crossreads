 Thursday 2 May The Boche has been fairly quiet again to-day but what few he has sent over have landed close to our billett, "duds" everyone.  Very warm. Playing cricket all day. Hankin wounded up the line this morning. 
 Friday 3 May Still on the Northern outskirts of Hazebrouck, doing little else but play cricket all day. Beautiful weather.  A walk to Hondenghem this evening.
