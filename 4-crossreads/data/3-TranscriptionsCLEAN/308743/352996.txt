6 July 1915Tuesday
A very quiet night for once, a little rifle fire on the right after lunch we went for our usual swim & afterwards went up for a view from Hill 701 Nothing much to be seen only the Turks (2 guns) sent a few shells after one of the trawlers & destroyer, had tea, Turks sent 5 howitzers shells on to our positions from Courtneys to Hells & beyond knocking the parapets about only succeeded in injuring 2 men & then by burying them, we again went to 701 at 6 pm & watched our mountain baty shelling the road (lyditte & shrap) under the Gaba Tepe , an 18 pounder of ours helped the 6" Hows to silence the Turks 5 [indecipherable] (partially) the gunboat on our left was busy shelling our friends at sunset. Two howitzers were rendered fit for service under Capt Pace & were to be put in position tonight. Two aeroplanes were reconnoitering over the Turks for a considerable time this evening.
7 July 1915Wednesday 47 wks of soldiering
Things very quiet during night only an occasional burst of rifle fire & bomb throwing. In the morning we paid a visit to [indecipherable] & had a few shots at the loop holes, the Turks must have changed round for their men are very eager & daring & expose themselves but now they have lost a few they have calmed a little. Went down for our usual swim after lunch & found the water rather leady as a couple of guns in the olive grove were throwing it about a bit. Our howitzers got on to them after a bit & temporally silenced them. About 6 their 6" started to shell [indecipherable] with high explosives & after they had put in about a doz they turned it up & then the wounded started to appear, they got 10 altogether 2 seriously. A 11.2 gun shelled the M Gun Baty this morning but did no damage they appear to come from the direction of Maidos & is of a fat pattern. An effort is to be made tonight to draw the Turks fire at 9.15
