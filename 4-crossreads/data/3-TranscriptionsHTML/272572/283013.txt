<p>I left Sydney on the 29th of March on the steamer Kanowna with  150 NSW women &amp; 100 Queensland men.  We anchored in the harbour for about an hour &amp; sailed about 4.15, perfect weather favoured us all the way <strike>to Melbourne</strike>, though a few men were sick.  We passed Gabo Island the following morning, the view being lovely.  On Friday 31st March we approached Hobsons Bay &amp; after sticking on the mud we berthed at 5.30 PM &amp; we were allowed leave from 6.15 to 12pm, we enjoyed our trip to Melbourne very much.  Melbourne impressed us as a very clean &amp; pretty city. Saturday 1st April at 1 PM, we cast off but lay in the stream till 5 PM, it commenced to drizzle &amp; the weather got quite squally &amp; a lot of the boys were sick.</p>
<p>Sunday broke with rough weather, we ran out of our course to escape a gale, which the T.S. Suffolk, that sailed from Melbourne which sailed before us, warned us about, she however got the full strength of the gale while we only got on the outskirts of it.  A lot more of the boys were sick, while I was off colour with a headache.  (We also took on board 50 men from Victoria, 20 Tasmania 40 South Australia) Monday weather still rough &amp; nearly all the boys were sick or off colour.  Tuesday weather still rough &amp; boys still sick Claude also.  Wednesday weather a little better</p>
