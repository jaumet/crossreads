<p>7 Thursday<br/>A very nice day, it is quite a change <strike>after</strike> to have a whole sunshiney day, after the very changeable weather of the trenches.  I don't think I mentioned about the flies out on the field, they are absolutely in droves of millions, but there is one good thing they don't seem to pest the life out of you like the domestic fly, they either go for the dead or the meat in the cook house.  Sleeping &amp; cleaning up all day. Things are very quiet here.</p>
<p>8 Friday<br/>The people down in the South of the western front seem to be very reserved.  Detailed for washing wagons in the morning, as they are to be taken down &amp; loaded in railway trucks in the evening, I also had to wash 3 pairs of wheels.  We are still in ear range of the firing, but I don't know the distance to the line.  Left Longvillette about 8.30. arrived at Douleons about 10 entrained &amp; left Douleons at 12.30 am &ndash;</p>
<p>9 Saturday<br/>Slept during the whole journey arrived at Poperinghe  (Belgium about 7 am.   We then marched to Reninghelst, where we waited all day in a vacant allotment for our billets  The people here seem to be a far better lot than down on the Somme district, more obliging.  We are about 6 miles from Ypres &amp; about 8 miles from the firing line.  Harvesting is in full swing here.  Went into our billets about 4 pm.</p>
<p>10 Sunday<br/>The Belgium language is <strike>very</strike> much like the German in some instances.  A very fine day.  A very big fog in the morning.  Went for a walk round the town in the evening.  Very quiet all day.</p>
