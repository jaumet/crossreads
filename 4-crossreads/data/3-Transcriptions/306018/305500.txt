<p>March 1918<br/>board.</p>
<p>Wednesay 13th<br/>There is a fair bit of work coming in especially on Wednesdays &amp; Thursdays.  An Australian mail was delivered today.  Got 1 letter from home, one from Doles &amp; 1 from Edna Ferguson.  I believe there is another boat arriving in a few days time.  There was a social at the Australian Soldiers Club.  Quiet a number of nurses were there &amp; we had a nice little evening finishing up at about a quarter to 11.</p>
<p>Thursday 14th<br/>The day was very warm &amp; windy &amp; dusty in the afternoon.  Nearly everybody is putting up blue &amp; red stripes.  A soldier leaving for active service in 1914 can wear 1 red &amp; 3 blues.  Then there are good conduct stripes turned down on the left sleeve &amp; As on the colour patches on your shoulder for Gallipoli service.  I havn't taken to wearing any of them yet.  Some of the chaps will be stripes &amp; colours all over if the war goes on much longer.  Put in for a pass for a week end leave to Alexandria.</p>
