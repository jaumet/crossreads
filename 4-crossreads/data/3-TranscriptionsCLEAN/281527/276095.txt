  
 29/1/18  London 
 Feeling rather tired did not go out until about 11 o'c  and then walked to Leicester Square there taking the tube to the Bank. Found that there were no letters for me and then tubed back to Piccadilly. Before that, had lunch costing  8d at a Lyon's cafe. Much struck by the tired wornout looks of many of these women workers. Poor neurotic sweated looking things.. Some very pretty girls among them but they have no colour. In the tube the type of men is undersized and weak looking. To the New Theatre to see "Peter Pan' which I much enjoyed and then walked up the Strand dining at a cost of 10d. A dark thronged street this. Tubed back to hotel about 8 pm.
