 I went to Perham Downs on Saturday 15th June. I was re-classified &amp; marked B.I.A.2  The Depot was situated in pretty miserable surroundings Ludgershall being the nearest town to us &amp; it was a one-eyed place.  I had my teeth fixed up &amp; was sent to the O.T. B. where things got worse  We were tormented from reveille to Retreat by the heads  Having kit inspections &amp; other ridiculous rot until we were glad to get clear of the place.  I left in a draft for France on August 15th  We had a good trip across &amp; arrived at our 3rd A.D.B.D on 16th Aug
