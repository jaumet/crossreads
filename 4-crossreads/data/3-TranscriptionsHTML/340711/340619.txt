<p>Monday, 27.<br/>No hot meals yet. Iron rations. Bitterly cold---rain, mud, slush. Horse lines in rotten state. Exercise of animals at 6.30am. Chains like ice. Later took horses etc. down country lanes---very pretty. In afternoon took them to village of Feutre. Booked for Orderly Sergeant in night. Cpl. Taylor acted for me. Went into Havre with Bdr. K. Came back late 9.45. Havre dead. All lights out 9.pm. Very few people out. Read notice outside public building exhibiting latest telegrams that the Australians had arrived at Marseilles!</p>

<p>Thursday, 30.<br/>Orderly Sergeant. The life is very enjoyable in spite of the work. There is no system, but we manage somehow. Pay about 10.pm. 120 f. They pay, it seems, at the rate of 1 franc = 8 &frac12;d. We get ten pence worth for it.</p>
