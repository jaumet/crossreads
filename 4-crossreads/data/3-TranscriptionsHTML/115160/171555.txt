<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>Sunday again, a glorious fine day and yesterday too, but everything was white with frost this moring, and thin layers of ice on the puddle-holes. &nbsp;I hope the fine weather continues.</p>
<p>Last night I sent Dad an &quot;Aussie&quot; and you and Bess some cards, which I hope you will receive safely.</p>
<p>Well, the war is not&nbsp;over yet, and it looks as if the Hun is doing as much hoodwinking as possible. &nbsp;There is a limit tho&#39;&nbsp;and he will come a horrible gutser yet, I&#39;m thinking.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t had any mail during the week for none has reached us from the Column. &nbsp;Last week we received our extra blanket and winter issues.</p>
<p>12 Nov 18</p>
<p>On our way to Germany.</p>
<p>What great news it is - the war is over! &nbsp;We are victors, and have come out on top at last.</p>
<p>I have not much to say at present. &nbsp;I hope you are all in the best of health and spirits.</p>
<p>I will continue at the first opportunity. &nbsp;I am OK.</p>
<p>Fondest love to all,</p>
<p>Your loving Son</p>
<p>James xxxxxx</p>
