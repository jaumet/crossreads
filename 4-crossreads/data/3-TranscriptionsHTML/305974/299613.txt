<p>18 Thursday<br/>Route march early in morning.  Not a very hot day.  Paid &pound; 2-1-0 in afternoon, or otherwise &pound; 2 in Egyptian money.  Took a photo of Bill Daisley &amp; Murrey Jones.  Went up the street at night.  Deaths here from heath &amp; other diseases average about seven a day.  The natives <strike>here</strike> language seems very easy to pick up.</p>

There were a few fights between men through the influence of liquer, &amp; a good few of them were put in "clink".  A very fine day, with a cool breeze blowing.  Went up the street in the evening, but as there wasnt much doing we came back home early.</p>
