Saw troops advancing & fighting seemed to be forced now, both rifle & art. Fire heavy. The L.H. division holding up re'fts arriving from Beersheba did splendid work. However at nightfall, rfts got too many & to save outflanking, div. had to retire enabling Turks to join up. Heavy fog in A.M. delayed action & but for that fight might have ended differently Labrynth only redoubt untaken & Turks heavily reinforced during night & 53rd compelled to evacuate their position. Tommies fought well in face of hellish fire & lost heavily. Early on 26th,  L.H.D.  A.M.D. took Gaza & did some splendid work a Sqdn of 5th LH, & sqdn of N.Zs & a troop of 7th, rode through charging with bayonets fixed on h'back. Came across 3 Turkish Guns & guard of 40 men & charged 26th - them killing all & turned the Guns on to Turkish positions. Blew one up & brought two away. Great work clearing thro' prickly pear streets. Our casualties for day very light, div seventy all told. Campbell C.S. missing, believed captured. Went to sleep before retirement & that was last heard of him. Varied & rather dangerous experiences thro night, humorous to a certain extent. Arrived at Hill 310 about 4 & camp about 5 a.m. received a few patients about 7am mostly of 5th. One man Johnstone A. of 5th abdominal not expected to pull through. About 10 am bde moved up to a barley patch to stand to & did not move till about 6 pm then out on Outpost. Bombardment ceased at nightfall.
