<p>audience, the dresses of some of the society belles were an eye opener &amp; jewellery sparkled everywhere.  I can see very little difference in London from the first time I saw her in 1916  there seems just as many people about as ever there was, but there is a big difference in the food line, if you haven't got your food cards you would nearly starve that's a certainty, it was a lovely moonlight night so I strolled down the Strand into Whitehall &amp; then went over past the House of Parliament &amp; over Westminster Bridge the old Thames looked so quiet &amp; peaceful with the moon shining on its silvery surface  I lingered quite a while enjoying this then I walked home down Victoria Street to my diggings</p>
