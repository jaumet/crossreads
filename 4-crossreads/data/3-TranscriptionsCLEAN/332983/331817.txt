  
 I often expected them to wipe us out. We seem to be lucky, we get shells all around us. Either too far, too short, or to the right or left. Just a little strip where our horse lines are they miss. Another thunderstorm this afternoon, turned very cold. After the rain stopped it got hot again. It is now a beautiful bright night with a new moon. A little excitement this evening between an Indian and a driver R.H.A. This driver went to the 15 Indian mule corps water trough to water his horses naturally the sentry, who was an Indian went to stop him. The sentry went to hunt away the horses, and the result was they started to fight. The R.H.A. man hit the nigger in the mouth, the Indian picked up a large stone to hurl at the driver. Some of our men arrived on the scene and put a stop to it. The Indians were greatly excited, they reported the case to their officers, who told them if it occurred again to stick them with the baynot. The water supply in this well is to water 1500 mules. The R.H.A. has a well allotted to them 12/10/1915
