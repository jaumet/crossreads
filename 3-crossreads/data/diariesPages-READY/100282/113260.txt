chance this time.
Things are very lively round here this morning, puts me in mind of when we were in camp in Kensington in Australia, with all the bands and bugles practicising, only one thing was different there was no perpetual roll of artillery nor the scores of planes that are at present flying round here, everything is quiet peaceful this morning all the tents have been struck lines cleaned up, now the men are laying about in the sun resting, the only places where there is any activity is round the cooks line Q.M. stores here a few men are on fatigue, above all this scene of quietness the bands are playing. You can hear tunes from all directions the gentle breeze floats them to us, so taking it all round it is a perfect morning, such as only France Australia can show us, such has been my experience France in all our opinions has a much better climate than England.
