  
 Red Cross letterhead 14.9.17 Dear Dad, Your letters of the 1st & 8th July to hand.  Ellis has gone to see the "Merry Widow" played & I'm trying to get some letters written. So You managed to get up to Old Burwood again.  Do you mind the time that you walked & Ellis & I rode our Bikes down to Mortlake. How are You going to get the Pony Home.  George aught to go down.  He could trot it Home all the way.  You'll have a talk methinks.  It is sure to be a little frisky. I do Hope Eric Merrett looks us up.  We are right glad to meet any one of our old Pals. So Adam Ogilvy has at last become Mayor.  Did Mr Keirle retire?  Is he still a Councillor?
