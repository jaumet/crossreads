<p>This is another school like ours just next door. I am sending this with Ruths to Grandma to save stamps, so I will have lots of money when I go on my six weeks annual leave. I hope my little boy is getting better, &amp; that he likes his tricycle &amp; gives Ruth lots of rides on it. Heaps of love from Dad</p>
