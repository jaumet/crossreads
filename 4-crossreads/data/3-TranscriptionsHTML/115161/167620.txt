<p>would then &quot;move forward&quot; twenty-five yards further each minute until it had reached well beyond our &quot;objective&quot;, remaining there until we had &quot;consolidated&quot; our new position.&nbsp; This is what is termed a &quot;creeping&quot; barrage.</p>
<p>At intervals while we lay on the ground, messages would be passed down the lines (we had in our early days gone through this very necessary training, and in many cases the messages would arrive at the other end very much distorted, and in many cases very amusing)</p>
<p>We lie there wondering if we shall freeze before the time comes for us to make a move.</p>
<p>There is not a sound, all is deathly silence, not even a slight breeze, all, even nature itself, seems to be holding it&#39;s breath during this awful suspense.&nbsp; One feels like screaming out, so uncanny is the stillness.&nbsp; Clouds are beginning to gather, there is every appearance of a change.</p>
<p>After waiting what seemed to us a lifetime, the awful deathlike silence was suddenly broken by the sound of one shot fired (I think) by an 18 pounder as the signal for the barrage to open.&nbsp; Then in a flash the terrible &quot;barrage&quot; opened in all it&#39;s intensity.&nbsp; The noise was deafening, the very earth trembled.&nbsp; (I believe there were about six hundred and fifty guns of all calibres which took part.&nbsp; No one who has not heard, can imagine the awful inferno caused by these all &quot;speaking&quot; at once.</p>
<p>In front of us was a long wall of fire, grand but fearful, caused by the bursting of the shells, and to think that this wall of flame and fury would move gradually forward with us following in it&#39;s wake with still more instruments of death, was appalling.&nbsp; Was it possible that anyone could live through such a &quot;hell&quot;, even a mouse one would think could not escape.&nbsp; What an awe-inspiring spectacle.</p>
<p>It took but a few moments for the enemy to reply.&nbsp; Then down the &quot;line&quot; came the order, &quot;Fix bayonets&quot; and &quot;prepare to advance&quot;.&nbsp; Then a message, &quot;Two minutes to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two minutes to go&quot;.&nbsp; Two minutes perhaps to remain on this earth.</p>
