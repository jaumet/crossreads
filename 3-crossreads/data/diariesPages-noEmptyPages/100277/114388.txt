out to our bitter cost.
5th. A couple of minutes to go all were straining at the leash, the moon had almost gone down there was a faint ghostly light over all save when the flares lit every-thing up in a white shimmering light the ground could be seen to be all watery shiny all of a sudden the strain was over, so were we, I was the first one of my platoon (as I should be) to hop over I gave a few more a helping hand for the sides of the trench were steep slippery off we rushed, as soon as we showed up the flares were sent up in batches which lit everything up like day, showed us men falling everywhere the boys struggling through the mud bogged nearly to the knees for the ground was as soft as a well fallowed paddock after a storm of rain, I was forcing my way through as fast as I could calling for my men to keep up " box on"
