<p>&amp;pieces of shell fell all around us but no one was hit, but 4 horses bolted out of the A.S.C. lines &amp; could not be found this morning<br/>You should have heard the French people when the shells &amp; bombs were flying, they were terribly excited &amp; started running about &amp; looking for shelter, some of the boys quietened them a bit, they were saying "Allemand us bon, "Allemand bombard", some of our planes went up after them, &amp; with the aid of the guns accounted for 2 of them.<br/>Got orders last night to pack up &amp; be ready to move off at 9 next morning I was Orderly Corporal this morning so I had my work cut out to get my work finished &amp; pack up in time.<br/>At 9.30 off we went our Coy leading &amp; all as merry as crickets</p>
