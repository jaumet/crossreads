 1915 June 25 Fri. Tucker has been getting pretty bad &amp; as the result of our growling suddenly became better to-day . For dinner we got tea, cold meat, potatoes, veg. marrow, tomatoes, cucumbers &amp; rock melon - &amp; steam pudding. How's that for active service? Attended weekly&ndash;meeting of Scouts at 7 p.m. How different these Scouts are from Australians, nothing like the cordiality &amp; warmth. The  English here are pretty reserved.
