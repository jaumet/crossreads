The Somme is a frightfully rugged place, but very pretty although the signs of warfare minimises its grandeur to a great extent.The place I am now camped at is called Chandos, is close to Domart.

Everything is bustle here, hundreds of waggons running here there everywhere, both Motor Horsed Waggons.There is great excitement here owing to the magnificent British success. Troops are being rushed through by Train, Motor Car every mode of transport available.The British Indian Cavalry have broken the German lines the Infantry are following them up. Big Motor Waggons are coming through loaded up with spoils of war it is the most animated scene possible to describe.All night long the troops are passing through it is sometimes impossible to move along the Roads.We have left 2/3 of our Company behind at Sailly never do not expect to see them again for some considerable time.
