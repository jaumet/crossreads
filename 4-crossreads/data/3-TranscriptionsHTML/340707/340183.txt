<p>55<br/>which I had made no arrangements <strike>but</strike> &amp; though I tried to meet my American friend failed yet spent a very interesting day</p>
<p>5-7-19<br/>Met Madelon this afternoon at 2 pm also her friend. We were going to Louvre but day is so inviting that we change our plans &amp; visit St Cloud the chateau of which was destroyed in 1870 by the Germans.</p>
<p>The lawns are not green &amp; springy but rather neglected. The grounds are exquisite long shady avenues &amp; quiet rotunda in the basin of the fountain you find a reflection prettier even than the trees themselves. I have bought 21 pc <strike>about</strike> of this spot &amp; they describe place much better than pen.</p>
<p>We see some chairs on top of Trocadero &ndash; the Emperors private garden &amp; go up &amp; seat ourselves Soon after a young women comes along &amp; demands 10c each though there was no notice to show that chairs were not public property. Any how the view was worth the 10c &amp; we sat there for over an hour overlooking Bois de Boulogne &amp; Paris.</p>
<p>Then we wander through the private garden where no artificial lines hurt the eye. The garden is a rustic wilderness with a lake &amp; kiosk</p>
