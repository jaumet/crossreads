Rain continued, so we returned Via Arras. We had a good look around Arras, which has suffered severely through bombing shellfire. Many of the streets are just heaps of ruins, others are scarred spattered with shrapnel. A cold Wintry journey splashing through mud brought us to Houdain, where we went to a small Hotel for lunch. The good lady knocked us up an excellent little meal in a few minutes. Its chief course was the all universal omelette. We arrived at Steenvorde at 4.30 pm.
