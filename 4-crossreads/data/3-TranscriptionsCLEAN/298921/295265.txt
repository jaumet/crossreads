October, 1915Thursday 21A beautiful calm morning the sea cobalt blue, & not a ripple - We give the men boat drill each officer having charge of a boat.In the Gymnasium there are electrically propelled riding Saddles, for exercising the bloated hypochondriac on his voyage for health. I am luxuriating in the hot bath s etc:- knowing what is ahead.Will give these notes to Steward to post when the boat returns to Alexandria as no one knows how the Mails will be delivered in the future.
