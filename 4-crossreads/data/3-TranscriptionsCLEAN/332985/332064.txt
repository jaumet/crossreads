5-1-1917Glorious day, Artillery very active, aeroplanes up in hundreds.  Close call last night wagon line shelled, one landed 10 yards from tent, covering the tent with dirt.  Marvelous  the little damage that is done.  General Bessel Brown in wagon lines, telling the Sgt. Major that 300 reinforcements coming for 1st Bde.  Taking a long time to get here.  A message tonight from Major General Hobbs, to the troops of 1st Division thanking them for their support, & etc.  He is now attached to the 5 Div.  6 horses sent to mobile vet. section.  One of our old Bty. hand, who was transferred to a T.M. Bty. was killed (Corp. Challen).
7-1-1917Cold, no rain.  4 shells just landed in our old wagon line.  Some talk of moving out.  Enemy very quiet last night.  Only 2 or 3 shells over.  Our Artillery were firing almost all night.  A lot of traffic on the light railway running past our lines.  Two small steam engines No. 107
