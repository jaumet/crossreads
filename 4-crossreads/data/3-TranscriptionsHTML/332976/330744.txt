<p>November 1916<br/>10th   I have been on the construction of the drain we located a few days ago, superintending about 300 infantry men of the 7th Brigade.<br/>The weather has been beautiful all day &amp; we have witnessed numerous air duels between our own planes and Fritz's.  About 2 P.M. I saw one of his planes brought down in flames near Longueval &amp; about an hour later another was forced to decend, but landed in his own lines.<br/>11th   I am still on the construction of the drain &amp; have had the same infantry party as yesterday.  The weather has been fairly cold all day &amp; a heavy fog came up this</p>
