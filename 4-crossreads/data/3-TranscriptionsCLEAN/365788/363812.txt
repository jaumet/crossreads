  
 We will have to have another Christmas when I come back I am too far away. Please kiss your two dear daughters & the fine son for their loving Uncle. We get plenty of Tobacco issued to us & some Cigarettes. Lately I have given up pipe smoking & taken to Cigarettes only. Very much love to you all & with best wishes for a Merry Xmas & a Bright New Year. Your ever loving brother Fred
