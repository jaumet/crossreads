Dear Col. Travers,
I have just received advice that your application for return to Australia for urgent family reasons has been granted by the G.O.C., A.I.F., as a special case.
Before you go I want to say how sorry I am to lose you both personally and in the interests of the service [indecipherable]  I want also to thank you for the excellent work you [indecipherable] while under my command, and to express the hope that you [indecipherable] find matters all right on your return to Australia, [indecipherable] may be able to return to us in the future.
With Best Wishes and Regards,
 
Yours Very Sincerely.
