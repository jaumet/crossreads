<p>January 1917<br/>Monday 1<br/>Went down to beach. Bombed by Taubes 3 shells fell close to me into the sea. Others went into a palmgrove. 13 casualties among British troops. Terrific wind blowing. Had the coldest swim I ever had. Drew rations at the dump and loaded up the pack camels Pinched some fowls so had poultry for dinner.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2<br/>Nothing doing. very squally and showery.<br/>Another visit from Taubes but they did not drop any bombs</p>
