<p>Scotchmen treat me very well &amp; I'm quite happy in my new job.  Cold better, &amp; plenty of work.<br/>Near here are antiquities &amp; Tombs with the bones of many past generations I have not had time to explore yet.<br/>I am posting you some Negatives, which you have printed if you like, but P.O.P has become so dear &amp; scarce in Egypt that I send you the Films only I have labeled the Films what they represent.<br/>Many good Films are spoilt by the Native photographers as Developing Mixtures are almost unobtainable in Egypt.</p>
