Rid has an Oakley uncle at this address in Southampton "Corbie Lynn," 82 Lumsden Avenue, Shirley Southampton, whom he is very anxious for me to go & stay with if the Artillery should go for training to Salisbury Plains as there is some rumour they may do.  He had very nice letters from the wife & daughter inviting him there if ever he got to England, that was while he was in Alexandria; of course, man-like, he extends these invitations from himself to me though I feel quite differently about it myself & should not go there without something more than that.  However perhaps you might keep the address, & in case you got a  tele  cable just  saying  giving Oakley Southampton as the address you would be able to supply the rest.  I don't think it is likely but one never knows these times.  I think if I have to do any any travelling about by myself I will do it through Cooks & very probably get all my letters through them.        All this is just in case, dears. Wal expects to be on picket duty again this week & that means that most mornings he drops in for an hour or so, or else we journey out somewhere for that time, and often it includes an extravagant visit to Groppi's for ices or tea & cookies, disgraceful of course in war time, but Wal's mad generosity of course! Horrors! how ever many "of courses" do I manage to bring into each letter I wonder, it begins to dawn on me- rather many!  I never read my letters through when they are finished, I hate them so, & would be tearing them up instead of sending them if I did.          On Friday last Wal & I walked down to the river, about half a mile from here, & Wal hired a boat for an hour & an Arab paddled us about.  I read some of my home letters that had just come & Wal took snap-shots.
