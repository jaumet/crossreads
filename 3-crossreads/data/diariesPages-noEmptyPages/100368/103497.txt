There were some pretty pieces of country situated amongst those barren hills. We marched along the splendid road that has been made here, when we got outside of the long line of tents we cut across country on to a narrow and rough path on which we could only walk in single file. As we climbed up the hills we passed villages which have been built, very high up and the higher lands are used for sheep rearing. Herds of sheep and goats are all over the hills. Some of the sheep have bells hanging round there necks and there moving about gave a very pleasing sound in the still quietness of the land. After a little refreshment we went in and had a sulphur bath. This was paid for by one of our odfficers. This sulphur bath was very refreshing. It came from out of the earth and was exceedingly hot. The room was lined with enamel tiles. The water poured out into four basins and by means of tins we poured the hot sulphur water over us. 
We returned by short cuts to the camp again and arrived back about four o’clock.
