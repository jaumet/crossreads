<p>be here at 6 a.m. to complete my packing.   We move off at 9 am for fresh fields and pastures new.   Praying for the best.</p>
<p>It was thoughtful to ring up our Buddie My letter reached Buddie rapidly, but you should have received one a day sooner than she, unless it be that hers was delivered on Sunday Morning &amp; you had to wait until Monday.   Is Mollie Power as jolly as ever.   The Maitland girls have been accomplishing wonders for the Belgian &amp; other war funds.  Rene will be an organiser of note before the war ends.   She wrote that my Caliban is not visited by her this year.</p>
<p>If we here had our way, some postal people had been hung shot and quartered long ago.   We would be as very Germans towards them.  The officials in the post offices here are civil and courteous, they are all Christians, Copts, because education is much desired by them as a class, a contrast to the Mohammedans, who do not desire the children to be taught, Alla being all sufficient for them and their children.<br/>The supply of Munitions is a problem with more combatants than the Turks, Lloyd George, Kitchener, French &amp; others cry out with loud voices more guns, more projectiles, more of all destroying engines &amp; projectiles.  It is hard to know what to believe in the cablegrams.   The fighting in France appears to be about even still.  Holman has plenty of knowledge &amp; heaps of brains.</p>
<p>Glad to learn that you were pleased with my cable, I may send you another at the end of this week.   Why has Mary O'Connor not written to me.  I have written to her &amp; her mother.</p>
