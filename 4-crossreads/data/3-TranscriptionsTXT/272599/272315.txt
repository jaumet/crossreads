 1917 Thursday 15 Feb. 
 Not much sleep last night  Make up for it today. Gas alarm blown tonight but only a little lachrymatory noticed.  Received late letters from base from Evelyn Emery, Rube, Bert Edwards, Miss Bullen &amp; Arch.  A few extra cases thro' during night. Fritz is towelling up our front lines mostly with pineapple bombs. Our artillery also pretty active.
