<p>France<br/>1.9.18</p>
<p>Dear Roy<br/>Well it was a surprise when your letter arrived a couple of days ago was beginning to think you had forgotten I existed. But I know your weakness for letter writing &amp;amp:  Father usually lets me know how things are going with you both so you see I am not so badly off after all. Yes Father did send me a photo of the boy but I am sorry to say I have lost it along with all of my photoes. There is no doubt he looks a very sturdy little chap judging by the photo so I shall have two nephews to make the acquantance of when I return to N.S.Wales. Father said in his last letter Les is very proud of his son. It is hard to picture Les as a married man let alone the dad of a bouncing boy. He will have to down now he has a wife &amp;amp: family to look after. Yes going up there was the making of him. It got him away from the crowd he used to knock about with in Sydney. Miss Smith says his wife is very nice so he is very lucky. Bert will feel rather out of place now the only two left single but perhaps Bert will be taking unto himself a wife when he returns. Oh well I shall put in my time then between the three places Harry Crosses wife says she is going to see me married to an English girl before I return to aust but don't  think she will succeed somehow have bought all the experience I want in that time. Harry is still in England at the Base Parcels</p>
