"Coming down from the Village there was a road, and we had a post of a dozen men, and one officer there.
"He (Fritz) sneaked down and bombed our post.  They drove our outpost into the trench, and we had to "stand to" again on the counter-attack which came about noon."
"If he had come again at night we could not have held out about 300 strong(a) at night until supported by the 18th Battalion.
"Fritz formed up (for counter attacking) in the long grass, shrubs, and the wood.
"The first counter attack broke through on the Third Division.  He (Fritz) marched up the road in column (of route) of fours, coming down the Canal du Nord (b).  When he got close to the front line Fritz split up into three waves."
"His first attack was made on the Third Division, and by the 18th, and came through Feullaucourt.
"Of the other two, as Fritz got behind us, the 17th fired on them, and they melted, and left a lot of dead and wounded.
"There was a lot of shelling on the 19th Battalion, and "minneys" on the 17th.
(a) Meaning the 5th Brigade, as a whole, 300 strong.(b) Clause underlined in red is obscure, if not incorrect.
