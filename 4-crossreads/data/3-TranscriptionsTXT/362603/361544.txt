 3.11.17 Dear Dad, I have Your letters of 2.9.17 &amp; one of some date in August.  Ellis took the latter over to the Isle of Man with Him so I cannot answer anything that You may have written in that.  A general mobilization has been ordered on account of the Sinn-Feiners &amp; the Russian Position.  All leave is stopped &amp; all those on leave have been recalled by telegram.  Ellis will not reach Jurby until 10.30 pm to-night &amp; will have to start away at 6 am on Monday to get here.  Pretty rotten to travel all that way for one day.  He only remarked before applying for leave that he would not go unless He could have 4 days in the Island.  Now he has had to go all the way for only one day.  I do not remember going anywhere with two Officers.  I suppose our mail often gets disjointed on account of the letters that have gone down.  You are right about my Friends.  They are real good &amp; they are only too pleased to do anything for the Soldiers.  We will never be able to thank the English people enough for the unstinted kindness to us.  Of course we are supposed to be fighting for them but I wonder if the Australian Public would do as much if they were in the same position.  I doubt it, from lots of little things I know about some of 'Em.  Australian people hate "Pommies" &amp; say they are dopey
