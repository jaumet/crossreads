 In an attack the men immediately opposite the wire indentation would continue running on, &amp; those striking the straight line wire close by, would, on seeing the men continue runing into the V naturally follow them when massed in a regular mob the Huns would by heavily bombing from the saps on either side create a regular shambles for the men would be caught jambed close like rabbits in a race. 
 While inspecting the effect of our shell fire amongst the ruins of houses &amp; dug outs, along the side of a road when looking for shelter from a very heavy fall of rain three of the men discovered one of what was afterwards described as "Pill Boxes".
