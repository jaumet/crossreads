weather here now it is just simply glorious. We get about in our shirts shorts. I would like to write give you a full account of the different stunts I have been in but you know it is impossible to do so. I suppose Noni will be quite a woman by the time I get home. I showed her to all the boys they all say what a lovely kiddie she is. I suppose you will have her playing the piano before she can talk properly. By the way Tom also Bill Pincott all wish to be remembered to you. Well dear Sis that is all I can write at present so will conclude with fondest love to you, Noni Vol from your brother Hal.Have only received about three lots of paper cuttings from Vol
