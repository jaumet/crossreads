 Thursday, 29 July, 1915 My cold troublesome swallowed some medicine which relieved it fatigues during day.  Drivers came on board and I went ashore  with my mates at night had a good time.  Alex is full of wounded soldiers, &amp; Cairo has more than ever, with Kitcheners Army &amp; 4 Brigades &amp; a Division of Aust as well as the sick &amp; wounded.

 Friday, 30 July, 1915 There are seven Hospital ships in the harbour and they are all going out to-morrow, the painters are working night &amp; day to get this boat finished white paint is over everything &amp; one of our chaps who was sick has returned and a couple of the drivers are coming for a trip. 
 Hot day, swimming &amp; writing our only recreation.
