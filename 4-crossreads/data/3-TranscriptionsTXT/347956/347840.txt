Tue 29thSignalling with H.Q. all day.  the sqd. signallers are not a little dissatisfied as we have been doing practically nothing since we have been working with them as we lose too much time in getting out to work.  we have lamp practice on Mondays Wed. Thurs & Sat. nights & can get passes the other three.
I am stopping in to-night & writing to England.  a roll call has been called last night & is to be continued with. it is all together unnecessary as it is very seldom anyone more than 5 % apply for leave.
Wed 30thHad helio & flag practice this morning the Captain of the signallers (Downing) was with us all day & some exceptionally bad reading was done by by one of the H.Q. stations.  After dinner we received a lecture
