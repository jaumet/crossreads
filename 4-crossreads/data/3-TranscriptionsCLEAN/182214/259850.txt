  
 We left Rail head  at least A Section did & went three miles further out in the desert to Duntroon Plateau. we were now about ten miles out in the desert from the canal & seven miles as a crow flies, over soft sand  we always prefered the road. Water was scarce out here & we led a very simple life indeed we ran a small hospital & most of us got sick in one way & another  Water was pumped out from near the Canal & a guard with fixed bayonet was placed over the storage tanks sometimes the tanks were filled to overflowing then we used to rush over & get a bath how lovely one felt afterwards, but we only got such luxeries once or twice while we were here
