<p>1917 Sept 1<br/>We bought some apples at Burcombe but did not liker them much. We stopped at Bulbridge House and had a game of croquet. Bill&amp; I won. The chemist where I used to buy my VPK films told me thast he had run out of stock, as all Kodak materials came from America and two boats bringing supplies had gone down. Bill and I bought enamel signal flag badges comme ca [picture of two crossed flags] to wear on our left arms. Only fully trained signallers are supposed to wear them but as all in our school were sporting them, we decided to do likewise. Ron Mawson arrived in England only in September and was sent to Larkhill Camp. He wanted to arrange a meeting place for us, so I suggested Salisbury. A sports meeting was held at No. 10 Camp. It was very fair except for the mounted events which were putrid. I had a sore foot so got back</p>
