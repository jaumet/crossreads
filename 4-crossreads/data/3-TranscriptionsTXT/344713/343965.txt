Sun. Nov. 4th: -Moved up to line through Zonnebeke with Hqrs just on far side of village - the most knocked about place imaginable.One pile of bricks is marked out with a signboard with "Church" painted on it - just for the reason of marking where it used to be for taking direction from it.B & D forward Coys, A Coy Behind them & C Coy in cellars at the village.
Wed. Nov. 7thFred. Strickland - my mate on the lines - was killed while with me out on the Duckboards early this morning (about 12.30 A.M.).We were out on "C" Coy's line for hours trying to restore communications & after dodging all the heavy shells of a bit of a bombardment returned to Bn. Hqrs & decided to wait till daybreak.Just going along track to an old pill-box to sleep when 3 "whizz-Bangs" happened along & the third one landed just about 10 yds behind us & as poor Fred was behind me he went down.Got him to Bn. Hqrs "pill-box" where he expired in a few minutes.Lt. Leitch present.A small piece of shell we eventually discovered has penetrated his back & Lungs.He was buried outside of "pill-box" on left-hand side of road almost in a line with old Zonnebeke Gas-works. It was his turn
