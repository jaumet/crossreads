<p>Thursday, 17 June, 1915<br/>A bold move was made to-day by the W.O. who strange to say has altered since he left camp.  He approached the Col with the suggestion that Capt Fowler &amp; he should take twelve men &amp; NCOs and land at Gaba Tepe and risk being sent back if not, and they succeed, the rest will follow in 48 hrs time with stores &amp; equip.  The Col agreed and it was decided that they should draw lots for the twelve to go, once I knew they were drawing lots for it I gave up all hope and as usual my name never came out of the hat.  then one man being sick I had a 2nd chance and again futile so I have to remain behind, the others went in high spirits at four pm.  It is just my damnable luck the same in camp when drawing for picquet I drew the worst   [indecipherable] in 13 weeks.<br/>Friday, 18 June.<br/>A party hired a native mule cart and drove out to Castro the capital of Lemnos, eighteen miles away and spent an enjoyable but uncomfortable day in  their rough carriage.  I was so annoyed and depressed on account of being unlucky re the Anzac party that I could not get the heart to go, so I stopped home and did the cooking for the remainder. I rather pride myself on my cooking now in fact what I have not learnt to do about domestic duties is not worth learning, from serving to nursing.  Last week the enemy tried to reinforce from Mudros but Artillery was played on them with disastrous loss to the Turks.</p>
