  
 It speaks rather well for the postal arrangements that in the stress of war a parcel went right back to you when it was wrongly addressed, of course McDonald is a very common name out here, I never thought we had so many in Australia. I have 5 in my own coy at present & shudder to think of the number that have been in the coy since we started. 
 What a surprise to hear that Dr Poate is married. It would most likely be a French lady & there are very few other than French or Greek outside the native races in that city of stinks & smells. 
 This letter reached me on the 2 Aug, but of course we have been in the big push, so do not know when the letters arrived they were waiting for me as soon as we dropped out for a spell. 
 This has been  Some Push  & don't forget it, poor old Fritz will never forget Pozieres, if he lives to be a hundred years old, especially when he met the Australians,  not the Anzacs please , that term is the favourite one used by the cold footed brigade who pose in front of cameras as  Happy Anzacs  
 Give my best respects to all the members of the Division, not forgetting nursing division & with best regards to Mrs Harris & the rest of the family from your old comrade. W T McDonald
