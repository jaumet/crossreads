The people had fled &amp; abandoned all their belongings, the houses stood just as they were, furniture, pots &amp; pans, pictures on the walls &amp; books on the shelves.   Most of the livestock such as fowls had already been used by the soldiers but our fellows procured a few also some rabbbits.   A few guns were banging away &amp; some of the roads were mined as the hun was only some 4 miles away.   "Aubigny" was a smaller place but equally deserted &amp; it had already been well looted by the various soldiers who had passed through, all livestock had disappeared with the exception of pigeons &amp; there were quite 200 of these flying about wildly as each gun fired.   Clothes, books etc were strewn all over the place &amp; hay &amp; wheat was lying about the lofts being trampled on by all &amp; sundry.   A small cottage allotted for our mess when cleaned up was first rate &amp; we had dinkum crockery for a change.   After tea set to &amp; fixed up a dressing room as the line was only 3 miles distant.  Had 4 sick in from</p>
