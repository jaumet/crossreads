Monday 31
 Fine day snowing at night.
 Artillery activity is marked a Fritz plane has been over.
 The gathering in the hut is complete among them there is much licquor. Bagpipes, songs etc are the orders and it has eventually ended at midnight with "Old Lang Syne" an orgy. I myself am O.K. have put a few of them to bed. The officers lost any spark of dignity they ever possessed. Welcomed the men into the mess for the New Year.
When I look back at 1917 I find it has been adventurous educating. The winter on the Somme was bad enough the Battles of Bullicourt Ypres rank among the most severe on the front. Two trips to England have in me satisfied a great desire to see as well as possible that country.
