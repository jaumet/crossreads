 Paid all hands today:- found great activity among Fellaheins sewing Cotton by hand- many acres adjoining us being good agricultural land.  Two Squadrons moved further South near Assiot ,  but we remain in  Minia  province.  Since Seft Beys funeral s  the natives favour us by carrying all their dead past the Camp.  While I have been writing 3 funerals have passed.  Life is cheap among the Fellaheins- &amp; they settle domestic disputes with a knife or a stick- Got some MAIL in Cairo &amp; Parcel  from May, soapenvelopes Soks  Handkies  -  No more woollen Soks are wanted in Egypt for 6 months too HOT - Please thank her.
