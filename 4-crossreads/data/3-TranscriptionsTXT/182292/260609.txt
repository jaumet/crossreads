A &#39;Hospital&#39; Train
It was at Waterloo Station that I say two Hospital trains pull in with their human freight of wounded soldiers both Engligh and Australian and it was a sight one could never forget all your life. The public are kept back by a strong cordon of police, and they need them too, for amongst the crowds are scores of persons waitig to catch a glimpse of their loved ones, and at these times, they might get quite frantic, and weep and laugh alternatively &nbsp;- to see the women folk carry on so before even the train comes in, gives one some idea of what you may expect, and their mood is catchy and it takes a bit to keep your own pecker up, especially when you may be alongside a poor soul crying her heart out for the poor boy that is wounded, they dont know how badly. Time and time again some poor sould will try and break through the barrier and get on to the railway platform but without success, which results in more weeping. All work seems to cease in the stations and awaits the train. No sign of them yet, but the long lines of cars and ambulances tell their own silent take, and the crowds of nurses, and the ambulance men waiting does likewise. At last two long-terribly long - trains stream slowly in and come to rest quietly alongside with a shiver almost, and all is at once a mass of bustle and excitment.
