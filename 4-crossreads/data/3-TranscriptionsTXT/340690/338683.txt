 fairly cramped using Stott's blankets.  Slept till about six and got up and had breakfast.  Half of section moved out at seven with rest and through Hazebrouck towards Strazeele.  Turned to right at Borre and after some wait moved back close to canal where we worked with 10th digging reserve trenches.  Good job but very tired and worked till 12 and then had dinner.  Every farm deserted and in morning got plenty of foodstuff to carry home, including potatoes, fowls, eggs, rabbits and various other souvenirs.  Places all evacuated in a big hurry.  Very quiet where we were but Strazeele and other side a fairly hot bombardment all day and stopped at 4 and came back on Strazeele railway and through Hazebrouck. Trains running all the time only about 4 miles from line but very foggy.  Some shells in Hazebrouck &amp; railway station and we had to hurry.  However others visited some evacuated houses (very few living there) and brought home all sorts of gear.  Beer, wine, biscuits, food of all descriptions, and beds and various other gear.  Plenty of police but not very energetic.  Had some beer near home and some more shells fairly close.  Our pack horse bolted and upset all our eatables.
