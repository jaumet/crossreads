ago a persistent rumor went round the camp that there was shortly to be very good news for the Australians, said to have come from the King - of course speculation was rife - the King paid a visit to the line & rumours became more persistent & definite till finally this following was the result.  The King had said that there was to be a new Prince & that he was to be called Anzac.  I suppose the King ought to know, anyhow everything was fixed up & the Prince was to be called Anzac as from the 14th of last month - can you beat that?
I can picture you having the time of your life with your feminine chacteristic [characteristic] I nearly said 2nd nature of match-making, what with a party of girls & returned soldiers you would have a happy time & By God!

Humphrey Scott is just back from leave in England & had a fine time, its some spot London, I hope to get there myself some day before long, its what we all look forward to & save up our pay for.  I hope I don't get shot before that - it would be most disappointing.
What about Bill Bailey?  I hope he is well again.  I wonder how long it will be before I see you all again, personally I give the war another 2 years at least & I'm by no means a pessimist, we'll all be forgotten by then, its a damnable business altogether.  Please give my "respec's" to John & don't spoil the kid, its funny I wrote you a lecture on how to bring him up in my last before you asked for it, so you will not need it now, I can imagine he'd be a bit wilful.
Thank you very much indeed for writing & please do so [the conclusion of this letter is on Page 21.]
