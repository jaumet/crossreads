<p>A.M.C.<br/>Liverpool Camp.<br/>Saturday<br/>7.8.15.<br/>My dearest Father,<br/>I have settled down to Camp Life again &amp; am feeling tip top again now.  On my return <strike>he</strike> I reported to the sergeant in charge of this contact camp &amp; he fixed matters up for me.  I am on the staff here until I get sick of it or we get shifted.  We have 6 wards each containing 12 beds, (all measles) &amp; at present we have a full house.  At first I was on the A.M. shift. i.e. from 6 AM. to 2 P.M.  Then last night as they were short of men for the night shift (10 P.M. to 6 AM.)  I got Percy &amp; myself put on that one.  Last night was our first one at the night <strike>one</strike> work.  On the other shift there were 3 other orderlies on beside myself &amp; for about 3 hours we were kept pretty busy with temperatures medicines, washing, &amp; breakfast, but from about &frac12; past 9 till 12 when we took the temperatures again there was practically nothing to do.  I used to occupy <strike>mind</strike> myself with playing dominoes with some of the more advanced cases, or reading.  The Dr. used to make his rounds about 12.  The Dr. in charge Capt. North, gave us a fine little lecture on Measles- Causes, results etc:-  Percy came back on Wednesday &amp; we are a happy little company now.  There are 6 in our tent so that we have ample room.  There are 6 orderlies on the 10-6 shift so we are splitting the work up.  <strike>Four</strike>  Three of us go to bed till 2 AM. while the other 3 work the six wards between them.  Last night we were on</p>
