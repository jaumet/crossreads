  
 30th I had a look at the pictures in the Royal Scotland Academy Exhibition. 
 This evening I went to see the Woman of no Importance one of Oscar Wilde's plays.  It was cleverly played. 
 31st Went out to the Castle again today, had tea at Bobbie Bovis Hotel where I saw two of the "third sex" and had a long ramble along Scott's glen a beautiful glen too.  Reminded me a good deal of my rambles along the Broken Back Range out Rothbury way.
