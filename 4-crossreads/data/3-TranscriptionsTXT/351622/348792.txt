 I think the past fortnight has been a picnic &amp; we are sorry to go. 
 7 March 1916 Tues Struck camp at Reveille &amp; moved off for Ferry Post. Ken &amp; myself told off to go with the mules and sand-carts. Arrived at F.P. at mid-day. Thousands of New Zealanders here in fact I think the whole lot of them. Many of the old stars of football fame are with them such as Roberts etc. A finer body of men I dont remember seeing. They are taking over our positions at the trenches. 
 8 March 1916 Wed Slept under waggons last night. Thousands more of NZ troops passed through at different intervals last night. Left Ferry Post 9.30 &amp; crossed Suez Canal about 10'oclock. Very hot on the march. Passed through Ismailia coming by the Bridal Path all the way at 11.30. Arrived Moasca about dinner where we picked up A Section &amp; many of the other boys who had been to England &amp; Malta Sick. Inoculated.
