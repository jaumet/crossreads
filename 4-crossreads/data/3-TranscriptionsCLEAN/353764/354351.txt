  
 Ships in this vicinity & are now taking a Westerly Course, in between the Arabian & African Coasts. It is a common sight to pass Arab "Dhows" they call them as much as 10 miles out at Sea.  They are very fierce looking men, but I suppose quite harmless, although I would not trust one of them.  They all carry knives in their Belts. 
 The African & Arabian Coast Line is nothing to be compared with the Australian.  It rises abrupt from the Sea to a height of about 700 feet & is inhabited by Arabs & Blacks respectively.  The Water here has a kind of greenish colour, so different to the Pure Blue Colour everywhere in evidence round the S. Australian Coast. There are myriads of Flying Fish here ranging in size up to 3 ft long.  We can now see about 5 or 6 Transports ahead of us.  In all 56,000 men are leaving Australia, forming the 2nd Division and are strung out between Sydney & here in batches, what a haul for a daring Submarine, but hurrah for British power, the Seas are swept clear of these pests in this vicinity.
