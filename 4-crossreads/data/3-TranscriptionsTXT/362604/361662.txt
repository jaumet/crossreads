Dear Dad, Mum & George
There is not much to write about, but I'll just scribble a few lines on the back of Auntie's letter to tell you that we are still doing O.K.  We have moved our quarters again & now Tom (Ellis) Dick our Sergeant mate, & Harry are all together in the one room.  I'll enclose a plan of our "Flat" & you will be able to imagine us getting around.  Ellis was inoculated for the "Simples" yesterday & I was done to-day.  I am not feeling too bad on it & Ellis is quite O.K.  The weather has been exceptionally hot & dry for the last week.  Gee it does get hot when it likes.  I received two letters from Auntie to-day so I must answer them to-night.  I went to Salisbury on Whitmonday.  I had tea on the Lawn at the Close.  It was very nice & a lovely day for a cool breeze was blowing.  I also went up to see Mr. & Mrs. Edmonds.  On Sunday afternoon our Band came out on to the Cricket oval & gave us some music.  It reminded one of the old days on the Oval.  Ellis has gone to a Dance to-night but I was not invited.  I am well pleased too 'cos I want to write a few letters to-night & also do a little reading.  I would like to have a cold shower but will not risk it until to-morrow night as I might catch a chill.  My mate is lying on His bed reading.  If ever you send another parcel send some sugar, will you please.  It is very hard to get & I always like to take my Ration with me when I go to Auntie's place or into Salisbury.  Must draw the plan of our flat now & I have done nothing but tidy up & write letters since I returned from Leave.
Lots of loveHarry.
