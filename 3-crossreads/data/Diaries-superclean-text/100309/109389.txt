11/6/17 Paris
glimpse of Notre Dame could be got. We now walked through other streets to St Severin which is also an old church possessing many arches and queer twisted pillars and a tremendous lot of old stained glass. There were some ladies painting in here and there were also many old tombs as the church dates from the 6th century.
While waiting for Holmes before setting out on this trip I reported to the A.P.M. and then walked round to the Church of St Roch being lucky enough to strike a musical service. Here they have a lot of old bells and some statues regarding the curing of deaf mutes.
From St Severin we went to the Palace de Concieregie passing the Hotel Dieu (or Hospital) and part of the barracks for the Horse Guards. Turned into Saint Chapelle but it was closed and we could not get in. our guide now took us in right through the Palace of Prison Conciergerie.
