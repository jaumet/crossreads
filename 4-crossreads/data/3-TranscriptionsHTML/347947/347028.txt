<p>I had a rather funny experience on the night of Thurs 6/7/16.  whilst asleep in the tent I believe I got up calling out something and woke the whole tent up.  my mates it appears got a terrible shock and also yelled out with the result that I took a flying leap through the door of the tent still yelling and asleep and woke up and found myself outside.  and some of my mates running about everywhere wondering what was the matter but when they cooled down a bit and got me inside again found I had a big gash on my foot bleeding profusely.  must of landed on a stone or a peg of the tent.  I got a long holiday off duty through it.  and when the boys of the tent recovered from the shock they laughed and joked till spinelli blew, at the panic I caused.  they thought the Germans was in on us and on Tues 11/6/16 all the mates who came from Eng with me were sent in a draft to the firing line.  I could not go</p>
