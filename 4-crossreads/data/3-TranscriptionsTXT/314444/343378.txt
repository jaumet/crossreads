Dear Mum

Dear Mum
Just these words from a good man in a damed bad place.  I am in a part of the world that is reeking with everything that is bad. Where I am the heat is always from 100 F to 125 F. I am leaving for the Front in 12 hours time to do our bit. Dear Mum you can bet your life that I will always be there when I am wanted Alec is in the Hospital here, through the same complaint. I have seen some wonderful things pyramids, sphinx I also saw the well that the Virgin Mary drank out of and the Tree that the Virgin Mary and the Child Jesus shelterd behing when fleeing from Herod
