<p>[Written on the back of the postcard on page 366, which shows Castle Street, Ludgershall:]<br/>Monday Feb. 5th 1917.</p>
<p>Had a glorious evening in the Queen's Head Inn. (ten minutes from our camp) All the local celebrities are already caricatured on the walls. The whole village is a fairy land of snow and the "pots" of beer warming right in the huge fireplace more wonderful than any picture you could ever imagine.<br/>Opposite the "Inn" is the little "Sweet Lavender" tea room and a few doors down the snowy street a sign "Officers Messes supplied with Meat. Wreaths and<br/>Crosses a Speciality".</p>
