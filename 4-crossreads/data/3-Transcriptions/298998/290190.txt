<p>made here. By changing the paper often, I am able to preserve the notes. I always use a tube partially depressed and smear a little of the substance on the outside to blind suspicion. My diary will necessarily be written weekly, or even longer periods may elapse. Nevertheless, the details and dates are correctly stated. I would give anything to be able to forget the scenes of misery, agony and brutality, however, that is impossible, owing to the lack of literature and other possible means of occupying one's mind.

No doubt this seems absurd, in fact it is, however, it is perfectly true, and I though it a real treat.</p>
<p>2ND. Several Australians sufficiently recovered from wounds to permit walking; visited us from another ward. According to</p>
