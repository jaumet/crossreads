<p>Corbie to Abbeville some four months back.&nbsp; The trees on either bank</p>
<p>of the Somme, then so dense and brilliantly green, were the only things</p>
<p>I could see through the open roof of the barge.&nbsp; Now they are but an</p>
<p>avenue of stocks through which the river runs.&nbsp; Although unlike the</p>
<p>poplar in many respects, I fancy they must be one of that family: for</p>
<p>the purpose of bordering a river I have never seen a more suitable tree</p>
<p>so tall and straight do they grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amiens is the next town of any size andnits tall</p>
<p>Cathedral visible for miles around seems like an old friend.&nbsp; I well</p>
<p>remember how on our treck from Amiens to Albert - we marched for three</p>
<p>days before we lost sight of that steeple and then almost immediately</p>
<p>we picked up the partially ruined spier at Albert.&nbsp; This latter land-</p>
<p>mark surmounted by the partially tumbled figure peeping over the hill</p>
<p>near Becourt Wood was visible to us in the trenches (i.e. on the</p>
<p>Eastern side of Albert) if not at Pozieres, certainly as far as</p>
<p>Contalmaison.&nbsp; Why it was not pulled down I can&#39;t understand, for it</p>
<p>must have been an excellent direction mark for the German gunners in</p>
<p>their search for our battery positions round about Albert.&nbsp; Sentiment</p>
<p>(one of the Allies worst enemies) was probably the reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Amiens another couple of hours brings us to Paris</p>
<p>where we arrive at seven o&#39;clock in the evening.&nbsp; The train for the</p>
<p>South leaves from the other side of Paris at 8.15 p.m. and the time</p>
<p>occupied in crossing Paris by car from the Gare de Nord to the Gare de</p>
<p>Lyon is about 20 minutes.&nbsp; It is apparently the intention of the</p>
<p>British Army that Paris shall remain a sealed book to its officers.</p>
<p>From the time we arrived at the Gare de Nord until the train left for</p>
<p>the South a Major from the R.T.O.&#39;s office never had us out of his</p>
<p>sight.&nbsp; Whilst we had dinner, he sat on the bottom step of the</p>
<p>Restaurante and I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t breathe freely until the Riviera</p>
<p>train started.&nbsp; One cannot see much of Paris in an hour and a quarter</p>
