<p>who had written a diary whilst a prisoner in Germany &amp; succeeded in taking it accross the frontier &ndash; No doubt some men have met with success &ndash; Moreover, I have not yet learnt of a person using my method to conceal notes of any kind whatsoever.</p>
<p>My fully detailed narrative has been composed &amp; written by myself &amp; is based upon these notes. The experiences enumerated in my diary are precise &amp; authentic right throughout. One or two omissions &amp; a little variation is inevitable. No doubt these few dates &amp; details are vaguely unintelligible to most readers - nevertheless I have experienced no difficulty in compiling the work, excepting the customary labour &amp; mental strain essential to good results.</p>
<p>The success &ndash; if one may call it such &ndash; is entirely due to the trials &ndash; endured whilst in Captivity &ndash; being indelibly fixed in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>Without the diary notes my complete narrative would have been an impossible task to write in diary form.</p>
