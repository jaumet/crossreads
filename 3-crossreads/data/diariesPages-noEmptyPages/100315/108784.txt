14/4/18 ? Lavieville
Some shells were put round our headquarters before dark but did no damage. The Transport took back all our blankets and soiled clothes to the Transport Lines. It was a windy and bitterly cold night. The light continued good until about 8 p.m. and it was after that hour before any forward movement of our relief commenced. Walked up across country to 24th Battalion H.Q. and there saw Col. James and talked for a while. Then across to 21st H.Q. and took over from Col. Duggan completing the relief by about 11 p.m. What
