<p>What ever you do send me a paper with the results of the Kojonup sports <strike>it</strike> in. I had a Post Card from Ted Tunney the other mail, saying that they where all well down that way. Ask Levi &amp; he will tell you the name of the place we are making for, the most Holy City in the World. Have you ever heard the boss say how my favourite Arab mare is looking.</p>
<p>Well I think I have about told you all the news for this letter so I must close with wishing both of you the very best of health &amp; Good Luck. Remember me to all old Friends. Kind regards to the Boss. God Bless &amp; Take every Care of you. "Good Bye for the Present"</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your Loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>Thanks for the parcels I hope to recieve the rest later<br/>W.W.</p>
<p>Kisses for you<br/>X X X X X<br/>X X X X X<br/>X X X X X<br/>X X X X X</p>
