<p>Hospital Ship<br/>Grantala</p>
<p>Oct 4th 1914<br/>My beloved Mother &ndash;<br/>I wonder if you will have posted me a letter before you left. I suppose you left in the [indecipherable] &amp; the girls too. My last news of the family was a letter from Father dated the 17th Sept &ndash; day before Jocelyn's birthday also a letter from Rosamond who seemed very happy and excited at the idea of leaving. I long for a letter from you. I expect you were worn out before you left. I hope you will get a rest on the ship. You will be anxious too &ndash; to get news when you get to</p>
