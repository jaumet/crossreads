  
 The more I see of man The more I love my dog Lafayette 
 Last night I held a little hand So dainty and so sweet Methought my little heart would break So W ildly did it beat 
 No greater hand into my soul Could greater solace bring Than that fair hand I held last night 4 aces and a king. 
 Here's to the man who rocks his child And rocks his child alone For there's many a man rocks an other man's child And thinks he rocks his own
