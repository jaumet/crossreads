<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>I am directed to transmit, per separate parcel post, the Plaque issued by his Majesty's Government as a memorial to those who made the supreme sacrifice in connexion with the war of 1914-1918, which I trust reaches you safely.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the name inscribed on this memorial is that under which the deceased served and died, and no variation to this rule is permissible.</p>
<p>The Plaque, being second-class mail matter, may take a little longer to reach your address. If the delay is excessive would you kindly inquire at your local post office before communicating with this office.</p>
<p>Kindly sign and return the attached receipt for (which can be torn off) at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br/>J M Lean Major,<br/>Officer i/c Base Records.</p>
