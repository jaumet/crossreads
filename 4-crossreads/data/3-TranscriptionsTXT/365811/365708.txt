Dear Mother and Father,I was sitting here a couple of nights ago when a runner came in with 4 parcels I immediately opened them in the presence of a hungry starving mob.
The first parcel revealed a dreadful tragedy. All the beautiful cocoanut ice had gone bad and could not be used for anything I nearly cried. However I proceeded to open the remainder and found all sorts of glorious things in splendid condition The ginger disappeared very toute de suite which is soldier French and means at the double Then I handed out some of the Watson's B which by the was is very eagerly sought after and which is any arriving fairly regularly now. Then in addition to your three parcels I got a very nice one from Bull and Wilga which contained nuts chutney &c so altogether we had a roaring time.
The "Mother's first pair" of sox were excellent work and Old Gran's washer was wanted too and generally have them but have been without for some time now I suppose you were mean Gran Turner if so please thank her very much for me.
I must write and thank Jack Fuller for his cigars they were very good and nice and dry.
Those helmet cap things are very good as a matter of fact As far as I am concerned I have got my tin hat sewen up in such a way that it fits me well without a cap but some of them are fair brutes and will not fit at all I gave that cap to a fellow here who was always cursing at his tin hat and he reckons it is a splendid thing I just asked him if it was really good and he said my word yes real bon.
With the parcels I got letters dated 7th Octr I8th Septr 29th Novr 7th Octr.
