 Armentieres is quite a big City and was before the war a big 
 milk centre.&nbsp; It is almost the size of Marseilles but of course 
 it is dead now, all the big warehouses, banks, etc. are closed 
 up and the railways and tramways no longer run.&nbsp; The tramway 
 system was a regular net work showing that it must have been a 
 busy spot in its days.&nbsp; Most of the smaller shops are still 
 open and there are two very fine afternoon tea shops where 
 officers out from the trenches sip tea and eat strawberries and 
 cream and forget about the war - to properly forget it you want 
 to stuff wadding in your ears to keep out the never ceasing row 
 of the gun fire.&nbsp; The strawberries by the way, just at the 
 present, are as big as ping pong balls - some even bigger.&nbsp; We 
 are not a bit interested in war news here, we get quite enough 
 war of our own.&nbsp; Even the every day joke about the number of 
 prisoners the Russians have captured fails to raise a smile these 
 days.&nbsp; There is one English weekly, The Tatler, which makes a 
 point of not mentioning a word about the war.&nbsp; It is very 
 popular here containig as it does mostly photos of actresses and 
 the like - something away from the war.&nbsp; Most of the stuff you 
 read in the papers about the war is all piffle.&nbsp; A few lines 
 tells all the news, and the rest is bunkum - interviews with 
 &quot;Anzac Heroes&quot; who never left Egypt, and the like.&nbsp; Everybody 
 here is disgusted with all this prominence given to Australians 
 on the Western Front - prominence at the expense of the Imperial 
 and other Dominion troops who are really bearing the brunt of the 
 fighting.&nbsp; Its Anzac this and Anzac that.&nbsp; Any little thing 
 they do is magnified to an enormous extent and when they are 
 doing nothing the journalists are equal to it, and manufacture 
 the most ludicrous stories of events which never happened.
