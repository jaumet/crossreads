<p>back on Kut [Kut-el-Amara] (which we visited two days ago and strolled over the old battlefield.  On the bank the Turks commenced building an obelisk to commemorate their victory, but did not have time to finish the job).</p>
<p>The only remains here are the ruins of the Kings Palace and the wall around the city.  The palace is remarkable in that its height is about 250 feet   <strike>high</strike>   &amp; the stretch of the arch is about 150 feet. The whole of which is built of small bricks girded together with huge slabs of timber.</p>
<p>We had a good look at the irrigation system of the Arabs. Erected on the river bank is a pully over which the ropes run which draw the skins containing the water.  A sloping ramp is excavated and two horses are harnessed to the ropes, each one taking the track alternately. The skins full of water are drawn to a beam</p>
