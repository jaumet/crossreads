<p>Machine gun &amp; snipers very busy right through the night, they were just raining it all around Eaton Hall &amp; the road to the saps. Only a few casualties today. At 8.30 am we heard a feint voice over the parapet on no man's land &ndash; it was the work of seconds for volunteers to get him, with no misfortunes &ndash; his name was (Pte Morris &ndash; 32nd from Sydney) poor fellow had a fractured jaw from machine gun also shrapnel rin thigh, he had been out since last Thursday morning, he had nothing to eat or drink since, of course, we showered our very best on him &ndash; he deserved a trip. Heavy bombardment all day below us.</p>
