5thThe day passed uneventfully.  In evening went along railway line, saw damaged tank & went along another battle front.
6thMarched to Byzantin with heavy packs, this the old Posieres battle field.  Here the blasted scene of desolation was very noticeable.  Debris & salvage lay everywhere - forests were laid bare to the ground.
7thMarched to Bapaume - 10 miles - over the old field through deep mud in places, for the rest over duck boards.  Arrived in Bapaume rather tired after 3 hours hard marching.  Not a single home in this part is left undamaged, some have been pulled
