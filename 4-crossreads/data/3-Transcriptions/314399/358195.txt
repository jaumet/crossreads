<p>Thursday 17 July 1919<br/>Auntie &amp; I talked nearly all day. After tea we went to see Aunt Hannah. She saw us in her bedroom. She looks very old indeed. Says she wouldn't know me cos I was better looking than she thought. Uncle Bill wishes to be remembered to every body home.</p>
<p>Friday 18 July 1919<br/>Auntie gave me a Sov. for a watch chain. Used 10/- towards my fare. Trains were all late. Had dinner on the train. Got into London at 9.15 &amp; then came down to Jermyn Court Hotel &amp; got a bonny room. Went for a walk down Haymarket thro Admiralty Arch to Buckingham Square then to Westminster &amp; along Whitehall &amp; Haymarket &amp; back to the Hotel. A tremendous crowd already. Cars galore could hardly move the whole place is marvellously decorated. Looks bonny. Got a letter from Janet at the hotel.</p>
