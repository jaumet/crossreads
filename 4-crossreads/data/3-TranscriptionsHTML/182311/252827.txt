<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I will thank you for your prayers and good wishes, I want them all and value them too.&nbsp; I often think of home but it&#39;s a place in another world, where it is sunny and warm, and old friends cluster round.&nbsp; I hope I&#39;ll find it so on my return,, I think I will but it is a long way from here and a very different state of things are here with us now &quot;in the living Present.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, with all good wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAROLD.</p>
