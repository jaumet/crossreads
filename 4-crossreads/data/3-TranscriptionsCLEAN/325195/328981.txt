  
 Sun 24th Today has been very cold, Church Service was held his afternoon in a large Hospital tent that was erected this morning at the Field Ambulance as it was drizzling rain, I was too comfortable lying down in my dugout with a blanket over me to attend & I think nearly every one else felt the same .Reid took last shift last night & Les & I slept in till 9-oclock this morning; The warboats have been very busy this afternoon to the south of us but everything is very quiet here; the poor beggars in the trenches & on patrol get a rough time of it these nights; 3 Officers & 85 men arrived at 10 oclock tonight, Harris, Weir & Snodgrass & the 8th Reinf.
