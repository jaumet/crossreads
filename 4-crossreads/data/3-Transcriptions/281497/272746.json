<p>kept so long at the Base.</p>
<p>This morning a few of us went for a walk round the beach, &amp; got caught lovely in a sharp squall which sprang up suddenly from the South West, we took refuge in the sand dune's but got pretty well wet to the skin, the sandy beach is a favourite walk with us for it is very pretty &amp; the salt air is bonzer &amp; there are always plenty of "white horses" breaking round about the entrance.</p>
<p>Last night the M. P.'s made a raid &amp; caught everyone crossing the railway line without a pass they caught 2 of our chaps among them.</p>
