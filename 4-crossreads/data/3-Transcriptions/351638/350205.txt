<p>The Colonials at Anzac<br/>E. Ashmead-Bartlett</p>
<p>The positions occupied by the Australian and New Zealand Amy Corps on the cliffs<br/>north of Gaba Tepe remain practically the same to-day as when I last visited them<br/>some six weeks ago. The area of ground occupied   has not been materially extended <br/>except along the sea shore towards the north were an advanced post has been thrown<br/>out some two thousand yards connected with the main position by a deep trench dug <br/>out of the sand along the foreshore. But the interior of the position would hardly be<br/>recognised now by those who knew it after the first landing three monhs ago. <br/>Everything has in fact changed. I suppose it is necessary to use once again the word 'consolidated' for this is what the Colonials have been working at ever since and if ever everything possible has been to render a position both comfortable and secure it is surely at Anzac.</p>
<p>There are doubtless many who are disappointed at our inability to press forward across the peninsula and thus cut off the Kilid Bahr Plateau from the north from our position at Anzac. Unfortunately the nature of ground renders it impossible for either side to conduct an attack successfully and the Australians and New Zealanders have been oblige to play the role of a retaining force ever since the first landing. But this stalemate cannot last forever and when the physiological moment arrives for a big push all along the line, we are certain to see the Anzac<br/>Colonial Corps again playing an active role for which they are peculiarly fitted<br/>by temperament and training. The men are desperately eager to advance for locally<br/>they have obtained a complete mastery over</p>
