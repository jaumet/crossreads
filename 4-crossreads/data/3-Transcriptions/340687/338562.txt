Home at 10 and walked both ways 12 enemy planes flying low over here about 11.30 and dropped 2 bombs and all got away safely. Spent afternoon writing and reading. Work at 9 to-night and out on pontoons but blocked on Warrington Rd as it was blown up and walked rest.</p>
<p>Shelling intense and stopped work several times &ndash; Luckily no one hit although 3 &amp; 4 struck it heavily. Walked home usual way &amp; still strong. Very tired. Each section digs a strong point after stunt Probably on Wednesday.</p>
