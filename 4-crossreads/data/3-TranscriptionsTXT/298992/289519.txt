 Dear Mrs Fry, 
 I have only just heard about poor Allan. I have difficulty in thinking of him as gone for always, he seemed as much the embodiment of youth and life. I am afraid I can say nothing that is likely to help you in your sorrow. He is swallowed up as so many glad youths have been swallowed, and it is hard to see the sense of it all. And yet, while the world is what it is, these things are inevitable, and your consolation can only be that you have borne sons who went, and not skulking hounds who stayed at home. I have been very sad for Australia, and bitter about the worms who batter on a world's agon6y. God knows I hate war and all to do with it, but I had rather be killed here tomorrow than return to Australia if I must for it be ashamed. 
 Putting all cant aside, you have more cause for pride than sorrow. But even pride cannot ease the smart of sorrow, and words are so hopelessly futile. I can only say that you have all my sympathy, you and Mr Fry, and all his brothers and sisters &ndash; but most of all you, who cannot give as gladly as he gave.
