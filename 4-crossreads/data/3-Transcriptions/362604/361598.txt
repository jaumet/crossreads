<p>set out for a run round the Town.  I visited the Pier, went on &amp; all around it.  Walked all around the Hoe Promenade.  The Lighthouse was once in position on Eddystone Rock but it had to be removed on account of instability &amp; it was replaced by a new one.  I visited St. Andrews Church &amp; the Guildhall which is just opposite.  There is a grand organ in the latter place.  It has 4 manuals &amp; 67 stops.  There you see Francis Drake's Statue.  The exact place where He played Bowls I was not able to find but it must have been somewhere along the Hoe Promenade.  The centre picture is of a Bridge crossing the River which runs parallel with the Railway.  The train which you see on the bridge is only a local.  The carriages are just 2/3 as long again as our Yankee corridor cars, some of the seats being placed along the sides of the cars &amp; others two by two like we have them.  There are 3 cars to a train &amp; the steam engine is placed in the middle, pull &amp; push style.  Drake's Island is in the Sound to the Right of the Pier.  Municipal Buildings are the Council Chambers Right, Guild Hall, left.</p>
