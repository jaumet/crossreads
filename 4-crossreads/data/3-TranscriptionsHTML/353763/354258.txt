<p>I wrote to Mrs McConnel &amp; gave her full details of AE1 &amp; all that we knew  -  Its quite on the cards that while diving AE1 struck a pinnacle of rock &ndash; submerged &ndash; but like the one I told you about in Simpson hafen with the cross on it  -</p>
<p>About 4 pm Herbert &amp; I went to the beach &amp; I got Mab a rather nice book full of Suva views &amp; I also got R some P. cards which I trust will meet with the young people's approval  -  I also posted a letter to Rawdon  -  Herbert &amp; I then went to the tennis lawns The turf here is vy vy good =  Of course the heavy  rainfall helps it immensely  -  They have 3 grass courts as good as I have seen anywhere  -  Beautifully level &amp; green  -  The tennis was moderate with no star performers that I saw  -  I think I prefer wandering about anywhere looking at the plants, birds - rocks, reef in preference to watching second class tennis  -  We are getting to know people ashore &amp; I met a lot walking home including Father Fox who had been visiting the Grantala  -</p>
