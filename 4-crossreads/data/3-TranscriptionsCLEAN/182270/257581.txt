 FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1919. 
 Fine & hot & muggy. Looked like 
 a storm at any time but cleared 
 off again. Arrived in Maitland 
 early & stayed at Grand Junction 
 Hotel. Caught the 12.30 pm train 
 from Maitland to Quirindi. 
 Came as far as Scone with 
 Clyde and Arthur Grigson. 
 Had tea in Quirindi and 
 Bob Bullock brought me out 
 after.
