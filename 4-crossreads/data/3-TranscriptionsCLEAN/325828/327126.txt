  
 Glad to forward them on to me.  The address then will be c/- Miss E.V. Lawson No 7 Derfald St., Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Eng. If I can possibly have this coming Christmas in England with the Lawsons I would like to do so, but I expect to be in France in about 6 weeks time unless I can get on "ferrying."  A ferry- pilot has a good job (flying new machines across to France & returning the next day) but it is fearfully expensive for a start. I must close now, with love to you all at "Cairnleith," Your loving son, J Leo L. Waterhouse.
