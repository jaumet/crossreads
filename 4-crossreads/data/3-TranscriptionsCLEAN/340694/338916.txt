  
 31 last night with the Doctor another officer & Corporal postman by jove it was a treat. Our object was to witness the bombardment a few miles distant & it was well worth while walking a few miles to see. The star shells lit up the sky & it looked like an immense fire-works display. The roar of the guns must have been deafening closer up it was just one continual roll jove they must have poured the metal in. 
 The view from the top of the hill was beautiful, the surrounding country looked great & we could see this little village right down in the valley. We passed through glorious wheat fields & the pure country air was very invigorating.
