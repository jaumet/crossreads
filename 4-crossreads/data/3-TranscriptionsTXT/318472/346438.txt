1 August 1918ThursdayNothing exciting to mark the incoming of the new month. Sighted a Spanish boat coming from Sierra Leone. Thousands of Flying Fish to be seen - some of them of very brilliant colors. Weather very hot. Making a good voyage.
1918 August 2FridayAn uneventful day. Very hot & sultry. A boat coming apparently from Sierra Leone passed close by. About the only thing of interest is to watch the Flying fish of which there are thousands here about.
