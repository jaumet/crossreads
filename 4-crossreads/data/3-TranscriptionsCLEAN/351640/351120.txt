 My dear Girls:/ 
 This a brief sequel to a letter posted earlier in the week but which will not have caught an earlier steamer than the one which will carry this envelope. 
 We have been told that letters posted up to the 24th of November will be in time for delivery before Christmas. Mayhap! I took time by the forelock & in an earlier letter than this enclosed my greetings for the Holy and festive season. 
 Still am I attached here waiting for something to do, the while filling in the moments reading writing and making excursions by tram and otherwise. 
 The day before yesterday with a party of four other medicoes, again visited the pyramids at Mena, Dr Henry promising to climb to the summit of the first or grand pyramid armed with a camera while I scaled to the top of the second or great pyramid that he might have opportunity to take my photograph across the intervening space. The light was growing dim as our arrival was after 4 p.m. I left the other members of the party to do their part and set out to perform mine. When I reached the apex there were some people on the top of the grand pyramid, & in the dim light, the sun had dipped below the horizon, with eyes & glasses it was not possible to tell faces & forms. I shouted that I was ready & with an Australian flag in my right hand posed for the picture. 
 [Captain Thomas James Henry, 54, medical practitioner of Grafton, NSW, embarked from Sydney on 1 September 1915 on HMAT A33 Ayrshire and served in the Australian Army medical Corps. He returned to Australia in late 1915.]
