Billets: good day: the reputation for shells was well kept up we were chased out of our billets in the morning: he was after our "big how is its" landed first shell almost on them but of course did not know his luck: communion at 9.am very nice: after dinner aeros were up like flies bombed Fritz's sausages: the bombs bursting in some big clouds made a pretty effect, just like weeping stuff falling from the clouds: nine of our planes were in a bunch with the big thunder clouds as a background looked well. A Fritz was up so two of our "fighters" chased him tried to bomb him the bombs looked pretty bursting in the clouds: Fritz bogged in to the trenches a lot our guns did a good bit of firing all day: after tea we had church in the barn it went well: we had another "Kentucky" tea party it was tra-bong: our guns opened up a heavy bombardment about 11.30 pm as our raid was on: It was a pretty sight to see the rockets going up the flashes of the guns explosions: Fritz got a rough passage all right: he replied pretty hotly but I believe we worked our "knut" this time in the trenches came off light:
