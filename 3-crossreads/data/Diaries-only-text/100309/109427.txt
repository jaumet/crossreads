5/7/17 Beaulencourt
At 8.30 moved out in artillery formation to a large open attack practice carried out against the 23rd. Batt, the 21st. cooperating with us in the attack. It went fairly well. Afterwards the General criticised the operation in his usual style. Had a good gallop back to camp. Afternoon spent on odds and ends and it went very rapidly. At dinner in the evening they very kindly drank my health with musical honours and said some nice things. Jack was in afterwards for a while. All the evening drafting up a scheme for an outpost scheme tomorrow night. Being rather weak moonlight the operation will lose some of its value. Never in bed before midnight these times it is busy without a second in Command to take some of the work off one. Aeroplanes tonight doing night flying. Some rumble of guns on the front. Colonel Craig came in for a yarn and some supper.
