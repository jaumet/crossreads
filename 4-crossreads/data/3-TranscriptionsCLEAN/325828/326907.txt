On the second day out we were steaming along at about 9 knots with the torpedo boat on our right & another transport about 1 1/2 miles to our left when this other transport let go two shots with her gun in quick succession The torpedo-boat got over to the transport like a streak of greased lightning.  I forgot to say, that as soon as we got away from the wharf, life belts were issued to us, & we had to wear them every day, neglect of which rule we were brought up pretty sharp.  We had to wear them all day long & at night use them as a pillow.-  As soon as the boat started firing we thought it was a submarine at work. It turned out that they had sighted a box half submerged & poured a couple of hundred pound's worth of ammunition into it.  We were all appointed to our separate boats & were given drill & warned that 4 blasts of the ship's whistle meant submarine attack.  One day we passed a sister ship which was a good way out & the skipper blew the whistle 3 times.  There was a general scatter up on deck from below where they were playing cards but they saw the meaning of it.
