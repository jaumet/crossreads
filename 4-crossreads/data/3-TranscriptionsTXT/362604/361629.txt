said, Mother, I tell you that they are coming on Monday.  Sure enough they got my wire on the same day, to say that we were coming on Monday.  She had a presentiment all along & my word it did come true didn't it.
Well I must go on Duty now so au Revoir & trusting you all to God.
I remainYour Loving BoyHarry
