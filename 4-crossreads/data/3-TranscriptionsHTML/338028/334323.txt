<p>Rumoured that we leave this happy camp on Wednesday back to desolate Hill 70 where we believe they are building sheds for horses. Then again wild rumours are floating that we are going to England. I am getting norirably[?] sick of war lately more so than ever before and when August comes I am going to try for furlough.</p>

<p>Nothin' doin', one night in the Mess at H'plis, during some revelry I was sworn into B' Sqn and now I always am one of them and all the sergeants mess together, we live like Lords custards, jellies, fruits etc right out in the heart of the desert. Having nothing else to do I started a rumour going that we disembark at Southampton on 24th June to do Town Picquet in London, in half an hour over a dozen told me about in confidence straight from H.Q.</p>

<p>All sorts of rumours floating as to our destination, we leave here on Friday. Tonight there is an expedition and so attack a Turkish camp at Salama and the 1st L H Bde and N Z M R [New Zealand Mounted Rifles] are taking part with artillery. The 5th L Horse leaving us so act as screen and prevent them from coming in our direction like the last time One Squadron of the 6th L Horse taking the 5th's place.</p>

<p>The scrap at Fad el Salamana came off last night or rather this morning and was one sided, we killed 15 Turks, wounded one and took one prisoner, this is all the details we come to hand.</p>
