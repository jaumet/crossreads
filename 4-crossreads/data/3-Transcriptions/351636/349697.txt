<p>Dear Mr. Layton<br/>We are sending Mrs. Bridbury to you. Her husband was out of work before he enlisted and has left her with some debts, which she is most anxious to get paid off. Hoping you can help her &ndash; she has had no assistance before</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>[indecipherable] A Bolton.</p>
