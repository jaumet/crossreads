<p>Mumps are still spreading. Started to pack surplus drugs, etc in the Dispensary. An all out Boxing contest took place today between a Rep 14th 2nd &amp; 9th 26th. 9th 26th got a win. It was a &pound;10 wager. Passed a lot of boats day &amp; night.</p>
<p>Sunday<br/>5/3/16</p>
<p>Very cool all day. Saw land on the African side all day, some pretty shadings, also a very fine sunset. Arrived at Suez 7 pm &ndash; it is just one mass of lights at night &amp; a stranger cannot make much out of them. Can clearly make out a Gunboat.</p>
<p>Almost alongside of us is the - a New Zealand Hospital boat, she looks very pretty lit up tonight. Also quite close is the Troopship Mephistocles, rumoured tonight she has all the troops still on her &amp; for the past week she may be isolated, ot else going to</p>
