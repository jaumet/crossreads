Permit me to offer yourself and family my deepest sympathy in the lass of your son Capt. A. S. Ferguson.
Unfortunately I had no opportunity of seeing him before I learnt of his untimely death so I was unable to tell him that I had travelled with you on the "Osterley".
I am sure that the circumstances under which he died will in some measure console you all.
With kind regards,I am yours sincerelyM.C. Moors[indecipherable]
