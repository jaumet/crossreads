to be spoilt. Also yarned with her cousin a pleasant looking mademoiselle of 16 who was a little bashful at first but later told us all the village scandals, the English Indian babies and the "beaucoup m'selle malade". A good and innocent girl ? they speak of things more freely in France than we do. This garden very pleasant bordered with fruit blossom. Overhead some ?planes flew at intervals. Mess in the evening was a happy meal and it was good to see all the officers together. The old order changeth. After mess promenaded once more and parted until all the family went to the Benediction. A couple of men ill today with trench fever possibly carried by lice. However we have baths and clean clothes tomorrow. Behaviour is excellent and much smatening up apparent. A bath tonight in Madame's washtub. At first she interpreted my request for a "bucket" as "bouquet". A long summery day.
