 18:  After many attempts, the doctor allowed me up for a few hours on the balcony &amp; am feeling much better though very thin &amp; weak.  Buying my food from Cairo &amp; since my admission, have spent about #163;5 to keep myself alive, the food is just as bad as ever. 
 22:  Asked to be discharged, the doctor letting me go at last, not even feeling my pulse &amp; my temperature was exactly 100.  Glad to get out on good food &amp; can treat myself better than the doctor has done to me.  Had a hard job to pass the C.O. who said I looked too weak, but let me out on condition I went to the seaside at Alex. for fourteen days &amp; put me on the A.I.F. sick allowance of 4/- per day. Put up at Rossmore House. 
 24:  Went to Alexandria, stayed at the Windsor, near the sea, plenty of surfing &amp; feeling first rate now. 
 26:  Went to Nouzah Gardens had a good day with some French people of Alex., who made us very welcome in their homes.  Amusements poor in Alex., not an English show &ndash; except pictures in the town.
