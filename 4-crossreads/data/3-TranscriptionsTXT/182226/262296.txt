Friday 1 October, 1915
Another glorious morning. We are truly in lucks way as far as the weather is concerned. At 7 a.m. there was a great cloud of mist over the completely hiding it.
Am on guard again.
Mr Wright came round & was examining the gun position.
Mac went to see Capt Fitzgerald in the afternoon.
Things in general have been very quiet today. The artillery in particular has been very light.
