Rather busy to-day - Patients coming in in fair numbers - have received orders to take another 100 patients into Mena House which will bring our total number up to about 280 - The excitement & bustle of getting ready to move has disappeared & it looks as if we were to stay at Mena until Doomsday. Attended A.S.A. French class in Adelaide Y.M.C.A.
