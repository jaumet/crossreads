<p>15-5-16<br/>Volunteers were called for for an unknown destination last night &amp; the tent volunteered we were supposed to leave in the morning, but what really happened was we were called out at 3.30 A.M. to do Musketry.  We got away at 5.0 A.M. walked to the Range about 4 miles mostly sand.  We had an awfull day the thermometer in the Officers mess at Tel-el-Kebir recorded 115 in the shade where we were it must have been 120 at least.  we each had one Bottle of water and enough Bully &amp; Bread for one Meal.  through some oversight no water or provisions was sent out &amp; in the terrific heat the men were drinking continuously.  The Bottles were all empty about 9.0 A.M. &amp; for the rest of the day we had to drink Canal water or snuff out.  it was simply awfull out in the loose sand.  One result was that 12 men went into Hospital &amp; the Officer responsible was put under open arrest.  We didn't get back to camp</p>
