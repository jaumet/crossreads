<p>found that the Order had never been issued from Headquarters.  So evidently it was a case of the working of wheels within wheels for some reason and the commotion all ended in a mull.</p>
<p>In brief I'll try and remember a few interesting items that have happened.  We are all in turn going to have a fortnight's furlough &ndash; Isn't that lovely?</p>
<p>Six of our Sisters have been mentioned in despatches and are going to get the Royal Red Cross &ndash; Lucky beggars I wish I could get it.  Rush is one of them.</p>
<p>The Duke of Connaught paid the Hospital a visit one afternoon, which was an inconvenience to everybody.  All leave was stopped for the Patients and the Sisters who had days off had to come back &amp; stand to.  And after all he only visited 2 or 3 of the Wards.</p>
<p>Of Course there was Xmas &amp; New Year and nothing out of the way happened.  The boys appeared to have a happy day &ndash; we had our ward prettily decreated with paper almond blossoms.  The New Year passed in ever so quietly &ndash; not even the tinkle of a bell.  So different to how we heralded in 1916 at Lemnos.</p>
<p>I have been to London 3 times but I'm not keen on it unless it is to go to a matinee or do something definite.  However fascinating</p>
