The part underneath that shaven.  these ladies took particular pains to stand near the edge of the balcony &amp; in some case astride the balcony rail in case you couldnt see enough &amp; all the time they were capering &amp; singing &amp; calling to the soldiers in the street below.  The police took absolutely no notice of them no matter what they done or what filthy suggestion they made.  In the Wassa proper the ladies ? sit on chairs in the street with the shortest of skirts practically none in fact, flash stockings &amp; the gaudy High legged high heeled boots &amp; some of them wear heavy bangles as well they are nearly all very plump.  We put in most of the day in Wassa much to my disgust &amp; explored most of the Joy houses but did not do any business with them</p>
