Last Tuesday week I had 1/2 a day off & went up to Cambridge.  It is a great City & I had a good look round the four Universitys there, Trinity, Kings, Clare & Queen's Colleges.  The famous lawn at Cambridge which attracts crowds from all over London is indeed fine & beautifulThe winding river, with grass meadows   u   right down to the edge, spanned frequently by quaint artistic bridges, & dotted here & there by boats in which students lounged & studied, formed a very pretty picture.  I was very glad to get away from the bustle & roar of London even for such a short time.Last Saturday afternoon another chap (from the Furlo' Section here) & I went to Richmond & got a rowing boat, on the river (Thames) & pulled about 8 or 9 miles up the river.  The scenery was gloriously pretty & we had a rattling good time.  It is quite light right up till 1/4 past 9
