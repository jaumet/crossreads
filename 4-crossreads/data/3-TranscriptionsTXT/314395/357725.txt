 7.  Officers and men are reminded that it is their duty to give no information of a military nature to anyone whilst they are on leave in England.  Information which is widely known in England soon reaches the enemy, and the success of Military operations may be endangered thereby.  Non-observance of the above will lead to cancellation of any present leave granted to the offender, and the stoppage of all future leave.
