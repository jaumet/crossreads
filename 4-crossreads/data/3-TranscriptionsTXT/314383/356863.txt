 March 4th [should be May 4th] Rained all last night - all were out more than once during the night guying up their tents  &amp;  clearing drains.  We rested until 10.30 am, a most welcome one too, then we cooked some food and moved off at 12.30 pm.  Our camp tonight is on a rocky flat near a village called  Karend &amp; our bed promises to be anything but a soft one.  Capt Kay &amp; I strolled into the village in order to purchase some eggs.  The inhabitants are a cut throat looking crowd, rendered more so in their rags &amp; strange black felt hats, shaped like a beehive worn on the back of the head. 
 May 5th A very trying day of 15 miles thro a dangerous pass which we had to piquet before
