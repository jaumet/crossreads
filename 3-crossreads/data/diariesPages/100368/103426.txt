July 6th
As we were on our way to Church we witnessed a very funny incident. We heard the strains of bagpipes and walking slowly we expected to see some highland regiment come marching along. We were very much surprised to find instead of Highlanders, marching gaily along, we saw a mixed band of pipes and brass instruments walking in front of a closed in motor car and two old fashioned horse driven cabs. The motor car was all decked off with greenery, especially the wheels of the car.
We understood it to be the driving home of a newly married couple going to their new home. The whole procession was followed by a crowd of youngsters cheering and shouting at the pitch of their voices. There were a great many soldiers and nurses passing at the time and a look of amusement crossed their faces as the humour of the scene dawned upon them.
While this scene was being enacted a contrast to the happy picture was also witnessed in the passing of a native funeral with its accompanying groaning and chanting as they followed the corpse to the cemetery.
Going home from the church in the gloaming we were rather tickled by seeing a drove of ducks being driven along one of the main streets, by some natives.
