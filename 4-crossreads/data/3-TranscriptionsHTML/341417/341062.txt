<p>[Newspaper clipping]<br/>Non-Stop Australians.<br/>3,000 Prisoners for 1,200 Losses.<br/>Mr. W. M. Hughes, the Australian Premier, received a cable of Wednesday's date from General Monash, commanding the Australian corps, stating: "The Australian forces attacked to-day, gaining all their objectives, including the ridge which dominates the Hindenburg line, and captured over 3,00 prisoners, 30 guns, and hundreds of machine-guns and trench mortars. Our casualties so far reported are under 2,000."</p>
<p>From C. E. W. Bean.<br/>With the Australians, Wednesday.<br/>To-day, in one of the most completely successful operations in which they have been engaged, the Australians not only captured the old British front line and outposts, which was the object of the battle, but also pushed on and took the front trenches of the Hindenburg system itself, and established themselves beyond the crest line on which the line is situated, and which looks down upon the Saint-Quentin Canal and main Hindenburg line beyond.</p>
<p>The Australians too 3,150 prisoners, including 120 officers, one a regimental commander and two battalion commanders. Our line now overlooks rolling brown moorland, on the opposite slopes of which can be seen the white parapets and broad bands of wire of the main Hindenburg line. Our losses were made much lighter by the splendid services of the British tanks.</p>
