<p>of the tragedian Talma with just this one word on it. This part of cemetry is a closely packed system of vaults all above 10 ft high &amp; all under shade. It is as the city of the honoured &amp; ancient dead for most of the old families &amp; well known personages are envaulted here.</p>
<p>Further on we pass to the crematory with its arcade for the ashes which has been cheapened by arranging flowers most of which die in a few hours &amp; the appearance is worse than if they had never been placed there.</p>
<p>Thence on to Musselman cemetery enclosed with a little hedge &amp; finally out. Of some of principal graves I have purchased some pc from a woman the chapel whose clothes reeked of human corruption I dont know how she stood it but I had to get out in fresh air. I dont mind visiting a cemetery but I dont wish to caress &amp; commune with the putrefied remains of what was once humanity.</p>
<p>Leaving here we visited Notre Dame de la Croix [indecipherable] it was closed. We then went up Menil Montant to Buttes Chaumont once a disused quarry &amp; garbage tip but now transformed into a glorious park with walk, grottoes, cascades &amp; a lake.</p>
<p>From a temple on island a glorious panorame of the N.W &amp; beyond of Paris unfolds itself though the city is veiled &amp; must be seen</p>
