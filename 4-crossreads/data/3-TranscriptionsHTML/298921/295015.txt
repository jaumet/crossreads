<p>February, 1915<br/>Thursday 11<br/>On duty all day &amp; night tonight we are camped in the Desert &amp; it is very sandy &amp; bare, dust everywhere. Camels, Donkeys, etc. but climate lovely &ndash;<br/>Arabic men women &amp; children swarm everywhere. French principal language spoken.<br/>Will cut this out and send on Saturday held back as anticipated hearing but no doubt letters are on the way.<br/>No word from [indecipherable] yet met Henry of [indecipherable] P.P.B.o</p>
