<p>Oct 27th.  Still in Mametz Wood &amp; the weather though temporarily brightening still continues wet &amp; dull.  A mail came in &amp; cheered things up.  This afternoon I had a look at a German howitzer with its elaborate writings etc.<br/>Oct 28th   Still in Mametz Wood in bad weather wind &amp; rain.  In fact the whole crowd is as miserable as the weather.  I had a look at some of our guns to-day.  6", 9.2" etc &amp; they are formidable in looks &amp; numbers.  Mail.<br/>Oct 29th.  As yesterday, no change in weather which is impeding operations<br/>Oct 30th.  Still in Mametz Wood in continuous rain.  A couple had a look over the Tanks yesterday &amp; also a couple of Russian Guns dated 1882 &amp; captured from them by the Germans<br/>Oct 31st.  Move to-day to Longueval, passing High Wood, Delville Wood &amp; the two Bazentins.  We are about three miles west of Combles &amp; near Trones Wood.  As usual the day is sometimes dull &amp; at others sunny, &amp; the place is still a sea of mud.  We are still a good way behind the line about four miles, the nearest point is somewhat beyond Flers.  Our position is a good deal to the right &amp; of course more advanced than before.<br/>Nov 1st.  Move up to the 2nd Bgde Aid Post, about four miles.  On the way we passed a few stranded tanks.  On arriving we had to pull the dugout down &amp; re-erect it.  The shelling is consistent but mostly on a wood &amp; village a few hundred yards behind us.  One shell burst in our sunken road five yards from the group of us but nothing else resulted except in mud &amp; a shaking up.  The country is very muddy &amp; I anticipate a rough time when we get a case- none of which have come in yet.  The trenches are thigh high in mud &amp; the men are suffering terribly from trench feet.  We have still undisturbed control of the air<br/>Nov 2nd.  Early this morning at 12.30 we had a case &amp; had to carry it through mud slush rain etc.</p>
