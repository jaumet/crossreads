  
 Thursday 15 August Still heavy shelling on our left.  We are to be relieved to-morrow & already 4th Aust. Division & some Americans are up here.  Quiet just here. 
 Friday 16 August Move this morning at ten a.m. & march through the boiling hot sun & dust, heavens, it was dusty via Harbonierres, Bayonvillers & Warfuses to Vaux sur Somme & were very much refreshed by a swim in the river. Another of the chaps has died, Groves, very unfortunately.  Bivouac for the night.
