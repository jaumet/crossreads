July 1917Tuesday 17thLast night was the rougest we have had a lot of water got down to our deck &amp; as many sleep on the floor they got washed out. It was an awful mess, with kit bags clothes etc washing about in the dirty water We are keeping close to the coast. It is straight &amp; uninteresting. Only (Boat broken last night) lost one man in Durban owing to the Pubs being Closed.
Wed 18A nice day still close to shore It has been fairly high to day. Mountains in places. Passed East London yesterday about 3 miles out.
