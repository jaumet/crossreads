My men on gas guard. 58-9-6 - 105/4
Wednesday 4/9/18Jerry sent gas over last night but not much of it came our way. Hot fine morning. Brigadier Hobbs just reviewed  the remnant of us, tells us wi/ the 14th Brigade did the impossible in taking Peronne High French Generals said it would take a month & fearful sacrifice of life to take it. We took it in a few hours. It is considered the finest feat in the war & beats Gallipoli. Total Ns of Prisoners [now?] 130,000 - 200 guns 15,000 m.guns 13,000 Trench mortars etc etc to end of August. The Brig/d. said words failed him & nothing he could say would be half good enough, he was filled with admiration for the 55th & better soldiers never breathed. Never had such praise as this before but suppose it means going in again shortly. He said the Bosche army is thoroughly disorganised. From the heights here can see right down into Peronne & a lot of it seems to be untouched. The view is splendid. 58-11-0 - 107/4
