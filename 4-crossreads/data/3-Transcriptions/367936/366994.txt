<p>Thursday 15 June 1916<br/>Rostron and others left for Ras-el-tin <strike>Rasseldoon</strike> convalescent camp near Alexandria.  In evening five of us and a sister went for an hour's motor drive round Cairo, old Sava car.  Beautiful roads, asphalted all the way.  Saw the Nile and bridge.  Saw Sheppards and some very fine buildings.</p>
<p>Friday 16 June 1916<br/>Wrote three letters in morning.  Lovely hot and cold showers here, making use of them while I can.<br/>Wrote to Aunt Katie, Aunt Fen and Rog &amp; Cisla.</p>
