Rev Dinsdale Young preached from 5.40 to 7.8.Then said he Lo I am come to the volume of the book it is written of me I delight to do thy willIt was a good solid sermon  4 points were taken (1) The reminiscent sermon2.

It was a fine exposition.The prayers were helpful & the theme was the advent.No one spoke to me either going in
