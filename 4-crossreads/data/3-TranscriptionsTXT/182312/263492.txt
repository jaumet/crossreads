villages and when one stops and thinks that each one of these has

     The country we are now in is by far the best piece
of Northern France we have seen.  Lovely green fields unspoiled
by shell holes abound on all sides whilst a lot of the ground bears
evidence of having been recently cropped - for the benefit of the
Boche no doubt.  We brought all our transport animals up and
turned them loose onto the grass - a diet which they had not
tasted since coming to France, or from Australia for that matter
as in Egypt they were always hand fed.  Old limber horses which
for months had toiled about in the mud with heads down and
genuinely "fed up" expressions, got a second lease of life in a
day and went galloping round the paddocks, kicking their heels in
the air with delifht.  Good luck to them, they have worked
wonderfully all the winter.
