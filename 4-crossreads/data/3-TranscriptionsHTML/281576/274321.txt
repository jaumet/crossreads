<p>Behold in me, alas! a stretcher Bearer,<br/>In Sunny France, O horrid trance<br/>Of all the mud &amp; shells a wretched sharer,<br/>Ah! Ambulance.  Curse my mischance<br/>When out on greasy duckboards slipping<br/>In Trenches wet; And dry &ndash; [pertet?] <br/>Clammy water from my tunic dripping<br/>No issue Rum &ndash; my sole regret.</p>
<p>With a cling, clang, crash Bang<br/>Comes another shell<br/>Makes me think, with Dante, I'm in &ndash; well<br/>My head is plastered thick with mud<br/>Good God, here comes another dud,<br/>I wish I was in Blighty,<br/>Where they treat the dinkums well.</p>
<p>Once again behold in me a war worn Failure,<br/>My arm, O Lor: Effects of War <br/>I'm bound, O how I hope for dear Australia<br/>Encore: Encore.  Tres biens, messieur.<br/>I've swung the Lead with skill &amp; great precision<br/>My Fate is nigh.  But hope is high.<br/>And now, with dread await the Board's decision.<br/>Hi, tiddly, Hi.  I'll ne'er say die.</p>
<p>With a crook wing I sing, to the Board<br/>My Tale of woe<br/>It's bound to get round the Doctor's Hearts I know.<br/>And if I once get on the Boat<br/>Bound for Home for which I dote,<br/>I promise you, fair dinkum<br/>That from Home I'll never go.</p>
