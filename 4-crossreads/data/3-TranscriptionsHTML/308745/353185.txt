<p>a working party of A.M Corps.  The story of how Brian unselfishly gave his redcross armband to a sailor to carry back a wounded comrade &amp; thus gave up his own distinguishing badge, you know.  It was an act of heroic selfsacrifice, even though it was contrary to all regulations.  You should indeed be proud of him.  He was shot from a trench.  The bullet entered the abdomen in the midline about two inches below the ribs &amp; emerged in the lower part of the back, shattering the last lumbar vertibra.  I state most emphatically that it was <u>not</u> a dumdum bullet.  We have seen <u>no</u> dumdum wounds &amp; have given an official denial of the statement that our men were shot by dumdum bullets.</p>
<p>This occurred about 8 am.  Brian was carried back to the coast, &amp; was seen at once by Captain Donaldson &amp; Private Henderson, whom I had sent off from the "Berrima" to attend a couple of wounded on a destroyer that had been attached for duty with the force landing at Rabaul later in the day.</p>
