 Flessells 12/12/16  We awoke to a world white with snow an inch or so deep and heavy flakes kept dropping noiselessly.  It was a very beautiful sight the twigs of the trees all outlined in virgin white and a mantle of purity over everything.  At 9 am we marched out to Haystack Hill along slushy roads the fields on each side all covered in snow.  Carried out an attack practice it was cold indeed and everyone was fed up by the time for moving in and all were wet up to the knees.  With greatcoat and socks wet the men cannot get comfortable at all because there are no means of drying them.  The snow remained on the ground all day but thawed a good deal in the afternoon. Had all officers in on a conference at 11.30 and spent the rest of the afternoon in the mess reading.  At twilight there was an extraordinary sight &ndash; an air full of crowds of circling birds.  We put it down to their having to go far afield for food and then returning to roost before dark.  Very glad that we are not in the trenches today.  Foot rubbing and baths filled in the afternoon for the men and we hope to give them a little easier time for the next few days.  Attended "D" Coys dinner in the evening and it was splendid.  170 Australian bucks feeding. Scene a large shed with tables down it. 20 mess orderlies passing dishes from hand to hand.  Lashings of poultry beer wine fruit etc.  Enormous helpings against which the stomach rebelled but the boys left nothing on their plates their appetites are enormous and they love a square feed.  A few speeches.  I responded to the toast of the Battalion and the Padre proposed Fallen Comrades.
