Nearly half of his head was sliced off and he was badly knocked about. Everything was quiet until about 8 p.m. and I then moved down below into the dugout on account of the enemy opening up shelling. Before long a barrage was raging and all the communications went. After dark things got very busy so I decided to move forward to battle H.Q. Stayed here all night and nothing further came. There was a good deal of stuff being plastered around our support trenches. Except for one or two men slightly wounded there was not much doing all night. Our patrols had a quiet time out in No MansLand. Our little Battle H.Q. became very "fuggy" and being tired out I soon got to sleep and was conscious of no more till dawn
