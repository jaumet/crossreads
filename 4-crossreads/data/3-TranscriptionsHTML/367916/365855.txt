<p>the last birthday honours and never were any decorations better deserved.</p>
<p>The brigade is very proud of the <u>few</u> decorations awarded to them as we know full well that the man with our colours up and with a decoration has done something extra splendid and is not wearing a ribbon just for doing his duty as I am afraid some get it for.</p>
<p>So we had a joyous celebration the night they were awarded. It was made more joyous by the fact that we had just pipped the 4th at cricket. Playing in the same field as Geoff Street made me think of bygone days.</p>
<p>Well I've no news Judge &ndash; but give my love to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; Dorothy and tell Keith he owes me a letter. Don't know if does but anyway its his turn to write. Cheerio.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>J. Mant.</p>
