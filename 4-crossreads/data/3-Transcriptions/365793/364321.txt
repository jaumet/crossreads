<p>Aug 10 about 10 oclock, &amp; proceeded to give sundry selections on a Concertina while his <u>mate</u> attempted to perform the Highland fling &amp; the Irish Jig. <u>He</u> managed the shouting part alright, but his legs got very wobbly &amp; eventually tangled him up amongst the deck chairs &amp; foot rests. Discovered the bath (with the aid of a kindly Chaplain) &amp; had a good hot swim. Soap mafeesh as the water was salt. Shoal of porpoises sporting on the Port Side. Deck tennis &ndash; croquet, quoits etc piano, &amp; sundry books &amp; papers. What more do you</p>
