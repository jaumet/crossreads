  
 Monday 23 October 1916 An overcast night & no frost, but nevertheless quite cool. Early breakfast & then marched abt. 2 miles to the starting point where we got on motor busses & lorries driven by French soldiers. The sight of the 300 or 400 busses gave one  new insight into the resources of the Allies. Some of the drivers were blacks (?Senegalese) & as we journeyed through part of the French area we saw many of these troops. The route lay through the outskirts of Amiens, along the Somme to Buire, & the drive, if cold, was better than marching. Owing to the mist one saw very little scenery. Having left Moufflers at 10 we landed at Buire at abt. 2 p.m. & thence had a 5 mile march to Fricourt where was a very poor apology for a camp. Got in by dark & was quite ready for a good tea before turning in, Cuthbert & I having a tent between us.
