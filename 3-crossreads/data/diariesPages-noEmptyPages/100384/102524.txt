Next day the 1st we were taken by motor lorries to Elaphes for a bath which was very acceptable. Whilst in these billet the battalions took up football a great number of inter company inter Battn matches were played thus helping to break the monotony of training etc. We next made a move on the 14th marched as far as Zoetux where we put up for the night next day marched as far as Ledingham it was a fairly long march. Next morning we had to pack up once more marched to the old Mill at Assingham it was very cold. Our stay here was very short for reveille was at 3 AM next morning the 17th after a scanty meal set of on the march with a blizzard blowing in our face went as far as Hizernes where after a lot of waiting fooling about we entrained. After spending a few miserable hours owing to being jammed in we reached Neuve Eglise where we disentrained marched to Ramille Camp at Himmel. This camp is well organised compact therefore we were very comfortable.
