<p>lovely, just one mass of wild flowers in huge variety, a topping change from a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>As we've been having a spell in most comfortable quarters with charming surroundings you can imagine that we're living well &amp; enjoying a bonnie time, especially as one occasionally has an opportunity of visiting some of the larger villages &amp; even cities.  Then, a fellow meets dozens of old pals, its just great, &amp; all the boys are as happy as larry &amp; in top hole condition.</p>
<p>Sorry we cant give you any news Bella.</p>
<p>Please give my love to Auntie Bella, Al, Eth, young Eddie &amp; yourself.</p>
<p>Hoping you are all enjoying good health I am</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely &amp; in the pink<br/>Chas H. Copp.</p>
