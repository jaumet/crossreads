<p>Dear Mr Rowland,</p>
<p>&hellip;. The 20th has had a rough time in France, as we lost Lieuts. Connor, Porteous and Blanchard last month, and the day before yesterday Capt. Ferguson and Lieut. Campling were killed.  This last knock is felt very much by the Battalion, particularly in the case of Capt. Ferguson, who was a general favourite and a fine fellow.  His Company thought the world of him and are very rattled at present.  B Company has had the brunt of it in officers, N.C.Os. and men.  However the day is not far distant when we will claim our revenge. &hellip;.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br/>R.F. Fitzgerald.<br/>(Major, acting in command of the 20th Battalion)</p>
