<p>My Dear Judge</p>
<p>I am very fir &amp; well &amp; living in a very comfortable Fritz dugout about 30 feet deep. Rations are excellent. We are at present in the immediate line &amp; shall move to the front line in a few days. I am again commanding the Battalion for the time being. It is a fine job &amp; I am enjoying it immensely. There is not a great deal of work to do but of course a very great responsibility &amp; I always remember your advice not to shirk the latter.</p>
<p>The situation looks quite cheerful now. How I should love to be able to tell you all about it. Everything is going well, I think.</p>
<p>Best Love, yours affectionately</p>
