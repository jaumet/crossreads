 Dull. 2 runs to A.D.M.S. Scottish Lines Busseboom. To 5th Div. A.P.M. (Ouderdom). To 30th Battalion (Ouderdom). I saw an impressive scene today at Ouderdom railway siding &ndash; A great procession of Tanks was making its way to the railway platform.  I counted 40 of them as they made their way across the fields towards the Railway.  Note:   It transpires later that these tanks went to Cambrai front.
