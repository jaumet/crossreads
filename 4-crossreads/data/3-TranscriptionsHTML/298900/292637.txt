<p>at night by Major Strachan on Water.   I did a couple of experiments for him prepared hydrogen &amp; made an explosion as well as shewed the flame.   Lecture very good.</p>
<p>Sunday 24th Feb<br/>    Nice cool day, very little doing but had 10 cases through during the night.   Finished the Cross today &amp; I'm glad that I did the writing myself as it looks alright.   Received a parcel today from Fan.</p>
<p>Monday 25th Feb<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain in the morning but cleared up during the day.   Enemy planes over at night.   Had a rude awakening during the night or rather morning.   The Capt Q.M. &amp; his W.O. became very merry on rum &amp; at 3 A.M. came to my dugout to disturb the other W.O. &amp; myself.    They stayed for &frac34; hour alternately wrestling &amp; talking.   One of them seeing Gwens photo was calm for 15 minutes going into raptures over it.    Eventually they left &amp; we remade our beds &amp; went to sleep again.   At night we had a lecture by a Tommy</p>
