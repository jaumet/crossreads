Then rode down to Reninghelst for a bath. Near some camps I saw General Birdwoods car and later himself and General Brand. He called me over and we chatted for a while about recent operations. He was taking a march past from the 4th. Brigade which was again coming up to the line. The men were looking very fit and fresh. In Reninghelst had a most luxurious hot bath and a clean change of clothing and returned to camp about 4. Dealt with some routine stuff read papers etc.and rested all the evening. Tried a new batman named Mouldy - I hope he is different to his name. A fine clear evening many observation balloons up. The mud is drying up and tomorrow morning the 4th. & 5th Divisions will hop over the top.
