August 3rd 1917. Rejoined unit after an absence of 15 days.
6 45th Bn marched out from "Neuf-Berquin" and after a march of 9 miles, bivouacked near "Kemmel Hill" (Belgium).
7. On the move again. Went up to act as reserves to the 48th Bn, we were stowed away in old German dug-outs in the battered village of "Wytschate". The enemy had done his usual tunneling under the ridge, his dug-outs were all connected up by long galleries and so on.
8 Enemy shelling fairly heavy about midday. large numbers of Aeroplanes skating about in mid-air, several scraps.
9. 3 of "Fritz" observation balloon,s brought down in flames by or planes. 1 of our brought down by "Fritz". British Artillery very busy near Ypres.
10. A great number of our Aeroplanes and observation ballons up, I have never seen so many before in the one sector, several fights took place. An enemy plane shot down by our Anti-aircraft guns.
11. Heavy rain fell to day making the ground rotten.
12 Sunday. All the boys on fatigue, improving communication sap.
13. Things fairly quiet on our front to day. Our Aeroplanes were on the move ton night annoying "Fritz". The enemys line looked quite gay with the large numbers of varied coloured lights he fired up, especially one for enemy aircraft..
14. 45th Bn releived the 48th front line support trenches about 10P.M to night, ground very bad after recent rains, the boys slipping and skateing about among shell holes. To top matter up "Fritz" guns opened up dropped several shells rather near, but none of lads were hit. The 48th had some casualties while releiving.
