  
 to be able to go somewhere for an evening's enjoyment if only to forget this terrible war. The Show was over at 7.30 & it is now dark at that time. The Town is practically deserted, except in the Estaminet's. We had a couple rounds of Drinks & then jogged along slowly home, arriving there about 8.30 when I boiled the Kettle & had Toast & Cocoa for Supper & as the Moon is now rising late & the weather cloudy, Fritz did not trouble us with his bombs although during the night I heard several shells coming over & exploding somewhere in the bush. 
 4th Thursday. I was booked on the Shunter at 4 Pm & was kept very busy all the shift & signed off at Midnight & came on again Friday 5/10/17.  at 3.30 on an Emergency job, we stood by until 6 Pm when we had to take a train load of Ammunition go Light Engine up to B1 Siding on the Old Belgian Line & pick up a Truck of 12" Shells
