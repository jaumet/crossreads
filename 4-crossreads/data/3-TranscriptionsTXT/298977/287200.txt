 DARDANELLES, 7th November 1915 
 My dear Mother, 
 Your letter of the 7th September and Father's of the 18th both came to hand this week, also three papers, which of course I was very pleased to receive. 
 I'm sorry that that remarkable letter of mine from Egypt should have had to be given a bath.  It strikes me if you wanted to keep it so much, the best and easiest thing to do would have been to take a copy. 
 With regard to Photos.  I had bad luck with these.  I had a lot taken and had them at the Developers, but we left Heliopolis in such a hurry that I did not have time to get them, so I suppose its good bye to the lot. 
 Have not seen anything of Charlie Witney yet.  I had a letter from him this mail, but it was written in Sydney when he was on final leave.  I understand he is now in Egypt, but expect he will be over here any day now. 
 You might send me Willie Stewart's Reg No. etc., I May be able to look him up.  Understand Frank Eather's Brigade is again over here.  They are a good way away from here however, and it will mean a day off to find him.  As soon as I can get the necessary leave, however, I will look him up. 
 Tell Father that the Magazine's he packed will be much appreciated by the Boys over here.  I suppose it will only be luck as to whether I see any of them, but someone is sure to enjoy them. 
 Things are pretty quiet here now as to what they were but still they don't give us too much time for sleeping. 
 It suddenly struck me that to-day is your Birthday I'm sorry I did not send along greetings earlier, so as to catch the date, but better late than never.  I'll enclose best wishes for the day and also for a good and Happy Christmas in this. 
 Hope you have a good Xmas Dinner and a better one than mine.  I often wonder what it feels like to have your legs under a table again. 
 No more news this time.  Still going strong. 
 Love and best wishes for Xmas to all. 
 Your loving Son, Roy.
