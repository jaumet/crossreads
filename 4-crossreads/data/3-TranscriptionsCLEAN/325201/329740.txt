  
 Each day we do the same things at the same time under the same conditions. Nothing happens, This man goes to hospital that man horse's fetlock has filled up. There is nothing new under the sun. Other armies in years &   centuries gone by have boiled on these sands &   under this sun here at Gaza The sun sand &  Gaza are still here only the men  &  the time differ. Whats the use of anything, Why nothing.
