Two Squadrons moved further South nearAssiot,  but we remain in Minia province.  Since Seft Beys funerals the natives favour us by carrying all their dead past the Camp.  While I have been writing 3 funerals have passed.  Life is cheap among the Fellaheins- & they settle domestic disputes with a knife or a stick-Got some MAIL in Cairo & Parcel from May, soapenvelopes Soks  Handkies - No more woollen Soks are wanted in Egypt for 6 months too HOT- Please thank her.
