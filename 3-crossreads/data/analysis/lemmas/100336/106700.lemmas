 not know how mani . After this he said noth . No doubt he was on the look out for us , but due to his ignor of German he was not certain . We said good-by to him and move off along the road , but he follow us keep about 100 yard behind . After go anoth mile or two we sat down again , and he came and spoke to us again , ask question about prison of war but we alway had an answer for him . We were almost sure that he knew who we were and were almost on the point of throw ourselv on his merci . We move off again and after go a few hundr yard we saw that he was not follow us so we quicken our pace . Here anoth strang thing happen . We met the old man who Nichol had bought the food off in the villag onli three day befor . He was with a gendarm ( polic ) with slung rifl . At first we thought that he had afterward had suspicion on us and had been into Mersini to bring the polic out to look for us but they pass us . The old man just nod and smile , and we breath freeli onc more . We were get veri close to Mersina and there was a lot of traffic on the road so we decid to leav it . All round the outskirt of Mersina there are veget and fruit garden of about 2 acr each . Note from side : Mersina veri import town larg port pop . 20,000 about Greek . They are not fenc off but just separ by narrow lane and surround by poplar tree which look veri nice . All these garden are irrig from a small river or rather a creek , which flow through Mersin . They are most own by Christian Arab . ( Greek ? ) After leav the road we made our way toward these garden as we thought we would be abl to buy some food and by go through them we would miss go through the town of Mersin . The first peopl we met were three Arab women . Two of them were wash cloth , the third was cook Arab bread . I think it is just flour and water flatten out till it is about 2 ft . squar and not much thicker than a sheet of brown paper . We immedi ask them to sell us some , but they said they had none to spare so we ask for some fruit . We could see the grape grow and knew they were ripe . One of the women call a boy out who climb up one of the tree with a basket and got us about 3 lbs . of grape . There the grape vine grow up the tree and I do n't think I have ever seen such larg bunch of grape ani where els . Just as were walk away one of the old women ran after us with one of these sheet of bread I will call them . We offer to pay but she would not take the money . We thank her veri much and went on our way . We went into anoth hous and there we found a woman and two or three children . We ask for bread but without luck . We ask her to sell us some fig . She sent a littl girl out with a basket with us to pick them . When we thought we had about 1 oke ( 2 1/5 lbs ) we came back to the hous for the woman to weigh them . The weight was just under the oke so she made us take an onion to make up the weight , although we said it was near enough ( this 2 1/5 lbs of beauti fresh fig onli cost us 2 piastr ( 4d ) ) . Just as we were about to leav a man arriv ; evid this woman 's husband . He look veri suspici at us but said noth .
