 We are travelling many miles off the usual trade route, running right around the coast of Guernsey.  Saturday 3rd July 1915.   The subs evidently endeavoured to break all records on the number of ships sunk in 1 day.  This mornings Wireless Press reports 6 ships having been sunk by them yesterday, a total tonnage of 20000 tons.  None of the boats sunk had wireless.  It is sheer murder sinking these boats.  The crew cannot have the faintest notion where danger lies as they have no means of receiving warning.  At 4am the mate on watch noticed three trawlers travelling in the opposite direction.  When they were in line with us the[?] wheeled towards us and one of them hoisted the signal Stop immediately.  We stopped &amp; the trawler came alongside.  A naval officer came aboard for particulars.
