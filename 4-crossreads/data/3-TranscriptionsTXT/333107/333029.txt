Thur. Apt. 18Busy day. Heard today that all men who are not C class are to be replaced by C class men on staff jobs, so it looks as if the 'ashers are coming "the proverbial".
Friday Apr. 19Got my "marching out" orders today, together with Arthur Foster (3 Troop[?] and Toby Nicholson (14 Batt.)
Rep'd to orderly Room and Toby and I were put in Hut 11, 7 Camp. Foster got a job on the Messing Staff.
Sat. Ap. 20
Showery day. Went for Route March.
After Tea Toby, Bill Beards, George Lawson and I went into Warminster. We Houp-lade and played darts and had a few little sips of Light refreshment.
Warminster is quite lively on a Saturday night as most of the crowd from 1 C P and O T B get there. We arrived back in Camp just on Lights out after one of the most pleasant nights I have spent since being in Blighty.
