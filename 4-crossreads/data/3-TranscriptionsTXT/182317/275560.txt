26 Salisbury Rd Rose Bay 10 June '65Dear Fergie, I would have liked to have been present at your last appearance but was unaware of it. You were one of those that upheld the highest ideals of judgeship & were one of perhaps a very few whose court could be relied on as being a place of peace & courtesy where barristers knew a fair & patient hearing would be had. Congratulations on your record & every wish for  happy years of retirement. Kindest regards to Madge & yourself. No reply necessary - a wave of recognition at the club quite sufficient. Yours sincerely B.V. Stacy
