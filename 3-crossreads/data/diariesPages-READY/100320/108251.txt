Slept well in a warm bed set down in a poor room through which the two agreeable old folk who live here have to pass. They were up at dawn in the morning and offered me coffee. Another clear fine day. In the streets of this place are a fair number of miserable looking civilians. Billeted in the town are at least 2 Brigades. According to a furphey we are not now going to the Rhine but orders we found at DHQ last night provided for us getting on the move again on the 26th when we make a 10 mile trek followed by several others similar which will bring us on to the border. Our little adventure at DHQ last night was unique. To be wanderers in a cold street and suddenly to step into luxurious comfort and a sumptuous meal. It was a very fine room and a comfortable fire. The troops marched down from the station â€“ a good march.
