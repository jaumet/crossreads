Daybreak saw the storm spent of its previous day’s fury & we were able to walk about the deck with some degree of ease & pleasure. Mess orderly.

A pleasant afternoon with Southern Arabia on our right. Calm seas with cool breeze tempering suns rays. Due north Cape Gardifue noon, NW comes island "Socotra".

Approaching Aden. Steamers becoming frequently – passed Harrison Liner – Aden to India – at about noon. Others sighted.

Hot close evening – ships in the night spoke 3 cruisers – Japs it was said, flashlights signalling & shore fires. Passed through Hell’s Gate at about 3 am

Received first wireless concerning war to the effect that Gen. French had reported that Germans were active on the French Frontier & had gained trenches but had been repulsed. Message posted on saloon deck at about 8 p.m. Dated "London official 20th July 1915".

Wednesday 21st July 1915

In the Red Sea – calm sea – muggy & sticky atmosphere – at 7 o’clock 3 ships in sight to the north – a large passenger, small packed & cargo in light trim – we soon passed them & they quickly faded away in the haze.

No Parades a/c excessive heat.

Barren huge rocks rising in pyramidical shape for the most part & towering into the sky. As we passed each group of the Apostles with their white lighthouse perched on their highest point, I could not reconcile
