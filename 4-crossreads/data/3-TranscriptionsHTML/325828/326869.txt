<p>From to-morrow night on we will be running at night with all lights out as a safeguard against submarines.  We are expecting to sight some warships soon which will act as convoys, while we are in dangerous waters   I will leave this letter now &amp; finish it later when there might be more news of interest.<br/>Since writing the above the weather has altogether changed.  During the last 24 hours the ship ran into 2 heavy rain-storms accompanied with a bit of lightning &amp; so we are having a stretch of cold weather    It is also a lot rougher now than it has been for over a week but not nearly as rough as when crossing the Bight.<br/>The kit-bag is of great value as I am able to keep under lock &amp; key any of my possessions I am not using   I have often been envied for bringing such a decent sized one.<br/>We "crossed the line on Monday Afternoon 29th Nov. about 2 P.M.  There was much argument over the matter but nothing special occurred.  Generally in passenger boats they post up the position of the vessel each day but they are not doing it in this case.<br/><u>Tuesday Dec 7th</u>  A week has elapsed since I wrote the above.  We arrived in Aden on Saturday (4th Decr.) at daybreak   I had been on duty the night before &amp; they woke me</p>
