falling but things are very muddy but this did not stop us from going on the usual route march, for a change we had the band with us they marched us for a good hour then about turned back to Camp without a spell, pretty rotten I reckon, but they have treated us very shabbily here, Capt Somerset is the cause of it all, he is too regimental for us, is thoroughly disliked by the Coy, I wish we could get rid of him, for he is making things very unpleasant for the lads I might say for all of us
Today we got orders that we were moving tomorrow for the Somme that we were hopping in for our cut at the earliest opportunity so there will be a few of the lads missing in a week or so worse luck
