 3/8/18 Villers-Bretonneux to a kind of slow barrage. Received word that the Hun has evacuated Dernancourt and that there are signs of him retiring from Mondidier. Efforts on the part of the 21st to capture a prisoner proved futile. The men had a terribly hard night tonight they had to do 6 hours digging without having had anything to eat for 12 hours. Every gas guard and all other details had to go on the job. They are working my men to breaking point and it worries me a lot. The people behind simply don't realize what the chaps have to do. Stayed up until 1 a.m. We shifted our headquarters from this wretched and evil smelling dugout up to where the 21st H.Q. is and settled down there.
