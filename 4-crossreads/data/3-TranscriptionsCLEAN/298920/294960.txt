Friday 17th Sept.  Rough seas all day, felt very sick up till bedtime.  Ship hove to for a couple of hours this morning.  Sea so rough.Saturday 18th Septr.  Sea calm sun shining brightly all day.  Usual night exercises, add plate of arrowroot to 3 cups cocoa.Sunday 19th Septr.  DittoMonday 20th "  DittoTuesday 21st "  DittoWednesday 22nd "  Missed Durban press for the first time since leaving port this morning.  Probably now out of range.  When yesterdays press was received we were 1000 miles from Durban; taking into consideration the fact that it is only a 260 mile station, this is not bad.  Next land stations we shall hear will be Australian stations.
