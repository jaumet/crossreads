<p><u>Friday 17th Sept.</u>  Rough seas all day, felt very sick up till bedtime.  Ship hove to for a couple of hours this morning.  Sea so rough.<br/><u>Saturday 18th Septr.</u>  Sea calm sun shining brightly all day.  Usual night exercises, add plate of arrowroot to 3 cups cocoa.<br/><u>Sunday 19th Septr.</u>  Ditto<br/>Monday 20th "  Ditto<br/>Tuesday 21st "  Ditto<br/>Wednesday 22nd "  Missed Durban press for the first time since leaving port this morning.  Probably now out of range.  When yesterdays press was received we were 1000 miles from Durban; taking into consideration the fact that it is only a 260 mile station, this is not bad.  Next land stations we shall hear will be Australian stations.</p>
