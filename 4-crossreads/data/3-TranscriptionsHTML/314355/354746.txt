<p>April 22, 23<br/>supplements from Pears, an open grate, and a mantel, silver candlestick flanked, and loaded, with incense and two friendly ticking clocks.  "A room &ndash; more like a whore's than a man's".  All have our own individual easy chairs, our places at table, our own champagne and liquer glasses.  The room will be spotlessly clean and the talk free of all &ndash; for five minutes:  then glasses innumerable, champagne &amp; sinister liquer glut in the soft lighting of candles.  And there's a war on! and he's shelling us!</p>
<p>Mail:  from T.B.C., James Stephens "The Crock of Gold".</p>
<p>April 23<br/>80.<br/>More shelling has added to the ruin of Caestre:  from there this morning a set of Liquer glasses, and two bottles.</p>
<p>Tonight there's expectation of a rush:  today has been busy, and the stunt is for Meteren.</p>
<p>An entry omitted.  The day we arrived here, Greenwood of Transport wounded, and this morning Bert Canty.</p>
<p>April 24, 25<br/>81.  a.m.<br/>To midnight fourty through:  now a slackening at 4 a.m.  A cold clear night, of loud warring:  for a while at midnight we received our shell ration.  Wounded 90&percnt; Machine guns.</p>
<p>This evening a sky of rare loveliness:  as though all the rich wonders of the skies had been massed to forget and hide the world's war, and a terrific orchestred gunfire of all our guns trained on Meteren.</p>
<p>April 25<br/>82.  1 a.m.<br/>A salute to the Landings anniversary of five salvos for the Boche:  about the A.D.S., no casualties.</p>
<p>From 4 yesterday morning one long unending line of wounded to the A.D.S. and some terrible wounds:  the attack on Meteren a failure:  and by the Infantries telling, a failure of the staffs.  Last night's long roar &amp; bombardment by rumour to level Meteren, in any case it was a firing that will live in the Boche's memory.</p>
<p>Mail yesterday:  from T.B.C. note of "The Crock of Gold" and of Moore's "A Story-Teller's Holiday" still printing.</p>
<p>83.  10 a.m.<br/>Writing, for the first time in our "Living Room".  The remote and serene beauty of the Medici Print of Perugino's The Crucifixion,</p>
