Darling Mum & KidsI wrote you all a letter each about a week ago, & through circumstances of various sorts have still got them here. So I'm sending them with this one. They are in official green envelopes & might not arrive with this one. I got Nance's letter the other day dated 9/7/15 & ought to get another soon as there is a big mail for us today or tomorrow sometime. Nance says she's glad I've kept out of it so long! Well we've been in it almost from the "jump-off" I'm certainly very lucky so far & am still hale & hearty.
I'm so glad that Claude is getting a commission or likely to. It makes a lot of difference - take my word.
It must have been a job, Mum
