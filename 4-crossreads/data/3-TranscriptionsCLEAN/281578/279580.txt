  
 13th Bn against the 14th. I was picked, & with the 3 others from D Coy. selected, walked on to Querrieu, & the match was played in the chateau grounds. Our team went under, as after leading by 9 runs on the first innings the 13th got us out very cheaply, & won by 4 wickets. Fathers bowled well for us, & they had a brother of Hughie Trumble (the old Australian XI man) with them, he is a young chap, the Bn. doctor. We played till 8 p.m., & I got back to D Coy's pozzy, hot & weary, & disgusted to find that those on parade were taken for a bath & change of clothing today, so I missed it. Playing cricket in military clothes & boots (we have no other) is rather sweaty work. Fritz flew over & burnt a couple more of our balloons today, the anti-aircraft guns poured in their fire, but didn't get him. It rained heavily, a thunderstorm, before morning, & came into my shelter, & I had to sit up instead of lie down after 6 a.m. Tuesday 16 July Very hot & muggy today, the perspiration poured off one. I had the pleasure of a quiet afternoon, had a decent rest for a change, didn't tramp down to Querrieu with the swimmers for their trial swim. Got parcels from Elsie & Kathleen Tofft today 17 July Played the 16th Bn. cricket
