Neutrals
When the job seems rough & riskyAnd you've got no rum or whiskyKeep on smilin', smilin' smilin'Till you're like a currant BunAnd the Huns they nearly shell yer'Bloomin Taubes they try & fell yerKeep on smilin', smilin, smilinTill you're like a bullocks yokeCause the Huns they know were martyrsNot real soldiers only cartersBad the 'uns they show real pityfor the purely neutral Bloke
