<p>June, 1915<br/>Sunday 20<br/>Hot again &amp; Church Parade rather a fatigue, but I suppose necessary &ndash;<br/>I am learning to drive the Brigade Cars &amp; Cadillac anyone can do so with practice but I never had the chance to learn. Sometimes I take the Signal Motor Bike &amp; have a ride I note Joe does a lot now.</p>
