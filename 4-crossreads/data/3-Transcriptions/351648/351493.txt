<p>My dear Babs R.,</p>
<p>I haven't written <strike>for</strike> to you for some time, I hope you'll forgive me, and although I have been on the point of doing so several times &amp; wanted to do so just to talk with you &amp; pour out my woes I have never brought myself up to scratch, for though I have simply longed for you to talk to &amp; have your sympathy as I feel sure I should have <strike>done</strike> had, its much harder to put it on paper &ndash; I know you are the sort that understands &amp; would make me feel ever so much better for the telling to you, even as you seemed to think in one of your letters that I too could understand &amp; sympathise.</p>
