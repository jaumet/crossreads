  
 Fri. June 8. [no entry] Sat. June 9th  [no entry] Sun. June 10th  Went into Amiens. Got up at 6. Had Breakfast.  Es Smith drove us into Albert Station where we caught the Train.  There was a big crowd & it was some time before we could get our Tickets.  The fare was 1/2 F.  The Train left Albert at 8.30 & arrived in Amiens about 9.45.  There was a big crowd of our chaps in the City & the shops did a thriving Business.  The first place I visited was a photographers.  I got my picture taken & they promised to send them on in 3 weeks time.  20 Fs for a dozen.  Snowy Atherton, Nigger Bowden, Bluey Stanton & Bricky Mason  were with me.  We visited the Cathedral & spent some time viewing the wonderful carvings.  Most of the best work is covered by sandbags.  The weeping Angel is a very fine piece of work.  It is a copy of the original in Rheims Cathedral, which was destroyed.
