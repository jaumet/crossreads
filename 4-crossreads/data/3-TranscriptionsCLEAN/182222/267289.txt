When storm clouds oershadow the Garden                       and spindrift beats on the winds                                        Tho all the fair roses are scattered                                    this comfort the optimist finds                                         When shrills the alarm of the Storm King                          how warm and bright the close curtained room!                 nor cares he if down in the cellar                                   some pessimist croaks of the gloom 
 Today there's no garden unshadowed                            no place from the spindrifts chill breath                           no curtains can keep out the demons                           that sweep under skies so heavy with  Death                 But far on those long trails behind us                           rise memories dreamlike and  old          ----------
