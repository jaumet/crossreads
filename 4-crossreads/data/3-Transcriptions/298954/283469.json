<p>1917<br/>2nd June<br/>We were taken in under the poop-deck &ndash; an evil-smelling hole with a row of tin basins ranged along the side.  'The iron deck was covered with rails &ndash; mine rails.</p>
<p>We were asked to strip and hand over all our clothes and were then made to <strike>scrub</strike> daub ourselves with caustic soft soap.  We took this bath surrounded by dozens of staring Huns dressed in white canvas uniforms.  Our clothes, meanwhile, were being thoroughly searched; every scrap of paper was removed from the pockets by a beautifully garbed Crown-Princish officer whom we christened "Little Willie" "The Beautiful Hun" on the spot.  During all this time we were clad in nothing but prepared-for-the-worst expressions, and were kept busy answering or evading all sorts of questions.</p>
