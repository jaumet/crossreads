 Neill.  Went to A.I.F. headquarters & got sick leave 1 month, hope to get it advanced, I leave tomorrow with Dolly for St Anns-on-Sea & will come back & see Laura when she is back in London. I am writing this waiting for Mr Neill to turn up he asked me here for a weekend, but as I'm off tomorrow I cannot stay- he has been away at Bournemouth. My Bronchitis is much better & wound quite healed.
