<p>&amp; Caix to a place just outside the last named village.  We arrived after dark and occupied an old German trench for the night.  Notwithstanding shelling &amp; bombing &amp; a pretty cold night I slept fairly well after the march of about 16 kilometres.  On the way up we passed through numerous old enemy positions, past old trenches, dumps of ammunition, &amp; material, railways, notice boards in German etc.<br/>We stayed about all day with one of the battalions of our Brigade going into the line and at 5 p.m. went 4 kiloms. further forward to Pozieres where our Ambulance is establishing an A.D.S. in a brick factory still in fairly good condition.  We are fairly close to the line &amp; Fritz is occupying the next village, Chaubrers, [?] an important railway centre.  The place is under shellfire and some very heavy stuff has been coming over during the evening.  Prisoners taken during the advance now total 28000 &amp; guns 500.</p>
