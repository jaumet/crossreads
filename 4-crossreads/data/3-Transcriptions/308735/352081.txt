<p>Wednesday, April 24th<br/>Up at 6-30 on parade 6-45 after rollcall we were marched off to breakfast.  8-45 parade, had jerks and games till 10-30.  (I took part in cockfighting, by some means made my opponent's nose bleed, but he won.)  We were then dismissed for the morning.</p>
<p>12-30 parade, with gas masks, and waterproofs and tin hats had to march about 2&frac12; miles (all up hill) to the gas testing at the "Tommies" camp, it took all afternoon to put us through Lacramentary and Chlorine Gas, drill and lecture, arrived back in camp 6 p.m. as hungry as hawks.  The march was through some fine country thickly wooded, from the camp a fine view could be seen right across to the bay at Le Havre, with the town in the valley with some fine hills as a background.</p>
