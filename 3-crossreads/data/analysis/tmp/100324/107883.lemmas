 18/9/15 Gallipoli to view with everi light glow and their vivid red cross . What a cargo of pain is on a hospit ship ! Abdul woke up again this afternoon and start to play hell . Artilleri open and bombard made it hot for us . Right up at Suvla we could see them get it too . Sudden the shell stop and they open heavi rifl fire and machin gun . Bayonet were shown over their parapet and there was everi indic of an attack . We repli with steadi fire at their parapet and until they stop . Two aeroplan up . Shrapnel bullet drop round . While talk with Hogarth one hit him but was stop by a pocket book . A few casualti ? one man 's eye blown out . Bde Major rang up but phone were useless on account
