Insults the garrison women with such bland pestering that the B.W.I.R gets on its dig & requests the Admiralty to remove him back to his ship. 24. Goes into the native town & commits atrocities that a mad Hun or Chow would blink at - (He is going to fight because of the way the Huns treated boys & girls of tender years in Belgium) 25. Is insulted when his Chaplain tells him a few home truths but scornfully rejects the information that , "these people look upon you with scorn & contempt, because of your treatment of their women & children - the men call you 'white coolies' because of your filthy talk directed at them & theirs - You have made the name of your nation stink here just as you have in the South, just as those who have gone before you have also done in France and England. These people are not only civilised, they are citizens of the British Empire - as loyal as you - in all but colour - Superior to you in knowledge of war. They have fought for Britain, many of them are now away fighting. They helped to win the Cameroons. They are helping to win East Africa & they are helping.
