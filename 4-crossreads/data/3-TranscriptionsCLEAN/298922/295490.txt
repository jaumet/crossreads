 Please post me a well bound Pocket book like this for DIARY. This will last till end of September only. Not far from here is a flat piece of couch grassed land, a pretty spot surrounded by Fig Trees etc.:-  at present an Aerodrome no doubt some day a Race Course or Polo ground - here are all sorts of planes DE HAVILANDS, Bristol Monoplanes, Vickers [indecipherable] Martinsides etc:  an alarm was given & the way the machines came out was like upsetting a Beehive.  At last the Tables were turning.   Our machines chased the HUN home. Stanley Braim is back in Cairo trying  again  for his commission so I did not see him. KEITH URQUHART I think is there, Rutledge has gone to England.
