23 Another alarm at 1 oclock this morning but false one. So lay down with all equipment on for a doze again. But roused again at 1.30 and stood to arms until daylight, waiting for Turks to Box-on. Our Howitzer,s carry out usual programme bombarding enemy trenches. Turk gunners reply and do some good shooting. Warships stir them up with a few high explosives now and then, for old times sake.
24 Stand to arms at 1 oclock this morning until 4 A.M. but the wily Turks have not made the long expected charge as yet. Enemy guns shell beach hevily again this morning doing a lot of damage to stores. Sounds of heavy fireing going on out towards "Krithia". Everything pretty quiet on our left. Retire early to night for a good rest.
25 Out again at 1 oclock this morning as Turks were reported comeing on towards our trenches, so every man on the alert. But the Turks came at our troops near "Walkers Ridge" and got a warm reception leaving many dead on the field. Our losses were 28 killed and wounded. They carry out their usual programme and shell the Base and landing stage, several reported to have been wounded. They can hardly miss hitting someone as there are allways such a large number of men doing duty on the beach.
