<p>16 June 1918 Sunday<br/>Too hot for even enemy to shell us, no thermometer but it is as HOT as I've ever known it to be.  Our men are like they were on the peninsular-   "Half naked, language appalling, they never salute but they always go on" as I wrote you years ago.  Johnnie Turk sent a message he would not attack us as after the summer only a fatigue party would be necessary to bury us! reckoning we had not the <strike>GUTS</strike> strength to stand the valley but he said that on the Peninsulars.  No church possible</p>
