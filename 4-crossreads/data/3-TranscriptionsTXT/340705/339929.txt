Gallipoli,Aug. 21st '15
Dear old Mick,
Was very pleased to receive your letters of June 18th & 28th also big batch of papers, the most welcome of which was the Torchbearer containing poor Lee Pulling's photo.  Poor chap was killed by a piece of shrapnel hitting his head.  Hugh was quite broken up, but has improved since.  A clever verse entitled "Tom, Dick or Harry" by Lock Pulling so I expect he will take his son's death in the right spirit.  Convey my sympathies to him, please Mick, and tell him I am writing later.
By the way our mails were delayed a week owing to the whole bally lot being sunk by the Turkish long range artillery.  But the mail bags were good and very little water got in.  You can just see the traces on your letter which I am enclosing as it might be of some interest.
The school concert was evidently done in real Varsity style.  Wish I had been there - nearly as exciting as Gallipoli.
