 terrac one door on each side open into a similar galleri , but which have had staircas , now block with rubbish , lead appar to the open air on top of the hill . The third terrac has right in the middl of the half circl an impos seat of honour with nich which were at one time evid occupi by statuari . There is a small ante-room here too . Evident here the Emperor himself sat to view the sport . The whole place is vast , the labour involv must have been enorm , and one can onli gaze in wonder and admir . On the left , as one stand face the huge structur , are some splendid preserv fragment of one of the outer court . The carv over the doorway here is magnific . Leav , fruit and flower , with other complic design , stand out as clear to-day as when the hand of the dead master-craftsmen , with infinit skill and patienc , first chisel them from the stone . The stone has been , some red , and some white , and evid polish to an intens degre , and what the finish construct must have look like with the sun strike on it polish grandeur and magnific , can onli be part imagin . We sat on one of the row of great stone which form the seat , and tri to pictur the scene that had been enact here . The stir gladiat combat , the vast concours of nobl and delic ladi , the vanquish men prostrat after a sanguinari encount , the plaudit of the multitud , and then perhap the tens moment of wait for the signal which gave the beaten man his life or took it from him . Unreal and shadowi , becaus of our own scanti knowledg of such thing , the pageant move befor us and the vast assemblag rise , and the ancient galleri resound to the tramp of mani feet as the throng seek their palati home . Sit here too , one look on over the town of Amman , dirti , mean , squalid as ani other Eastern town . Remark contrast , link between the old and the new , the splendid and the mean , present themselv to the eye . From the centr of a cluster of mud hous with flat roof , rise a singl column of granit four or five feet in diamet and tower abov it squalid surround to a height of thirti feet . Away on the left amid similar surround part of the wall and tower of some great fortress rise . An old bridg of enorm stone span the stream . Granit and marbl column are everywher . Over all is the mark of Arab occup . The huge galleri of the Coliseum , and the ante-room all bear the unmistak hallmark of Turkish occup . They have stabl their hors in the galleri and live in the ante-room , and dirt and evil smell are everywher . Away on the hill in front are more mass of ruin where the ancient Capitol stood .
