<p>3.<br/>Had the war not ended when it did I was expecting a trip out to Sydney during a furlough of 6 months, for which I applied towards the end of October. I have not yet heard the result of my application but in any case if a return to peace conditions is imminent I don't quite see how I can allow six months of idleness to come in at a rather important stage.</p>
<p>I have been for some time thinking of resuming University work at Oxford and understand that there is a definite system at that university to meet the cases  of overseas men whose 'varsity work was broken into by the war. I am trying to get definite information now about it and although the first term there started last month I might be able to commence lectures at the beginning of the Easter term. Failing that I could get some work over here for a few months and do some preliminary reading before starting lectures next October.</p>
<p>Meanwhile of course I have to return to B.E.F. on Monday &amp; may then see what the position is with regard to the early demobilisation at any rate of balloon sections.</p>
<p>If I go to Oxford I think my reading will be in History and Economics with a good deal of attention to prominent present-day industrial questions. It is an extremely interesting subject, especially over here at present, and easily, tho' I hesitate to tell you of it, drives any thought of resuming law work from my mind.</p>
<p>It may seem to you a gross desertion of my native law but I must plead that three years over here have brought home to me the great attraction of being in close touch with many different world</p>
