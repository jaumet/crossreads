<p>men to a Tent.   This Camp is situated right on Top of a Hill &amp; is well laid out.   The Tents are all let into the Ground down about 18 inches &amp; the Earth is banked up around the sides &amp; the Tents are raised up &amp; the sides are secured on the Bank by Pegs, so when one is laying on the Boarded Floor there is about 3 ft of earth all around, of course this is done for the purpose of protection from Bomb's, as only a direct Hit would do any harm to one sleeping inside.  There are about 4 rows of these Tents.   After placing our Kit in the Tents we all went along to the Dining Room for our Dinner, each man receiving two Plates &amp; a Pannikan, &amp; went inside in single file to a counter &amp; was served with some Roast Beef &amp; Potatoes also Rice &amp; Raisins &amp; some Tea which I enjoyed.   I passed the remainder of the Evening strolling around the Camp &amp; in the Canteen.   Before turning in all hands received one Blanket, &amp; all hands turned in at 10 Pm.   Reveille was sounded at 6 am &amp; after returning our Blanket we had to march again in Single File for Breakfast which consisted of Porridge one slice of Bread &amp; Butter and an Egg, which all hands enjoyed &amp; at 8 am the Boys were paraded &amp; at 8.15 am marched off for the Boat arriving there at 8.45 when we were given two Scones each &amp; then in Single File on to the Boat,</p>
