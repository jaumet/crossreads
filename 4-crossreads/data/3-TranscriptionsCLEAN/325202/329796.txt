equivalent has been taken over by the Military & my company has to supply 2 limbers each morning to the Divisional Sanitary Section & whosever turn it is for that duty has to drive up & down the two long main streets, collecting the road refuse which is swept up & shovelled into the limbers by a gang of old Frenchmen & boys.
This job is commonly known amongst us as being "on the Council" & of course one comes in for a deal of chaff when engaged on it particularly by ones own mates "What did you do Daddy in the great war" is the commonest gibe!
