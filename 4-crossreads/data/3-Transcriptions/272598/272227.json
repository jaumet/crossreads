<p>future.</p>
<p>Tuesday 28.8.17<br/>Arrived at Ebblinghem 6 Am, detrained, slung the old pack &amp; equipment on my back &amp; set off on foot to the unit, where I arrived at 7.15 Am in time for a much needed cup of tea &amp; breakfast.  The day was occupied answering all enquiries &amp; relating my experiences.   Fine budget of mail awaiting my arrival which I was pleased to get &amp; read; it conveyed the good news that my diary had arrived home in good condition.  Feeling collar proud, find it difficult to get used to the old conditions again.</p>
<p>Wednesday 29.8.17<br/>Orderly Corporal for the day, feel rather strange at work once again.  Wrote home fixing up</p>
