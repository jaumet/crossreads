<p>February 1915<br/>Sunday 28<br/>Went to a Ball at the Continental Hotel last night, it was very gay with Uniforms, but not enough girls, if any girls want a gay life they should come to Cairo at once.<br/>It is strange returning to a Dusty Tent in the Desert after the Brilliancy of a beautiful Ballroom, but decent girls do a man a lot of good at this game. I am afraid I cut the leaves too carelessly of my last posting &amp; you will have difficulty in reading. Going to the tombs of the Kaliphs this afternoon.</p>
