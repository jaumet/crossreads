<p>August 1915<br/>Friday 6<br/>My first scratch<br/>Wounded in right arm with shrapnel. Only a fine graze. Our guns opened up on the Turks trenches early in the morning. About 4.30 PM they opened an intensive bombardment and at 5.30 our Batt charged over the parapets, ran over the first and 2nd lines of their trenches, rooted the Turks out and began to work hard to make trenches so as to prevent a counter attack.</p>
<p>Saturday 7<br/>Fine   We worked all last night and are still working. The Turkish losses are heavy. We are on the right wing and they are trying to bomb us out, but we are holding our own. (The New Zealanders have successfully pushed through the Chessboard"). The information was wrong as they did not get through.</p>
