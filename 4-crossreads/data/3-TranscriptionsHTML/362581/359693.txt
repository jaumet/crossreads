<p>My darling Eddy,<br/>At least we have got a few p.cards but they are not as pretty as I would like. Your letters are lovely but I'm just longing to see  you daily. I've ordered an "Anzac" paper to be sent to Ilkley so dear pet you keep it   &amp;  I'll tell you all about it.  Love   &amp;  kisses. Auntie Eadle</p>
