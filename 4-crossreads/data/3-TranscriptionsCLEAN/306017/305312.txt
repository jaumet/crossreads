  
 January 1916 at night went with Harry Newing to Mrs Warner's house near the Central Rly Station whom Harry has got to know here.  There are 5 in the family & they have the knack of making you feel right at home at once.  I just caught the train back to camp in time.  I was in again 4 nights later & we had a splendid evening.  I did not bother this night about getting home in time & stayed at the ordnance store all night & got a car back just before stables. 
 On Saturday 29th I was on inlying picket & on Sunday went into town again & had a good time.  We thought we were leaving on Friday 28th, but word came through on Thursday after we had everything ready for departure that it had been cancelled.  Most of the infantry are at Tel-el-Kebir & on the canal.  There are also Light Horse & other troops at Wardan about 40 miles from Cairo.  Tom Kirton of Dorrigo is in the 7th, has only been here [Possibly Cecil Kirton of Dorrigo]
