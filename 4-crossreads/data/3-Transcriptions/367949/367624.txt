<p>The Mitchell Library<br/>Sydney 28th April 1918</p>
<p>Mr. F. J. Brewer<br/>"Maryvale"<br/>Lytton Rd<br/>East Brisbane</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>In reply to your letter of 21st inst beg to inform you that this library desires to get war diaries in their original form, &amp; as yours has been kept in shorthand you will readily understand that it is not of any value, but to one who can decipher shorthand. Hence its value to the Library is not as much as if it were in longhand. The course now for you is to make a complete copy in longhand &amp; submit it with the original.</p>
<p>If you will send them both along by registered [indecipherable] post an offer will be made to you for them in accordance with their value for the purposes of the Library. You might also add the ship's newspapers, photos, maps, &amp; any other information collected by you concerning the war and an offer may then be made to you for the lot as a whole.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>[(s a)?] H. Wright<br/>Mitchell Librarian<br/>For the Principal Librarian</p>
