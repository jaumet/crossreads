I also received a letter from Keith. He was in hospital with influenza. I had written to him advising him to stop in England and try to get into a school - at any rate to get some sort of base job whilst I am over here and I am glad to say that he recognises the sense of this and is going to do his best for a school. Holmes wrote him a very nice letter and advised him to come over to the 17 th as Basil is now second in command. I don't know whether this would be too good but that's how it stands. Hoping you are all well at home and that your duties are more congenial. With much love, Bert.
