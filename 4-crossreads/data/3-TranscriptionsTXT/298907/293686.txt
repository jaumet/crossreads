swarming with people all sitting about on the grass & under the shady trees for it was a glorious sunny day & real hot, the people were all out in their summer dresses & the whole ground was simply a blaze of color with what seemed to be countless thousands of happy little kids running about & enjoying themselves I never seen so many children together before, all Birmingham must have been out taking the air, I know I had a good turn with the little Yankee girl we went down to a bonza little Park, private one with beautiful little lakes fountains rose walk & etc, just the place for a camera & I got quite a number of shots which should prove very interesting.
21st Out again this afternoon with my U.S.A. girl, we got a taxi at New
