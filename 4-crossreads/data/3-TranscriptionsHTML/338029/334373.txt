<p>Wednesday 11th Oct.<br/>Did two rough sick parades, watered, 11th Regs. marched in looking very business like then a few more camel corps, then later the R. Riders, it was a great strain on the wells but they stood well although towards evening the water was very thick.  All is excitement in preparation.  General Dallas &amp; his staff arrived to-day, over 7,000 camels are to be used for transport alone, showing the big nature of the stunt, we have a task next to impossible to achieve but we are all eager and prepared.  To-day one of our camel patrol met a hostile tribe of Bedouin who beat them by numbers using old flintlock rifles.</p>
<p>Thursday 12th Oct.<br/>Off to-morrow to our fate.  God help us to be successful.  The organization is perfect so far, save that the wells and pumps are not doing to well, it took four hours to water to-night, had to go down twice,  Marching orders out.  I stuffed feed after feed into old Zigi all night, we pinched three bales of fibre [?].</p>
