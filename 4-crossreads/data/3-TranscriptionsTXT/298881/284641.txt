Wardreque Sunday 26/8/17Yesterday, being secretary of our H.qrs Mess and the Mess corporal being sick I I went with the Mess-cart into the town of St. Omer to do some shopping, Saturday being market day or rather one of the market days in France.  We drove through the town square about 8 a.m. and went straight on to the B.E. Force canteen.  I found they did not open till 9 a.m, so I strolled about the botanical gardens, had a look at the varied and many beautiful flowers.  Three beautiful swans were floating on a circular pond and presented a fine picture
