<p>Ferry post &amp; how soon we move off we don't know, the sooner the better as there are much better camps than this one</p>
<p>Saturday 8th April<br/>Last 3 days the same.  Digging pits &amp; sandbagging them to prevent sides caving in.   Owing to striking shale &amp; lime stone the work was fairly difficult but I find no difficulty in keeping going all the time.  Reveille is now at 5.30 A.M.  Start on pits at 6 AM. till 7.  Breakfast 7.30 parade 9 A.M. when we once more start on pits till 12.  Afternoon mostly free with a bathing parade in the Canal.  It is an ideal spot for swimming about 120 yards wide &amp; the water very clean. Large ships pass regularly day &amp; night &amp; look very majestic passing slowly down the narrow channel.  Tis a wonderfully busy scene, in addition to the pontoon bridge which is used whenever ships are not passing, two punts are used for the cross traffic &amp; are packed from morn till night. Motors of all descriptions, waggons, horses, camels, are passing to &amp; fro &amp; the light railway makes several trips out to the trenches.</p>
