 Weather continues fine. The premises we are now occupying are the cause of much comment.  Gardens etc. are looking first class. Exp. Force Canteen next door to us - Comes in handy for morning and afternoon tea. Fritz threw shells round our end of the town and inflicted many casualties on the 29th Batt.  Stray pieces of steel flew into our yard.
