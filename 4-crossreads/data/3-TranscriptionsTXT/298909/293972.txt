3/5/16  Wednesday
Very dusty all day - Drill all the morning - we also had collection of supposed wounded, up sand hills & down the banks of the Canal - In the evening we had a medical inspection - one man was put out. They also made enquiries about our gear & the Major said he wanted us to be uniformly dressed as we would be criticised in France. All our Ambulance transport horses were commandeered by the Artillery & today we got in a draft of raw mules, talking about fun on the Bristol - any man could pick one & do his worst. I never laughed so much for a long time.
