<p>15-1-17<br/>Mon 15th<br/>At 9 oclock last night several of our 'planes came in showing blue lights apparently they have been on a night raid; &amp; again this morning 7 went out heavily laden, it  is a fine sight to see them one fast battle 'plane flying very high &amp; some distance ahead to clear the way followed by the bomb carriers flying close together in line followed by a light scouting 'plane on either flank. All the 'planes returned soon after dinner: We had a Taube over early this morning but she did not stay long &amp; dropped no bombs. 14 Turks came in &amp; gave themselves up yesterday &amp; several more today; The weather has been perfect since I returned from my trip.</p>
