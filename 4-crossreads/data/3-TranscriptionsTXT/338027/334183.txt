 Saturday, 22 May, 1915 Left Imbros back to the base Lemnos, found the harbor full of boats as well as the entire French Fleet of battle ships  It was a fine sight as we passed them, we anchored right in the harbor and the big liner Franconia drew right alongside us and took off all our slightly wounded and convalescents,  when they are better she will take them back to the front.  Our boat is taking only the serious cases, we are to receive 35 more here.  Two more died last night one a Turkish officer.  Once I could not look at the dead but now I can dress them fix them up and carry them anywhere.  News comes that Major General Bridges is killed, this is our 2nd General we have lost.  the Turks casualties are about five to our one.  I have a good ward now a few light cases mostly nervous breakdowns from the effect of bursting shells.  Since the Turks came aboard every man has become lousy with body lice off the dirty devils. 
 Sunday, 23 May. The N.Z. [indecipherable] went ashore [indecipherable] a base hospital leaving us only to look after all the patients to Alex.  There is nothing to make us remember Sunday there is no service we are all to busy attending wounded &amp; sick.  A party went ashore to-day to bury some dead and procure stores, as we are badly off for provisions. Lemnos is a quaint beautiful place with a fine harbour.  There are 17 villages in it all occupied by Greek peasants who wear typical costumes. 
 The French reinforcements are there as well as all the Indian Transports.  The French uniforms are mostly a ridiculous lot all colours scarlet to sea blue even red tassels on their boots, this is how they go to war.  The allies are holding their own and are steadily driving the Turks back little by little in land but an enormous toll of Dead Turks to mark the victory.  I am in charge of a good ward now about 40 convalescents and light serious cases pneumonia &amp; rheumatic fever I am becoming a first class nurse and can take the most serious cases.  I have to feed four of them  with the spoon.
