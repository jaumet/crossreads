31 THURSDAY
Fine & warm. Working round the
pit all day filling sandbags ect.
I was firing on some stunts
all afternoon. Did S.O.S. Guard
at night & then pit guard after.
We had a fire in the pit
in afternoon & it burnt a lot
of our camel fly & sandbags
but did no further damage.
I fired my first shot out of
an 18 pounder. Fritz sending
over a few, but did not do
much damage. we were
sending them over all day
in one stream. Fritz got a dump
behind us at night
