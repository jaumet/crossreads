 Hobart and anchor in Barnes Bay.  From e  there all Tasmanians are taken to the "quarantine station" in a very small launch.  The water is rather rough and great amusement is afforded us by the attempts of the "Tassies" to get from one boat to the other.  Unfortunately (for them) it will be necessary to do 7 days in quarantine. 
 One of the ship's boats gets adrift and causes more merriment
