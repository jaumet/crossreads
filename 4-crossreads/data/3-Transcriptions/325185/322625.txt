<p>to make up their number were sent back to the reinforcements. So we have to go back also. I won't be surprised if we are called up again yet though should we be moved from this company before Wed will let you know. Will apply for leave on Wed night wont be as hard to get away from this lot as it would have been in the reinforcements.  Tell Miss Smith the cold is just O.K. it was only the want of the good old fashioned stew. Living at Marshall st was to heigh after what we are used to here. No more just now Father will see you Wed if all goes well.<br/>Love &amp; Best Wishes<br/>Your sincere son Clyde</p>
