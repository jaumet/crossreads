  
 glad to hear Keith is getting on and awfully glad for your sake he won't be able to come back. He's done his share. I only hope that in time he'll get over everything. One sees so many wonderful cases of recovery these days that it seems that to die of wounds is rare. 
 One little cove for instance hit a C.C.S. with some of his stomach sticking out of his skin and a pulse that was hardly working. In three days though everyone had given him up he was more or less sitting up with a nearly normal pulse though his wound hadn't been touched, Just sheer gutz that all. 
 Cheerio Judge. My love to Mrs. Ferguson - Dorothy & Keith. 
 Yours very sincerely John Mant.
