up clear right out for good on that I am determined, for when all said done it is only an escapade where we would have been today goodness only knows if someone had not taken risks, theres one thing I am positive of that is if McPherson carries this case to Melbourne he will make a bitter enemy of me for life I have never to date born any animosity but this will be my turning point, I shall be on the alert for this gentleman in the future. how they will be shocked when they get my letter which I intend to send from Colombo also another to my various friends from Fremantle if we call there, all I hope is that they get them before the boat gets in wouldn't a chap look nice being marched away his friends looking on, I pity Bill May Braithwaite
