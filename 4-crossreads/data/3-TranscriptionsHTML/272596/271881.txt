<p>the impulse of the moment</p>
<p>Got nicely burnt about the face yesterday &amp; this morning my nose is like a ripe cherry, hope it goes off before I get home or they will be thinking that I am a walking advertisement for "Johnny Walker"</p>
<p>The whole ship had a kit inspection this afternoon &amp; all military &amp; surplus articles were taken away from the men you would have been surprised had you only seen the immense quantities of clothing, such as hats breeches shirts boots tunics &amp; extra blankets that were collected, luckily for me I missed this for I was put on one of the gangways to stop all troops from going below while they were examining kits &amp; clearing the decks of clothing &amp; etc, &amp; so I have still got the few things in my black kit bag, &amp; I think I have a good chance of getting through with them now</p>
