 Opposite one of the "bays" &amp; from that one only! a very good target was "spotted". Between two leaning stumps of willow trees in No Mans land and over the enemy's trench where it took a sight dip, a careful observation at 350 yards distance revealed a mark which was plainly seen to be about 2 feet of the top of the open door way into a cookhouse

This fierce uninterrupted fire cut the top layer of our sand bags so much that 30 additional bags had to be filled &amp; kept in the "bay" for replacing the bags as they became too much cut about to be quite safe.
