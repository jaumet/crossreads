We finished up at about 6 oclock in the morning having passed through 70 wounded including the Germans.The raid I fancy was a success although the left wing was held up by German bombers whose trench had escaped the strafe.  The German trenches were battered to pieces & their losses must have been very heavy.  Our killed are not yet counted up but I expect it will be about 30.An aeroplane was up & dropped parachute lights indicating the gun positions of the Bosch.The whole front was like a scene from fairyland with its star shells & red & green lights except for the screech of devilish shells & the roar of artillery.Went home at 7 in the morning.  I began to feel tired then.  Our Batt. on whose
