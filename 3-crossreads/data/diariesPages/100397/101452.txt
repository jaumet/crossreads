Paid my respects to Mrs. G. then returned to town with Mr and accompanied him to his place of business, he carries on the business of Tin manufacturer makes tins of various kinds from Army biscuit to vaseline tins and incidentally makes a very fair amount of Tin which he puts into the bank. he told me confidentially that there is nearly 93 per cent profit in the business ? and the turnover is upwards of 12,000&#163; per wk. just a present , ----what seems enormous. he has money to play with, one of his sons manages the Biz, a second is in a second biz somewhere, and Jack the third is in the Army a Lieut. Jane is the Nurse of whom I wrote and Elsie the baby ? has a childrens class somewhere. She is delicate, but is an exceedingly nice girl, very quiet, and quite natural in all her ways. we got on well during my two days visit, I also met the sons wife "a Lively Talkative Lady who asked me many questions about Australia, of course I could not resist telling her a few stories of the bush which at first she was inclined to believe were romances ? never the less they were Perfectly true.
