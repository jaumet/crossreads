<p>Monday 10 December 1917</p>
<p><strike>Malta</strike> still, I don't mind as we are able to see so much of interest here.</p>
<p>Four of us went to a "Maltese" Hotel &amp; had a Fish &amp; Spaghetti dinner. Malta is a cheap place to live in. Cold &amp; rough weather, we are glad to be going to Egypt &amp; wish Laura would come. Parties have been digging up Flint arrow heads among the Tombs, Phoenicians, Greeks, ROMANS, ARABS, all had their day. I wonder if this is England's swan song.</p>
