  
 The German lines are  3 kilometres away. There are no tramways, gas electricity, telephones nor telegraphs. Many of the people live in caves & underground houses. At the same time, there is plenty of food, military bands play & there are cinemas for the troops. Was forgetting to mention one interesting thing I saw during my ride to St. Omer & that was the little steam trams that connect up the various villages, The rails are laid in parts along the side of the roads & in others they cross through fields or round the side of a hill. These trams are only little things but it is very interesting to see one puffing along. They must be very handy for the country people.
