  
 brains of the "heads" of our affairs. St Roch station being heavily shelled & I spotted 8 men of the Bde. lying out killed. Most of our air bomb casualties we caused when the men were coming along the streets with their packs. A bomb also came through the roof of the hospital. No wonder we get this bombing & shelling when they march the whole brigade in column of fours into Amiens in broad daylight with bands playing right in view of the enemy airmen. 
 Fri Apr 12th:- Moved by train from St Roch Stn this morning & moved 
 Through Doullens & St Pol to Hazebrouck. After a wait on the roadside we received orders to move forward towards Fritz wherever he might be & no one seemed to know. The road is a continuous stream of transports moving back with all the stores they can hold & detached parties of "Tommies" who have become lost, stolen or strayed. Can't get anything intelligent out of them though they swear that every Jerry possesses a machine-gun. Seems to me that the whole damn lot are more intent on getting back than getting up. They'll make a good advance guard - for the civilian's retreat.
