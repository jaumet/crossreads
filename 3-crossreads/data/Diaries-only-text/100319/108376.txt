25/9/18 Cappy
A rather memorable day in the history of the A.I.F. and of the Bde. "A" Co. 21st allotted to us were ordered to march in at 9.45. They refused to move. After lunch their officers reported but their demeanour was such as leave no doubt as to where the men were getting their support from. I endeavoured to say a few welcoming words but might as well have spoken to icebergs. Later on the General came and I suggested a scheme of compromise which he welcomed. After mess word came through that for the present "everything was suspended" which looks like an ignominious crawl down on the part of the authorities and straight out and complete victory for the strikers. A fine chilly evening.
