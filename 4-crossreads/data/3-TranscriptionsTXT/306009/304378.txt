1915July 11 Sun.Attended Evening Service at All Saints.Heard the British Military Band which plays even on Sunday evenings in the Esbekieh Gardens.Saw a couple of Battalions of Australian Infantry marching through Cairo streets, returning to camp after a route march - all wearing the shirt & short pants.The Australian troops look far more tough than the other Troops & better fighters - but they lack the discipline of the others. - Physically they are far superior to the "Tommies". The N.Z. men appear to be good all round.
