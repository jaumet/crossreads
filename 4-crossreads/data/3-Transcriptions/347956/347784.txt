<p>Sat 21st<br/>Woke up at "reveille" this morning &amp; was surprised to see that all the ships are at a standstill; I believe we lost two of our ships last night &amp; had to wait for them to catch up again.  we have left the main fleet behind us &amp; they are out of sight.  we are a flying squadron &amp; travelling at 13 knots per hour, I believe we take fresh water</p>
