  
 August 1917 of Westminster Dragoons look after the horses & come out with us on parade to hold them.  We do 21/2 hrs mounted work before breakfast & on our way back we take a couple of hurdle on the way.  The horses are in great condition but are rather heavy for Light Horse work.  Most of the work is done at the trot a pace we do not have in the Light Horse & the horses are a lot rougher than our own.  We have several lectures each day & also bayonet fighting.  On the Wednesday afternoon we got leave into town & met several of our regt there.
