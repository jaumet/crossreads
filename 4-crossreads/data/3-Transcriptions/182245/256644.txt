<p>MAY 1917</p>
<p>9 WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>A beautiful warm day. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all day, but I got all</p>
<p>mine finished &amp; wrote a few</p>
<p>letters. The 26<sup>th</sup> Battery played</p>
<p>H.Q rugby in evening &amp; we</p>
<p>won by 26 - 5. Fritz doing</p>
<p>a bit of shelling all day.</p>
<p>The roumer about Russia</p>
<p>was without foundation</p>
<p>thank goodness, &amp; we hear we</p>
<p>are pushing old Fritz back</p>
<p>everywhere. Got a letter from</p>
<p>mother to say Alan had</p>
<p>the Military Cross.</p>
