10/1/18 Randolph Hotel. Oxford
A fine day with sun. The town is chock full of the most old venerable buildings whichever way you turn and a big proportion of those not colleges i.e. private houses, inns, shops and the like also appear to be ancient. Just outside the hotel is the Martyrs cross erected some 60 years ago when the High Church movement was on, to the memory of Ridley, Latimer Cranmer who were here tried for their anti-papal teachings. The streets are busy and full of good shops but over all is an air of seclusion learning that is due to so many schools college buildings. In the streets a great many cadets with white banded caps for each college has a company of aspirant officers in lodging there. Went into the old church of St Michael at North Gate ? an old square squat tower with slits well adapted for bow and arrow defence.
