  
 Thur 1st July Out of trenches at 5 & to blankets. Rested to 12 Out of sorts. Feel need of different tucker, want tinned milk & cocoa or coffee. Officers can buy or obtain all they require but a private even if he has money can get nothing Day in day out Bully Sun bathed for weeks, bacon & cheese & jam. None of them bar former too bad but the stomach revolts at the eternal sameness No fruit preserved or otherwise 
 Rice  second  time to day - Bennett roots Bob Harrison up with his foot. Bob curses him. This is a fair idea of what one can expect from such officers (cads) as we have. Dolly McLeod is back. Heard him say he'd lost a stone, but he's gained no savoir faire. Makes no attempt to greet his men or ask how things are going
