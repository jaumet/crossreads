<p>28 May, 1916<br/>Hill 70<br/>We got the stuff on the trucks yesterday &amp; had it landed here at dinner time.  There was a great dishing out of goods during the afternoon &ndash; I was glad when I got it all fixed up, every one seemed pretty well satisfied.  Perce left for the School of instruction last night &ndash; I hope he gets on alright.  I am on guard on some timber &amp; mats, have fixed up a bit of shade &amp; would be fairly comfortable except for the flees whose name is Legion &ndash; Asked a Scotsman what he was doing out here, he said "altering the contour of the desert mate"</p>
