<p>22 June 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>Up with the larks &amp; off sniping only saw a couple though &amp; pull their house down about their ears, plenty of arty again from daylight. Aeroplanes in sight 2 at 8 pm one ours &amp; one theirs both our arty &amp; theirs blazing away for all they are worth. News of yesterday confirmed. After lunch have a little fatigue work to do then make up our minds for a dip, beach closed as high exp shell is taking it but we get through &amp; are OK until on the return journey when one ought to have got us but didnt. A Montor assisted by aeroplane is bombarding Gala Tepe with lyditte for all she is worth the effect of the shell is awful, &amp; debris is flying about in heaps, the Turks have in turn sunk one of our water barges so mifish moia for today. Bert Fitton &amp; Irving are back with us from the Cape again. Met Charlie Laurie OK. Paid a visit to Bill Nelson for bridge &amp; nearly got another shrapnel it touched Hal only</p>
<p>23 June 1915<br/>Wednesday 45 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Sniping again at 5 light pretty bad but succeeded in giving one a start. An aeroplane was over early this morning &amp; very low to so something is doing at the back of our position they were hovering there pretty well all day. Went for our usual at 3 pm &amp; the Turks were pumping shrapnel in for all they are worth, they bombarded our positions to far into the night &amp; high explosion at that. The effect is very pretty although pretty dangerous, quite a bomb battle opened up at 7 &amp; for every one they threw we threw two &amp; they quick turned it up. Things were as far as rifle fire went very quiet all day. Our howitzers get on to the gun opposite &amp; Sykes lets his guns loose for once they make good practice on the gabions but the Turks quickly repaired them by next morning. The gun opposite Courtneys gave our parapets hell &amp; blew one poor chap to bits &amp; wounded others. No luck com again not for our brigade but paper will come in handy for future use.</p>
