Battalion's that were engaged round these Hellspots have large crosses as tribute to their fallen heroes : our 1st Division have a fine cross at the Albert entrance to Pozieres : Our 2nd Division has a fine large cross by the old windmill to the fallen heroes in the taking of Pozieres ridge : as an example of the value of "our" ridge victory when standing at the "cross" one can see for miles beyond Albert on the one side on the other a clearview to the Arras-Bapaume road can be had : had an interesting day strolling over the old places got home for tea : gas alarm at midnight but none came our way : plenty of gun fire lately : also plenty of planes kicking around :
