<p>walking cases went ashore.  I did not get away till three and after purchasing a few things we went for a three hours rickshaw ride, returning to the boat at 6-30 p.m.  MALING-et-INTOX &ndash; Disgusted -</p>
<p>Friday 2nd Feb.<br/>After disgraceful episodes of last night all leave stopped save for the bad patients.  I was like a mother arranging a picnic in a.m. telling the couples off and to take each others hand.  I stayed aboard and let my orderlies go.  Some Ladies came aboard in p.m. and although the heat was stifling I had to get dressed and show them through my wards where they distributed flowers etc.  Then came the Commandant of Ceylon and all his retinue to inspect the ship.  It is rumoured that France has declared war on Holland, they are holding all Dutch ships up in this port.  One of my patients ran amok with a dagger but I got him into a cabin very quietly.</p>
<p>Saturday 3rd<br/>Coaling until 4 p.m. when the gangway was pulled up and we sailed.  Eight seamen off the Brisbane invalided back are returning on this boat, I have them in my ward.  It was lovely to be travelling again, there was not a breath of air in Colombo.  I used just saturate night and day.  All the wasters who played up are doing cells now.</p>
<p>Sunday 4th<br/>C.P. in a.m. by Archbishop, quiet day, everybody seems to want to sleep, I have hour off in p.m. but cannot - it is splendid to think now that our next stop is going to be Australia</p>
