 You remember BANJO's Preludes,  I am plagarizing - but  I have gathered these notes, afar in the wind & the rain in the land where the Bedouin Camps are on the edge of the plains. They are just the rude stories one hears in sadness & mirth. The records of wandering years and scant is their worth. Though their merits indeed are but slight I shall not repine. If they give you one moments delight Old Mother of mine.
