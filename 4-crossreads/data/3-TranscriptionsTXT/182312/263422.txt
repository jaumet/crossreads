 case, it is usually one shell only which causes the trouble.&nbsp; Of 
 course a great deal depends upon the nervous state of the man at 
 the time but if a shell explodes immediately in front of him so 
 that the red flame or flash is right in his eyes it seems in many 
 cases that the recollection of the sight of that flash is passed 
 on from the eyes to the brain and thence to the nervous system. 
 The effect is more pronounced if the same explosion killed a couple 
 of men alongside.&nbsp; A man might have his back turned on a shell 
 which blew several men to bits and spared him by some miracle and 
 he would not turn a hair:&nbsp; it seems a recognised thing that he 
 must get that flash into his brain through his eye.&nbsp; The effect 
 of shell shock is to make a man shake all over.&nbsp; He cannot rest 
 and any sudden noise such as the dropping of a mess tin will make 
 him jump.&nbsp; I have seen a couple of cases of the sort in the 
 trenches, men who were as cool as cucumbers, men who had been

 but of course some are never able to face it again.

 the opposing front lines is always a place of interest and 
 excursions out there at night are tinged with a certain amount of 
 adventure.&nbsp; Just where we have been the lines are from 300 to 
 400 yards apart and the intervening land is quite flat with a 
 bit of a stream running parallel to the trenches.&nbsp; For some 
 distance out from the front line each side has a barbed wire 
 entanglement designed to prevent surprise attacks.&nbsp; This wire is 
 constantly being damaged by shell and mortar fire and as fast as 
 it is destroyed it must be repaired.&nbsp; Consequently parties set
