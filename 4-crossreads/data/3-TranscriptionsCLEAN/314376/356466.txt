155[near]ing our camp when we saw a couple of planes brought down a mass of flames. Reached the camp that night just in time for pay. I believed we remained one night in the Nissan Huts of which the camp was composed.
Filling our water bottles, we started off on a long march of 14 miles. The weather was threatening as we set out and shortly after it commenced to snow and continued till we reached Bapaume. The way was across duck-board and then mud eventually when we reached Bapaume along the roads.
What made it hard going for us was the fact that we had to keep our waterproofs wrapped round us to stop the snow getting in.
