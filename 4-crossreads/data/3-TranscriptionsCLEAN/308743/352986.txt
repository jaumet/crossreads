 Another heavy bombardment to wake us at dawn & they kept us on the move to some time, shell after shell came down the valley & got one of our sniper pals in the thigh.  After lunch Hal & I went to pay a visit to a friend of his on Steels Post & there I met Pere & Eric both are well & in good spirits, they are now in a machine gun section & have been doing some rare shooting at time, while we were up there the Turks opened with their arty again & it didn't take us long to get out of it, when we go down to our quarters we were informed that Bill Steele & [indecipherable] had stopped a few about them, then next shell Metcalfe stopped the case with his leg it made an awful mess of it tearing the flesh away & leaving the bone bare to some length I saw all of them fixed up & then got back to tea.  Made application again today for commission at home & hope its ok this time met Fatty [indecipherable] down at the beach he is with the 4th arty reinforcements.  Stopped one myself in the knee.  Alright. 
 17 June 1915 Thursday 
 More arty at break of day its getting quite the order now for a salvo of shell to awaken us during the night the enemy erected many "gabions" & these had to be destroyed by arty today [indecipherable] Sykes baty was employed & in 24 rds he did the job but it drew a heavy fire in return from their guns.  A Turkish patrol surprised one of our m guns & shot the gunner the remainder inskied leaving the wounded man to tend the gun this he did & accounted for all the visitors I might say that they came from NZ.  Went for a swim today & after that on a hunting tour I got 6 today and 6 yesterday, am not feeling a scrap lonely of a night now  All lines patrolled this morning & are now in first class condition, all going along satisfactorily at last, changed time to full Navy today & coded in [indecipherable] just the same..Mail expected tomorrow, Rations cut down by half no transport.  No word of our wounded.
