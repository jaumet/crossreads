August 1916lying about in shell holes &  did not have much cover &  the day was spent in sniping the few who dared to show themselves &  they suffered a few casualties. During the afternoon of the 17th our own big artillery bombarded our front line &  also next day &  we suffered very heavily through same &  it was afterwards found out to be a mistake on the maps of our front line for we were further advanced than shown on the maps. It rained on & off  the whole time on & off in the trench & it was very uncomfortable for it was impossible to carry either overcoat of waterproof & we were wet through & through. It was during the afternoon of the 19th that our relief came &  our battalion was relieved by the 10th Battalion &  it was not till dark they we moved along the communication trench &  we had to move at a good pace for Fritz's artillery was playing at different intervals &  when we reached Albert a little after midnight we were all fatigued &  had a much needed rest. Between the first & second time we were at Poziers our troops had gained over three miles of country &  then there were two divisions to follow us & have been advancing. We remained in billets in Albert till the morning of the 21st & then we had to move back to Warloy where we rested till next day &  then marched to Val-de-Maison where we encamped in the first Anzac
