 9th Febi /18 There was no drought in the Liquor , which howev , I am pleas to say , was not imbib to excess . The rain pelt deafen on the big tent , but this onli had the effect of make everyon sing louder or danc wilder . It seem imposs that such merriment could exist in such an obscur and forsaken place: - a tini squar of desert sand , whose grain have drift for countless age , cover by a thin roof of canva . But I believ our boy would enjoy themselv even in Hade itself . I have seen them hand in hand with death , sing and gay ; under a hail of shellfir , in the fright of winter warfar , blister and thirsti in the desert , unalt . Sure a nation must becom great that breed such men as these . Heavi rain all night and , everyth in flood .
