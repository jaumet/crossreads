<p>1 pm proceeded in &amp; aided by two tugs the harbor being small &amp; conjested by battleships cruisers &amp; destroyers.<br/>2 pm Moored to bouys fore &amp; aft. The Naval people came off &amp; examined the crew of 195 all told. 3 Greek stewards we shipped at Alexandria Egypt last trip on examination here were found to be Turkish subjects with unauthorised passports. These were taken ashore under escort &amp; interned yet these three were shipped through the British Consul at Alexandria, so therefore the British authorities there are to be blamed.<br/>The harbor &amp; town is a very picturesque place. Very strongly fortified the old forts being still intact. We are moored 100 yards from the entrance &amp; 50 yards of the mine field that protects same so that we are within a few yards of dozens of submerged mines &amp; booms. In a very dangerous position should we by any chance break away from our moorings.<br/>The town contains nice &amp; lovely buildings. Clean &amp; well laid out water fronts &amp; streets but like the French &amp; Italian towns very gay. We are taking in here 400 tons of Welsh coal &amp; have had orders to leave tomorrow for Alexandria.</p>
