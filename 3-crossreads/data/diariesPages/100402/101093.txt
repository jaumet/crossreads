Monday 24 June
Last night we were sent up to 2nd Battn. R.A.P. at Molenaker in expectation of stunt. Full moon. At 12.30 this morning our barrage opened in conjunction with South Africans on our left, two Companies of 2nd Battn. went over successfully reached their objective, about three hundred yards. There were about forty casualties, including four Germans. The Bosch hardly fired a shot behind the front line.
We are now back at Borre again.
Tuesday 25 June
Except for light showers, weather continues fine. A walk to La Kreule this evening where there are Americans attached, two Sergeants and three Officers. Already they have introduced base-ball into the Ambulance. They went up the line this evening visiting posts the Sergeants are attached now to Borre. Watching a 9.2" battery in action I was half surprised to see the shell soar away into the air.
