here for a week, & scarcely over a dozen patients have passed through our Main Dressing Station.   It is certainly a great relief, after our trying times on the last Front.   I have sent out, to a number of my pals in the Bearers, reading & writing material, so that just proves to you, how quiet it must be here.   It reminds me of the three weeks I spent in Foray House Dugout, in July & August of last year.    All the week our guns have been going their hardest, in fact its one continuous roar I would not care to be on Fritz's side of the Line, it must be hellish.    The War news lately is very encouraging indeed - The German Press is warning the Public not to be alarmed if their gallant troops retire, to near the Rhine which means evacuate Belgium,  to still have faith in their Leaders etc.   Belgium Factories are being pulled down, & furnaces are being destroyed.
The Italians have at last made a stand & captured a considerable number of prisoners.   The Flanders fighting is still in our favour & the Allied Troops are having great victories in Palestine.
The weather lately, has been very mild, quite pleasant in fact, why this time last year the weather was very severe, plenty of snow & ice.    The outlook certainly, looks promising - it is to be hoped, that this wretched war will soon be over.   I believe that we will be here for 4 weeks & then we go right back away from the Straffing, till after Christmas.  On the 27th November, great war news came to hand, the British Troops, have made a big advance near Cambrai, many thousand German Prisoners were captured, also a great quantity of War material, including 100 guns.
