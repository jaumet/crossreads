In the afternoon each company did a practice and Stewart and others went to a 5th Bde practice at which General Birdwood was present. Watched a battery of 60 pounders in action their long venomous noses kicking up with recoil at each discharge. Read with much amusement Phillip Gibbs' account of the Lagnicourt stunt. From an authorised war correspondent one would look for something a little nearer to the truth. Personally I feel inclined always to accept as reliable the German official. Made preparations for an early morning stunt tomorrow having a reveille at 1.30 am. C.O. very slack and slow about furnishing returns to Brigade H.Q. and takes up a novel stand as amusing as it is possible. In their cemetery here the Huns have erased dates off the wooden crosses so no information can be gleaned from them. Heavy stunt about twilight - roaring of guns
