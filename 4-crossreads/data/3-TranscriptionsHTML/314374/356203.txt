<p>(19)<br/>eventually had to wait for a stretcher.  After arriving at the dressing station we sat down to have a drink of tea and eat some biscuits, which the gunners had given us.  Our eighteen pounder batteries were firing close by and whilst we were watching one fired a shell burst prematurely close to where we were, killing an English officer and wounding several mules.  Nothing is perfect and a lot of our shells used to explode prematurely.</p>
<p>I consider that stretcher bearers generally speaking are the greatest heroes in a battle, they, in my opinion, having the most dangerous and strenuous work to perform and too much praise cannot be given them for the noble and excellent work which they perform.  It was dusk when we arrived back at our trench and we were told to get ready and pack up, as we were to be relieved that night.  But we weren't relieved that night and I think that we ought to have considered ourselves lucky that we weren't.  The Hun that night put down a terrific bombardment on us which lasted all night and very many of our men were killed and wounded.  A shell burst on the top of our trench, blowing it in, and buried my body &ndash; my head was just protruding.  A couple of pals (one since killed) dug me out and freed me.  I escaped without a scratch, with the exception of a severe shaking, but after this my nerves went to pieces.  Sitting under a bombardment plays havoc with one's nerves and a good rest and quietness away from the line is the only cure for this.  At last daylight dawned and we prepared to move out.  Started at 9 a.m. and hurried past a corner of the road, which was continually being shelled and where many casualties occurred.  Each side of the track was strewn with hundreds of dead Tommies &ndash; and equipment &ndash; the latter being discarded by the wounded as they evacuated &ndash; who were killed going in to relieve another company the previous night and which would also had been our fate had we been relieved the previous night as originally intended.  In places the dead were piled several feet high &ndash; so great were the casualties.  Tired, hungry and sleepy (having had no sleep for three days and nights) we struggled along, through the mud, slush, and dead, not resting until we got back a considerable distance and then fairly safe.  Coming out of the line is not the same as going in.  When going in we are in order and kept together, but coming out, its every man for himself to get along the best way he can.  We were now on the never-to-be-forgotten Menin Road which was strewn with thousands of dead soldiers and mules.</p>
<p>After several rests another digger and myself reached the outskirts of Ypres where the Y.M.C.A. gave us hot cocoa, biscuits, chocolates and cigarettes.  Strengthened by this we continued on and eventually reached the ruined asylum, where the rest of the Battalion had already arrived.  We were given a real good hot meal of bully beef stew, which made new men of us.</p>
<p>It was not raining heavily and a seven kilo march was ahead of us.  Our Captain very kindly and thoughtfully gave myself and mate a "lift" on one of the cookers.</p>
<p>Huts (on the outskirts of Popperinghe) were reached at dark, when we were given another hot meal, our packs, and several</p>
