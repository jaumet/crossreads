<p>I have not had any letters from the boys, suppose they are still on the move, so unable to send me word. It has seemed a very long week &ndash; had a bit of a cold &amp; made to stay in bed a day so am alright now. We were not busy then, so the day's rest did me a lot of good. We expect to be busy this evening. Wish they could make the <u>Push</u> &amp; get it all over. The weather has been a little better for 3 days. I have no news (personal) to tell, could write heaps if Censor would permit but one has to be very careful. I wonder if I shall be home this time next year.</p>
