My Dear Mother ? I am out on Furlough, and you will see that I am at Present in London. I will not be here very long though I was going to Mrs Horton but just at the last moment received a telegram saying do not come letter following, I had to leave with the others, before the letter arrived so do not know yet what is wrong. I had my Railway warrant made out for Liverpool and the man who made it out made it via Crewe instead of London, so I dont know yet whether I will be able to get through Euston Stn with it I may be able to get it fixed up at Horseferry Rd, the Aus. HQS, if I cannot I will have to pay my fare part of the way but that will not cost me a great deal. I suppose I want to go down to Newcastle Staff to See all my friends there again before I leave. when I get back to Weymouth I may be sent out to Perham Downs if considered fit Eric Elder is out there, to I may meet him there is just a chance. Weymouth is a quiet place, a nice beach and Promenade we can get a pass out of camp early every evening one
