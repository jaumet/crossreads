<p>This afternoon Sgt. Wilson (Stumpy) &amp; I we always call him, went for a stroll through Durrington &amp; down to Fighledean, Stumpy &amp; I are great pals &amp; we get on well together though our natures are a long way different, especially as regards women, Stumpy loses his heart to every pretty girl he see's, this is generally about 10 times a week, while I am just the opposite, I have seen nothing over here that's startling so I throw cold water on "Stumpy's" fascinators, you wouldn't think that two natures like these would agree but we get on capitally, &amp; every spare hours we have we are roaming the country, poking our nose in every little nook &amp; corner</p>
