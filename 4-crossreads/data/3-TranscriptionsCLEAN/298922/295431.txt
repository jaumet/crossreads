 Enemy shelled Railhead yesterday & again today. Attended Service, but many heads were turned up to the Sky watching the effect of our Anti aircraft guns firing on Plane directly over our heads. 
 Murgha MACK is alright, no cancer. 
 Just posted 2 Field Post Cards as we move out to the big attack tomorrow night - I'm A1 & so are all the men. 
  Love to all from son
