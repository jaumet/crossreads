 1916   TUESDAY 18   JULY 
 A decent warm day at last. M r  Neylan had us for flag drill in morning & we  were working the helio-graph in afternoon. It is interesting work in the open like this. I received a paper (Sunday Times) from Linda and a letter from Alan from Scotland. Had a game of Cricket and some kicks at the football in evening 
   
 Here's to the man who plans things -  
 Builds things - makes things - 
 Who prates not of wonders of old; 
 Nor gloats on ancestral gold, 
 But takes off his coat & takes a hold, 
    And does things.
