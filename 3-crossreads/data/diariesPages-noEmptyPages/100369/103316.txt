about three quarters of a mile away. Here we had to dig in, in view of the loving visits Bro Abdul pays, and the habit he has of dropping affectionate messages from the skies. We are now where the battle of Rafa was fought, a great achievement our boys having to advance across an open plain in full view of the enemy, and exposed to all his fire. Several quiet graves are about here, containg the last remains of brave lads who paid the great price. Simple crosses are raised over each, with the number, name and regiment carved on them, and here the heroes sleep, and in their death pass on a message of courage, faith, and devotion to a cause which might well stir all our hearts. 
Looking on the graves one is reminded of Macaulay's lines
"And how can man die better"
"Than facing fearful odds"
"For the ashes of his fathers"
"And the temples of his Gods"
 Our stay at Rafa has been very short. Barely a week here when once more we pull up our tent pegs, and move away again, this time to Beni Selah, about 3 miles past Khan Yunis.
