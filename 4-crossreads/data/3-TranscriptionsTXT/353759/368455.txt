 day till 10 a.m.  There till 5 then back to first sunken Road carrying from there to wagon behind second ridge towards A.D.S. 
 During that night I guided party of another Amb. to sunken road relay in valley from the R.A.P. (embankment) and acted as driver in between wagon trips.  At midnight a Boche shell got two wagon loads of ammunit. &ndash; and shattered one 40 R.E.s, wounded terribly a lot more.

Carrying there all night and day &ndash; casualties though only half they were and shelling half as bad.  No casualties.  Returned at 10 p.m. the 7th evening, and back to sunken Road.  Then at midnight on to A.D.S., and at 3 a.m. the 8th day on to M.D.S. 
 We had breakfast at 5 a.m. &ndash; and waited. 
 The M.D.S. was shelled the day before and was moving &ndash; and they shelled it again while we were there with damnable H.V. shells. 
 We left there at 11, by the light tram of the Decaulte track and arrived at Bapaume about 2 p.m.  Had lunch, and marched on to Beaulincourt &ndash; joined up the 2nd F. Amb. 
 Slept out that night in the open, and the next day, after an inspection by General Walker &ndash; and congratulations on the "superb way we"d carried ourselves" left for Pozieres. 
 At Pozieres they"d a surprise supper for us, and after it sleep, blessed sleep.
