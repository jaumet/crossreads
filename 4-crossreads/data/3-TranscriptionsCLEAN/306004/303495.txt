  
 22.8.16 Tues 22nd A wet Canteen has been erected by the YMCA & was opened today & good many of the lads are rather merry tonight in consequence; We went over to the Field Amb. again this afternoon for our second innoculation against Cholera, I have been feeling very sick today but am better tonight we had a visitor from the  6th L.H tonight & had rather a gay time here, nearly every tent in the Regt has some Scottish lads in it tonight as our chaps have been rather free & easy today & made pals with the Scots at the Canteen; Mergha Mac went away to hospital a couple of days ago he had been drinking very heavy for some days
