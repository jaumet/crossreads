 The weather has completely changed today and we now have cold and wet conditions. Mud and slush are everywhere. Last night gas projectors were put over to the Hun from this front. Capt Davis returned today from sick leave in England. Yarned for a long while with him. Tonight we only have about 75 men on fatigue jobs and all the rest are off duty. It seems as if we shall have to start them on some job of work or training to keep them occupied. Down below where all are crowded is not healthy. Dined with Braithwaite Gorman &amp; Co. in their quarters and them saw Mackinnon. Talked to groups of men along the corridors and underground passages.
