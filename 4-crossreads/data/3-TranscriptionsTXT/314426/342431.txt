The newspapers express the nation's sympathy with the King &amp; Queen. Tuesday Jan 21. 1919. (72) Dull &amp; cloudy but no rain. I wrote to Lizzie this morning letter 154. This afternoon I had a look through the brick works at Chicherell. I watched the operations from when the clay is shovelled into the crusher where it is ground into coarse powder and elevated to a loft, where it is fed into a machine mixed with water and carried on to another machine which presses it and feeds it into moulds where it is again pressed with a pressure equal to 10 tons.

A 75 H.P. suction gas ingine drives the machinery. The bricks are wheeled to a shed for drying. The kill for burning the bricks is on the Hotman principle
