<p>Malta. 27th Sep.</p>
<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>We arrived at Malta yesterday morning but are not embarking the wounded till 9 this morning. It's very funny to see the old slouch hats coming round in the funny sandola boats. Australians everywhere! Malta is awfully pretty, I wish I had a box of colours here to colour these cards. We are not likely to get ashore here but we have had a good deal of leave when possible (about 3 days in Alexandria) so must not grumble.</p>
<p>I do hope Wilga has got over the measles without any permanent effects on her beauty. Lovingly Dene.</p>
