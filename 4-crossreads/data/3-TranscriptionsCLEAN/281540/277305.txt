10/12/15Very dark at stand to arms 0600 but rather warm than cold.  Just after turning in last night Abdul suddenly sent up red rockets and poured in a very heavy fire.  Went out to office again but within ten minutes conditions were normal.  Otherwise a quiet night.  After breakfast went up firing line to B8 and had a good search round with telescope but owing to smoke hanging round a decent view could not be obtained.  Since my travels a good deal of barbed wire has been put out by us but no other changes are noticeable.
Talking to some of the lads in "A" Coys lines .  Craig glad to get back there once more, - Elmiger to "C" in his place.  At 1430 noticed a sort of minature Zeppelin over the sea and apparently belonging to us.  A sausage shaped gas bag with one end inclined upwards  slightly and on the depressed end another cuplike gas bag.  Depending from the gas bag was a rope and which at intervals were five black objects which gradually reduced until only one was left.  I saw one fall off leaving a train of black smoke behind it.  The whole affair appeared to be captive to one of our cargo steamers lying off Suvla.
Went down communication tunnels and gave some directions about the digging of the regimental office and other headquarters dugouts there.  Inspected the faces there which are now well under the centre of the hill   The space being confined the Engineers are able to work two faces at once by driving a little tunnel in first and then opening up a face further on leaving the remainder of the first to be completed by another party.  Are very close   In some places moisture filtering through the roof of tunnel.  Iron piping put in to take drainage off adjoining sap.
