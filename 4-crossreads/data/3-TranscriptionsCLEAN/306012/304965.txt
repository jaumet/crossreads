little or no tact since taking over the draft tried a little bluff but we stood firm.  An inquiry was opened and the food has improved somewhat.Further irritation has been caused by two wires received from Fremantle.  One stating that we should have to undergo quarantine on arrival & the other saying that a payment of 9 ration allowance on board to all ranks was cancelled.On the morning of the 13th the transport arrived in the roadstead outside Fremantle but on account of the strict quarantine regulations no-one landed.
