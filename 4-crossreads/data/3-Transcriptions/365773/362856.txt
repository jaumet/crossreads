<p>I tell you I feel awfully proud of it. Captain &amp; M.C. in the Regiment I started a private in, I was highly commended for the work my Coy did in our last attack &amp; it is rumoured I am in for another decoration, it will be out in a week or so, if not please forget I wrote this.<br/>In regard to our last fight, the old 2nd covered itself in glory. We captured a fortified village called "Hermies" going about 4000 yds on a wide front. It was a very clean fight &amp; we put it all over Fritz. My coy. on the right flank of the Bn.</p>
