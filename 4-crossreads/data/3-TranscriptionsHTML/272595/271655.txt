<p>Got my snaps &amp; etc from Liverpool this morning, for a wonder the firm sent them along without being paid in advance.<br/>25th.  Have been doing nothing all day so this afternoon Lindsay &amp; I went over to see Len had a few games of bridge &amp; stopped to tea, then we went to the pictures &amp; came home, <strike>bfo</strike> while over there Len &amp; I fixed up a bit of business with the Pay Master.<br/>On arriving home I find a job waiting for Dental Sgt. &amp; a rotten one too took me 2 solid hours to get the names out <strike>las</strike> &amp; it will keep me going most of the day, still it will give me something to do instead of dodging parades &amp; etc &amp; keep me out of mischief for a while</p>
