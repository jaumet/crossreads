<p>Aug, 1916<br/>Brig Royston was the wonder &amp; idol of the whole division he has earned a great rep with the boys, part of it being his ability to knock up horses.  he got hit in the leg but when they wanted to dress it said, "No never mind laddie, get me another horse",  Bill comes in almost every day to see us here.  to night he called bringing me a pair of pants &amp; spurs.  he seems to be having a good time &amp; likes his job &ndash; Im glad he has fallen in to a good possie, he is a real good sport.  Ive had one after noon's leave since coming here 4 hrs I extended it to 5&frac12;  on my own initiative &amp; was told next morning that I was up for it but have heard nothing so far &ndash; That was on Sunday 13th</p>
