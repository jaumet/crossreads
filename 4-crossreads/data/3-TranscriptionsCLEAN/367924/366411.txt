  
 Bombay March 14th 1917 
 Dear Mother Just a line to let you know that we are off the boat and we are Camped in Bombay. But of course we have no Idea how long we will be here or where in the world we are off to. 
 We are all growling about the food here. They offered us dry bread and tea for tea and breakfast and the bread is sour at that. Goodness only knows what they will give us for dinner. We all whent out and bought our tea and breakfast. My word money goes quick in these places. There is some wonderfull buildings here in this place. We only got here about six oclock last night, so of course we have not seen to much yet. 
 I am sending you the leaf and the certificate I was telling you about in the other letter. I forgot to put it in the last one, I only found out I had not sent it this morning. The buildings here are a great hight and well made. We have a good place to sleep in here. 
 No more news for the present. With my very best love to you and Remember me to the Boss. Has Uncle Johnny arrived yet 
 I remain Your ever loving Son
