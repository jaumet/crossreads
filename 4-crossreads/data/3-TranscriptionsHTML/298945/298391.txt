<p>+ + Sunday 18th Aug 1918</p>
<p>No early morning parade. Got up in time to receive a good rousing from Sgt. Stacey for being late. The only point that was telling was the fact that lateness if general may produce an early morning parade, so I must go warily.</p>
<p>Church parade. Text: "I know that my Redeemer liveth". After a short reference to the recent battle, &amp; the fact that once again the Australians had given the world something to admire, &amp; the home folks something to be proud of, he gave a practical proof of the text. One of his most telling points was an every day explanation of the meaning of personality, &amp; how monstrous a thing it would be if each individual personality was finished when the carcase was dead.</p>
