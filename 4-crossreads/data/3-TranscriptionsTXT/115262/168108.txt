 Friday 7 December 1917. 
  Rations came up at dawn &amp; were issued . 
 Nothing doing today until a party of us were detailed to go back to Julis for rations at dark. 
 It rained &amp;&nbsp;we were working in mud up to our knees. A fair nightmare altogether. 
 We were that cold &amp; wet that the Lt. QM. gave us brandy to warm &amp; sort of revive us as we were just about frozen &amp; near collapse. 
 The camels sent to &quot;our relief&quot; brought in the rations. 
 This was the roughest nights&#39; spin I have had yet &amp; ever hope to have. 
 Got back at 3 am.to rest of unit who had moved 1 mile and then gave up trying to move further tonight. Lay down by a fire we built up to warm ourselves --&gt;
