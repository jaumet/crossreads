this direction, with some aeroplanes, we all turned out, & could hear the hum of their machines, and the sound of their bombs over a hill from  our camp but tho' the machines flew over our camp nothing happened. There were a lot of great searchlights from the different hills about, like great white ribbons waving to & fro about the sky, and little flashes here and there, just like the flash of an electric torch, and those were shells of ours, bursting around the Fritz aeroplanes. I believe there were five raids here last week, a lot of our fellows went for the shelters but there was such a cold wind blowing that I went back to bed, of course I would have ducked for cover quickly if they had started to bomb. I don't wonder we are not winning the war, if the mismanagement we have seen so far is continued right through, and from what I hear, it is the same it would make a person cry at times.
