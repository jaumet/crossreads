 Inspected by G.O.C. Horses very poor &amp; eating SAND like in a drought &amp; like the men. They are stale &ndash; (LILIES). Desert "Lilies" are in bloom a very pretty white bloom about 3 in. in diameter. A sweet scented bulb &amp; I may be able to post you some. 
 Am anxiously waiting news re my application for leave &amp; hardly dare expect it will be granted. 
 [The remainder of the page crossed through.] Will go via ITALY &amp; FRANCE if it comes off. 6 weeks I applied for. When the next stunt takes place here, the Turkswould know all about it before hand &ndash; Their flying men come over &amp; congratulate ours on any decoration the very next day. HOW DO THEY KNOW??
