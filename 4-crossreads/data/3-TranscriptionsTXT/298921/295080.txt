April, 1915Saturday 17Mothers letter from [indecipherable] 15/3/15 arrived safely, I am glad to hear my Diary arrived safely I shall be interested to hear the dates you receive it.These fountain pens are not too good after a while so excuse scribble so long as you can read it. There is a Tea Room 'Groppis' on Continental style, Cakes etc all spreadout & each visitor wanders around with a plate & fork & spears what he likes then returns to a table in a Garden & Tea or Coffee is brought, it is a curious cusTom & amusing to see the different types & the seriousness of their choice.
