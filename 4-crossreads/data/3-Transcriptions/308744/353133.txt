<p>On the 9th and 10th troops at SINJIL, BIREH, HUWARAH and LUBBAN, were attacked with bombs and machine gun fire by Pilots:- Lieuts. D.R. Dowling, R.S. Adair, J.M. Walker, C.C. Cameron, G.C.

Jensen.<br/>Good results were reported, several bombs being observed to drop in the midst of large groups of the enemy.</p>
<p>Whilst returning from a raid on the aerodrome at KUTRANI on the 19th, Capt. E.G. Evans M.C., then in command of No. 142 Squadron R.F.C. flying a Martinsyde, was forced to land in enemy territory owing to engine trouble. Capt. R.A. Austin, M.C. (Pilot) and Lieut. O.M. Lee (Observer) who had been escorting the raid in a Bristol Fighter, at once went down to his assistance. In landing one of the wheels of the machine struck a rock and buckled, with the result that they could not get off again before the arrival of hostile Arabs, who made all three officer's prisoners and ultimately 'sold' them to the Turks. Other officers on this raid were Lieuts. F.M. Haig, A.W.  Murphy, and A.J. Morgan and A.V. Tonkin (Pilots) and Lieut. Dawson R.F.C. (Observer)</p>
<p>On the same day, while escorting R.F.C. Machines on a bomb raid near WADI AYJA, Lieut. C.C. Cameron (pilot) and Lieut W.A. Kirk (Observer) attacked an enemy two-seater and an Albatross Scout. The enemy machines succeeded in getting away in the clouds.</p>
<p>The raid on the HEDJAZ RAILWAY was launched on the 21st when our forces advanced from the Valley towards AMMAN. One of the main objectives was to destroy a large viaduct South West of AMMAN. Stubborn opposition was met with and our troops were considerably handicapped by heavy rain, which rendered the tracks almost impassable. Our machines co-operated closely in this operation and despite the unfavourable weather, made numerous attacks on the enemy with bombs and machine gun fire, and reported their movements to our own force. Frequently our pilots flew beneath low-lying clouds, literally skimming the mountain tops, in these attacks. In addition to the raids already referred to, troops at SHUNET NIMRIN were bombed on the 24th., troops and camps at DAMIE, cavalry South West of KUTRANI and rolling stock at KASTAL on the 27th., rolling stock at ZERKA on the 29th. These raids were carried out by Pilots &ndash; Capts, R.M. Smith, MC. S.D. Addison, Lieuts, A.J. Morgan, E.P. Kenny, S.A. Nunan, C.S. Paul, E.C. Stooke, D.C.M. C.C. Peters, and H.L. Fraser. Observers:- Lieuts. E.A. Mustard, J.H. Traill, W.P. Cashman, M.C. H. Fysh and Cpl. N.F.B. Jensen.</p>
<p>On the 26th a report was received that a large body of cavalry had moved out from KERAK, and that their whereabouts was unknown. A reconnaissance of the area was made by Capt. S.W.  Addison (pilot) and Lieut. H. Fysh (Observer) and the enemy was located in three groups of about 250 each, in the hills South West of KUTRANI. A direct hit on the largest of these groups was obtained with a 25-lb. bomb thrown from the cockpit of the machine, and 220 rounds from machine gun were also fired into their midst causing a general stampede.</p>
<p>The same day Lieut. E.S. Headlam and D.R. Dowling, (Pilots), Lieuts. W.A. Kirk and C.J. Vyner (Observers) while on a reconnaissance attacked two enemy two-seaters, and drove them down on to the aerodrome at AMMAN. While reconnoitring KISSIR the same morning Capt. D.N. Rutherford and Lieut. J.M. Walker  (Pilots) and Lieut J. McElligott and C. Finlay (Observers), engaged a hostile two-seater North of KISSIR, and forced it down near the railway. Information was received from the Australian Light Horse later on to the effect that this machine was destroyed by the Germans.</p>
<p>Patrols were carried out from time to time over our troops in the vicinity of ES SALT, to protect them against attack by hostile aircraft.</p>
