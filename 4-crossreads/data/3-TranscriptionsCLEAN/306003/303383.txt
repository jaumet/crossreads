This morning Les heard rifle & machine gun fire on the coast to the north east of camp & as a patrol of one Corporal & 8 men had not returned he reported it to Brigade & received some very sarcastic remarks from Major Chisholm for his pains.  Chisholm told him he had noises in his head but a Sqd of 2nd Regt were sent out to investigate & found it was the infantry at practice 
 6-6-16 Tue 6th This morning Les reported Major Chisholm to Major Granville who said he would take the case to the Brigadier & that Les had done right to report as he did;  Fatigues are very constant here & a man is lucky if he does not get a turn twice a day;  & today trench-digging has started to consolidate the night outpost;  This morning a Taube came in as far as Qatia scouting;  Tonight C Sqd goes on outpost duty at 6 oclock
