  
 After a few days of hell I got quite used to it, every evening we get shelled with shrapnell which is verry dangerous especially out of the trenches & down on the beach where they shell verry often in fact while I am writing this diary there are shells bursting on the beach.  we are down near the beach for a spell so I can see them quite plainly.  this country is verry mountainous especially when we have to carry up the water in cans from the valley.  It is against all rules to have a wash on account of shortage of water, it is nearly a fortnight since I had a wash so I am going down to the beach tomorrow for a swim, this is the only time we can get the swim when we are spelling.

 June 27th Things are verry quiet just now we had it pretty lively last night, they attacked us at Quinns Post but were repulsed.  I have been in supports now about two weeks so things are getting very stale.
