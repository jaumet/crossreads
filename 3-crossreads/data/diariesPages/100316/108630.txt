25/4/18 Lavieville
Slept well and almost unbrokenly, except for breakfast etc, until about noon. The General then called in for a talk and says that still identifications are wanted so after lunch I went up and endeavoured to organize a party to catch one. Offered 100 francs blood money dead or alive. The day was fine and quiet. Walked along Pioneer Trench and had a yarn with Kennedy and King. Back and saw Colonel James ? a shrewd nut. While there BM. Bridges came and we argued. Then Harris of the Engineers was round. I put up a request for better cooperation between the Brigade Staff and the Engineers but the General was unsympathetic and did not agree. Our 6th flying pig fired a few rounds today under cover of a light artillery barrage. Matthews and others came up when the rations arrived and I took the former up the line and round the posts with me. A sniper has been annoying "le vieux Major" very much and wounded Sammy Dyest and nearly got Harricks. This devil has now killed and wounded a number of our chaps. Our snipers are still superior and captured Huns tell of losses sustained in their platoons. It was a pleasant walk round the front line posts. We called at all the company headquarters on the way. All our efforts to catch a Hun proved unavailing. He moves abroad very little. Returned to Barracks and there found orders for relief tomorrow night. Also a particulars of a minor operation of artillery on our left but this turned out to be a very small affair and not at all worth bothering about.
