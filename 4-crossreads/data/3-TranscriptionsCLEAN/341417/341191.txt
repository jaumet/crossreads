Ludgershall:] First morning on Parade "Snow falling fast" Dental Parade Sapper Vasco No. 16136. 48 hours off duty (thank GAWD!) extractions. Luckier by far than six fellow sappers who get the order "From here to the left right turn QUICK March" through soft snowy fairyland to a cemetery armed with miniature seaside spades and great picks never dreaming for one moment they were to bury three heroes on the spot - A bit sudden this icy douche on the Perham Downs Salisbury Plains after our tropical Turkish bath at Sierra Leone. There is frozen ink 1/2" thick in the bottle right here.
