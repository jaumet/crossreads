About 8.15 things were quiet once more and a glance outside showed the whole place wreathed in smoke and fumes and an almost perfect quiet save for the hurtling sound of heavies wobbling over high up in the air and the rattle of an occasional machine gun. Today the Hun has had stretcher parties out collecting wounded working under the red flag. In one place he had an open cart and did not seem to be using much ceremony in the manner he was putting people into it - possibly gathering in his dead. Young [blotted out] the runner is a little dark boy of about 18 very quiet and clean always. His brother was killed at Bullecourt. Despite his quiet looks he is one our dags and can use filthier language than many others. Cold blooded, callous to agony and dirty sights, this child of 18 (a veteran in service) is one of the peculiar products of the War & its work.
