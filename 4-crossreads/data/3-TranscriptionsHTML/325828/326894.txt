<p>able to wish it to you personally next year.  At least I hope so.<br/>To-day has been a brutal day.  About 9 AM. a strong wind from the South East sprang up &amp; by 10 o'clock it was impossible to see more than 6 or 8 yards in any direction for the flying sand &amp; grit.  We nearly had the eyes cut out of our heads &amp; everyone was groping about with eyes, nose, throat &amp; ears choked with sand. At dinner the sand got into all the tucker &amp; every chew we gulped down a bit of sand -Sand- I'm sick of the sight of it; it seems to get everywhere.  Tea was a repitition of dinner only it was blowing harder than ever.  It is very boisterous outside now, &amp; our "possy" is shaking &amp; rattling in the wind.<br/>We are very short of water here.  We are only allowed our bottle full (2 pints) once a day, &amp; out of this we have to shave, wash &amp; wash our gear up.  Needless to say we don't have much to spare at the end of the day.<br/>If you could get hold of a map of <u>any sort</u> showing the different war zones &amp; send it out, I would be very glad of it please Father dear.</p>
