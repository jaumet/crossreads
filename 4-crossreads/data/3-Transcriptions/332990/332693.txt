<p>After parade and roll call this morning we were drafted  in batches of 5 to each shoeing forge. The all the Australians were called in to the lecture room and given a lecture by the Vet. on the anatomy of the horses foot. There were diagrams on the wall and also all the bones of a horses foot, also the hoofs and tendons . After that we went back to the shoeing forge. In each forge there are 3 fires and 3 instructors with 5 pupils each. We did not do much work before dinner. At 2 pm, we paraded for roll call and went back to the forges and shod 3 mules on the front foot only. We were dismissed at 4.30. I had a very easy day. There are 22 Australians in the school. All the others are English.</p>
