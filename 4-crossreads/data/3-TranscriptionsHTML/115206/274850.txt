<p>October 1918.<br/>Monday 7</p>
<p>In rear of Ramicourt, Bty Pos.<br/>Weather decidedly unsettled these days and there are<br/>rumors of a further stunt in the morning.<br/>Fritz very busy shelling the above villages and barraging a great deal of stuff in the valley.<br/>Warned for hop over in the morning, with the Yanks. Have to carry 24 hours rations. Had an excellent feed in the village or rather what came from the village.<br/>Got a good clean change too. Have left all my gear with Tom. Good luck to stunt in the morning.</p>
