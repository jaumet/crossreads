<p>S S WANDILLA<br/>No padre with us so no service,  lovely weather &amp; nothing doing much.  We are camped for some time here we hope &amp; have built a Tucker room or Bough Shed out of maize stalks which grow very rank on the irrigated Nile flats when stiffened with MUD it makes a good cool feeding place.<br/>Flies getting bad again with the warm weather coming on.<br/>You see I am not worrying much about the war, it is each mans daily bread &amp; life he thinks of- we are all really very narrow minded &amp; self satisfied</p>
