  
 Wednesday 24 January 1917 [1918] Sister Peile's day off so I on the ward myself & then 1/2 day.  Went 14 A.G.H., met Dick & went Barrage & had happy afternoon, then dinner St. James Restaurant (very good) full of soldiers & maybe Sisters are not supposed to be there but all best hotels are "out of bounds" for troopers. Dick's colors  black &  red & blue [see image for drawing of colour patch] for 2nd light horse.
