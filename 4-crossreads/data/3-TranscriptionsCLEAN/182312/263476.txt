of miles of these duckboard tracks in France; in fact  in Winter
they are absolutely necessary where men have to travel off the
main hard roads.
      Let us ffollow a Battalion into the tranches.  An
officer and a couple of N.C.O's from each Company have gone up to
the line the night before to obtain full particulars as to how xx
it is held and the disposition of the troops in the various posts.
They return and are able to divide their Companies up accordingly
so that on arrival at the trenches each party can move to its
appointed place without confusion.  A heavy frost is on and the
road is slippery so the men wrap a sandbag round each boot to help
them keep their feet.  Steel helmets are chalked white so as not
show up against the snow.  Rations and water being served all
round we push off.  For a mile or so we follow the road and then
branch off on to a duck board track and here our troubles commence.
The duckboards are frozen and are very slippery.  I used to think
that walking with carpet slippers on polished lino was a risky
matter, but frozen duckboards beat all.  It is moonlight and the
duckboardx track shows up well across the snow as it winds about
dodging shell holes.  Falls are frequent and the language is vile.
Once a man falls it requires a considerable struggle for him to get
to his feet again so great is the load on his back.  After three or
four hours of walking and slipping we arrive at our area and each
party moves off to relieve the post to which it is allotted.  Half
an hour goes by and then the report comes through "relief complete"
and we are left in possession of that section of the line whilst
the relieved Battalion winds its weary way back to the Camp from
which we came.  Fortunately a few clouds had come over to obscure
the moon and the relief was accomplished with trifling casualities.
