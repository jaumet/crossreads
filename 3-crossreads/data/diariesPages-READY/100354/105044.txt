village station of Candas in the Dept. of Somme. Marching about eight miles we reached the reserve billets at Domart-en-Ponthieu a little village nestling in a most beautiful little valley. Small copses of larch, beech spruce in full leaf were scattered over the gently sloping hillsides down which the road with its avenue of line trees twined. Fields of wheat oats interspersed with blaze's of poppies rose in terraces from the clear brook which ran through the valley.
Domart-en-Ponthieu is a rather ancient village with a queer church commanding a view of the valley perched on the hill-side. This edifice is some 900 years old, of an architecture quite unique though it probably is of the Roman type.
Leaving Domart at 9 oclock12th July we marched some 7 miles southward
