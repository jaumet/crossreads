<p>Sed Miles, Sed Pro Patria</p>
<p>S.M. Herald, 5 July</p>
<p>Captain Arthur Gardere Ferguson.<br/>Killed in action June, 1916.</p>
<p>God's gift to youth, fair happiness,<br/>And Fortune's gift, a life of ease,<br/>He flung aside for battle stress,<br/>For toil, for peril overseas.<br/>Hearing above the drums the Voice<br/>That leaves the valiant heart no choice.</p>
<p>Oh, not of laurel wreaths at all<br/>That clarion Voice spoke, high and clear,<br/>Not even the patriot's stirring call<br/>To arms rang loudest in his ear,<br/>But just that one plain call to man<br/>That has been since the world began.</p>
<p>The call to man to be a man,<br/>To play the part a man should play;<br/>Nor heed the risk, nor pause to plan,<br/>Nor seek for less austere a way.<br/>But just with soul and muscle knit<br/>To do the work that's definite.</p>
<p>The bloody mystery of war<br/>He served, God's faithful artisan,<br/>And slept, his day of service o'er &ndash;<br/>(Salute!) a gallant gentleman.<br/>And marvels that those living yet<br/>Mourn with such passion of regret.</p>
