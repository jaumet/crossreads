<p>Before I resume the Diary or Amateur description of my voyaging here on page 64, I must record that on my arrival I collected from H.Q. a letter from you dated Feb. 2nd (second) with reference to Rome, and I am disturbed that only one letter should be lying here.  Possibly a letter or two has gone astray.  There is another Lambert also a Capt. in A.I.F. and as I was handed one of his letters today He may have been handed one of mine.</p>
