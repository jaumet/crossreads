P.S.  Oh Father I tried my hand at printing photos, for the first time on Saturday morning & was doing them stylishly in salt solution first to give that blue tone & then directly I put them in the hypo they all went crackly & spoiled & they would have been such good prints- too.  I was using glossy seltona paper & Wal said it was because I had used the solutions just after mixing & they were different temperatures.  I was going to send you twelve too, doing things on a decent scale to start with don't you know!Again love.     OSO.
