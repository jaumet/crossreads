<p>spent at Anzac.</p>
<p>The loud report of the gun firing, the whizz-z-z of the shell through the air, the sound of the explosion a minute or so afterwards was all that was apparent to me. But, should I let my imagination rove, I can see bricks flying up in the air, hear the groans of the wounded and dying, then the news reaching those whom they hold dear and the heart breaking scenes which would be the consequence.<br/>Such is War, where the glory of such a thing as war comes in I fail to see it. It is tragedy and a disgrace to civilization.</p>
<p>At this point we were not very far from the trenches but my curiosity in this respect has been satisfied long ago. I have seen sufficient results of war to satisfy me for a life-time.</p>
<p>While seated at the cross roads, who should come along but Major Brooke Moore, one of the officers. He was on the hunt for some excitement. After having a look round he offered us a ride back to the C.C.S. in a Motor Amb, a thing we gladly accepted.</p>
<p>July 29th. Saturday</p>
<p>Weather beautiful, something like summer weather.</p>
<p>Went for a walk across country. Passing through fields of beans, peas, oats, potatoes, etc. This struck me as a good business point of these peasant who do not believe in putting all their eggs into one basket.<br/> </p>
