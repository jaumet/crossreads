<p>Sunday, 7 January 1917</p>
<p>Fine &amp; warm again. Mule watching an enemy plane flying over &ndash; a big mob of PELICANS came along in their usual PHALANX formation &amp; as one wag <strike>says</strike> said "the Orderly Sergeant behind to see they keep their "dressing &amp; don't fall out". Very few game birds here except a few ducks &amp; plover.</p>
<p>[This sentence crossed through.]  Parcel from Selfridges sent by Lance - I have been very lucky of late in receiving letters &amp; parcels.</p>
<p>Brigadier inspected lines always know Sunday by his visits.</p>
<p>Church Parade &ndash; Padres could tell us a lot of interesting stuff about this Country if they knew. Am sorry to see by Papers "Carbinder" is dead &ndash; I rode GUNSHOT at Romani a good horse.</p>
