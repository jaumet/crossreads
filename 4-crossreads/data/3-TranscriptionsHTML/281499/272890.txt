<p>this morning followed him right to the ground it was not a bad fight &amp; the old German deserved his win.<br/>Early this morning Dave Murray &amp; I went fossicking about round towards the old wrecked "Tanks" from there we went over to "Guedecourt," &amp; I think I saw the most dead men both British &amp; German that I have seen in France the ground is just littered with dead men &amp; horses, arms legs, heads &amp; etc lying all over the place, the worst place is just on the edge of the village they must have had some machine guns hidden there &amp; they caught the men as they rushed out of the trench &amp; over the road, however the place is a shambles &amp; stinks something awful, so we beat a hasty retreat which was just as well for us for a few minutes after we had got away from it they started to shell it heavily with 5.9s We have given them a terrific bombardment</p>
