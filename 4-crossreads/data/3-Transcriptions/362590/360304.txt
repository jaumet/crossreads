<p>2.<br/>We are now in the sandy desert about 8 miles from the Canal &amp; about 12 from Ismalia. Mt Battn is the Brigade Reserve at present, 17th 18th &amp; 19th forming a line in front about 2 miles from us &amp; Gen Holmes has been good enough to name one of the Positions Kurrajong Heights, knowing that I was associated with that part of the country at home, a compliment which I very much appreciate.</p>
<p>We got 150 of our reinforcements at Tel el Kebn but are still below our war strength considerably. I am glad to say the health of the Battn a very good turn[?], but we have not yet any of sick officers back yet with the exception of yr son &amp; Major Jenkins, would have heard of our great loss in Majors Jenkins, Utter &amp; Harcus, one shell caught the three of them on their way to inspect the lines at Russel  Tops which they were to take over the next day from the 7th Brigade.</p>
<p>This was the greatest shock I have yet had &amp; the loss to the Battn is almost irreparable, in Utter I had a giant, he was brave to the utmost, Loyal to the core &amp; I never saw an officer work harder. I have recommended him, from the 20th, for the decoration of "Legion of Honour".</p>
<p>I sent you a cable re our comforts arriving, the men had the time of their lives, &amp; are really most grateful to the Com'e [Committee] for the great amt of work they must have put into the business.</p>
<p>I note you say yr other son is in camp &amp; that you wd like him to join the 20th. If he is near us at any time a transfer can easily be arranged &amp; I will tell yr son at this line to look out for him.</p>
<p>The weather here is very cold &amp; we have heavy showers blowing over, not at all what we expected in the desert, but I expect the scene will soon change.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear a good report on my wife's work, in connection with the Com'e, in her letters she seems to be most interested in what she is doing &amp; I am very glad for her own sake as it keeps her mind occupied instead of sitting down &amp; thinking.</p>
<p>I think I have exhausted my stock of news. You will please give my thanks</p>
