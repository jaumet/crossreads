<p>We are right in a beautiful green wood, every thing is as much out of sight as possible about here, under trees, etc, so as to be out of sight of Fritz aeroplanes, there has not been an hour today that there has not been one or more overhead, observing I suppose. As we came along today the guns were firing at three Fritzs overhead, and a piece of our own shells fell on one of our men, penetrating &amp; breaking his wrist, &amp; he is now for "Blighty" lucky beggar. I have often before told you of how beautiful the fields are with flowers, but the last few days in France has capped the lot. You know those red poppies that I always liked? Well you know how lovely a small patch of them is? They try to imagine acres of them so thick that they hide the green, &amp; that is what I see every day. Also in places, lots of blue corn flowers but the poppies are the most brilliant</p>
