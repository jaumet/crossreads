<p>looks as if we have come a gutser   After tea Lindsay &amp; I went round to see Jack Gribble as we promised, they were having dinner &amp; were nearly all more or less drunk, all the officers present were under arrest for something or other, Jack was celebrating his getting out of his Court Martial so lightly &amp; he was as happy as could be.  Jack persuaded me to have a glass of whisky to drink his health with, so I did   it was the first whisky I had ever tasted in my life &amp; it will be the last I hope, we stopped about an hour with them, &amp; then went down for a walk to Green Hills Y M. C. A. which is a very fine one, it was originally a private residence but the Y.M.C.A rent it off them for &pound;9 a week I believe, there is also a fine little gymnasium attached to the place</p>
