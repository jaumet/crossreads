<p>dried clay.  Our Cairo party includes the guide W. Dixon of  E. Maitland like the Nids &amp; myself.  The country looks lonely on the way down we had a dusty ride of it.  Zagazig is the nearest town to Tel-el-Kebir on the way I noticed the pumping water on the Archimedean Screw principle a man or boy serving as the motive power.  we passed the town of Benha, the streets of all these towns including some parts of Cairo are frightfully narrow &amp; the houses look like little ruins on account of the walls being higher than the roofs.  The married women wear a thing like a few brass bobbins between their eyes &amp; reaching down to their nose tips.  On reaching Cairo we first went to the Wassa on Donkeys.  My Donkey gave me a bad time some of the streets were only about 7 feet wide &amp; the Donkey would not go slow he galloped all the way untill I explained to the boy that I couldn't ride, the streets were packed with<br/>people</p>
