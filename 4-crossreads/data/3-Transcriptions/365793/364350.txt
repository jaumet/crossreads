<p>Spt 5  several games of deck quoits. Plenty of birds still following us. Fairly heavy rain this morning &amp; last night The Sisters are playing the boys cricket, &amp; judging by the laughter it's a dead funny game. <u>One</u> Sister holds the bat in the appropriate style, &amp; puts in some pretty work too, but most of them get well away from the bat, &amp; make wild hits at the atmosphere.<br/>Only 295 yesty; think the skipper must be economising in coal. Now &amp; again an extra large wave heaves the propeller out</p>
