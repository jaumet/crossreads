  
 fixed Prices of items & a list was issued & orders received from the different units. I opened a few cases to check etc 
 Thursday 9th Dec I apportioned the items overordered by the different Units & in the afternoon issued the Headquarters stores. There was a good deal of shelling to-day. 
 Friday 10th December I had to serve the 7th & 9th Batteries to-day & it kept me very busy indeed. There was a terrific Bombardment to-day by the Warships. It was good to hear the guns booming out once again. How they echoed & re-echoed across the Peninsula when their broadsides went forth.
