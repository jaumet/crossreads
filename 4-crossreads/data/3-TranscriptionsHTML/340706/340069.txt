<p>arrived at Chepy Valines &amp; there we found a seat which was jolted to pieces in first few minutes. Thereafter I decided to walk &amp; the private on front gave me his seat &amp; we sat straddled across seat &amp; in this way reached Gamaches having travelled about 7 KM to much in a 9 KM journey because driver was 34th &amp; only knew the way via Chepy.</p>
<p>On arrival I found the finest state of disorganisation that it was possible to conceive &amp; I have been in the military some years now. No one was in charge. No one knew anything. There was not even a billet &amp; no one seemed to care. The RC padre Major [Ploemel] the last of the family of that name in Brittany escorted me round many places but all in vain &amp; in despair I put up at the Hotel St Pierre (4 fr) for the night Little did I think when I dined here last that I should ever see it again much less dine in it</p>
<p>13-4-19 (Sun)<br/>I rose 8.30 pm &amp; proceeded to mess. All that now remain is McKenzie De Vere Sheehan, Padree Major Wheeler &amp; Prentice &amp; subsequently Collier. These will probably all be on the last <strike>draw</strike> draft for home &amp; will probably leave here about 5th May.</p>
<p>I am rather anxious over my Paris course &amp; have written 2 letters to London</p>
