  
 3.  Padre that we must have Music so He told me to buy some.  Of course I'll buy some good stuff while I have not to pay for it.  After 5 o/ clock Tea we sat by the fire yarning & looking over photos etc until about 8 pm & then I went over with Mr Fremantle to the Cathedral.  We went all around the Place to see if the Doors were all locked.  I saw the Statue & Tomb of a crusader, a former Earl of Salisbury, who was killed at the Siege of Jerusalem 700 years previously.  All the flags were flying yesterday in honour of the capture of Jerusalem. Of course Tuesday is always Market Day & in the market square you can buy anything from lingerie to fat pigs.  I rode home alone.  It is a long way then but I know every inch of the road & it only takes about an Hour & by train it takes from 1 1/2 hrs to 2 1/2 hrs so I don't lose any time by it.  I saw a strange light at the 4 mile peg.  I thought it was a chap with a puncture.  No, it was a Bobby looking out for lamps not lit.  But mine were alight & even so He could not have caught me.  There is only one chap on the road that can beat me & He does the journey 4 times a week & has a racing machine. Ellis has gone to Sarum to-day, so I am all alone.  I've several letters to write but I shan't do them all to-night.  I had the nerve killed & taken out of a Tooth to-day & it has been filled also so my jaw is a bit tired like. Well, Mum, I want to write to Marie
