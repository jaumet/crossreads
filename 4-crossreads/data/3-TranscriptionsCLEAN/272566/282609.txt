 Since Monday nothing of any note has occurred other than a couple of route marches, one being over a distance of about 12 miles.  Cricket matches are still on the afternoon program - my best score to date is 29 not out. The weather continues warm. 2 trips to Buire today on the "Triumph" Motor Bike a total distance of about 120 Kilos or 75 miles.  Met Harry Reynolds & Ron Wolff. Tomorrow we move to Senlis back near Warloy about 3 miles to the West of Albert. New "Douglas" Motor Cycle has arrived to replace the broken one.
