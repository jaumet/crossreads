<p>the Harbor in Lemnos Island.   The harbor has a wide entrance to the ocean but hidden inside is a fine sheltered harbor where were lying at anchor several Battleships ships &ndash; Cruisers &amp; Sub-marines beside supply ships.   All around the harbor is gently rising country being mostly cultivated while there are a number of quaint villages, while a striking feature are a great number of wind mills &ndash; apparently used as a primitive method of grinding the grain.   The place gives one the impression <strike>that</strike> of having been inhabited for many centuries as no doubt it has &ndash; the people no doubt living a very simple &amp; primitive life.   Taken in all it is a pretty place &amp; interesting &ndash; but one thing that strikes the eye is the entire absence of trees.  As we steamed in a number of recently large guns were to be seen on the foreshores.</p>
