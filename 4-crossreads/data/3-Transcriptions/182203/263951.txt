<p>Had a good dinner, then went on deck. We were taken to the hospital  &amp; it is wonderfully fitted up for a    <strike>hos</strike> ship hospital. The matron is a charming woman. &amp;  we all love her &amp; wish she were to be always with us.<br/>The other nurses uniforms are not nearly so well made as ours, &amp; the indoor dresses are not all one color, some are grey, much lighter than ours, &amp; some are almost blue. Matron is very annoyed about it. They are a very noisy crowd from Sydney but the New Zealand ones are very nice &amp; we all think will get on very well.<br/>Slept soundly all night, up at 7.15. a.m.  Breakfast at 8.30.p.m.  &amp;  am up on deck now. Will add more later on. Am feeling splendid enjoying every meal, it is very calm. Sister Newton is very well today  &amp;  gave us a great treat with singing    &amp;  playing this afternoon. Cannot say where we are but send letters to Sister Thistlethwaite   1st Aust. Gen. Hosp.   Egypt. <br/>Hope you are all well  &amp; happy. I am feeling splendid  &amp; sleeping soundly. Fondest love  &amp;  kisses. From your loving daughter.<br/>Edith</p>
