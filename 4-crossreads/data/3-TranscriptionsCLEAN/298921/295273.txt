  
 October, 1915  Friday 29th October  Along the road to Suvla, we can watch men walking  - the Turk Snipers are very active, & it is one of our amusements to see how close the bullets go & if the men get through - run, duck, walk & [indecipherable] Day & night firing goes on & bombing, but my nerves are as good as ever. Started wearing Sheep Skin [indecipherable] coat I like the smell of the Jumbucks. Fortunately my mate Lieut Harris who was in same Region Africa does not take  sugar  Our  water  ration is 3/4 Gallon per Die
