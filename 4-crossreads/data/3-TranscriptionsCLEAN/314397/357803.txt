  
 dump. Gee the roads were muddy. Got bogged on a number of occasions. When passing Villers saw a lot of tanks going up, also a lot of guns. Did the job & came home along the main road missing all the mud. Passed right thro Villers. It is knocked about badly. Not a house left without several shell holes in it. Got a ride coming home & landed back in camp at 4.30am. Shelling was fair, but none came near us. 
 Wednesday 7.8.18 Slept till 1pm. Had brekker in bed. Read out an order from General Monash to the men about the stunt. The stunt comes off tomorrow. Have to leave some of our kit here so that we travel as lightly as possible. Packed it all up in a waterproof sheet. Went to bed early so that I could get a bit of sleep. 
 Thursday 8.8.18 Chris [indecipherable]'s birthday. Some celebration too it is going to be. Got up at 3am. Moved out at 4.20am when our barrage started. Moved to some dug outs near Villers Brett.
