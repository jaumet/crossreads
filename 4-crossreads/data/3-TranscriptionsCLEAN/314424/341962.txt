 I built a cook house by digging a hole into the bank two posts in front, a few sticks for rafters & a tarpolian for a roof. I will sleep in it tonight pending making a dugout. Last night Cliff Thomson & I slept between two bales of [Indecipherable] hay & some sheets of iron on top. 
 It is very cloudy this afternoon & warm. There are numerous planes about including some of the enemies. 
 Major Storey has been reappointed Second in Command and reinstated.
