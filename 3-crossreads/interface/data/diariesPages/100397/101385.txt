This morning we got Porridge stew and Bread margarine for Brek at Dinner, Roast Mutton, Potatoes Cabbage Most of the men are pretty right again but some of them are feeling very downhearted yet I am feeling allright and pretty hungry. so far I have not felt ill and at present the sea is comparatively smooth, we are now somewhere off the Victorian coast and expect to pass Melbourne early tomorrow morning. I dont think we call at Melbourne I had a good sleep last night the first for some time, the last 3 or 4 nights in camp I was never in bed much before 1 am. we have a mixed crowd aboard. Artillery, Engers Remounts. A. C. A.M.C. and about 1400 alltogether, I suppose we will call at freemantle but dont know how long we will stay there. Thursday night things were only middling in camp when I got to camp
