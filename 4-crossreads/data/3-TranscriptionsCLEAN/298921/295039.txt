March, 1915Sunday 7Church parade, very sleepy - Went Zoo in afternoon. Have been warned to take thick clothing when we leave here in 10 days, but no one yet knows where we go, they manage these things well at Head Quarters, not even the wives know.Tried to be interested in Giraffes, etc etc, but got back to Camp early and had a glorious sleep. War Office advises I can wear both ribbons, I have been trying for this for some time, as the bars were issued years ago.
