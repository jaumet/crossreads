<p>Fine but cold. Out with the signalling class all day, but dont think we will learn much there. Poss, Warren, Self, Jack Hunter &amp; Blue Slade went to the pictures at night, but they were&nbsp;more rotten than usual, which is saying a lot. Saw an airman looping the loop over the camp before dinner.</p>
