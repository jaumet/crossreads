<p>I hope you can read my letters.</p>
<p>Fancy your having more rain, things must be good at Tog.  Arthur said Telleraga was better too, so I'm hoping it will be a profitable season for the Boss.  Fancy David Petre being back, was he wounded or sick.  Of course I giggled over the Carrathool sale, I'd like to have been there.</p>
<p>Fancy the river being so huge for so long.  Just my luck but I suppose if I'd been at home I'd have groused like one thing.</p>
<p>Are Peter &amp; Miss Hilda married yet.  I haven't had any news of Mrs. McLean lately, I hope she is getting on all right.</p>
<p>I'm pretty disappointed these days, I was hoping to go on leave to England this month but they've cut it down so I can't, not for two or three months.  So now it can wait till May I think when the weather is decent &amp; things generally are a bit more settled.</p>
<p>I saw Jock Ellis's photo in the Pastoral Review but it wasn't at all a good one.</p>
<p>Well I must do a flit, do forgive me if my letters are short &amp; scrappy &amp; uninteresting but really there is so little to write about these days, nothing exciting at all.  I shall have a look at Driver Rowe of the unit you mention as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The snow has all gone, all mud &amp; muck now &amp; a cold raw wind.  I have a big round today so must flee.  Love to Mac, Grahame &amp; the Boss &amp; my very best to you, my fairy-godmother, ma marraine.  Hope you are well &amp; happy.  Don't fret too much over things, I have some quite startling theories to expound to you when I get back.</p>
