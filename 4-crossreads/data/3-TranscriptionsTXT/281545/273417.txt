 my return from St Jean, they coming home after Tea by a special, I duly arrived back at 3 Pm &amp; at 4 Pm was relieved &amp; signed off &amp; spent the Evening in my Hut playing cards &amp; debating on various topics.   I would like also to mention that on Sunday Jan 27th a Team of Footballers from the 11th Battalion A.I.Forces paid the Camp a visit, about 36 players &amp; supporters came over in a Motor Wagon at Dinner Time &amp; afterwards a special Train took all hands about a mile away to a good ground, this was the first time our Team had played the Australian Game &amp; the 11th Batt. Team were a splendid lot &amp; gave our boys a good game beating them by 9 goals to 6.   Several of the boys who came over where of the Original 11th Batt which landed at Gallipoli, I met several of my old friends from my Town in W.A.   They all looked well but had altered a lot;  our corp gave them a good spread after Tea &amp; they left in the Motor for their Camp at 9 Pm giving us 3 cheers as they left.   I left with several of our Regersberg Boys shortly afterwards for our Camp after enjoying a good day.    I will close now &amp; will continue my Diary at Boore relating my Experiences on the Main lines from time to time.
