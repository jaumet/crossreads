 APRIL 1917 
 1 SUNDAY 
 Fine till evening &amp; then it 
 rained heavily for a bit &amp; then 
 cleared off again. Cleaning 
 harness ect all day, &amp; got all 
 mine up to the knocker, for 
 inspection at 4 pm, but the 
 inspection did not come off 
 We could see Old Fritz&#39;s 
 shrapnell bursting over 
 Armenti&egrave;res way all day. 
 They started to shell our 
 battery out, they knocked the 
 houses that the right &amp; centre 
 section were in down, but 
 did no other damage
