  
 Gallipoli Peninsular July 8 1915 
 All the boys send their love & good wishes 
 Dear Weir By last post I received your parcel of writing paper & envelopes & immediately distributed them amongst the different squadrons they were quickly swallowed up. Everybody was on beam - ends for such material & it was most welcome. We have sent a couple of lads over to Lemnos for a few days to try & get some further supplies & a few luxuries such as jam & pickles as well. We have been doing purely garrison work ever since we landed not having made any attempt at our part of the line to advance at all. Of course we are only a very short way from the Turkish trenches & to do any good would mean a general advance This seems to be hung up waiting on the southern forces but their progress is exceedingly slow & very heavy losses have been inflicted on both sides. Our men are keeping only fairly well a good deal of dysentery etc due a good deal to the inactivity. When out of the firing line they get a chance of a swim
