 FEBRUARY 1917 
 22 THURSDAY 
 Fine but dull & misty. Our section 
 [team?] was called out at 2 AM to 
 take our guns down to a sniping 
 position & I was one of those 
 that had to go. We went down 
 to the same position as last time. 
 Our harness got in a hell of a 
 mess in the mud & the horses 
 also, & I was all day cleaning 
 mine, but got most of it clean.
