Friday 4th August2nd Anniversary of the war & still going strong. My poor old mother must be worn out waiting for it to end.  The 3rd year should see the end however.  Altho' personally I cannot see the end.  It will be a glad day for all when it does come.  Spent the day lounging about it being rather cool & I could not settle down to anything.  Our existence once more becoming monotonous & as I am not working in the Hospital I seem to be out of things rather.  We pass sick through mostly getting a few wounded occasionally.
Saturday 5th AugustOrderly Sergeant.  Very little doing.  Had a visit from a friend in "Estairs" who rode out on horseback & stayed to tea.  After tea went for a stroll & in looking for a battalion found myself well up amongst it.  By chance we came on a battery firing alongside a house, the guns being screened with branches etc.  'Tis remarkable how the residents carry on their duties seemingly oblivious to danger.  Familiarity breeds contempt
