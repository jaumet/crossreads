  
 8 over at the Coy. 
 15/5/16 Nothing startling happened to-day, only hot wind & dust it was terrible. Was inoculated this afternoon & my arm is beginning to get stiff & sore. No mails at all to-day expect some to-morrow. 
 Everything points to a speedy departure, our Egyptian money is to be changed into English. On everyone's lip is the question "When are we going?" 
 17/5/16 9-15 am. I was on the point of writing up yesterday's doings last night when an urgent despatch was required to be taken over to Divisional Hd Qrs. & I was the only one available.
