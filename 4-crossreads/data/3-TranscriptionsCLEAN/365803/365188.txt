  
 Present, and the Captain Ferguson's people will have no difficulty in finding his grave. 
 I am glad to know you are getting on well in the R.F.C. I expect you are one of the fellows who sometimes wake me out of my best sleep in Pinner these early summer mornings. 
 Best wishes, Yours faithfully, 
 E.A. Box 
 P.S.  Perhaps Ferguson's people would care to know somethings about his grave. I may be over there during the month & I shall try &  find it tho' it is a pretty hot Corner . There is a village quite near the Bois in which I have sheltered on occasion; and where the peasants are keeping the graves quite tidy: the last place in the world one would expect to see War is Sailly - the crops are growing &  birds singing right up to the front.
