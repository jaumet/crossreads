  
 You'll notice the officers daily Their bottles with water fill They never drink beer or spirits boys So follow you leaders will 
 If you come far away to fight Then kill in a kinder way Dazzle  the  your foes with your polish Boys Blinded they'll lose the day 
 Each fortnight when you get your pay Buy polish & cleaning gear Perhaps & cake & or ginger beer Boys  But  dont for Gods sake buy beer
