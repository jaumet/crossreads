Friday 31 [30] August 1917 [1918]Met Mr. Wanden 4.30 p.m. & tea Groppi's.  As usual Groppi's is full, mostly Australians & the "kangaroo feathers" wave as gaily there as maybe on the battle field.  One certainly finds out the best in each one of us over here & we meet in such a friendly spirit.  Walk round Cairo a little & then photos at Nubry's [?] & so back per Mauchette [?] tram & on duty once more.Stories one hears -Hundreds of our boys up the line, 2 up in 'plane which catches fire, when 1500 ft. up, one boy jumps - seen shot to pieces - other burnt to death before their eyes & all unable to help, the hardest sight of all these men say.
