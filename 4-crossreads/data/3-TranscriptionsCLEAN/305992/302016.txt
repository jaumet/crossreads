  
 Taranto Italy June 25 Noon. Left inner harbor & dropped [anchor] at the outer harbor awaiting orders for departure. All transports at anchor with 8 Jap. distroyers. 
 26 Two Italian dreadnoughts out at outer harbor at 14 inch gun practice also Italian distroyers & submarines. Their shooting fairly good at 3 mile range. 1 pm Hove up anchor & proceeded out of harbor escorted by 8 Jap destroyers & 3 Italian small torpedoe boats which piloted us out 2 miles from the entrance with some trawlers. Near the barrage mine field the Italian had a large & powerful portable crane & on passing at the entrance we saw within 50 feet a fair size submarine hove up & slung by wires. The N.5. Conning tower above water & decks awash fore & aft with a 4 inch gun mounted in the fore part. The crane & sub. were towed into a shallow part of the harbor.
