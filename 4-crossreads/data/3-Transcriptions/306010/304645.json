<p>the 1st Battalion up round Armentieres and down on the Somme.<br/>Thurs 3rd Aug. (8pm) :<br/>Have started swimming up here &ndash; had one off Wimereux beach yesterday &amp; another a bit further round the  coast today. The weather is very decent now &amp; I shall try &amp; get a dip in the briny every day while it lasts. The O.C. Has had bronchitis and is at present convalescing at No. 32 Brit Stat. Hospital which used to be Lady Dudley's Aust. Vol. Hospital and is right on the cliffs a full two miles round the coast going north. I have to go up and see him with papers &amp; things at least once a day &ndash; to day it has been twice. (88)</p>
