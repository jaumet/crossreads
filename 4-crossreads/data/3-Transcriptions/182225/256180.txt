<p>Jan. Tuesday 25 1916</p>
<p>Very hot again&nbsp;&nbsp; 104&ordm; on verandah</p>
<p>Round Hill paddock with father in morning &amp; set fire to Ben Ledi scrub as we were coming home I think we got a good fire though it. Chilcott came over in afternoon &amp; stayed to tea Joan &amp; Linda &amp; Self went as far as Weblands with him as he was going home. It was great riding in the moonlight after the heat&nbsp;of the day. We did not get back till midnight Cant make John Chilcott out at all he says he is breaking his neck to go &amp; has no family ties &amp; yet he does not move Linda feeling heat very much but nevertheless I think she is happy &amp; glad she came up with me.</p>
