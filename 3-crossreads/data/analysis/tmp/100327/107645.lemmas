 25/10/15 Veri amus to hear our veteran pull their leg . They anticip a rest but I doubt whether 130 will make veri much differ as tunnel is progress apac and over 1500 bag of spoil remov daili . Went down to secret post in " D" Co overlook German offic and search the place with telescop but could detect no movement of ani sort . Return to lunch . Went down to secret post in " A" Co with Drummond Curnow and had telescop over the whole place . Saw a few Turk work and marvel exceed at the strength and amount of labour expend in their trench , probabl a lot of the work is done by civilian gang of Armenian under taskmast . Receiv Kitchen 's messag . My advic is "dig" . Went on to Lone Pine trench saw Capt Park and Frawley . Good deal of head cover . In one place they are direct opposit to 22nd trench and it was novel to see our own trench just as the Turk see them . They are marvel neat and clean look compar with their irregular line but this veri regular has it serious drawback . Artilleri start 75 's fli round pass through sever post wreck with shrapnel so took shelter underground in tunnel until bombard ceas . Go back found reinforc wonder what sort of a place this was with so much ironmongeri hurtl about . Saw Foot in 23rd line . Glorious sunset
