numerous other questions, and after another hand shake I retired, outside I was taken by the hand again by several Officers belonging to the Kings staff and wished all kinds of nice things and so on. I then marched form the Palace with smiles galore, my face fairly ached with smiling, and I only wished I was going straight home to "Diddie" and the girls, to show them what I had won. God Save the King.
(13) Took a Train journey as far as Stockport near Manchester and visited the Hospital at Verno Park where last Sept I was a patient, there were no Australians there and very few British Troops. No doubt the Sinking of Hospital Ships lately has set them thinking.
(15) Took a run out to Mossley where I was in Convalescent Home after leaving Vernon Park. The Staff were all very pleased to see me again, especially when they knew I had come over from France to be decorated.
(17) Returned to London. The country looks beautiful this time of the year.
(18) Reported back from leave. Steamed out from Victoria Station about 9A.M. this morning and arrived at "Folkestone" midday. Went straight on board Troopship and left about 5.30P.M and arrived at "Boulogne at 8.P.M. and were billeted for the night
