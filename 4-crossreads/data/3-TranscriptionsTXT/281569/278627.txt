 79 wks of soldiering 
 Stables at 6.30 
 Off again to Bahnasa at 10.30, this time rode down in train returning by road &amp; I brought a skull home for Pard, strapped it on to the back &amp; it (Hector) carried OK. The plane reported that the Senoussi had left the Oasis about 1000 strong &amp; were coming this way, they dropped a few bombs on them but owing to the sand they were not too effective.Second Regt got orders to move out to Nazlet-el-abid, about 40 miles S of Minia, we moved about 100 yds towards the centre of the camp. Two train loads of niggers (prisoners) went through today on their way to a concentration camp in Cairo. More mail arrived &amp; another one from Nell &amp; Mother. 
 Bed at 10.
