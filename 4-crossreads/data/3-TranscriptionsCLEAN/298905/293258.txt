  
 2 killed & 7 wounded a very smart piece of work, the raiding party say that the German trenches were full of dead & dying men, & they killed all the survivors they found. The 20th Batt. got 9 prisoners & I don't know the exact number they killed, but they got some valuable information from paper's they got over there, & also captured a trench mortar, so you can see our boy's are keeping their reputation up, the German prisoners say they don't know what to make of the Australians for they can never tell where they are going to appear next or what they are going to do. We have had a most successful week so far, our aeroplanes set fire to 3 of old Fritz's observation  ballo  balloons, they dropped fire bombs
