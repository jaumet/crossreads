Account Of Second Escape From Gelebek On 29th April-1918 Ever sinc my return from the first attempt escap , I had made up my mind that I would tri again , onli that I would go about it differ next time . , i .e . I would construct a portabl boat which we would be abl to put to sea in and reach the coast of Cyprus 60 mile distant . After my return from previous attempt I have said that I start work again at Belemedik . Not long after I had a bad attack of Malaria and had to be shift inland as I was in such a bad state of health that I was unabl to work . I was shift to Bore where we soon recov . Dure the latter part of my stay there Corpor Sloss of the Australian Fli Corp suggest that we might escap from the camp and walk to the Russian Front at Siva , 300 mile distant , but my previous experi told me that this would be a terribl difficult undertak owe to the shortag of food everywher , so we cast this idea asid .
