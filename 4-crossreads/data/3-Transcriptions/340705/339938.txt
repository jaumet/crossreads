<p>from Australia will last me for a month or two yet.</p>
<p>Did not see Springhall or Howard before we left the Peninsula, although they sent a message round to me by our then acting C.O.</p>
<p>As to future movements, we are still in the dark.  I hope we will winter in Egypt, but nothing is certain.</p>
<p>Well, so long till next week.  Best love to all from</p>
<p>Your affectionate,<br/>Eric.</p>
