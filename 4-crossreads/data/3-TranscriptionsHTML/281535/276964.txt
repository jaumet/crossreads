<p>20/5/19<br/>Sutton-Veny<br/>wife is a nice woman who speaks without stilted affectation. In fact they might be Australians so free are they from accent. Tonight I go to dinner there with General and Mrs Robertson. Returned to camp at 11 and went to the Orderly Room for a while. Saw Jack after mess. General Robertson called in a car. I introduced Crawford Vaughan late Premier S.A to the party and the car then left. We were received by footmen who took our wraps &amp; then announced us. The Duke and Duchess introduced us to their niece Mrs Loder and we had a very merry little dinner party and there was no restraint at all. Left at about 10.30 and the run home was a little cold but dustless &ndash; these roads are so good. About midnight an attempt was made to burgle my cubicle but an alert batman frustrated it.</p>
