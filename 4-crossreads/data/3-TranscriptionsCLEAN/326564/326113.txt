  
 Continuation of A.A . Barwicks diary of the 1st battalion, A.I.F. 5th March. 1918 Yesterday a 6 inch gun and its carriage capsized into a big drain running alongside the road, she looked a hopeless case but last night a traction engine appeared on the scene & hauled her out. Gill & I went & heard the "Boomerangs" last night in a Y.M.C.A. a few hundred yards from our Camp, they were very good indeed. I was to have gone into Bailleul this morning & bring another prisoner out, but Golder wanted to go into the town so I handed the job
