Saturday Nov 17thMuch better today. Cape Otway was sighted just after dinner. Victorians, S.  Australians & Tasmanians are all getting ready to go off tomorrow, We are expecting to be in Melbourne tomorrow morning. It remains a mystery whether we N.S.Welshmen are to go overland from Melbourne, or by boat. Concert held on No 3 hatchway this evening. It was very good, & the bunting was splendid.
Sunday Nov 18thWe went through the Port Phillip Heads about 6 am. Of course everybody was up by that time. Some had been up since 2 am. Great excitement on board. Arrived in Port Melbourne about 8 am. The quarantine Doctor came on board & examined us all. Apparantly we came in a day before our time as the Dr said we were not expected until tomorrow.
All the Victorians, S. Australians & Tasmanians were preparing to go off all the morning. Pulled into the wharf just at dinner time. Great was our surprise when we (N. S. Welshmen & Queenslanders) received half an hours notice to hand in all our thing & be prepared to disembark straight away. I was mess orderly, but we left  let all the cleaning up rip when the above order came out.
