 Monday 3-9-17 I walked to Aire yesterday &amp; had a look around. Quite a lot of Hun planes Bombed St Omer &amp; its vicinity including here (acques) last night. There was a Hell of a row generally between our "Archies" &amp; the Bombs bursting. The planes were flying very low right over our billet. We could hear the squeal of the Archies shrapnel quite plainly. I believe one of the ladies (French) rushed out in the street in her "nightie" squealing out "Beaucoup wind-up". Bridge Building &amp; Bath today "Bo-Koo promenade" about 20km. 
 Tuesday 4.9.17 I believe the 6th Field Ambulance fell foul of the Portuguese last night &amp; there are wild rumors of injuries received Knife wounds etc. The yarn runs that the 22nd Battalion then came up with Machine guns  Bombs etc and cleared the Portuguese right out of their village. Anyway the Portuguese camp &amp; village have been placed out of bounds. Bridge building again today. Arch. Fullgrave came back today. It is rumoured 5 Portuguese were killed in the trouble mentioned above. 
 5.9.17 Wednesday We were ordered last night to parade at Orderly room with full Kit &#64; 7.30A.M. &amp; leave there for St Omer Railway Station arriving &#64; 10A.M. We are now waiting for the train. The train left at 1.0P.M We reached Poperinghe &#64; about 3.0 &amp; Busseboom &#64; about 4.0. They have Chinese labour here &amp; Fritz comes over every night with Bombs &amp; Machines guns. Spent the evening in a Boozer listening to Tommies singing, incidentally drinking Beer. 6/9 Fritz Planes over in Battalions
