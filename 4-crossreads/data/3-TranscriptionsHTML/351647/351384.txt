<p>France<br/>18 November</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Fancy its one year today since we left Sydney in the old Persic, it doesn't seem that in some ways, time goes very quickly &amp; yet in some ways the life there &amp; indeed all that has happened since seems very far away.  I wish this month &amp; next &amp; January would go quickly as just now things are particularly trying, it is that cold that I don't know really how I am going to keep alive much less work.  One has no idea of it in our parts &amp; then there we have warm rooms &amp; fires &amp; hot food &amp; a good bed &amp;c., &amp;c.  And here well thank heaven my dug out is a pretty warm one &amp; I have a clerical job.  I have to get out a bit &amp; it nearly kills me.</p>
<p>I'm getting chilblains on my feet &amp; on my ears &amp; I can hardly write &amp; taken all round</p>
