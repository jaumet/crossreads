  
 3.  weary next day   &   caught a touch of a cold in the Head in the Tube, but will soon be O.K. I have told you pretty well all the news.  We met several nice Girls in London at Dinner,   &   strange to say nearly all were Nurses.  The two last were Welsh, one named Davies.  There are few men about   &   the places are crowded with women   &   Girls.  There were very few vacant seats in the restaurant we patronised   &   we had no difficulty in finding someone to chat with over dinner.  It is strange to see the Young Girls smoking.  The mostly carry cigarettes   &   after their meal just smoke their cigarette like a man.  But, these Girls   &    women in London are lively.  They hop on   &   off the Buses   &   Trams like any Man.   There is no messing   &   waiting in London.  One has to be on the step waiting to alight or they will get over-carried.  The Motors slow down,   &   fair fat   &   40 all have to jump on.   If you are not lively down in the Tube, the door will slam in your face   &   you'll wait for the next.  The place is lit up much more now the Zepps are not troubling us.  Sugar is off in London.  We could not get any in our Hotel.  Money can't buy it. Now, my Dear people, I must go to bed.  Ellis & Dave have gone to the Pictures, but I have many other letters to write
