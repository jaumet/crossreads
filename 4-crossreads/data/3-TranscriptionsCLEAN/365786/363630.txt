On the way during Sun. we passed numbers of Indian troops, with cavalry & infantry encamped & entrenched.  At Kantara we saw signs of the early  recent  fighting for it was here the Turks made their abortive attempt to cross the Canal.  We saw the trenches & dugouts & sandbag barricades & the station protected by earthworks & more sandbags.  It was our nearest approach to grim war.
