  
 with the skull of a lady that I had loved.  I am writing Dorothy (Ussher) on the grave subject when I have the sketch prepared or ready and I think I can trust her to use her discretion as to whether she sends on my letter & sketch or not.   The point is that my official duties took me past the cemetery and I managed to take half an hour off to visit   the cemetry  the grave of a friend.  Just that and nothing more. 
 We embark on a French boat for Constant. tomorrow at 10.30 and I cannot tell you how pleased I am at getting clear of this graveyard beautiful as it is nor can I explain how satisfied I am to have done what work I have done. 
 My side is alright at present and the question is how are you and the boys?  I shall hear soon.
