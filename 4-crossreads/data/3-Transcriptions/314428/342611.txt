There were several boxing contests which afforded much fun &amp; provoked many remarks. The musical chairs were very amusing, the Padre Cptn. won his heat and was well up in the final. He would have won had his two opponents not cheated him by keeping inside the ring. These sports will be continued tomorrow. The C.O Major Matthews and the Doctor Cpt. P. O'Shea were competitors in the musical chairs but failed to win places.</p>
