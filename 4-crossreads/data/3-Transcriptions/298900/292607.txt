<p>Monday 7th Jan<br/>    First went to S.M. &amp; Co. to draw another &pound;10 after which I felt much safer also received a letter from Paris.   Went along to Bumpus again &amp; settled up for my books.   Had lunch at the Y.M.C.A.    Went out to tea at N.Hill &amp; had dinner at The Rendezvous another of the French places round Soho &amp; very nice too.    Then went along to Princes &amp; saw  Carminetta, a real good musical play, Delysia, a French girl being very good.   Supper at Bustos &amp; tube home.   Weather rather cool with a little snow.</p>
<p>Tuesday 8th January<br/>    Spent most of the morning ringing up Dartford to get Ramsay up for the evening as I had arranged to meet M.L. &amp; D.W.A. for dinner &amp; the theatre after.   Had lunch at the Y.M. &amp; met Ramsay at Charing Cross Station.    This was the coldest day I had yet experienced in London &amp; although I did not mind, I noticed that others did.   Met Ramsay about 2.30 &amp; we strolled round finishing up at Bussards in Oxford</p>
