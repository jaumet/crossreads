<p>Dr. Sir<br/>Excuse an entire stranger forwarding to you this sympathetic communication.<br/>It is with sincere regret that I noticed the death of your noble son in France. My son has been associated with your son Major Garling for a long time in France &amp; possibly may have been with him till the end.  At least I know for he has often noted in his letters to me that your son Major Garling was held in the highest esteem both as an officer &amp; a gentleman by the men in his Battery.<br/>My daughter &amp; self extent to you our sincere heartfelt sympathy in your sad bereavement trusting you may derive a morsel of comfort from the esteem in which he was held by the men fighting under him.<br/>I am<br/>Dr. Sir<br/>Yours Respectfully<br/>Rob. S.M.Cormick</p>
