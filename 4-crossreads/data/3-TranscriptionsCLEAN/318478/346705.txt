Tuesday 25 Feb. 1919
Dull & rainy with fairly strong wind.  Painting again out of the question so with Spruce I hunted among the stunted bushes or small trees for pieces likely to make passable sticks or hunting crops which I hope to bring back as souvenirs of the peninsular.  We covered a lot of ground & destroyed the original gloss of uniform & general appearance by scrambling through thorny scrub in search of straight pieces.
