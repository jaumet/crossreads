<p>March 1916<br/>their place in the harbour too. That evening we had a concert on board &amp; was the first bit of enjoyment we had had since leaving Egypt &amp; it was a fine turn out. After the concert I was again told off for submarine guard the next morning &amp; I took my first post at 6 am. We left Toulon at 8 am &amp; set sail for Marseilles which we reached about 2 pm. To look for the entrance to the harbour is a puzzle from the ocean for there is also a big brake water here too &amp; we were guided through this towards our wharf. It was then raining but the band struck up the Marseillaise as we passed the wharf  &amp; the cheering was deafening. When the boat was tied up to the wharf &amp; the gang ways swung I was detailed off to help unload our gear off the boat &amp; it was then that I first put my foot in France. Marseilles Harbour is a fine big place &amp; there were dozens of boats of all sizes there &amp; the wharfs are also fine with their big storage sheds etc. We did not disembark till about   half past nine that night then we were lined up &amp; marched in fours to the Railway station which was about a quarter of an hours walk from the boat. On reaching the station we had to sit down &amp; wait till the gear etc was put on the train first &amp;</p>
