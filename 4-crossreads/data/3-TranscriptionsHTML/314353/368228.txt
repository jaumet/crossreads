<p>The "Selected Poems" of Rupert Brooke last night I sewed over its cover a part of a triangular bandage.  Carrying it in the pocket is dirtying it.</p>
<p>99.<br/>Torturously writing lying on my stretcher.  The dugout's cupula iron and on either side carries 12 stretchers in four sets of 3&hellip; 24 stretchers.  Turned in 9 a.m. and slept till dinner:  slept again, and tea, and so to bed!</p>
<p>Last night, about this time,-'sadness set in':  the rum bottle &ndash; jar rather &ndash; was placed ready for Nick to issue, on one of the rickety dugout forms&hellip; someone sat on the form&hellip; and the rum jar smashed its rum to the floor&hellip;now tonight Nick asks for loans of water bottles to draw the issue in &ndash; "they won't break even if they do fall!"</p>
<p>The Kookaburras have made one song well known to the troops, its melody swings, and its fully appropriate.</p>

<p>We know H.E.O. never was a fool,<br/>Horatio's a pal of mine.<br/>To see the boys went up the line.<br/>And he damn near stopped a 5.9.<br/>-It says so in John Bull.</p>
<p>It is so!!!</p>
<p>I always keep my John Bull's by!<br/>That is how I prophesy!<br/>The war was over last July!<br/>It says so in John Bull.</p>
<p>Reddy &ndash; Mons! and Barrett last night, had a rather disastrous box-on at the C.M.D.S. &ndash; so Serge informs us.  Reddy carries bad black eyes from it, and Barrett has been sent to the bearers!</p>
<p>No mail today:  the Channel too rough.  Tomorrow is due, Masefield's, "Herod the King" and two 1st editions of J.C. Squire's from Beaumonts.  Theirs is a bonzer little book shop &ndash; one of the gems of Charing Cross Road:  It was on Saturday afternoon after seeing at Drury Lane "Samson and Delilah" that I discovered it:  and tragedy was in its being closed.</p>
<p>In the windows were all books of appeal&hellip;a Vale</p>
