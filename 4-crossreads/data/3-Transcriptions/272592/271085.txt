<p>The following is a parody" on "Sing me to Sleep" &amp; is a great favorite among the boys</p>
<p>Sing me to sleep, the bullets fall<br/>Let me forget the war &amp; all<br/>Damp is my dugout cold is my feet<br/>Nothing but biscuits &amp; bully to eat</p>
<p>Far far from Pozeries I want to be<br/>Where German snipers can't pot at me<br/>Think of me crouching where the worms creep<br/>Waiting for shrapnel to sing me to sleep</p>
<p><strike>Refrain</strike></p>
<p>Sing me to sleep where bombs explode<br/>And shrapnel shells are &agrave; la mode<br/>Or the sand bags <strike>in front of me</strike> behind me you'll find<br/>Corpse's in front of you corpses behind</p>
<p>Refrain</p>
