The mails have been mad lately & I have had very little news whatever.  The season seems to be good for which I am very very glad, but the coal strike is bad & things political seem to be very very mixed.
Well my dear I wonder where you'll be when this reaches you.  I suppose it will be too hot at Tog but I hope you are well & happy & Graham & the Boss aussi.  My love to you all & dear old Mac & believe me,
Yours as everJim Wilkie
