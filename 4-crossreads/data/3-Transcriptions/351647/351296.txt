<p>day did he worry us much.  I'll tell you all about that later on.  What did surprise me was that I was much more amused at the other chaps antics than scared.  Sounds callous but it is so.  We came out of the line about Christmas &amp; went back to a little village.  In a way it was better there, <strike>but</strike> had a decent room to sleep in &amp; decent meals but I had a very busy time working all day &amp; till 10 &amp; 11 every night.  Weather pretty rotten too.  Then I had to come away down here for a course of instruction in a new branch of clerical work which they are starting.</p>
<p>I haven't cared much about it, it is a big training camp &amp; we sleep in tents (very cold &amp; damp this weather) &amp; 8 of us which is rather crowded.</p>
<p>It is terribly cold, snow every day &amp; we have to attend lectures all day &amp; swat at night.</p>
<p>Of course there are compensations.  I have met several old friends &amp; made several new rather jolly friends.  Then we have had a couple of impromptu concerts.</p>
