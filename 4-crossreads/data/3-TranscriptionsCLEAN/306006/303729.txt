Heard this afternoon that we are to go back 60 miles & will be in a rest camp near Sagia, the majority of us would much sooner remain here as there is too much Regimental work in a rest Camp, we are counting on getting leave to Cario from Sagia Two of our 'planes came in at 7 oclock tonight & was the cause of us standing to our horses as we thought they were enemy machines Got 12 worth of goods from the AIF Canteen today between Frost, Browne, Laney & myself.
