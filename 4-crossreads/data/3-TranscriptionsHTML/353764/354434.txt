We then had to ride about 3 miles out towards the Nile so as to skirt the Camel Encampment &amp; head for Helmieh Siding.  On reaching here we dismounted &amp; handed our horses to an Arab to mind &amp; had a Cup of Tea &amp; Cakes.  We then struck out through the Desert &amp; after a further hours stumbling ride, reached Camp, very tired &amp; our horses completely blown out.</p>
<p>30.3.16 Thursday<br/>This is now our second week on Bully Beef &amp; we are beginning to get a little tired of same.  The only Vegetables we can get are Onions &amp; if I am spared to get back again I don't think I will ever look at them again, I am so tired of them.  Some of the men are breaking out in Pimples &amp; Boils, through the constant supply of "Bully" so I am going to cut it out for a few days &amp; live on Bread &amp; Golden Syrup, which is a kind of universal food to us.  The "Tea" which which we all call Soapy water has now come to an end &amp; thank goodness we are getting decent stuff.</p>
