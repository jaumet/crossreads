<p>warriors before launching his attack on Thermopolae, many centuries have passed over them Since that day but still within their sight we civilised beings are making war and killing our fellow-beings and this for world-power the cause of wars from time immemorial.<br/>Yesterday we had an armistice to bury the dead and we who were lucky enough to go out, talked as freely as possible with our friend the Turk- He is a strange little creature- the Turk in his blue-grey green clothes and slippered feet and I expect he thinks the same of us for he was surprised to find us white and human.  He is a sport and I hope he thinks the same of us.  I do not think I shall tell anymore of our doings out in front that day enough to say we buried all our dead and our padres held services over them</p>
