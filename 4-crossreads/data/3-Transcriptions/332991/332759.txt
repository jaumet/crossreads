<p>I had my foot dressed last night and again this morning.  It is now very much better but aches at times very much.  There was a captain in this ward from one of the Battalions to see the wounded this morning.  I heard that W. Stubbs is in England suffering from shell shock, and that in the recent raid german prisoners were taken.<br/>This afternoon I met on  the stairs young Popple of Merrigum.  He is in the 10th Field Ambulance and is looking well.  Later on W. Herring also of Merrigum &amp; now a Lieutenant in the 38 Batt. came into the ward to see some of his wounded men.  He was in the recent raid &amp; escaped without  a scratch.<br/>This evening there were some enemy</p>
