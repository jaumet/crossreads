  
 May 1916 Supply of water so we left again at 10 am & got back to Oghratina at 2 pm.  We were all feeling very stiff & tired.  Filled our water bottles up again, made some tea & about 3 oclock we were off again & reached Qatia about 5 pm & were back in camp by 6.30 pm, watered fed & groomed our horses, fed ourselves.  We were all in a hurry for bed, but were informed we had to go on outpost at 8 pm.  It was a weary troop that dragged itself along the mile of sand to No 2 Redoubt.  However, we put everyone on & made the duty as light as possible. 
 Tuesday 9th The weather is getting very warm again.  Our troop was on day outpost in the afternoon.  We heard of successes in France but cant get the full strength of things 
 Wednesday 10th Had a full day in camp, but was out on outpost at night.  There was a very heavy fog & it was after 6 on Thursday morning when we came in. 
 Thursday 11th to 18th We put in the usual existence
