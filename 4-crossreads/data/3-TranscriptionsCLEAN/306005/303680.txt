2-1-17Tues 2ndPut in one of the most miserable days we have yet had cold,  & a heavy wind blowing. the sand blowing everywhere; B Squadron is on Outpost tonight & must be having a miserable time as the rain commenced at sundown & it promises to be a miserable night. Hill reported to A Sqdn for duty today. The Tommies went out last night & were followed by more this morning;  Rang up Bde this afternoon to see if Lieut Kater is back but found him still away: The Egyptian labor corps are now camped in the palm grove, at El Arish they appear rather comfortable with 1 tent to 6 men & here we are camped within a mile of them & not even a tent for the C.O. or Orderly Room.
