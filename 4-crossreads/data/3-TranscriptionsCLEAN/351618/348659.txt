  
 Another quite morning. A few shells scattered about our area. Canteen to-day for 8th Battery. Called in at Olly's coming back & had a chat. It was nice & crisp and I enjoyed it. Had to dodge a little shelling. 
 Friday 12th Nov Called up at 9th Bty and in the afternoon went to Canteen for them and secured cakes & on the way back a shell lodged in a dressing shed of the Ambulance at Brown's Dip  [about 100 yds from Lone Pine] and killed 3 poor unfortunates who were there while about 4 others were wounded. I saw the poor fellows getting taken away on stretchers and one seemed in a very bad way.
