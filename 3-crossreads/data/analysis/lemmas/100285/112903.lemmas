 I notic a rather remark thing on parad this morn it was in connect with the band , everi morn without fail while we are wait to move off from the parad ground the men are constant kick up a row spar , sit down , or talk like old women in fact do everyth that they should not do it imposs to keep them quiet , but this morn whether by accid or design I know not the band stop quit close to us play some veri nice tune all the time the music was on they stood as quiet as the oldest most disciplin soldier could have , I could not help rememb that old couplet , " Music hath charm to sooth the savag beast " for here was a veri good case in point . This afternoon all the Sgts W.O.s
