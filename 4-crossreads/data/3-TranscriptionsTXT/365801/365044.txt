killing a crowd & more raids are to follow.We really have them well in hand & are only waiting for the word to move forward.  What a day that will be & what a sight for the Gods to see the boys of the 20th let loose on the Huns.  May I be there to see.  I too have noticed the large number of lost men, but the Honor List might steady them a bit.  France is a beautiful country except where the Hun has spread desolation.  Some day I hope to tell you some of his doings, I could not write details.  But he is "up against it" now & the end does not look too far distant.I hope you have seen the Anzac Book.  Read the poem "Anzacs".  Fragments from France is also well worth seeing & is true to life.
