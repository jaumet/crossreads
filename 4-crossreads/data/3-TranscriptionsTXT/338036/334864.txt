 Saturday 20th When I awoke it was icy cold and the snow which has been on ground for days is still frozen over.  After breakfast I was appointed water picket and which [while] on that job our artillery opened fire just nearby kicking up a deuce of noise.  Shells commenced to fly about &amp; Fritz replied later.  It was hard to distinguish Fritzs from ours.  One chap brought up by our R.A.P. bearers with one leg off. 
 The Tommies coming out are comical and cut some funny figures.  Such remarks as, Have a monkey [indecipherable].  Have some butterscotch etc when they havnt a cent is typical.  This picket game is no bon as plaster falls off the wall all over you
