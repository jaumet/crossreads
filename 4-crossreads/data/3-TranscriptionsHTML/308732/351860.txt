<p>ago. The routine is the same, as usual, we go up Communications trenches to the front line, &amp; dig most of the night to the accompaniment of more or less shells &amp; bullets, and then back to our dugouts for the day. My platoon has had three men wounded by bullets out on the job, &amp; have gone back to Blighty, also some very narrow escapes even back here where we are. While here we can have a little more freedom of movement, also have a wash, etc. 19-7-18 On the night of the 17-7-18 we moved up &amp; took over the front line, it was a most unpleasant march, in fact the men said it was   <u>worse</u> than that. We left about 10 o'clock, &amp; there were about 4000 yds to go via C.T's (communication trench) there had been a heavy thunderstorm just before, &amp; the whole of the trench was on an average about ankle deep in water, by the time a hundred or so men had filed thro' them, they were a nice &amp; slippery &amp; muddy condition. It is awfully sticky stuff, the least touch &amp; it sticks fast, as the sides of the trenches were in a good sticky condition</p>
