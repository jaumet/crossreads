<p>latter place I have known the wind to blow at an average velocity of 80 miles an hour for as long as 3 days and nights without cessation. But for a real "smotherer" commend me to this one today. It was only a short one but I have never experienced its equal. For fully 20 minutes there was one continuous mad swirl of dust and a 'hurricane. The Thermometer in the tent went from 112&deg; to 70&deg;. The Sergeants Mess tent for the third time in this Camp blew down. The wind has dropped now. (8pm) and the atmosphere is much cooler. 2 bags of parcels tonight. Appleton of "A" Squadron goes to the forthcoming school of instruction for Signalling at Zeitoun at the end of the month  Also Campbell of "B" Squadron. I don't give much for Appleton's chance of passing creditably but I have every faith in Campbell. Tried to go myself but the powers that be would not hear of it.</p>
