<p>May 1916<br/>Supply of water so we left again at 10 am &amp; got back to Oghratina at 2 pm.  We were all feeling very stiff &amp; tired.  Filled our water bottles up again, made some tea &amp; about 3 oclock we were off again &amp; reached Qatia about 5 pm &amp; were back in camp by 6.30 pm, watered fed &amp; groomed our horses, fed ourselves.  We were all in a hurry for bed, but were informed we had to go on outpost at 8 pm.  It was a weary troop that dragged itself along the mile of sand to No 2 Redoubt.  However, we put everyone on &amp; made the duty as light as possible.</p>
<p>Tuesday 9th<br/>The weather is getting very warm again.  Our troop was on day outpost in the afternoon.  We heard of successes in France but cant get the full strength of things</p>
<p>Wednesday 10th<br/>Had a full day in camp, but was out on outpost at night.  There was a very heavy fog &amp; it was after 6 on Thursday morning when we came in.</p>
