 My own darling Sisters, 
 I am writing this on the eve of my going into action. They say there will be something big doing. Please God that "I will do my duty and be a man". (to quote part of what poor old Ralph said when he left Australia) I have seen Alister Stobo several times, & yesterday he went thru our dressing station suffering a little from the effects of a gas shell which fell in his vicinity. I trust he will be O.K. Dear old girls! Should anything final happen to me I hope that you will hear that I tried to do my duty. - and don't grieve over much. With very much love to you all - also to Mr Owen & Will Ever your loving brother, Fredk S. Phillips.
