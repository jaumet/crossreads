 30/9/16  During the evening the enemy's "minnies" became a shade too active in the front line and our guns commenced to plaster them and kept up a heavy bombardment till late in the night, shaking these crazy ruins with their reports and filling the air with acrid smoke. 
 1/10/16  Woke up and commenced strafing my batman Hunt who commenced today for not being in on time and found that the clocks had been put back an hour on account of the change from summer to winter time.  Went into the status and promotion of NCOs with the Colonel during the morning and took control of the mess at headquarters.  After lunch attended church parade about 30 in the ruined chapel in front of the building.  A very tawdry place this has been gilded columns of wood!  Lath and plaster ceilings and gaudy woodwork and gold paint.  Blown about and splintered with shells it shows up in all its false finery.  A dull quiet afternoon with planes up and "archies" coughing at them.  About 4 the enemy commenced putting over "77 pip squeaks" and 4.5 inch shells.  These came very close and many burst on the square just outside.  Some landed in the ruined cloth hall and further damaged the tower and front fa&ccedil;ade wreckage.  At dusk when the bombardment had ceased I went round to the Belgian barracks for a bath.  A fine building whose strong walls have made a good resistance to the German artillery but which is well ruined nevertheless.  The baths were rather crude but the hot water quite removed the grime of our last stay in the trenches.  Spent the evening writing and turned in at about 10 pm.  A quiet night.
