4/4/18 ? Berthen
church is comparatively new and garish with the tawdry waxen painted images and imitation flowers so dear to the Catholic. At the last minute the doctors forbade burial until post-mortem. Not having the necessary tools the body will have to go to a C.C.S. for burial. Rain fell fairly heavily so I ordered greatcoats for our march today. Valises and other gear are much reduced in size and necessarily so as there are now about 40 officers here. One of the characters of the regiment is L/Cpl. Habel of the Mess. Always has nothing to eat, can produce nothing, always despairs but always turns up with a good meal for us under any circumstances.
