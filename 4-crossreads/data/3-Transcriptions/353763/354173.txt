<p>Friday 18th Sept  -  Yesty aft  Captain Moore &ndash; Patterson &amp; self went for a stroll on the beach  -  Well laid out place  -  No butcher's shop to be seen  -  They live on the stuff &amp; food is vey  -  scarce since the war broke out  -  We then 'blew in' (very common expression) on the Berrima &amp; met men &amp; drank  -  The bar trade on the Berrima is a huge one  -  We also were on the Sumatra &amp; Madang &ndash; the prizes   -  &amp; then blew in on the Protector &amp; had more drinks &amp; 'buz' then off to S.S. Upolu  -  I'm the medico that gets around &amp; sees things thanks to being on the 'Robert D  -  Lee'  -  I all but got a week end patrolling on the Sumatra  -  I wanted to go badly but as I'm MO to 3 ships (Upolu AE2 Protector) I couldn't be spared  =<br/>All our men &amp; officers are doing jobs somewhere &amp; I've my name down for any odd job anywhere or anyhow  -  That's the way to see what's doing &amp; you don't lose anything even if you don't go  -  You mop up all that's possible  -</p>
<p>Its hot &amp; close to-day  -  What I'll jot down is the 'Buz' First of all a few facts however  -  In this harbor lie the Montcalm &ndash; not much good as a first class fighter &ndash; the Protector &ndash; no damned use at all &ndash; the Encounter? ditto &ndash; AE2 &ndash; the Destroyers   -  [indecipherable] Yarra &amp; Warrego  -  Yarra has her shaft buckled  -</p>
<p><u>If  - If</u>   -  the German cruisers &ndash; Scharnhorst &amp; Gneisenau only knew it now's their chance &amp; their only chance  -  As a matter of fact the Germans expect us to be attacked  -</p>
