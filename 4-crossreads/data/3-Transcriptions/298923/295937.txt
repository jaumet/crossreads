<p>28 September 1918 Saturday (X to X crossed out)<br/>Outpost again.<br/>Moved back to water &amp; a beautiful Trout stream, with Bamboo etc:- Oleanders &amp; Black berries , found odd wounded Turks, but opposition finished except from Circassian Bedouins - over 40 000 prisoners now &amp; 300 guns.  Thunder storm last night, rainy season commences in a month-   We have little Transport &amp; only carry a Blanket &amp; Oilsheet<br/>X Cannot send any letters or receive any from the wife these days but I trust all is well.  I doubt if this reaches you it runs many risks but with love I send it hoping the War may end soon-   Your son FW X</p>
