<p>the flashes of the big guns from the navy. What a sight it was never to be forgotten. The infantry from the transports were being loaded into destroyers and a long line of them about severn in all made for the beach at Kaba Tepe. When the got close to the shore, the Turkish machine guns began to speak and things were looking very nasty for us, but our men threw off their packs jumped into the water with fixed bayonets and made a famous charge which will go down in the History of Australian Arms. It makes one proud to be Australian what more an Australian Soldier. Of course the Artillery did not get ashore for a couple of days later as there were no places for guns as the country is very difficult and then they were only used as shot guns the use of ammunition was very great</p>
