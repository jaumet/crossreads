 F. We lay at anchor all night & we are up & breakfast by 6.45 am. I am detailed to take Temps of all the men. It is a farce. We pull in to shore about 10 am. Great crowds & I am very pull up. We go ashore at noon but no train until 2 pm. I refuse dinner. We arrive Adelaide 2.45 pm. I look for Queen's Mall but get lost & then found. Lovely Church then I post Book No 4 views to M. I catch Malrene Tram & can't find No 65. I have dinner & arrive back in Town at 7.30 catch 8.30 train & write to M when I get Home but don't finish letter. 
 16 July, Wednesday 
 F. Dull & cold. I work all day alone. We have a lot of work. V.A.D's from the shore come aboard. I run ashore for an hour for dinner. I help myself in the Y.M.C.A. Work all afternoon & go ashore at 8 pm to Concert Hall. I hear first song "Someday you'll know how much I love you. You'll be sorry you sent me away". I play for Highland Fling twice. We can't sail because we have such a terrible list to starboard.
