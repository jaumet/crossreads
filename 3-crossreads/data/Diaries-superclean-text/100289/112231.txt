Monday 26.3.17
Terrific explosion at midnight last night; Town Hall blown up by a mine laid by Fritz supposed to have been set by clockwork. Many killed few taken from cellars alive. Earth rocked like a boat at the time of the explosion. Warned against sleeping in cellars.
Tuesday 27.3.17
Fatigues for the day: walked around to the scene of the explosion; hundreds digging to try release any who may be alive in cellars.
