  
 intense pain & have done with it than to hang on perhaps for a month or so & suffer the whole time, so I made my decision & said right oh Sgt. have a go at her, once my mind was made up I was right so he sat me down & got his tools ready, he then called 2 more chaps in & one got hold of my head & another steadied my shoulders & I got a good grip of the seat & opened my mouth, in went the forceps & for the next minute I did not know whether I was standing on my head or feet I thought my head was coming off though, at last oh heaven what a relief out she come a beauty & with a nice little abycess hanging on the end no wonder my face ached, but what a relief once it was over I felt like a new man straight away, & I was as pleased as Punch with myself for that tooth had me bluffed in England where I could have got all sorts of attention with it, but no I kept putting the evil day off & at last I had to have it out in about the most unexpected place & circumstances.
