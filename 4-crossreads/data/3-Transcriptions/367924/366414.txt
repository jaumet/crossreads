<p>My Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines to let you know that I am quite well and I hope you are all the same. I am sending you a little Card from here, look inside it as soon as you get it, as it has a little Card in it. I am also sending you a parcel with a Cusion Cover for you and one for Nell, I do hope you get them safe, if any one had the money to spare, their is some lovely things to buy here.</p>
<p>I have only been into the town Ismailia three times since landing here, there is nothing much to see there, we whent and saw the Gardens and the fresh water Canel. The Native quarters are a dirty place if ever you saw any thing dirty. We are starting to get some hot weather now, and the flys are starting to get fairly bad to.</p>
<p>We get plenty of War news here, there is a paper comes here every day. I have not had the luck to meet any of the Kojonup Boys yet but expect to any day now. I will write to both you and Nell every chance I get. The Norrish boys have not arrived here yet.</p>
<p>My word men must be hard to get hold of in Kojonup there now, how are people going to get there crops in. I suppose no one has been working on my place yet, I expect you will soon know what the wool brought, you did not say how my horses where looking, they should be doing well</p>
