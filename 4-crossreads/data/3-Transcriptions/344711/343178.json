<p>17th<br/>6th Light Horse went on a route march up the Nile as far as Helouan, camped for dinner, &amp; returned in afternoon.

<p>21st<br/>Went by train to Helouan, a very pretty place.  Leaving there went to Cairo to All Saints Church, where there was a fine choral service.  Were invited to tea by some nice English people, &amp; had an enjoyable evening.  We had some music, and I had tea out of a three handled bowl, called a Wassail bowl.</p>
<p>23rd<br/>Our Brigade was astir early to repel an attack on our camp by the 1st Light Horse Brigade.  Our job was to hold them in check until 2 p.m. but at 5 p.m. we were still masters</p>
