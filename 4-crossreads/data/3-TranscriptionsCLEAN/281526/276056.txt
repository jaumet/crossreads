Walked down to the Magdalen Bridge which gives pleasant views of the tree lined Cherwell and a big expanse of open grass land & meadows on either side. Entered Magdalen College and had a good look round the beautiful cloisters of its secluded interior. Being winter time the creepers have no leaves - when all is green these walls and towers must present a lovely sight. The Chapel dates from 1480 and is very lovely with a stone reredos. Some cadets were drilling in the garden & the paths to river side and the walks were not open. Passed University College & All Souls College without entering and next pulled up at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin. All turrets & pinnacles and a high tower. The door has twisting stone supports surmounted by a statue
