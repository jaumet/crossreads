 I cannot get home quick enough for I just detest this country. 
 I hope you are in good health after all your good work which you did for us during the war and I sincerely hope you are enjoying the peace which we took such a big part in bringing about. 
 As soon as I arrive in Sydney Miss King and am free I shall call on you so I hope you are still at Elga so I will be able to call on you and know where to go. 
 I will now fetch this letter to a close as it is getting near sleeping time. 
 With Best Wishes and Kindest Regards Yours Sincere Friend Sgt. R. Otto 2nd Btn AIF
