<p>I hope to goodness that this Moascar rumour turns out correct, for then I may be able to get up to Cairo &amp; get my teeth fixed, they want it badly again.  I also want to see Curtis again &amp; ask him about the Agricultural opportunities of this country.  I should very much like to get a job here when the war is over.  I consider that it would be an ideal country to live in, as I don't think that I could live in England after the way in which I have stewed here.  I am now trying to get into the Camel transport of this unit, with a view to learning a bit of Arabic, but I don't know whether it will come off or not.  It is really disgraceful to have been nearly three years in this country &amp; not be able to speak Arabic.</p>
