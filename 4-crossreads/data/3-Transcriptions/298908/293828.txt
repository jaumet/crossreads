<p>&amp; is dying down according to the papers.<br/>Yesterday afternoon I met Miss Nissen &amp; we went for a stroll round the "Hoe", this is a most famous spot for it was from here that the Spanish Armada was sighted &amp; the battle started, &amp; here also is the little piece of green where Drake was playing his game of bowls &amp; the old hero's statue overlooks the Sound, he is gazing out to sea as if watching for the fleet to appear.  Just close to him is a big statue of Brittania surrounded at the base with the old cannon of those days &amp; piles of cannon balls, &amp; also the origional Eddystone Lighthouse stands on the promenade where it has been re-built.  There is a most splendid view to be had from the promenade which follows the coast round.  A great breakwater runs far out to sea you can easily follow it by the white clouds of foam which are continually breaking over it while the great rocky headlands stretch out to the open sea shaping the bay like the letter U &amp; in the sheltered waters scores of camoflaged steamers are sheltering</p>
