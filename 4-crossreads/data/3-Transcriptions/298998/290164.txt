Within a few moments I could feel the blood trickling down my back and arm - the bullet having entered under the shoulder blade; the injury did not deter me and of course was not sufficient to stop me; in fact it increased my determination.</p>
<p>I could see my opponent (Fritz) quite plainly, only 80 yards distant, where he operated a maxim with deadly accuracy upon the Corporal, several strange men and myself. Fortunately there were very few men within the Hun's sector; his shooting unfortunately proved effective.
