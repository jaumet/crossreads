At night we held a concert and the talent was splendid, quite as good if not better than in civil life. Our officers were present &amp; had invited the leading French officers &amp; the English officers totalling quite 40, quite a distinguished company. This day the staff Dispenser took sick which brought my case forcibly before the O.C. with the result that today he sent me across to my unit to try &amp; get a transfer or else permission to stay on. The trip was very rough but I had a splendid day seeing old friends again.<br/>Thursday 28th Oct. Came back with a note from my O.C. &amp; handed it to the Major, It contained a refusal to his request, rather rough on the Major, so I return to my unit tomorrow after being away from them for six long months. I spent today packing up &amp; writing letters &amp; preparing to clear out<br/>Friday 29th October - after some delay managed to get a loan of one of the cars to take me to the pier with my gear. I had collected some good things for the cold weather also some</p>
