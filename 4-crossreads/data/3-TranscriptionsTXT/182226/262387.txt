 Friday 31 December, 1915 
 Went into Valletta, De Mattos &amp; Sheen, two friends of mine managed to get a few shillings which was nearly all spent. 
 Coming home we met two nurses &amp; took them home to St Patrick&#39;s Hospital. 
 Were too tired to see the New Year in so we went to bed at 11.30. 
 &nbsp; 
 Turn to January 1 st &nbsp;in front for continuation.
