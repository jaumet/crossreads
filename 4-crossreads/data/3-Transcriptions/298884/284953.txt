<p><u>7th</u>  We passed Gibraltar this morning at about 06.45. It did not look very imposing or impressive in any way though as it did not show up very clearly.</p>
<p>Our trip has been a most enjoyable one since passing by the Bay of Biscay when a big number of troops and even the crew and one of the ships officers became a little bit green.</p>
<p>Time on board is passing away rapidly and happily. Our band has been giving splendid selections daily with the exception of one or two days when it has been almost impossible to remain on deck at all.</p>
<p>The Y.M.C.A. has not forgotten us even though we are</p>
