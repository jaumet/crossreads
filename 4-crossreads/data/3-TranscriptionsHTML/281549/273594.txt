<p>On the night of the 24th I walked into Wylye village to have a look round, I was unable to see much of the place, the night was too dark, But what I did see of it struck me to be very nice &amp; it seemed to be very comfortable . It was very quiet &amp; old fasioned, All street lights were extinguished owing to the fear of Zepplins.</p>
<p>To-day I went to the village of Codford, as there was no parades all day  I was able to see the village in daylight, It did not strike me as being at all nice. It was very dirty &amp; not so homely or as comfortable looking as Wylye. I strolled back to camp after a while &amp; got caught in a storm on the way &amp; wet through into the bargain.</p>
