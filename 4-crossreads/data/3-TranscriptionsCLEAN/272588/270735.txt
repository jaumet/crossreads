  
 Tuesday 9 July A bit of a scratch match at cricket to-day. To-night I went down to the "Sentimental Blokes" near Hazebrouck, & the concert was very decent.  The girl was fine in fact she becomes more chic daily. A stunt is coming off to-night and we are standing by. 
 Wednesday 10 July Raining to-day & thundery.  The stunt of last night resulted in 30 prisoners & about 60 wounded for us.  Visit 3rd Brigade Concert party.
