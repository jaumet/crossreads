Ramsay Lodge a place for Overseas soldiers so up I goes up a very steep hill only to find the whole joint crowded out, so they sent me round to the overflow house "Blackie House" here I got fixed up, gave the Matron all my money etc to look after, had some dinner then went down the city, what a wonderful place Edinburgh is, all the while I was there I don't think I saw a single wooden or brick house nothing but solid stone is used it gives the place the appearance of being as solid as a bell. Princes Street is something splendid, reckoned to be the finest street in Europe I can quite believe it on one side there is nothing but beautiful big buildings stretching for a good  of a mile as straight as a die while the other side there are fine gardens statues etc the whole way along overlooking it all
