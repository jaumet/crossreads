<p>Working day and night on the alterations. They say we will be ready to sail in the morning.<br/>28/4/18.<br/>We sailed from Durban I the "Field Marshal" this morning. We were making good time until we ran into a heavy gale. The ship threw herself about in an extraordinary manner; nearly everyone was sea sick. The lascar crew were down to it and I volunteered with other chaps to lash the lifeboats down they were breaking lose. A sea smashed our forward cookhouse, and we hove to for a while. Heavy sea's are coming aboard and the decks are washing with water. The ship is rolling heavily, but as we have shifted our course to meet the gale it is not so bad now. Have never seen a big storm at sea before and I am enjoying the sight of flung spray and foam.</p>
