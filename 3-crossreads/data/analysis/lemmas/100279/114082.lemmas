 let fli with rifl machin gun wipe near the whole crowd out they count over 40 dead left on the ground . I reckon that was a brave deed . We never went into the line this time for some reason or other but stop at Eaucourt Abbay done fatigu . They are pile the gun on to this part of the line proper I know of one littl sunken road between a great German dump the Abbay where there is a gun for everi 10 yard it must be a good of a mile in length . On the 6th we had a fair heavi fall of snow but it did not lay on the ground long , but a cold bitter wind follow for near 24 hour after it .
