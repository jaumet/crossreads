<p>On leaving 10th Division called on 9th Corps Headquarters and saw the C.O.S General Reid. I had previously known and disliked him in Constantinople.  He said Gen Stopford was not very anxious to have any Correspondents with him but had consented to Nevinson and self coming on condition we brought an officer with us. We merely asked that they would give us news from time to time of coming events so that we might be in the right place to see t them.  However it was quite easy to see that the atmosphere was not overcharged with friendleness. He promised however to arrange for us to see Stopford on the following day at nine am. This interview never took place for reasons I will explain later. Just as I left The 9th Corps I Caught a glimpse of the General pouring over his Maps evidently trying to discover where his own men and where the enemy where.</p>

It does not look to me as if it would be any shelter in<br/>the storms of the autumn and winter. Inhear that the Navy thought they cou d utilise the Salt Lake in the winter. This is a good joke</p>
