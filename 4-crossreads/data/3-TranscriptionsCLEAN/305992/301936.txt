for them. Otherwise we soon lost sight of all. On arrival we decided to signal our escort destroyer the 0.8. & invit the Commander & officers & engineers aboard for dinner. An hour after at 6.30pm they came aboard & dinned with us & the Military officers. They were the Heroes of the day.  All our Military officers & ourselves were highly pleased to see them & much fuss were made of them. For as we expected they did not have a meal for 3 days otherwise than buscuits & Bully beef. All their drinking water spoilt by salt water during the gale. The Chief engineer of her I had up in my cabin along with our own officers. He said the reason we lost sight of them it appears one of their forhead scuttles was washed away. 20 tons of water got down the chain locker. The water being 6 feet above the valve they could not possible pump it out. Their condenser for the main turbines temporary broke down. It was opened, they found some of the tubes were burst. It meant stopping the engins & repair commenced. They plugged some of the tubes with wood & as he said it was nearly a matter of being towed into port by the Indarra it being terrible weather throughout.
