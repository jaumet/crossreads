<p>Sunday Oct. 20th<br/>Rained all night.  10 a.m. moved off to new position, went through St. Soufolet across the canal and railway, had to come back as we had gone too far.  Saw a lot of dead Fritzs and a batch of prisoners.  The line is blown up also the bridges.  Camped outside St. Soufolet.  Rained all day, mud and water everywhere.</p>
<p>Monday Oct. 21st<br/>Still raining.  After dinner gathered a bag of vegetables from the gardens near by (Turnips, carrots, celery, beet and thyme).</p>
<p>Tuesday Oct. 22nd<br/>Showery, mud everywhere.  Had a bonza bilious attack.</p>
<p>Wednesday Oct. 23rd<br/>Another attack opened on Fritz 1-30 a.m., the bombardment was very heavy, lasted four hours.  A glorious sunny day.  A lot of wounded came down the road.</p>
<p>Thursday Oct. 24th<br/>Another stunt after breakfast.  Another sunny day.  Got four letters from Aussie, one telling Dave had enlisted.</p>
<p>Friday Oct. 25th<br/>The 5th Div. Artillery went out for a spell.  Some of our chaps went and salvaged a quantity of german flour, soup, butter, jam and candles.  Fritz raided the village, blew a water cart to bits.</p>
<p>Saturday Oct. 26<br/>Fritz again shelled the village, got some direct hits on the station.</p>
<p>Sunday Oct. 27th<br/>Fritz shelled during the early morning.  Saw a good "box on" in the air, one plane came down.  Started raining before tea, rained all night.</p>
<p>Monday Oct. 28th<br/>Put some new piping on cooker.  I pinched it from some tommies.<br/>During the night had a visit from Fritz with his bombs, also shells.</p>
<p>Tuesday Oct. 29th<br/>A glorious day.  Great activity in the air, a Fritz plane had a go at one of our baloons but got knocked by the Anti's, he jumped out with a parachute and landed in our lines.<br/>P.M. Fritz was over dropping bombs, nine searchlights picked up four of them, Anti's and machine guns turned them back.</p>
<p>Wednesday Oct. 30th<br/>During the early hours Fritz shelled the town.  Another stunt opened on Fritz.  Fritz was over again with his bombs, the plane was brought down in flames, made a great firework display.  Great cheers by the crowd.</p>
