their Yashmaks, and their ankles fettered with silver. They are not only enchanting themselves, but they assist in producing that air of mystery which is the lure of the East.

Completed arrangements for departure and will leave by train 6.30 pm for Port Said.
Afternoon visited the Metal bazaar Cairo. I saw the whole process of Damascene work and also other styles of inlaying. Visited the stores of Hatoun and Coy in the Mousky, which is itself in a Museum of present day art. The intricate detail of the Meesharebeia and filigree is here seen at its best. I saw a wonderful bedstead, inlaid with mother of pearl flower designs, which cost 750. A masterpiece of skill and unlimited patience.
