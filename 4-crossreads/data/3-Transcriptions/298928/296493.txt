<p>fire corner, the camp we have just left, and the casualties were <br/>200.  What a lucky escape for us. <br/>Spent the afternoon in salvaging.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/>Out of 685 men who went into the trenches 83 answered roll call <br/>and 3 out of 16 officers.  <br/>The battalion's rations were sent into the lines but they were all <br/>fed out of one co's rations</p>
