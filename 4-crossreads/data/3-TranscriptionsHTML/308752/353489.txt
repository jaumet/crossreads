<p>It was a hard tussle getting him to the cars,  I can assure you. On returning to the Crater things were all anyhow,  one side of the crater had been blown in &amp; a great number of  wounded were lying about, also along the track were a number of dead.  Only 4 squad were stationed at the crater &amp; I found to my dismay that Les Townsend of B section had been slightly wounded leaving one man short in that squad. Another squad had not returned so you can imagine what an awful state things were in. However we carried on the best we could but of course we soon became dead beat so I reported back to the officer at the next post &amp; explained things to him. A great number of stretcher squads were sent down to the crater to carry on. Our squad was brought back to the tunnel dugout for a rest &amp; although the place was stinking etc. it was a treat to have a little est. the squad that I mentioned as missing happily turned up, they had carried a patient right through to the Dressing Station fully 3 miles away so of course you can guess how tired they were. The squad consisted of Tom Ross, Sullings Nesbit &amp; Calf. Peter Moore was slightly wounded during the night. I have mentioned him previously.  These men who received slight wounds are exceptionally lucky to get away from this awful business. Our squad did gas picquet for the night in 2 &frac12; hour shifts. Whilst on my shift 4 tanks passed by towards the Line. If Fritz gave us hell during the day our Artillery gave him 10 times hell during the night. The bombardment of his lines was terrific,  I cannot make you form any idea of what is it like. Our troops made a successful advance &amp; hundreds of prisoners passed by our post. Crowds of wounded passed by our post. Crowds of wounded passed through our hands &amp; other Ambulance bearers were sent for to copy with the rush. Saw quite a number of amusing sights. One Australian soldier with a rifle &amp; bayonet over one shoulder, a  revolver in one hand &amp; a short bayonet in the other was swanking down in front of a batch of German Prisoners. A good picture for Bairnsfather. Another chap was guarding a German officer.  I think he was a Colonel, he sang out to us that it was "Peter &ndash; meaning Peter Hindenburg. About 4 p.m. the pleasant news was passed down the dugout that A Section squads were relieved.</p>
