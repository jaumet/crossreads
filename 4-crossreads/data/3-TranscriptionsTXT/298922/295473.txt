OUTPOST
In support at NAGILI, with the naked eye, 100s of Turkscan be seen grazing their horses & gathering in the Harvest. We have just sent a Squadron to set fire to it.
I told the wife she was wrong in going to LONDON for WAR work, plenty about Manchester. Laura only saw her twice in about 3 weeks. Rumoured we are going back a few miles soon for a spell. Some sea bathing would be good for Septic Sores. I am quite alright again now.
Will post this tonight. Thank you Mother dear for your long letters.
