  Wednesday  Friday 19th Jan. In morning after 3 hrs. wait for breakfast, I reported to S.M.O. he said that boat would not be in, so I asked for leave to Cairo which I got and after 7 hrs. train traveling I arrived there, after wash went straight to O'Raffs to tend my last farewell,  Gwen took me to the sisters to say good bye then home again I could hardly say good bye to these fine people but at 12 p.m. I tore myself away and missed Mrs. O'R who has been a mother to me.  Went to Anzac Hostel and left special instructions to call me in time for 7 a.m. train. 
 Saturday 20th Awoke and found it was three to seven, I had not been called pulling on my trousers I grabbed my clothes jumped into a waiting gharry and whilst galloping to stn. dressed, arrived there to see train leaving.  Full of chagrin I returned to Hostel and blew off my feelings.  At 10 a.m. a big crowd of returning men came down and we caught the train at eleven&percnt;  finally arriving at Tewfik at 5 p.m. where we embarked on the lovely old Euripides, commenced work immediately, unpacking drugs etc., busy till midnight.
