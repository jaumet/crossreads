<p>My Dear old Bet.</p>
<p>Many thanks for floral decorations &ndash; should have liked to be on Bellevue Hill at the time you mention, but as a matter of fact about that time I was billet hunting all alone in la Belle F., a great &amp; exceedingly pleasant country, very different to god-forsaken, filthy little Belgique, the land of my 'verdunkelung.'</p>
<p>France is a country, the French are a nation sufficiently broad minded not to use the word "foreigner". You are never a foreigner to them &ndash; only a stranger &amp; , as such, entitled to due (or undue) hospitality. The beer is bad &ndash; except when produced in central or southern districts, when it is excellent. The wine is bad &ndash; if you don't know what to ask for, when it is good beyond criticism. Also the cooking is sublime &amp; living cheap, as cheapness goes in war-time. Had fate given me another month I should certainly   <strike>hage</strike>   have grown fat in France, but Fate sent me up to Belgium &amp; Fritz had just written my name on a big H.E. so I return to Aust. for a rest before resuming the argument.</p>
