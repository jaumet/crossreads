 Friday 15 Sept. 1916 Bright &amp; sunny but cold : last night was extremely cold. During the morning was at Div. Gas School where part of the brigade was being fitted with the new respirators. Met the 2nd Div. Gas Officer, Capt. McNiven who used to be an evening student of one of my Geology classes. Finished by lunch time &amp; in the afternoon trotted round fixing up matters &amp; visited Poperinghe to have a bath, but had to come away unwashed.
