 3/6/16  Saturday 
 Reveille at 5 am. Major Moseley & 3 Doctors took us for a route march, we cursed them up hill & down dale, they took us across some awful heavy country for 3 hours or about 8 miles. six of our fellows fell out sick, we were all ringing wet with perspiration & completely knocked out after our march in yesterday - We had a swim in a little back water from the Canal, it was not too sweet, but it freshened us up.
