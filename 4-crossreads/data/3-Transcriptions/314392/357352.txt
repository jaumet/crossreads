<p>Gradually the Battalions gear is being conveyed to Bapaume. More stuff is to go tomorrow. We shall all be out there by Wednesday next. (today is Saturday)  I have not seen a daily paper for over a week so do not know what the outside world is doing. Some say that the betting is 5 to 1 on the war being finished by August. Gee! I hope it is true. Today has been miserable. It is now raining heavily. Hell What a life! Sutton is again in the DTs.<br/>April 1st Some fool we! Caught before &amp; hit the ground. More gear sent to Bapaume today. It will only be a matter of a couple of days before</p>
