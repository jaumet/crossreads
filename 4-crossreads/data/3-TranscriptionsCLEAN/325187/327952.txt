[Friday 28 July 1916]
The 7th L.H. ran into a bit of an ambush this morning & had some casualties the Turks keep pushing their outposts towards us in the night.Arrived back to Bivouac this morning & out again tonight.This is the day we expected Johnnie Turk to attack but he has not shown up yet.  I have classed my small Kit into what I can carry & what throw away & am already for eventualitiesScribbling these notes each day keep me in touch with you, little Mother & that far away dusty little town - I hope you are keeping well to meet me when I come home once more.
