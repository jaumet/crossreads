<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This England is a lovable place, a country of stories, for almost every town, many of the villages and even wayside cottages and crossroads have histories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It gives one quite a thrill when passing through a village to learn that Amesbury is really Almesbury of the &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; and that here Queen Guinevere sheltered when retiring from the court of King Arthur.&nbsp; Again when travelling cross country in a motor car we observe a large conical hill in three terraces, and hear that it is Old Sarum (Old Salisbury) fortified in prehis-toric times, used by Romans and Saxons, and is one of the famous &quot;Rotten Boroughs&quot; retaining very strangely, the right to send two members to Parliament (although quite uninhabited) that is of course until Reform Hill passed.&nbsp; Again at a place called Figheldean (pronounced Fielden) we found the Chestnut Tree and Forge quite incorrectly alleged to be the scene of Longfellow&#39;s &quot;Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree the Village Smithy Stands;&quot; and then the church where the Smith heard his daughter &quot;singing in the village choir.&quot;&nbsp; An interesting old place is this Church of Norman and Early English Architecture, with in the porch are two cross legged figures discovered in a field at Milston probably from the tombstone of some old time Warrior for they seem to represent Crusaders.</p>
