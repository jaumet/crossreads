The lake looked very enticing on this very hot day & we lost no time stripping and enjoying our first swim since we left Australia. The water of the lake is very salt and is connected with Suez Canal. Two warships lay at anchor & many small boats, Launches & Feluccas were on the lake. We returned back to camp about 5 O'clock after a very pleasant day.Sunday July 31 1On Duty all morning afternoon Cricket Match Knock Outs v. Dug Outs. Victory for K. Outs by 3 runs
