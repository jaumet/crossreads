<p>To enable our machines to co-operate with this force, the difficulty of petrol supplies had to be faced. This was overcome by despatching the Handly Page to UM ES SERAB with a 'cargo' consisting of 40 tins of aviation spirit, 8-25-lb. Coopers Bombs, several tins of oil, spare wheels and bomb racks for the Bristol Fighters and rations for six officers and four mechanics  for six days, together with their kits. The machine was flown by Capt. R.M. Smith M.C., D.F.C., who had with him General A.E. Borton, D.S.O. Lieut. E.A. Mustard, and two mechanics. The arrival of the Bristol Fighters had already caused considerable excitement amongst the Arabs; But when this aerial leviathan landed, they sang, danced, cheered and fired frequent volleys into the air from rifles and revolvers. The Handly Page returned to RANLEH the same afternoon, but the Bristol Fighters remained with Hedjaz  force for five days. While there, in addition to effacing aircraft, they made frequent attacks on enemy outposts along the Hedjaz Railway, bombed and machine-gunned parties engaged on repairing the demolitions effected by Col. Lawrence's force, and carried out a number of reconnaissances in co-operation with this force. Col. Lawrence intimated later that prior to the arrival of our machines the Arabs operating with him were on the verge of desertion owing to the frequent attacks being made upon them by enemy aircraft.  However, not only was the confidence of these natives restored by the work of our machines but it was the means of attracting all sorts of offers of assistance from the Druse tribes and other inhabitants of the Hills.</p>
<p>A large column of troops was attacked on the SHIBLEY-BEISAN Road on the 22nd. The whole column consisting of 3,000 or 4,000 troops scattered in wild confusion, but later it was reported to have reformed and to be marching back towards WADI FARRAH, headed by a large while flag. None of these troops escaped.</p>
<p>The following day attention was concentrated on movement East of JORDAN. It seemed that the enemy Armies here had at last awakened to the gravity of their position and preparations for a hasty exit from this sector seemed to be in progress. Our reconnaissance machines reported large columns of transport moving from ES SALT and the vicinity towards AMMAN, the aerodrome at AMMAN being dismantled, while there was considerable activity on the AMMAN-DERAA railway. The AMMAN station where there was considerable congestion was attacked with bombs and machine gun fire, and general panic resulted.  Similar attacks were made upon troops and transport on the ES SALT-AMMAN road where large quantities of transport was wrecked and a good deal were abandoned. During the day machines from this unit dropped 6,270-lbs of bombs and fired 15,500 rounds from machine guns.</p>
<p>On the night of the 23rd. DERAA station was bombed by the Handly Page: Pilots, Ca<br/>Capt. R.M. Smith MC, D.F.C. and Lieut, C.C. Cameron, Observers:- Lieuts. M.D. Lees and A.V. McCann. 16-112-15 bombs were dropped, several of which fell within effective range of the station buildings and railway lines.</p>
<p>When reconnoitring DERAA on the 23rd. Lieut. E.P. Kenny (pilot) and Lieut. L.W. Sutherland, MC., D.C.M. (observer) drove away an enemy two-seater down. Both the occupants of the enemy machine got out and ran away after landing, but one was hit and seemingly killed by a bullet from our machine.</p>
<p>The evacuation of AMMAN was in full progress on the 25th. During the previous night a large number of troops had departed Northward, and on the morning of the 25th were located by our reconnaissance machines at MAFRAN. There was a big concentration of troops, transport and rolling stock here, and it afforded a great target. It was vigorously attacked by our machines from which 4,480-Lbs. of explosives were dropped and 13,200 machine gun rounds fired. The troops scattered, and the line was blocked with the wreckage of rolling stock upon which our bombers had made 'direct hits'. Further trains arriving from the South loaded with troops and camels were held up by this obstruction, and they, in turn, were similarly attacked.</p>
<p>In the meantime our troops in the Western Sector had been pressing on. By the 25th the Port at HAIFA was in our hands, while the  Desert Mounted /corps was well on the way towards the sea of GALLILEE. By this</p>
