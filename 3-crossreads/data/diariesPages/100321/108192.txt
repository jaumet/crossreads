17/2/19 Cologne
To the Cologne Cathedral which strikes one as resembling Rouen's interior. Walked to the centre and the + cross arms are full of good glass. Some windows were taken out at air raid time. A verger showed me round the tomb of the Sanctuary. The pillars inside the aisles of the church are very fine. From the Dom Hotel the windows look right out on to the Cathedral. Met Davis and Courlette and with them dined afterwards walking round different shops. In one they told us that the mark is now only worth 43 pfennigs and consequently all prices have risen. Davis was pricing little objets d?art et deluxe and it is marvellous here as in Paris how these luxury shops can get a living. Went to an Eau de Cologne
