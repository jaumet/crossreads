  
 Duty in trenches at night (5pm till 9am next day) sleep in dug-out. April 22nd Easter Saturday quiet day in trenches, night duty 'College Green'. April 23 rd Easter Sunday proves a bad day for our boys. Germans fire 250 shells in 40 minutes on Australian lines- 4 killed and many wounded in our Dressing Station, indescribable sight of wounds only equalled by remarkable fortitude of our boys.
