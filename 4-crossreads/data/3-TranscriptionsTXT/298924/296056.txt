 Saturday 15 March 1919 Red Sea Today all ranks were put through a Steamer to disinfect for influenza, already 12 men are in Hospital with malarial relapses. Very hot and I am wondering how my little wife is getting on about 2 days behind in the Derbyshire. We should reach Sydney on the 16th April, it is doubtful if the boat calls at Melbourne. Vaccination beginning to tell so I must have needed it. My job on the Boat is to look after comforts &amp; to finish the War Diary, I have 2 years to do yet.
