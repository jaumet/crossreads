 Dear Dad, Only a P.C. this time. It is very late & I'll only have time before lights out. I am sorry about poor Tom Frizell. I hope you had a nice holiday. I hope to go away for 4 days at the end of the month. I will go to visit Jennie I think. I will be pleased to have the Photos of Home. It is great to have them now & again. I'll send Brenda's Photos to Auntie. The kid is very much like Ida. We have a cold snap during the last 3 days & was have had ice again. We don't mind though. We are used to any weather now. Norm. Kierle came over yesterday & we had a long chat & a walk about. I walked a lot of the way home with him. It was a freezing clear moonlight night. Lovely for a brisk walk. Now, Dad Dear, I must wind up. I have lots of letters to write but they'll have to wait till Sunday. I only write on Sunday now except to you & Cousin Marie. I'll just have time to get my Roll Called & be in bed by "lights out" Regards to all From your Loving Son Harry
