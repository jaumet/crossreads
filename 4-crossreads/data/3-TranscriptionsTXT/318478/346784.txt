The charm of writing with a black leaf as it was called, what time I earned my "living" (Why?) at the age of 121/2 years, is that one can review, next day, one's mistakes.  Rotten English but you will catch my idea.  Today or rather tonight - tomorrow to be accurate (0100 - 25/7/19) - I sit in quite a good room which is smelling of paint, it is true, but not my paint, thank goodness, with half a suit of pyjamas on my silly old weather beaten body, after having got rid of or having lost 4 charming guests, male, and one or two of 'em got away with sincere introductions to Chelsea.
In re Black Leaf, * I was about to rant or rave this morning about on the wonders of planes under certain effects scimming Cairo.
* Original lost & found - tissue mistaken for original of Duplicate book, explanations later.
