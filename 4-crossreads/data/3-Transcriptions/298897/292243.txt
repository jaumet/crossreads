<p>Wednesday 5th<br/>Still safe &amp; nearing Alexandria had a day of rest. &amp; also a tip top bath &amp; a clean change &amp; then washed things I took off.  A very pleasant voyage so far.  Am getting very keen about meeting Morris &amp; Will D.  It will be to me the event of the year.</p>
<p>Thursday 6th Jan &amp; Friday 7th<br/>Sighted Alexandria at daylight.  Sea rather rough so much so that we could not take the pilot aboard.  So after much manoeuvring we followed him in, followed in by the old "Southland."  The trip was very enjoyable, we have good quarters &amp; food.<br/>At first we anchored near the Entrance going alongside the wharf about 5.30 P.M.  By 7 P.M. we were aboard a train &amp; on our way.  Our destination turning out to be Tel El Kebir.  Cattle trucks together with ordinary 3rd class carriages were provided for us &amp; much amusement was caused by the men on the trucks bleating like sheep or cows.  We reached Tel el Kebir about 2 oclock A.M. &amp; then camped</p>
