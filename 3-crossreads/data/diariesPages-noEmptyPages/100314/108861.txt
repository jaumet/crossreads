15/2/18 Velinghem
soon after in a motor lorry. After an exciting match the purple and reds won by 2 goals. Great barracking. Returned for yet more tea with Bateman and returned to Velinghem just at dusk. The roads slippery with the renewed cold. At Bde.H.Q. they have a rotten smoky brazier that sends smut all over all. Tonight is paynight for the troops. We drink much tea ? we Australians. The French people take tea as a medicine using it to get thin so they say. In the Army it is bad taste to ring up between 6.30-8 pm. everyone then being at mess. Conversations recommence after the latter hour when people come back into their offices and ready to carry on with the War.
