 Monday Nov 11 Today about 5pm the news came through that Germany had thrown in the Towel. Needless to say there was wild excitement.The Batterys were firing, Torches &amp; Flares made the skie seem like day. The horses stampeded in our lines and it was some job to catch them. Everybody was happy for after 4 yrs of war Germany has at last been brought to her knees. Tuesday Nov 12 2ND Brigade sports today. There is very little to do now except enjoy yourself as well as possible under the conditions.
