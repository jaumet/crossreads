<p>aircraft battery came in for much satire &amp; will not cease fire so quickly another time.  Had a look at "Favreuil" village &amp; found it had been a pretty place containing a German cemetary with several hundred occupants amongst which was one Australian Capt. Pemberton.  Every cross had had the regiment &amp; date of death erased, the object being to suppress all information, so as not to assist our intelligence branch.  Had another casualty today, one of our Sgts, Sgt Vicars being killed whilst handing over to one of the 15th.  He was buried at 8 P.M. in "Beugnetie" close by.  Heavy shelling during the night, our barrage at 4 A.M. being particularly heavy, more Rain.<br/>Tuesday 15th May<br/>   Had a fair number of cases through the result of Fritz's attack in the morning.  From all accounts he suffered very heavily.  Orderly Sgt for the day with very few duties so ultimately found myself in the dressing tent.  Rain at night.  Spent a bad night with a sore ankle result</p>
