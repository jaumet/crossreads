  
 small parties down to the beach where we washed our clothes with sand & while they were drying we went in & out of the sea as we thought that by the time that the sun had gone down our clothes would be dry, a Gun called :Beachy Bill" used to send a shell now & again if there was a crowd on the beach, he must have got a good view as every now & again he would sent a shell over & of course he would be sure to get someone each time 
 & after about a week or so during which time we were kept at work each night in three reliefs digging more trenches down to where there was a well & where a lot of men had got killed while waiting their turn for water so a trench was dug to give the water carriers a better chance as the water supply on the Peninsular was bad & all the water had to be carried, half a Pint of water was each mans allowance each day for all purposes & some days we got a Pint! 
 Sickness broke out amongst the troops, Dysentery & malaria Fever was amongst us & the men were very weak & suffering constantly with Dysentry & about September 20th we were relieved & sent round to Popes Post round to the right not far from Quinns Post, Courtneys Post & Walkers Ridge which were all occupied by my brigade the 5th Brigade A.I.F. 
 About the end of September I began to feel queer & got a touch of Dysentry & was losing a lot of Blood & one one morning I stood up while we were at Popes Post & fell down again I could not stand & the doctor was brought & took my tempeture & I was 102"
