August, 1915Friday 27Col: Spencer Brown (Brown) offers me a job adjutant of all Light Horse Details in Egypt when I get well - This means not going back to Gallipoli - We hear rumours that the 7th Division is to be given a spell & withdrawn first chance. If this was certain I might take the other, as it means promotion for certain - I am to remain in bed yet another few days, so am not too fit yet - Lieut Henry left for home by "Euripedes" yesterday, his trouble weak knee, which I hear was bad when he enlisted - "entre-nous on dit avec froid pied"
