 24-6-16 Sat 24th Received a parcel from home today &amp; I [it?] could not have arrived at a more convenient time &amp; is quite a luxury after bully beef &amp; biscuits  I went to the canteen this morning &amp; managed to get a few tins of fruit &amp; half dozen lemons at 2d each so should live well for a day or two;  An order came through today asking for a report on the state of the men but do not know what the reply was, a good many have been going away weak &amp; sick, but practically all of us still have a kick left &amp; can carry on.  but we would be better for a months spell if it could be done at all. 
 Yesterday a party of Worcestershire Yeomanry went to Oghratina to bury the dead Tommies lying about there &amp; the officer in charge of the party recognised his own brother among the dead by a scarf round his neck with his name on it.
