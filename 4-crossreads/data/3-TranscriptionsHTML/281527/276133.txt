<p>17/2/18  Selles</p>
<p>Another clear sunny day, all the pools frozen and the ground ringing underfoot. Church parade in a field at 9.45 a good attendance The Band playing. The equipment was not cleaned to my satisfaction so I roused the Company Commanders before moving off. The Band played on its way back to the village and a number of civilians and a French soldier or two also followed &ndash; rather amusing. Between now and lunch I interviewed a number of different people. Lunched and then had a conference with the Band N.C.Os &ndash; musicians are as fickle &amp; hard to handle as women. The Band played a programme during the afternoon At 3.30 rode out with Sutherland to the neighbouring high moors</p>
