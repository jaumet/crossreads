<p>fillings and I am to go down tomorrow afternoon to have them fixed up. By all accounts I shall be here for at least two or three weeks, then I suppose it will be France again. There is a chance that I may get a staff appointment but I am not putting my faith on that just yet. There is no doubt that I have been very very lucky, all my old comrades of the battalion were killed or wounded at Bullecourt, a week after I left them, so you see, what I thought hard luck, might have happened for the best. Out of my company of Lewis Gunners I am the only surviving N.C.O. All the rest, 6 of them , were killed in action since I left.</p>
<p>I must sign off for tonight dear mother, will write again quite soon, Remember me to all old friends.<br/>Trusting that all of you are quite well.<br/>With best love to you and dad and all the rest<br/>Your loving son<br/>Gordon</p>
