<p>16-6-16<br/>Fri 16th<br/>Had plenty of work to keep me occupied during the last two miles going to Bir-El-Abd this morning as the line was cut in several places &amp; on the ground in others, but managed to get to Bir-El-Abd within 10 minutes after the arrival of the Regt to find the Turks had made themselves scarce again as usual;<br/>I connected the phone after cutting the wire again to the east of us &amp; sent a message through to Bde &amp; shortly after we received a message to come in;</p>
<p>On our way in we passed the 2nd Regt on its way out. We arrived back at Oghratina at midday, spelled our horses till 4.30 PM &amp; then came back to camp arriving here at 10 oclock as all the Sigs are about knocked up I have gone on duty till midnight  The last time we went out after the Turks they followed us back to within a few miles</p>
