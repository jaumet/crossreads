<p>Dear Man.</p>
<p>I got yr kind letter and the enclosure about poor Arthur's death. It interested me greatly &ndash; I think I know who wrote it &ndash; would to God he had seen Arthur for he is a bold and skilful Surgeon. I was very interested in the doings of yr sons. I repeat to myself often the thought "Thank God we have no cause to blush for one beloved" &ndash; Robert arrived in England on Sunday night &ndash; He seems fairly well except that he has Jaundice &ndash; an embarrassing adornment to a bridegroom for we are marrying him to Stephanie Barton tomorrow! &ndash;<br/>Latimer Jackson who married Judy and me all these centuries ago is to marry the son of that former marriage &ndash; It is not often that this can happen -</p>
