<p>generally 5 or 6 women &amp; a dozen kids riding on a little donkey cart these seem the <strike>most</strike> least concerned of the whole lot, for I don't suppose it matters much to them, whether their lord &amp; master is alive or dead, they have a dogs life, at the best of times  I have seen more than once a cow donkey, or camel, yoked with a woman to the plough, while the husband walks behind.<br/>If they are going to town &amp; they have one donkey only it is the woman who walks, that is one of the weak points of Islam, the way they treat their women, it nearly got a lot of us into trouble several times, for it seems so funny to us</p>
