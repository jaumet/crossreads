About 40 patients being admitted this morning. Received letters from home, Iris & Miss Montague. Several cases of small pox about. Will have to undergo vaccination again. Would like to get out of A.M.C. into an active Unit – either engineers or artillery, but we are not allowed to change unfortunately. Mrs Hindmarsh and a Mrs Connor were out today. I saw them for about an hour.

Did practically nothing today. We started our leave into Cairo again today. I also wrote 8 pages ready to send home. Sent 9 films into Cairo by Otto Peters. They are trying to make us into a swank unit again but any of us who have been on Anzac don’t trouble much. Our uniforms are nearly worn out and they won’t give us new ones. Going to pictures again tonight.

Have been doing nothing much this morning. Sent letters home by man going to Australia. Heard of vacancies in details of 4th Division Artillery and as Crop & I went to see if we can get in. Will know in a day or so. I only hope we can get it. We are beginning to get fairly comfortable now. Mess sheds to have our meals in, shower baths picture show and canteens very handy. I understand our pay is being reduced to 1/-per day as we will probably be going to France and it will bring all soldiers on a similar footing.
