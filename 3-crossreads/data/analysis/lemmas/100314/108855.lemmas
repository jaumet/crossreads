 11/2/18 Velinghem Rode back through Lottinghen expect to see Colonel Jame but he was out . Reach Bde .H.Q . after 3.30 and found a fair amount of routin stuff there . A ride like today over love peac countri without troop at all is an enjoy prepar for the real thing . It onli want a littl imagin from one who know to pictur the whine of shell and whiz of bullet over the scene and the aftermath of stink corps and live pain . War is becom scientif murder as soft flesh and blood have no chanc against hard steel . All the hedg hereabout are commenc to bud and on the tree are all the littl green nodul of earli Spring
