<p>gaurd on to stop us from giving them water.   <strike>indecipherable</strike>  The aeroplane that was brought down on Saturday night was a Super-Gotha with 5 engines. It carried a crew of 7 and a heavy load of Bombs.</p>
<p>In our offensive which started on the 8th &amp; is still going on the 3rd Corps were held up and the A.I.F. had to send the 4th Bgde &amp; later the 4th Div. to assist them. I believe they also had the assistance of some Yanks. Anyway the Aussies went ahead like Wildfire untill the failure of the 3rd Corps on their left made it necessary for them to wait and as mentioned above send assistance. General Buckley of the 3rd Corps has been Relieved by General Godley.</p>
