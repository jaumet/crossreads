<p>Our formation was again attacked by enemy scouts who were aided by the presence of broken clouds. Two of the machines failed to return, one of which was from 1st Squadron, Lieut. J.D.S. Potts (pilot) and Lieut. V.J. Parkinson (Observer). The first machine &ndash; a R.E.S. from No. 14 Squadron R.A.F. and flown by Capt. Hewitt M.C.  was attacked by an Albatross Scout. It went into a spin, and in coming down collided with Lieut. Pott's machine, carrying away part of the extension of the port wing. In the crash that followed, Lieut. Potts was killed instantly, and his Observer Lieut. V.J. Parkinson, severely injured. A day or two later a message was dropped by hostile aircraft, furnishing information to the effect that Lieut. Parkinson was in hospital progressing well, a photograph of the grave of Lieut. Potts was enclosed showing a blade of the propeller of his machine affixed across the headstone. Lieut. Parkinson was repatriated after the signing of the Armistice.</p>
<p>The first close reconnaissance of the AMMAN-KISSIR area was made on January 3rd., when some hundreds of rolling stock, and a considerable force of cavalry and infantry were observed. The railway stations at AFULE, JENIN, MESSUDIEH and TULKEERAH also were closely watched and here too a good deal of activity was noticed. Each of these centres received attention from our bombing machines in turn. On January 10th a formation led by Capt. S.W. Addison, raided the AMMAN and KISSIR stations and several direct hits were obtained on station buildings and rolling stock. Other Officers who took part in this enterprise were :-<br/>Pilots:-    Lieutenants R.A. Austin, E.L. Spragg, F. Haig, L.W. Taplin, L.W. Rogers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A.J. Morgan and A.A. Poole.<br/>Observers:-   Lieutenants O.M. Lee and C.J. Vyner.</p>
<p>On the 19th January the railway station and numerous dumps at MESSUDIEH were bombed by a formation led by Capt. R.M. Smith with whom Lieuts. L.B. Carson, E.L. Spragg, L.W. Rogers, A.R. Brown, E.P. Kenny, G.C. Peters and A.A. Poole (Pilots) and Lieuts. E.A. Mustard, G. Finlay and C.J. Vyner (Observers).</p>
<p>The same target was re-visited on the 20th and again on the 22nd.</p>
<p>On the 25th January Lieutenants L.B. Garson, F. Haig, E.L. Spragg, A.V. Tonkin, A.J. Morgan and P.J. Sims, Bombed enemy horse lines at HUWARAN and caused a stampede.</p>
<p>Numerous other objectives received attention from our 'bombers' who usually operated in formations of six with an escort. These targets included camps at KUTRANI on the Hedjaz Railway on the 12th and 13th., camps and dumps at SHUNET NIERIN on the 20th; and billets and troops at KERAK on the 25th. At the last mentioned place, which is situated about 15 miles East of the DEAD SEA, it was learnt, a considerable number of Turkish cavalrymen were billetted in the ancient citadel at the South Eastern corner of the town. This was selected as the Primary objective, and Lieut. Haig obtained a direct hit on the building with a 112-lb. bomb. A considerable number of troops were seen to rush out of the building from numerous exits into a big open square adjoining, only to run into a shower of smaller bombs (25 lb) dropped from other machines that were hovering overhead.</p>
<p>Aerial Photographs disclosed that a spacious pagoda which ornamented the centre of the ancient structure before the raid entirely disappeared after this bomb had found its mark. It was learnt subsequently from secret agents, that the enemy suffered heavy casualties on this occasion.</p>
<p>These raids were carried out by the following &ndash; Pilots:- Capt. S.W. Addison, Capt. R.M. Smith, M.C. Lieutenants R.A. Austin, A.V. Tonkin, C.N. Watt, A.R. Brown, C.C. Peters, C. le B.

During the 59 days ending 28th of February, a total of 68 strategical reconnaissances were carried out &ndash; 40 of which were in January and 28 in February. During the latter month flying was possible on 19 days only, owing to frequent severe tropical storms, while observation from the air was often rendered extremely difficulty by the presence of</p>
