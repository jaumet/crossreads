Friday 26 January 1917
Just handled 2 Turkswho took gave themselves up - I lifted the Cap of one & found he was simply crawling, one man may be lousy, but not like those fellows. They say at Saliel about 25 miles on there are 3000 Turks, 4 Guns & 23 machine guns & no wire entanglements so its not a bad job ahead.
Jim Ayre is in my tent doing the Cash Books. Re LICE - The DELOUSING machines we have are German ones captured from the Turksat Magdaba, so they know the curse in spreading disease. Glad to hear Charlie Tyson has the Military Cross Medal. Must write him.
