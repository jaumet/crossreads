<p>Monday 25th April</p>
<p>Anzac Day<br/>Went to the Anzac Hostel for the memorial service which commenced at 9 a.m.<br/>A beautiful ceremony.<br/>The noble feeling displayed by all there especially in the messages sent in response to cables, contrasted very forcibly in my mind with the attitude of the married men in the old country.<br/>Chopin's beautiful "Marche Funebre" (1st movement) was played at the commencement &amp; followed by the dead march in Saul.<br/>Then all sang a verse of "God Save The King".</p>
