<p>20.1.16<br/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I was delighted with your kind letter &amp; in return will try &amp; interest you for a few minutes.</p>
<p>I am at present at Tel el Kebir with 1st Div F.A. training &amp; working so that our next enemy will find us a tougher problem than the last. The Camp is very quiet, far removed from any town Cairo about 80 miles is the nearest.</p>
