<p>(45)<br/>r.a.p., Prowse Point. This was the most dangerous post of all and while here our infantry raided the enemy trenches, and our trenches including our own "possy" were properly strafed by the enemy guns. Also we had to work hard all one night pushing trucks up and down the line. One day we saw a 42 inch shell strike the crest of the ridge about &frac14; of a mile away and ricochet upon the rocks which caused it to come in our direction and lodge almost at our feet. Needless to say it was a "dud" and it had not been there more than 10 minutes before someone shouldered it and was walking off with it till stopped by an officer going into the line .</p>
<p>On the last day of my four days here I was obliged to report sick with influenza and was sent on 16 April 17 by Major Horiman into the mds as a patient. Here in Pont de Nieppe I spent a quiet six days in bed, that is , on a stretcher set on trestles and was well looked after and soon cured. While there I was glad to receive some parcels from home and do some letter writing.</p>
