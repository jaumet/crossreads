<p>a heap &amp; only a small door for entering them, which is the only ventilation for the house. The huts are very small, the roofs being covered with corn stalks &amp; palm branches, whist the house is composed of mud.  Donkeys, goats, fowls &amp; dogs make their home inside these huts with the inhabitants &amp; the places are reeking with dirt; yet they make no attempt to keep the animals out.  A few palm leaf mats, water vessels &amp; crude working utensils comprise the furniture &amp; effects, but they seem to live very happy in these circumstances.  The upper class live in luxury, occupying well appointed dwellings &amp; treat visitors to the best obtainable.  Each village has its sheik or Omdah, who acts as governor of the place, but invariably they rob &amp; sweat the poorer class to death &amp; the word of the Omdah is law.</p>
<p>A few of us were invited to a land-owners home for dinner &amp; there had the finest meal I ever had in this country.  The places for the guests were marked by small flat loaves of bread &amp; dishes of salad, but before sitting down, each person washes the  hands &amp; mouth basin, which was brought in by a servant &amp; kept solely for that purpose.  The first course was soup, for which a spoon was provided, each person dipping into the same bowl, which was in the centre of a small round table.  This over, fish &amp; pigeons were brought in &amp; we waited in vain for knives &amp; forks &amp; plates. Our host gave us the lead by picking up the food from the dish with his fingers, so of course we did likewise, &amp; made the best of a bad job.  He would pick out choice portions</p>
