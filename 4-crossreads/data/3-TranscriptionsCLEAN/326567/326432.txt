At 10 a.m. a large number of Machine Gun Troops with a Brass Band & 60 Coy of the A.R.O.D. marched into Camp in dirty weather, raining on & off all day. All hands gave 60 Coy a cheer on their arrival & after they were allotted their Tents they were dismissed & soon both Corps were together again relating their trip to each other.   Wednesday.16/5/17. After Breakfast we were paraded for a Route March through the Town. At 10.30 a.m. the Bugle sounded & we formed up in our Platoons & marched out of Camp & followed the Train Route down the Hill on the way down we were further charmed at the beautiful scenery & private Residences as we passed the Casino a very large building some one Cooed & several Nurses came out & cheered us they were Australians & the Casio was being used as a Hospital, we noticed a few of our Lads walking about, as the streets were very narrow & not to clean & the Roads very rough we soon began to feel tired.
