being sent from the Base. Now I will have to advise the Base P.O. of my whereabouts as then perhaps some of my letters will be sent across. The Parcels never arrived and I do not expect to see them now. I think that it would be best not to send any. I can get all sorts of little things over here. up near the line we have a small canteen for each Batt. So anyone who wants buscuits of sweets can purchase them there also Tobacco, etc. Pencils "Indelible" are hard to get at times but I have allways managed to keep one. I had it ever since Pozieres and only lost it in 47 Gen Hos. I lent it to one of the Canadian Sisters and never saw it again. However as soon as I arrived here I was able to purchase a fresh one.
