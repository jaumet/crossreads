 Friday 18 February, 1916 
 Had two trips over to the right half of the 20 th  Batt for another gun &amp; tripod, we saw some fine desert scenery&nbsp;round Australia Hill. 
 In the evening we moved camp &amp; I was put in a different tent to Mac &amp; Bernie, it feels strange being away from them. 
 Two of our chaps, &quot;Sis&quot;&nbsp;Ellis &amp; Bingham had a fight, Bingham won. It is the first fight we have had in the M.G.S.
