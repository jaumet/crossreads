<p>stamp upon it &amp; dated 6th April, contains sentence Sir Francis Suttor died on the 4th of April. And now I notice that your other letters are dated 6th April.  I shall read them next. Sir Francis has worked hard for his Native land.  He deserved well of N. S. Wales, and filled the presidents chair in the Council with dignity and satisfaction R.I.P. I must write to Lady Suttor.</p>
<p>A letter from Ted, &amp; one from Rene Silk. Nice of her to write. My love to her if you see her.<br/>One from Col. Fallon, all about Military matters and the drought.</p>
<p>Tabbie dear:/ Yours of April 6th opened.  The rain was the best that could come to N.S. Wales and Australia. Col. Fallon wrote that the drought conditions were of the very worst.   Let me hope that there will be no more dry spells for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Mrs Franki &amp; Kitty were brave to chance the rain, I hope that neither got wet.</p>
<p>I must write to M. Chayet again at an early date. I thought that you had all the powers necessary for selling land in the power of attorney.  A nuisance, I shall have it rectified.<br/>Dr. Shubers Chalet is his summer house on the dessert, to it he comes from Cairo to breath the fresh air and take afternoon tea with his friends, and sometimes dinner.</p>
<p>I have not met Harry Stokes the friend to Doris.  It has not been possible for me to move about freely, after tomorrow I shall be able to do so in comfort as the danger to my reputation will</p>
