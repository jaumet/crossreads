<p>I hope the war ends soon &ndash; all those jolly old days come again but I'm very afraid that things never will be quite the same.</p>
<p>Well as you will see I'm as blue as the sea so I had better stop.</p>
<p>Things are just as lively &amp; exciting here every night especially so.</p>
<p>The weather is beautiful again quite hot &amp; bright but frantically dusty.  Better than the mud.  I still trail round the country a bit but with so much traffic &amp; the dusty roads &amp; heat it isn't very joyful.</p>
<p>Tansey is or was well when I last heard but two or three of my pals about here have gone West just lately.</p>
<p>I do hope things are better with you &amp; that my letters in future will arrive better.</p>
<p>Love to Graham, Mac &amp; the Boss &amp; very much of the best for yourself.</p>
<p>Always yours as ever<br/>Jim Wilks</p>
