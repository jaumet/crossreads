<p>My Dear Mother.</p>
<p>I now take liberty to send you some news as regards myself &amp; the rest of the Australian forces. After leaving Colombo as I mentioned in my last letter I was taken ill with pluresy &amp; Infleunza &amp; was sent to Hospital for a week &amp; two days &amp; had a very bad time my temperature was very high being 106.4 &amp; my pulse being very low. Say Mum I fought a great battle &amp; won I can tell you truly that quite a lot of things of the past came before me &amp; also my thoughts we also of those I left behind. I think Mum dear that it does a chap to have some sickness like that to tune him up &amp; let him realise where he is.<br/>Well dear Mum just before reaching I was out of bed &amp; in the convalesent ward &amp; enjoyed the welcome rays of the sun &amp; of the surroundings. We reached Aden the day after I left Hospital &amp; I can say that the scenery round about there</p>
