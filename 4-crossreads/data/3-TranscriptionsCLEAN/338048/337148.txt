Saturday 7thFooled about on cable wagons until tired of it when we did washing.
Leave obtained in evening afternoon & went with Ernie Pynor to Salisbury catching a car from Amesbury. On the way in we passed a big mound called Old Sarum where excavations have taken place to see what can be discovered of the old cathedral built in very early Norman days prior to the transfer of the district cathedral to Salisbury.
On reaching the city we wended our way to the Cathedral entering through the gateway through the wall which surrounds the place. A beautiful lawn which I understood was once a graveyard surrounds the cathedral and a plan of all the graves is still, I understand, preserved so that any corpse can be located. The We just got inside the place when a service started & we had to see it through standing a great part of the time and listening to the meaningless chanting etc which appeals to one as farcial. Just after a service one of the choir men showed us around explaining it all.
After that we walked about & arrived at the Town Council Chambers where a light tea was obtained at a reasonable cost. These council chambers are used as a sort of tea room for soldiers each Saturday & Sunday, young ladies waiting, & an orchestra in attendance. After tea we went to a show & saw pictures of the review of Australians by the King. We had just come away from the fairly enjoyable entertainment when we struck a [indecipherable] off to Lark Hill so we caught it & got home about 9-45 p.m.
