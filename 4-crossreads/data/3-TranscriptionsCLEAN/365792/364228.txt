  
 May 24 Up late as usual. Visiting day today, & the weather is tip top. Was perched up on the barbed wire fence t'other night yarning to the people outside & listening to the band when a Tommy Officer ordered me down. Am afraid I hastened slowly, but then Tommy officers are enough to give a fellow the pip. Aunt & another lady came to see me this afternoon & brought sundry bunches of flowers which the Matron straightaway took possession off. We sat on the Lawn in a nice shady spot & yarned for an hour or so until the whistle sounded Rec'd letters from Ethel & Uncle Jim. [in margin] (Mill) 
 25 Rather cool with a little wind & rain. 2 more letters from Sue & Uncle Jim. Did a bit of brass & floor polishing & feel better for the exercise. Just been watching the LSWR trains rattle past. There are electrics & ordinaries running [in margin] R, AD
