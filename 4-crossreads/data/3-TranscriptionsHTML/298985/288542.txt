<p>side. It came on to rain after dark so got into a dugout with 2 other chaps  Just enough room. The Division was relieved today so we moved back about 12 oclock.  Camped in a good place about &frac12; a mile from out old camp near Hamil. Corbie is not far off  Our Officer let us get on some empty Lorries about &frac12; way This annoyed the Major &amp; he made us stand to while the other Platoons got the pick of the places &amp; stuff for dug outs. Morison &amp; I went to our old camp &amp; salvaged iron &amp; timber &amp; now have a very good little home with plenty of straw on the floor. It is very quiet back here away from the guns A little shooting at planes at night is all we hear</p>
