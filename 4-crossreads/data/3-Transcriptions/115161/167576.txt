<p>convey us to our first stopping place. However at about eleven .p.m. after wandering about in the rain and mud for many hours, we board a train. We still have to wait a long time before the engine driver feels disposed to put the locomotive in action.</p>
<p>We stayed in the train for about two days, during which time we remained stationary mostly, and moved forward sometimes. We bought bread and wine from the peasantry on our journey, a funny lot they were. (the peasantry, I mean) I fancy they bake their bread by the yard, so long and narrow were the loaves, and nearly all crust. The wine they sold at high prices, was really not fit to drink, but as it was the only stuff we could get, we managed to swallow it, and did not suffer any evil effects therefrom.</p>

<p>Here is militarism with a vengeance, huts and tents, soldiers and officers (note the distinction). By soldiers I mean the genuine digger, the chap who bears the brunt of the fighting, puts up with all the hard-ships imaginable, gets poor tucker, but does the job he sets out to do, and does it well. He growls &#39;tis true, but you never find a true digger shirk any dirty work that falls to his lot, he does it, does it quickly. He never tries to palm it off on some other chap, not he, it&#39;s not his nature. He&#39;ll often help another fellow, but never shirk his own job. An officer is not necessarily a soldier. He&#39;s a good fellow very often, and a good leader sometimes (when he does lead). Brave to a degree in some cases. A staff officer (who had never been to the front) told me once that officers were not necessarily soldiers, I replied, that I was quite aware of that fact, but that I&nbsp;was pleased to say that I&nbsp;had met quite a number who appeared to be gentlemen. He was a man (with apologies) who considered himself far above the ordinary soldier, and felt it was infra. dig. to be seen in converse</p>
