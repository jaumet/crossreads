  
 Wednesday 2nd May Had half holiday in return for working (?) last Wednesday.  Hired cycle for afternoon & starting at 12.30 p.m. for Bournemouth, reached there, after a splendid ride, at 2 pm Found Aunt had moved from Lincoln Avenue to Orcheston Rd, near Em's. Aunt was astonished to see me, & so was Bert, who by good luck, I found at home. Em amp; [indecipherable] her husband (who is the Sec of the Chamber of Trade) were both in & so was Rachel.
