for they had the mail openedI should like to have a look at Amiens it is very close to here, you can see the Catherdal quite plainly, she looks a fine big town & there are electric lights & trams in her.Any amount of aeroplanes about here they are nearly as common as motors.  Had a good close look at one of our battleplanes yesterday, they are fine big 'planes, there is an aerodrome right close to us.Went for a stroll last night with Don Fraser & Charlie Tonkin, the roads & lanes are beautiful around here & a pleasure to ramble about in lovely flowers & creepers everywhere.  I saw the tallest peas I ever saw in my life the other day, they were easily 15 feet high, they were on sticks
