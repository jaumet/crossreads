<p>the Advanced Dressing Station before dark &amp; enjoyed a good hot meal. Enjoyed some excellent cocoa, our first hot drink for 48 hours.</p>
<p>30th October.<br/>Woke up feeling very crook, &amp; I don't wonder at it.   Reported to my esteemed friend &amp; asked for a days rest. He was very sarcastic, but I managed to have two days rest &amp; feel every so much better. A great number of our men have been sent away sick, it is no wonder as we have all been wet through on numerous occasions. On Thursday 2nd November I felt a great deal better &amp; proceeded once again to the strafe. Raining heavily all day, my pal in my dug-out had a narrow escape, a piece of shrapnel dented in his steel helmet. Twelve months to day since I left Melbourne for Sydney. I little thought then that a year later I would be stretcher bearing on the greatest battlefield in the world. The mud was worse than ever, we felt done up before we reached our posts. Twelve days without a wash or shave, or change of clothes. "What a life". The poor beggars in the infantry I do pity them, before they reach the front line they are done up, it is very severe trudging through the mud. I was speaking to a young fellow who had done 24 hours in the firing line, on a biscuit &amp; a half &amp; only a little water. How can men fight on an empty stomach. 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. 120 walking patients passed through our hands to the Advanced Dressing Station, it is getting worse every day. Very cold at our post during the night, I was prepared &amp; collared a few blankets. Rumours about, that we will shortly be relieved, it will be a God send, we are all sick of this mud &amp; rain. About midnight our squad was called out to carry a patient to the Dressing Station,</p>
