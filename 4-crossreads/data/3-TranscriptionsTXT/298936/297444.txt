 October 1915 
 Friday 15 Artillery Lane Station. 
 Very good day indeed but during the afternoon news received that a general attack will be made at 4 oclock in the morning mainly on the left. They say that a disparate attempt will be made to get right through this time. Stormy times ahead. I sincerely hope &amp; pray that it will be successful if that is what is intended.
