<p>for abt. three weeks. Address to me still as before &ndash;</p>
<p>379 PTE H.W.P&hellip;.(abroad)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4/9th  MG.C<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attached 3rd. Div. M.G.C.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AIF  Abroad.<br/>The reason for this is that so far my number is not altered. When I get a new number I will cable it &ndash; you can then cut out the 4th/9th part of the address. Savvy? I think its pretty safe to address direct to me that way after you get this letter as I will get them quicker than if sent care of Hortons. Signallers in the M.G.C. handle the Co's mail &amp; , naturally, look after their share of it!</p>
<p>Must shut off the switch&hellip;<br/>Love from Harry.</p>
