<p>25th [August 1918]<br/>Fritz bombed the aerodrome last night.  It was a lovely display.  Enough to put the wind up anybody.  The Concert Hangar was nearly full of Soldiers.  The second Bomb hit the Hangar second next to the one in which the concert was being held causing some casualties in the crowd.  Smedley told me he could see the red hot shrapnel flying through the sides of the shed, this Bomb also destroyed 3 Planes &amp; set fire to the wreckage.  The Flames lit up the place brightly enabling the Fitz planes to score some good hits.  Smedley dived into an 18" gutter.  While there he noticed another chap being head on to him.  Smed tapped him on the head saying are you hurt mate.  The other chap answered "No" &amp; almost in the same breath gave a screech &amp; putting his hand to his "rear" bolted for his life.  About 20 Heavy bombs were dropped altogether with the result that the 48th Squad R.A.F. was practically wiped out.  This aerodrome is only a Kilo from the Dump.  I made quite sure from where I was</p>
