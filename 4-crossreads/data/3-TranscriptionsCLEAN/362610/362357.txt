  
 Sunday 21 May 1916 A summer's day, the heat being rather trying & the little stream near the camp was very well patronised by hundreds of the men bathing. Church Parade in the morning was taken by the Presbyterian padre who preached on "Hobab the Midianite"; a very helpful service. Did some writing during the day & in the afternoon went up to the hospital & looked up a few of my old men. A glorious evening & warm night.
