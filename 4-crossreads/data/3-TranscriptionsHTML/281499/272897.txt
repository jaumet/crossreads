<p>3rd.  Well we did not go to the trenches after all last night, but I think we shall be after the Huns early tomorrow morning, it did not rain last night only a very heavy dew &amp; by Jove it was cold none of us got hardly a wink of sleep our feet trouble us so, where I have been sleeping since we came into these trenches is a little nook cut out of the wet ground &amp; it is about 3 ft wide &amp; 4 long, on this ledge 3 of us doss, with our legs hanging out in the cold wet trench, so you can imagine what a rosy time we are having but still there is no grumbling all take it in good spirit, although it is a soldier's privilege to growl, &amp; at times some of them exercise their right to the utmost, we have had a good fire going all the morning we go over into Flers village whenever we want wood there is plenty of it there, the remains of the houses &amp; etc.</p>
