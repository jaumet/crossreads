<p>Pension Wales.<br/>Sharia-el-Manakh<br/>Cairo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday March 8th 1916.<br/>My very dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>There has been a long spell between the mails from you this time &amp; I am watching every day now for letters.  I was so glad when I got back to Alexandria on my expedition to get the rest of my clothes to find a letter from Mother waiting for me and one from Jobber in French.  While I was in Alex I went to the Post Office &amp; gave them the addresses to which letters had been coming for me and they gave me a form to fill in which ensures them all being re-directed straight from the Post office here.  The local mails like that are often a shocking time in being delivered though, for instance last Monday week Rid wrote to me direct here and it did not reach me till the following Thursday and he only three hours or less away, by train.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am gradually settling down in Cairo now though have not taken up any special work yet on purpose because I have been seeing quite a lot of Wal at different times &amp; also because we decided a little spell would do me good now as the summer is coming on.  I think I shall not be able to get hospital work like I had in Alexandria because there is very little of it to do here now that our troops are inactive and we are now having casualties like those of the Dardanelles.  But there is likely to be work in connection with the T.U. or Y.W.CA &amp; those sort of institutions.  The three of us have talked about my future and Wal &amp; Rid both thought it would be a mistake to return to Australia yet, but that it would be better to just wait a little</p>
