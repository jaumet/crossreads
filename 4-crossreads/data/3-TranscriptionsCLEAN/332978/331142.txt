 Septr 20th Had shower (cold) Wrote letter to Uncle Arthur Mother & a PC to Capt Davis, enclosing Photos - Played Bridge - Discussion tonight, as to what sort of an army shall we have after the war, opened by Lt Col Tollemache. 
 Septr 21st Saw "life" today for first time since being at Freiburg - The adjutant has been untiring in his efforts to secure we invalid officers bath chairs so as to enable us to go out on walks - 
 He has at last been successful & my first outing this mng was simply magnificent - I had numerous offers from officers to push me. The scenery is really splendid, best I have seen, we have nothing to equal it in Australia - 
 Needless to say, we were looked upon as novelties by the populas - we left camp at 8 am - had a bath in the public baths & then proceeded on our walk returning to camp at noon - 
 Was weighed today - weighing 13.7 stone - no parcels yesterday or today -
