 you can get ani amount of them , but I expect this state of affair wo n't last long . 29th . On the same job again today onli the parti are all split up . We had a few anxious moment last night old Fritz drop heavi shell all round us the clod fell like rain on our slender littl humpi , we were expect everi shell to land right on us , but they knock off in time . A man would be dead stiff to stop a shell right back here , but you never know when one will blot you out for he drop them at random day night they are like to catch some one . It rain a fair bit last night melt all the frozen ground , the consequ is , that today everyth is soft muck onc more , King mud reign suprem .
