<p>Sunday 24 Sept. 1916<br/>Foggy early but otherwise a perfect day. A combined Church Parade was held in the morning on the Gas School grounds attended by the whole brigade. The service was taken by Padre McKenzie, General Birdwood, General Walker &amp; their staffs, &amp; Mr. Andrew Fisher being present. At the conclusion ribbons &amp; a few medals were presented by General Birdwood who made a very characteristic speech to his "boys". The 3rd Bn. band was present &amp; it was fine to hear the old hymns played by the band. Most of the remainder of the day I spent letter writing as the Aust. mail closed in the afternoon. A fair-sized home mail in also.</p>
