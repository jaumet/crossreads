<p>235  Oct. 11<br/>Lawson"s<br/>"And I am very sad tonight,<br/>Because of many things."</p>
<p>About sums up tonight"s feelings.  J. is a bloody fool, and so consciously so.  Seeing through C. as he does and knowing him from previous experiences, he"s a fool to play with such dirty fire.  Clear gambling &ndash; the only thing he"s capable of I don"t mind, but when he"ll gamble with such an utter &hellip;  Anyhow I managed to stop it tonight with he holding somewhere about &pound;5.7.6 so that"s one satisfaction.</p>
<p>236<br/>How far will M. go? but the exaggeratedly maternal (?) ground we"re on is in itself a barrier.  Thank the Lord G-s gone:  she reminds me of one of de Maupassant"s yarns &ndash; a girl in a barge of 7 or 8 men:  her case is similar:  half a day dangling, each of us in a turn &ndash; and then the sickly sentiment clouded over a most unsentimental happening.  That"s where she differs from de Maupassant"s heroine:  she"d have shrugged her shoulders, laughed, "La via" and forgotten in new loves.</p>
<p>237<br/>Bowled King into the tent this morning in a hellish mood:  snarled silence till he gets into bed, then:-  "What"s the lowest type of civilised humanity known?"  I dropped to the cause:  Jake didn"t, and gave out &ndash; "The Aborigine!"  King &ndash; ex [indecipherable] &ndash; "No! the C.C. bloody Tommy!" &ndash; 'here"s an example &ndash; I gave a chap a cup of tea, told him what it was, and he asked me what he"d do with it."  I told 'im to bath in it."</p>
<p>238<br/>Symons Tragedies.  'The Death of Agrippina".  The inevitable subject &ndash; Nero"s murder of his Mother, continually through the whole of its one act, closely follows Macbeth &ndash; the schrieking hellish night of Macbeth"s murder of Duncan and this becomes in its way, the Feast of Athena &ndash; Agrippina.</p>
<p>Ah<br/>Now I hear voices and a song:<br/>"Goddess of Mercy", that is not her office,<br/>What are they singing.</p>
<p>Acmonia<br/>It is of Orestes,<br/>Because Athena freed him from his guilt at Athens, when the furies followed him.</p>
<p>Agrippina<br/>They followed him because he killed his mother.  Then could Athena free him from his guilt, who could not free remembrances?  A wild song &hellip;.</p>
<p>Nero<br/>I will not let you go.<br/>The moment the atmosphere became changed with the song of Orestes, Nero hesitates &hellip; and is kept to his object by Poppaea.  Right to the murder Macbeth has mainly been well used.  The play finishes well and is a fine little piece of tragic portrayal.</p>
<p>239<br/>Wrote tonight to Betty forwarding Jake"s sister"s challenge for an 'Apres la Guerre" swimming championship &ndash; at Moonta or Bondi, S. Aus. or N. South.</p>

<p>241<br/>To finish the page,<br/>In "Death of Agrippina",<br/>Why does the King stand looking after her as if he did not see her, and as if he could see nothing else?</p>
