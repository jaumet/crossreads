Robert is stay behind as Order Serg . and " Thoma " came in charg of our parti . It pour with rain on our way out and made us feel veri cheer and happi ( I do n't think ) We arriv at the " Crest " about 6 , and reliev the 15th , who were mighti glad to see us . It is a good dug-out , one of Fritz 's with about 12 step down to it . There are 27 in the parti and we were veri crowd . We work in 6 hour shift , and as each parti chang over , they chang place with the crowd on duti and go to the down stair portion of the dug-out . We have a parti of Infantri attach to us as bearer and seven of them are with our parti , Stan Wright went Home sick after carri in one patient , so we had a big Inf . Chap in his place . The first patient we took over the top , but it was veri bad go , so we took the rest of ?em through the sap . In place it is up to the knee in water , and also is part fill in with earth , but for all that it is much better than fall into shell hole . We were kept busi on our shift .
