<p>the Heads in a launch to welcome me home. A certain other person writes very<br/> regularly to me in fact has ever since I left Sydney last February, and I can tell you I appreciate it very much indeed. If you only knew what letters mean here, why I think you would be always writing, every spare minute you had.</p>
<p>Several of the photos I am sending out were not taken by me, but Sergt White of the 11th Reinfs has a camera like mine &amp; we generally go out together when we are going to take photos &ndash; that's why I appear in so many, perhaps you gave been thinking I gave my camera to some one and ask them to take a photo of me each time. I think I told you I received the parcel OK It was alright too, - made all the difference in our Xmas here. I got it altogether, so did not do too badly. I'm glad to hear that Olly is well again, and hope to see him over here one of these days. Has he heard anything about coming away? I wondering what Dene is doing too. I do hope he has not joined the Infantry. Anything but that for him. Dene Cliff's engagement was a bit of a knockout too &ndash; it will give you some idea of how things go on, once I leave. I can see, the sooner I come back the better. Why Hazel tried to do the same thing while I was away, &amp; would have only I came home unexpectedly, otherwise I would not have been  there when the deed was done.</p>
