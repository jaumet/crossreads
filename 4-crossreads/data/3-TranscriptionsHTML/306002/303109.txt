<p>14.4.15<br/>Wed. 14th.  Mounted parade with Squadron;  had a fair amount of Signalling with H.Q. this morning &amp; had dinner in the shade of the Palm trees &amp; returned to Camp shortly afterwards.  The Colonel appeared to be in a rather bad humor all day &amp; gave us a bit of a lecture before we started on the parade, he says we are getting rather slack in our work.  Was boxing with Conway after tea.  We were to start on an 8 days bivouac tomorrow, but the Transports are getting repaired, &amp; it has been postponed.</p>
