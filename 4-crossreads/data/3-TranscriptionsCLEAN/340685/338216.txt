  
 and chocolate. 1st Field company had left the previous evening and we left at 3.15 for an unknown destination. During our travels there were many rumours as to where we were going. England being particularly mentioned. However I had a bike on account of bad boots. Next to last night we had been in action, work of relieving 1st Division by second was in progress. Pretty march and once we skirting a wood which was very beautiful and marched on the mountain crests instead of the valleys and got some  very pretty views. Passed through Contay and arrived in Harponville at 7.15 P.M. and straight way Tonkin and I inspected the place per bicycle. Very interesting and returned for tea which was well enjoyed. Had a good bath and slept and slept at 10.30 in an out house as the billet looked too much like lice and slept well. 29.7.16 The sergeant major awakened us at two in the morning and told us we had 1 1/2 hours to move off in so got things ready hurriedly and had a breakfast. Some infantry battalions had been with us of the 3rd Brigade but here they left us and we followed a pioneer battalion. Went down to our parade ground and after waiting about in the cold morning set out at 5 A.M. eventually on our stiff march. Good bit of hilly country and passed through  a  familiar towns and through Rubempre and on to another village where we rested pretty knocked up. It was very warm and we cyclists had to go on and find the route. Duffy we went on and found the place about 1/2 mile from Lavicogne and 4 from Beauval and camped in a pretty open paddock. Close by was a house with a well and I had a pretty good bath and then some dinner. We arrived at 12.30 and McNamara wasn't very well and badly knocked up. After a rest Tonkin, Eades and I went up to look at the aerodrome which supplies planes for reconnaising the Albert front. I was pretty tired but enjoyed it. The men there were very courteous and good and we saw Biplanes of Morane and Monoplane scouts all fitted with the Gnome engine and highly interesting equipment. The control is very simple and efficient later on about 6, 4 monoplanes  went up for a two hours relief to our good wishes for a 'bon voyage'. It is very dangerous work however very interesting to see them rising. We had to hurry back as we night be moving that night. They carry 100 gallons of petrol and 20 to 30 of best castor oil and use 9 to 10 petrol and 2 to 3 gallons of oil an hour. An emergency petrol tank is carried and a Lewis gun with c chargers as well as a revolver and a flare revolver and aeronautical instruments and the pilots always go up thickly and warmly clad. Went straight to bed and saw a plane coming home that astonished us with brilliant Loop the Loop Exhibitions just above us and very low. Very interesting and after tea got some wine in the  villa  house nearby and went to bed.
