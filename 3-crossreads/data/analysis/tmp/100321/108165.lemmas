 2/2/19 Gourdinn Work away on histor stuff all this Sunday morn and then after lunch took a walk to Somze and then back by a cross countri track . All is cover inch deep in snow and yet life is veri activ . Everywher on the snow are the print of bird 's feet and the pad mark of anim 's hoov . The afternoon 's becom lower and dull fair earli and a sort of haze steeli white seem to settl down earli . The villag compact with snowcov roov look cosi and comfort . No wonder the peopl keep close indoor this weather and take no exercis ? there are few induc to outdoor life . Evene had a famili parti at Madam Crochelet and talk , joke and ate a tart .
