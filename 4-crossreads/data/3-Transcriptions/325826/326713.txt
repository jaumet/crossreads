<p>3.  He found that after all there were none for him so we had that extra time &amp; after he had seen me and my luggage here to the York Pension we had a couple of hours together here &amp; such a lovely little time.  Then he had to be off to get back to mess- they have it at 7.30 now - and I unpacked and watched for my dinner hour.  I forgot to mention that before Rid went to see about his funerals he took me to the Red X Depot to see about getting me attached to the Hospital but nothing could be actually done till he had the definite permission of the Matron and O.C., which he says he almost has now &amp; will have no difficulty in getting on Monday.<br/>I feel so glad to have my things properly unpacked- the first time for almost five weeks, and a couple of photos about make my room more home-like, I wish with all my heart, now, that I had brought more.  Still it is not worth while asking you to send more in case they take it into their heads to pack off all of us women out of Egypt.  It is not probable but quite possible that they may do, in which case you have promised not to worry about me for I shall be well cared for somehow or other for an absolute certainty.<br/>There are several English people in this Pension and  amongst them a very nice doctor from 21 &amp; his wife- Capt. &amp; Mrs Miller, a new wife she is.  I shall like them I know as Rid does though there are a couple of other officers not quite my style, still one needn't have anything to say to them &amp; they may be nicer than I can judge from first appearances.</p>
