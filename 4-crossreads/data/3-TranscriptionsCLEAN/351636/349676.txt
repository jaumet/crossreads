 Dear Mr. Layton, I am sending Mrs. Mackay to you to ask if you can give her a little money to keep her going until her husband's first pay comes to her. 
 Mrs. Mackay has been to you & you are going to pay her debts she tells me, but you have not mentioned that you will pay her debt on Furniture & she was afraid to mention it this morning. 
 Trusting you will be able to help her 
 Yours truly E. H. Bennie.
