  
 Sunday cont. Arr. at Vaulx about 8.30pm and had to wait there till dark as the rest of our journey (about 3-4 kilom.) was open country answer could be seen by the enemy. Stopped about 20 min. when a slight fog came down, so we advanced. Left our load at the 11th battery. One of the gunners killed about an hour before. Fritz very quiet but he started to shell Vaulx as we returned home. Arr. camp at 11pm. Monday 14th Recd. letter from Com. Bank saying remittances sent home 26th. Cleaning up the lines, and oiling harness. 2pm Taube overhead. Fired at by our guns. I thought it was hit as it came down 2 or 3 thousand feet turning over and over but as soon as he got into the clouds he made off.
