<p>29/12/18<br/>On the whole this was a wet day and far from pleasant. A visit to the mess this morning showed that windows had suffered from revellers last night and there were a few sore heads and pale faces in the morning. It is a good thing the day is Sunday. Afternoon Bazely called in a car from Division on his way to Walcourt and told us that the Bde.HQ had got home alright. The mounting of our guard was an attraction that drew a good crowd this afternoon but some of the younger N.C.Os need a good deal of instruction in their duties. Wrote and read. It was dark at 3.30 pm &ndash; I must take more exercise than at present. Our village is very quiet today.</p>
