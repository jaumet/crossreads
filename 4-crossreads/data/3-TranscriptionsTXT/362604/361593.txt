Dear Dad,
Your letter of 16/12/17 I am now about to answer.  It is Saturday night.  Ellis has gone to the theatre but I've 20 letters to answer & the show "Under two Flags" by Ouida is not my style so I stayed at Home.  I've another job now as well as my usual work.  I've to go & sleep in one of the Barrack Rooms to see that it is cleaned etc. & that Lights Out is obeyed & generally manage the Hut.  It is a beastly job but Duty is Duty.  I'll not be sleeping with Ellis now for 3 months but of course I'll have the usual comforts & will only sleep in the other place.  A fellow can sleep anywhere so it is of no
