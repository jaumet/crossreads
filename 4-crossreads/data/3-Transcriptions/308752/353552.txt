<p>good meal, - fried steak, mashed potatoes, onions &amp; rice pudding. Luckily there is a cow on the premises &amp; we always have a good supply of milk.</p>
<p>13th May 1918.<br/>A very sad incident occurred to day, one that I shall never forget. My old pal Jim Powel (who is mentioned on numerous occasions) in my diary was accidently killed. How it happened is really a mystery to me. At 12.15 a.m, Jim &amp; Will Macdonald called at our Post to get some water tested.  Whilst Macdonald was in the cellar talking to us we all heard a rifle shot, &amp; on rushing out of the cellar we found to our dismay Jim Powel lying on the ground. On carrying him to the house we found that a bullet had gone clean through his head, of course he was unconscious &amp; he died in a few minutes. The rifle he carried over from the other Relay Post for the purpose of salvaging had accidentally gone off. You can just imagine the shock the sad occurrence gave to us all especially the fellows who were with him from the very start in Liverpool &amp; Queens Park.  Needless to say it was a terrible shock to me, Jim &amp; I had been pals for a long time, we came over on the boat together &amp; we have often been in the same stretcher squad. Tom Ross &amp; Clarry Sullings carried poor Jim down to the Loading Post. Of course sleep was out of the question after this, and all were very glad when some more squads arrived from B Section at 10 a.m. the following day to relive us.</p>
<p>On arriving back at Hd. Qrtrs. about 3 p.m. I had to turn in to bed, as I had a bad attack of influenza.   Fortunately I was only laid up for three days, &amp; was soon O.K. again.   Rather unusual for me to be sick.</p>
