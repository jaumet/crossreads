The French motor drivers seem to live on bread and choclate; and are dressed in huge hairy goat skin coats.   24/10/16 Marched on through the rain; along roads conjested with traffic. Dumped our packs along the road and donned light fighting order. Halted on a place we call "Mud Hill"; though the whole landscape is a sea of mud; of the consistency of cream. Absolutely no shelter here, but I have found a possie in an old trench. Am drenched to the skin and covered with mud. Don't enjoy the prospect of fighting in this weather.
