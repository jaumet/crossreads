they said, we will never hold it, as you are out too bleeding far. We went back about to the Reserves about midnight.
Sunday  12/5/17
Very hot - We were relieved by 8th & 14th F. Amb. - went back to Main Dressing Station about two miles from Bapaume, where we arrived at midday - got a square feed & plenty of hot tea. Had a bit of a clean up - shave & an apology for a Bath. I got another crack on the shoulder coming out but it didn't hurt nor cut the flesh - I really do not think Fritz will knock me now - Without a doubt as the Doctors all say my case is another one in favour of the steel lids - undoubtedly they proved friendly to me & in future will never treat them with such contempt. I must admit my nut was fairly sore last night & all day today - It is healing fast & I had a dose of Anti Tet - S - I forgot all about my little grievances when I found 9 letters awaiting me from Mrs Hill, Annie, May, Mrs Single, Gert Nock, Kit, Lill & Les hagan - it was great to get such news from good old pals. Gas alarm at night. Had a good sleep & pleasant dreams after the nice letters.
