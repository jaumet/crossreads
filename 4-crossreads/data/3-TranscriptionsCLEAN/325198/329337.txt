[Contd. from page 152]But will not own up when we are asked"Who's life had we assisted?That it was but a common horseWho's leg rope had got twisted.
So now you know our historyOf how we served the KingAnd how we watered horsesAnd made the brushed ringNow don't proclaim us heroesFor we're bashful to the coreAnd when the war is overWe'll be Civvies ever more.
