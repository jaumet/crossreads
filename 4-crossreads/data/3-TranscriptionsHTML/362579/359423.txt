<p>My dearest Family,</p>
<p>To my delight me parcel has just arrived   &amp;  I've opened it. The cake looks beautiful, shall sample it soon. The short-breas is very nice but a good deal knocked about, still it is good. The cocoanut is the worse for travelling   &amp;  sad to say must turn it down. The Ginger is quite alright. The Flagss, Eddy's painting's   &amp;  beads are grand. I'm that pleased</p>
