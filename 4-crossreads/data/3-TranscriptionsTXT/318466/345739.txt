 [Transcriber's note:  This is the third diary of Lieut Leonard V. Bartlett and begins in Boulogne, followed by a short leave to Paris in January.  He is then given leave to England where his wife and family are living.  He returns in February to Ballieul in France.  In April he is gassed at Villers Bretonneux and is eventually sent to England for hospitalisation and recuperation until August when he returns to France. Soon after he reported suffering an episode of shell shock and asked to be relieved of his command and allowed to return to Australia.  This was granted and he and his wife travel back to Australia on the Niagra, via New York and Canada, Honolulu and New Zealand.]
