<p>Bulford<br/>1.9.17<br/>Dear Dad, Just a P.C. to let you know that we are both going on O.K. I have just come back from a 10 mile spin through the countryside. Ellis has gone to Salisbury. It is the first fine day that we have had for three weeks &amp; I could not resist the chance of going out. I went for a Motor Ride this morning about 20 miles to take a chap with Mumps away to an isolation Hospital. It was lovely driving through the crisp sharp air. We are beginning to have cool weather now. The Autumn leaves are full tinted &amp; very soon all the trees will start to lose their leaves. Nothing more this time.  Love to All  Harry</p>
