<p>17th. I spent one of the most enjoyable afternoons of my life today, with <strike>one</strike> a young lady who works with heart &amp; soul for Australians, I was introduced to her the other day &amp; we sort of took a fancy to one another with the result that I was invited down to her home, so this afternoon I went, she met me at the tram terminus &amp; as the day looked very stormy for thunder was about she insisted on taking me home, they live in a most lovely house, the afternoon passed like lightning we had music singing &amp; etc for Grace thats her name is an accomplished girl, afternoon tea about 4 oclock &amp; then as the sun was starting to shine a little we went for a stroll in the garden &amp; I took a couple of snaps of her with my Kodak she is a very fine &amp; good looking girl,</p>
