You can thus see that unless you have these two levers in exactly the right proportion to each other you would not get satisfactory results out of the engine.  For instance too much "fine adjustment" would cause the engine to choke, too little would starve it.  In either case the engine would "konk out" perhaps with fatal results to the pilot if he was just leaving the ground & was over buildings etc.  So to get the pupils thoroughly proficient in engine running they have the escargot running.  This is a big platform-box arrangement with various types of rotary engines inside, fitted up with petrol tanks throttles, fine adjustments etc, exactly the same as a machine, and the pupil has to run each type of engine up separately.  Of course  the engine  not being attached to anything, the engine simply stops & does no damage if the pupil starves or chokes it as  the   very often happens.  The name s  "escargot" is probably taken from the shape of the arrangement, [diagram here] the chimney arrangement being used to carry away the exhaust gases etc. set up. Thank you so much for attending to the photos for me, for it is almost impossible to get anything in that line done over here now.
