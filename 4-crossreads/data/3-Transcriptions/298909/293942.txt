<p>6/4/16  Thursday</p>
<p>Rather a nice day. All leave still cancelled &ndash; Very few men left at Zeitouin &ndash; two brigades of L. Horse are to supply all the Guards picquets, I think they are going to remain here &ndash; rumour has it the 11th &amp; 4th LH. will remain till the Anzac Police 2,000 odd being formed are trained to take over their duties. All N.C.O's were dismissed from all parades in our section &ndash; not enough men to go around. Talk about rag time guards etc., at 7.30 pm myself 5 Corporals &amp; 1 Sergeant 36 men called out for guards &amp; picquet, quite a good joke here AMC Picquet.</p>
<p>I had to report Garrison Orderly room &amp; sign on, who to my surprise should be there as Orderly Sergeant but Billy Bedsor, soon</p>
