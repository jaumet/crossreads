Monday 3rd
Owing to change of shifts had day off. Received long letter from Lill. Quite cheered me up. Wrote a long one in return. Capt. North instructs us how to use the rifle and Bayonet as splints. 4 from our tent on picket. Made plenty of room for the rest of us. Rained heavily all night, card party during the evening.
Tuesday 4th (x)
More latrine wires about B. Section being in action at outpost. Hope it is true, as we are anxious that B. Section draw first blood. Niggers had nothing to do, so set them on digging holes in which to bury rubbish. Wind blowing a gale, very cold and miserable. Library opened, but not much use as we are on duty all day and at night reading is difficult, as our supply of candles is very limited "Bricky" still argues.
Wednesday 5th
Still very windy and cold, plenty of traffic through canal. Big boat tied up, on opposite bank.
P.S. (x) First quality Latrine wires.
Unloading sand bags, 1 barbed wire, engineers built big landing stage. Pump on water barge broke down hundreds of camels lying about a waiting their loads of water for the outposts and various camps. Lancashire Artillery depart, to the Persian Gulf (they think), left a lot of seats and tables behind which we quietly appropriated Long benches placed in our tent, giving it the appearance of a Sunday School.
Thursday 6th 
Still windy and cold. These poor devils of Arabs feel it very keenly. Saw them making their pancakes, which seems to be their chief article of diet. First of all they prepared a coarse looking flour into balls in dough about the size of a cricket ball, then rolling it out flat they curl it round a stick and run it out on to a flat piece of iron and cook over the fire for about 3 minutes.
