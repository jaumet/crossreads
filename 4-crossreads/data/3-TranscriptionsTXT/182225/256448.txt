 1916 &nbsp; SATURDAY 25 &nbsp; NOV. 
 Fine &amp; warm. Saw Auntie Flo first thing &amp; then went up to the Bank with Eric Murray (M rs &nbsp;Angus&#39; brother) &amp; a good fellow. Went to see the dentist afterwards but he was out with some sickness so did not get my teeth seen to. Went round &amp; saw Auntie F at her workshop &amp; then picked Poss &amp; Kieth up &amp; we had dinner at Hatchetts &amp; went on to &quot;Flying Colours&quot; at the Empire afterwards &amp; it was jolly good.&nbsp; Had dinner &nbsp;Saw D r &nbsp;Whylie (a throat specialist) after &amp; he says I want an operation for my throat. Had dinner at Simpsons &amp; Poss &amp; I went to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; at the Palace after &amp; it was a great show. I camped with Poss at 71 Jermyn S t &nbsp;that night.
