<p>had to be spoilt to pull a portion of the dressing over the bottom hole. However as he said, it was not bad for an "amateur"</p>
<p>One of the AMC Doctors hopped over the "cases" lying on the ground &amp; inspected the dressing &amp; gave instructions to the Corporal taking out the wounded, to have a proper dressing put on at the next Station in "support" &amp; to hurry out straight away.</p>
<p>But the loss of blood had been so great that the wounded sentry had to be placed in a dugout to lie down for about 20 minutes &amp; therefore missed that draft. His section "pal" who was wounded on the hand, at the same time decided to stay with him. Another draft of "Walking Cases" being ready to be "passed out" the sentry &amp; his pal managed to take their places &amp; started on their journey to Hospital.</p>
<p>An unfortunate incident occurred which should have been avoided.</p>
<p>The NCO regulating the traffic at the "Sap Head", had allowed three stretcher "cases" to go through about five minutes previous to the second draft of Walking Cases &amp; behind them a battalion being relieved was allowed to follow, the result was that long before half the distance was traversed the three "stretcher cases" were overtaken &amp; the "Sap" was completely blocked. As all the saps were continually being shelled, the target offered by the men going out was naturally a good one &amp; losses took place.</p>
<p>Things got so bad that it looked at one time, that the three stretcher cases would have had to be placed right upon the parapet till the battalion had passed, for unwounded men were being "hit" on account of the block caused by the "Stretcher cases". Eventually they managed to get them to an opening in the "Sap" when the battalion passed, at the double.</p>
<p>While waiting at each stop that would occur, the effect of the nights bombardment on the Saps, was horribly apparent, dead men were lying about, some having been blown on to the parapet in such natural attitudes that it was hard to believe they were dead. Time &amp; again one would almost instinctively put a hand out to pull a man down from an exposed place, or start to abuse such unnecessary recklessness</p>
