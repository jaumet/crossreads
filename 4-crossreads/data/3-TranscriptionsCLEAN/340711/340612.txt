March.Wednesday, 1.Jerks (first parade) and footdrill morning. Usual leave (Wed. and Sat. afternoons) from 2 p.m. Went with N. and G. to Native Bazaars, (Egyptian and Arab) Blue Mosque, and also another Mosque nearby. Beautiful marble mosaic, lapis lazuli etc. Bought a black and gold table centre for 100 piastres. They wanted 250 for it. Struck a nice place in Khan Khalil, a French and a Russian girl there, and had good time trying to speak French. Went with N. and G. to French brothel---50 piastre place, at north-west end of Bulac Shareh. We refused their overtures but shouted drinks which cost us 55 piastree We spent half an hour chatting till a well-dressed native came in when the ladies immediately flocked to him.
Thursday, 2.Jerks and drill morning. Heavy dust storm, so no parade in afternoon. Went in with Bob M. in evening. Indigestion and liver victim---late when we got to town, poor companion---so not particularly enjoyable evening. Left by 9.15 train for Camp. Station Helmieh.
