<p>31-5-19<br/>Leave camp at 9 but do not catch train till 1 pm &amp; then pay my fare to Salisbury as there is a train for France via Southampton which leaves from this station &amp; so if I go by this route I need not change my baggage</p>
<p>I leave my baggage in the cloak room &amp; have dinner at Chinese restaurant (4/10) where I met 2 African airmen who volunteer to take me up in their plane if I can get leave to go up to Northolt junction before I leave. I then find Lily Brookes &amp; take her to the pictures after which I go home to Baywater Rd</p>
<p>1-6-19 (Sunday)<br/>Get up this morning at 11.30 &amp; take a walk in the park &amp; listen to the speeches There is a big police meeting here to day to decide if the London police should strike. I ask a policeman what I can do to fill in time &amp; suggests going up the river in the boat &amp; I add visiting Kew Gardens to myself.</p>
<p>The interval I fill in by visiting Cleopatra's</p>
