<p>May 1915<br/> 29th &ndash; of their bread. Seemed tough &amp; indigestible. Went for swim in afternoon, Captn Mac, came with us, he did not stay long no sooner in, than out &amp; home. Turkish snipers (2) caught last night, also about 20 prisoners captured. Enquired at office of clearing hospital for name of wounded. Not there so far. Reports that Turks silenced one of our battys, also large number of troops to reinforce. Report about batty not confirmed. Out men captured an M.G. last night. Turkish snipers in <strike>most</strike> awful condition, been there for weeks, when captured, been there for weeks, when captured, one attempted to sing out &amp; attract attention but was quickly silenced for ever. Our men crept up on them in darkness.<br/>30th &ndash; Grandma's 85th birthday. Morning very quiet. About 12.30pm. Our guns started firing quickly. A Ruse to draw the enemy's fire so as to assist N Z's &amp; perhaps some of 2nd L.H. on extreme left wing<br/>captured three trenches &amp; two MGs also partly filled in one trench &amp; left part open &amp; allowed Turks to occupy. Directly Turks <strike>open</strike> occupied, our MGs poured in upon them a terrific enfilading fire &amp; annihilated them. In afternoon 1pm to 4pm shrapnel burst &amp; poured down upon our valley &amp; dug-outs in torrents. About 3.15pm it stopped for few minutes &amp; at 3.30 we got out of our dug-outs &amp; looked round when <strike>shells</strike> shell burst on hill ahead of us &amp; stray (?) pellet hit E.A. Wiggins on the head &amp; went through his brain (Compound fracture). Poor Wigg died at 4.35 &amp; was buried with others in burial ground in shrapnel fully about 8pm. Col. Green senior chaplain read service. Did not go, had only under trousers, others soaking. I was on outside Eddie Miles on <strike>other</strike> in side of him, his head on a level with my nose. He seemed to stand up for about ten seconds before falling staggered &amp; fell back over</p>
