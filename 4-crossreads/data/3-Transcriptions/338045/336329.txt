<p>have tea in Sergeants' mess receive two blankets, take a walk back to 4th Div. B.D. &amp; talk the situation over.  Decide to see it out.  Turn it at 9 p.m.  This camp is for details, Artillery, A.S.C., A.M.C., Engineers, Pioneers, etc. &amp; is fairly miserable.</p>
<p>Oct. 17th &ndash; Tuesday<br/>Cold &amp; rainy.  Last night was the coldest of my experience &amp; nearly frozen.  Two blankets!  Too much of this is not appealing.  Reveille 6 a.m. &amp; parade 6-30 a.m., orders &amp; then dismissed at 7 a.m.  After a good wash in icy water hands &amp; face numbed.  Breakfast &amp; at 9 a.m. parade.  I have to take charge of a section &amp; march them on to the parade</p>
