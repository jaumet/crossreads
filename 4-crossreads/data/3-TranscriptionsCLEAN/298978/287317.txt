Nov;Reach Melbourne - raining - reminds me of London. 2 p.m. no lunch, entrain for Broadmeadows Camp - arrive, Broadmeadows ankle deep in mud - no lunch, no tents - everything rotten
Nov;Visit Melbourne Picture Gallery - rather good painting by St.George Hare, flesh very nicely handled. A powerful piece of work by Harold Power, and - a Brangwyn! No need to say what I thought of his work. Visit Dick H., a most frightful scamp but great fun, understands Art and Literature but not how to treat his wife. I meet a charming damsel, rather like one of the dream maidens that Waterhouse delights to depict; want to have a chat with her but Dick drags me off to a theatre, suppose a man with more sense would not have allowed himself to be dragged off.  Return to camp by a detour to avoid pickets.
