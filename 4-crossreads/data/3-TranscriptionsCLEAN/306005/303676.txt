  
 30-12-16 morning & left camp at 8 oclock in drizzling rain. the sky was very cloudy & the wind cold but blowing the same way as we were going (East), had a fairly interesting trip passing several villages along the coast, a good deal of the country is cultivated the crops just above the ground these we travelled over doing a good deal of damage to all the fields we passed over, there are no fences & the fields are seperated by a narrow strip of weeds which are allowed to grow; We followed a good road for the transports all day & arrived at Sheik Towait about 4.30 & built a "bivy" with two blankets to keep the rain off. Frost, Lindsell,
