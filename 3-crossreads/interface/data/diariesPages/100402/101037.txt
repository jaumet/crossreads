On fatigue at A.D.S., working on the dugout.
Last night Fritz shelled the line for four hours with "mustard gas" about one hundred casualties to 9th Battn. was the result. Colonel, Adjutant, Capt. Phillips (1st F. Amb.), M.O., were gassed. Some cases were very bad came down on the light railway, eyes other parts of the body were affected. The cases were pitiful. Glorious day.
Go up to the posts on Sunday.
