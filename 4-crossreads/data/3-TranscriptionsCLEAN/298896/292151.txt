Tuesday 27th Aug.A quiet day with a few casualties from an 8th brigade push. News still good, he's falling back not being at his own leisure as it was during the old Somme days. Fixed up my store in the morning & went along to the M.D.S, for dressings etc as several back dressing stations had been cleared out & all the stuff brought forward, a wise move & economical, I came across a lot of the stuff I handed over to the 3rd Fld a week or so ago.
