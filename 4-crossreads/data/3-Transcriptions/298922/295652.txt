<p>Wednesday 19 December 1917</p>
<p>Received 62 letters, none missing dating from July to Nov. I sorted them out into proper sequence &amp; read them like a book. Also got Pocket Book from Joe. Heaps of Papers came along also, many thanks for them. Jim Ayre is well but Bob RONALD badly wounded again &amp; many others you will see in the Casualty Lists in Papers. <strike>I feel ashamed at having asked you to mention my return to old Sam.</strike></p>
