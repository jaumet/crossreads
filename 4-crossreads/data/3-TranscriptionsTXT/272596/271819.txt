Island on our starboard I dont know whether its Somaliland in Africa or a group of islands called Socrates  opinions seem to be divided but I favour the latter, weather is all that can be desired a gentle breeze is blowing & the sun is just what you would call hot,  all I have on is a thin flannel a pair of shorts (very short) & a pair of shoes this completes my Xmas costume, nearly Garden of Eden style.
There was a certain amount of beer on sale today 1/2 a bottle a man, this is all that is allowed for the voyage otherwise we have a dry ship, some of the old boozers are dying for a good bust up, what a time they will have when they get loose in Melbourne.
Great commotion on deck this evening the mob have been on the ramp catching & ducking anyone they could lay their hands on   in you went no matter how you protested
