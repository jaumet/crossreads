  
 Saturday 17 February 1917 [16 February 1918] 1/2 day & very instructive one seeing Coptic churches.  Left Y.W.C.A. 2.30 p.m., took tram to Old Cairo & met Canon Garland with 4 Australians in tram & oh what a hard clasp he gave to an old T'mba [Toowoomba ?] woman.  We last saw him in "Wilga" when Mrs. Fairfax was there with measles. Note for the Copts - Saw oldest Copt Church & supposed place where Mary hid the infant Christ.
