<p>speach  ,,To devasted the Germ. Race he advised to hawe all Children of Germ. Mothers killed in the Wombs of expecting Mothers.  Although the Bishop wher in Company of the Camp Comandant, &amp; the later esteemed &amp; well liked by everyone of us Internees, the boo hooing &amp; shouting started, combined with singing "Has anybody hier seen Kelly".  Also objectionable Names of all sorts, yes, even a few stones wher aimed at the Rev. Gentleman.  Several Internees wher arrested by the Military Police &amp; placed in the Camp jail.  When the Camp Comandant noticed the riot, &amp; no doubt know the reasones of its origin requested the Rev. Bishop, to better leave Camp, as Service no doubt would never hawe been patronised not even by one Internee, the Bishop left never to return to give Service amongst the Huns in the Germ. Conc. Camp Liverpool.  As sayd previously, the new Comandant &amp; his Staff wher respected &amp; well liked by all Internees, as they had proven fair &amp; just Gentleman, wich had done their best to make our internement as light as possible.  This respective Gentleman would even hawe gone further in easy our detentions, however they stood under order of superior Officers of the Head department Melbourne.  I admitt that these Gentleman in charge of the G.C.C. done their outmost to make our detention as bearable &amp; light as possible.</p>
