<p>9th Mar 1917<br/>Dear Mother/.</p>
<p>I awoke this morning to find the world wrapped in the hush and the whiteness of snow.<br/>While men slept the gently flakes had commenced to fall and they were falling as we fell in for parade.<br/>A snow fall is a beautiful sight to see.<br/>That more than silence and greater than peace, hush and awe of it is one of the rarest and finest poems of nature.<br/>The soft flakes come like silent messages of peace.<br/>As tokens of an unseen presence which seems to be spirit of the great all persuading whiteness</p>
