Visited Cairo &amp; was very impressed with everything I saw.<br/>It is the filthiest City in Creation.  That is the Native Quarters, of course the City itself is just beautiful.</p>
<p>23.12.15<br/>Visited Cairo &amp; Suburbs again &amp; part of the Nile.  Called on [indecipherable] &amp; had a good time.<br/>Took a Motor Car in the afternoon &amp; did a few hundred miles of country</p>
<p>24.12.15<br/><u>Christmas Eve</u><br/>Everything was in an uproar.  Fancy 500,000 men all making a noise at the same time.  Richard obtained leave &amp; went into Cairo &amp; visited a few more places.<br/>You never saw the like in your life, of Course every second Soldier was drunk &amp; what with them, &amp; the natives shouting out <u>Verie Good Christmas</u> <u>Verrie nice Christmas</u> (of course for a Piastre) it was a sight that one will never forget.<br/>I arrived home at 10 &amp; wondered what you were doing on your side</p>
