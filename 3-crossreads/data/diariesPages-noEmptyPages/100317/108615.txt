No better today. The situation quiet here on the front but the Tommies lost all their gains North of Albert after holding them for three days. Our people don't want to take any risks here. At 4 p.m. the mess cart called for me and I set off for Lamotte-Brebiere where they had procured a room for me in the Chateau. A few big shells landing about 1000? from Battalion H.Q. as we left. Feeling wretchedly weak when I got as far as as Mile's Store. Miles none too well either. The weather has been muggy and close for some days and I think a good fall of rain would do good. The Somme river is low and exposes many weeds. The men seem to enjoy swimming here and plunge in from their little camps so conveniently situated on the riverbanks. Sutherland and others came in to see me and inquire as to health
