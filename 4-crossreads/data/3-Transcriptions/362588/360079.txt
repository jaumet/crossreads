<p>[The last page of this letter is written on a form entitled "Messages and Signals" and the contents of the form have not been transcribed.]<br/>Life here is curious in our funny little Dugouts &ndash; "Possies" the men call them.  The heat, flies &amp; dust are rather a nuisance, but we get plenty to eat &amp; an issue of tobacco weekly.  Water is scarce &ndash; enough to drink, but none for washing.  Some regard this as an advantage.  Things have been very quiet lately - &amp; we only have desultory shelling &amp; rifle fire.  The men are splendid though the Regiment is sadly knocked about.  George Simpson is quite fit again.  He got plugged in the arm, but was never a lying down case.  I was much amused to see in the Sydney papers that I was slightly wounded.  If that was slight, God forbid I should ever be wounded or worse still seriously wounded.  The Sunday Times states I was a frequent contributor to their papers.  To the best of my knowledge &amp; belief I never wrote a line in my life for them.  I am going to ask you to send me any of your newspapers which contain references to the Australians after you have finished with them.</p>
<p>We are not supposed to write anything of the happenings here - &amp; I don't think I have disobeyed &ndash; though possibly the Labour Party will consider the state of affairs at Alexandria etc. as "happenings".  Many of us are beginning to wonder if we shall get billets on our return &amp; if we return &ndash; or whether people will have no time for a brutal and licentious soldiery when the War is over.  All this may sound pessimistic &ndash; but some of us, especially those who have been through things, know how rotten things are beneath the surface &amp; how plausible Politicians &amp; Members of the Defence Department are.  General Birdwood &amp; his Staff are splendid.</p>
<p>Thanks again so much for writing.  I hope you will do so in future when you have the time.</p>
<p>Will look out for Keith<br/>Charles M. Macnaghten.</p>
