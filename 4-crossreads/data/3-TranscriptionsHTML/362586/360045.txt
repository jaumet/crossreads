And if one of them should be sick or wounded, or killed, remember what comfort a line or two to his family may give them.  There is many a bereaved mother who counts among her dearest possessions the scrap of paper from her boy's officer just to say he wants her to know how sorry he is.</p>
<p>Good bye, my dear dear boy.  Do you duty manfully, &amp; remember that the honour of Australia is in the keeping of her sons.  Whatever comes, face it with cheerfulness &amp; fortitude.  Mother and I can't help feeling sad at parting with you, but we are borne up by the knowledge that you have offered yourself in a great cause and by the earnest hope that we may soon know the joy of welcoming you home again.</p>

<p>Your affectionate<br/>Father</p>
