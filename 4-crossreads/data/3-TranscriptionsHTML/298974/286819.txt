<p>14<br/>I have enjoyed the letters more than you can know. Don't be afraid of all telling me the same news. Dorothy's was always saying "of this &amp; that", &amp; yet she was the only one who told me what was in the nurse's letter about Alan's death. Father forgot to enclose it. You should let me know her unit &amp; name. Always do this. We get to some queer places, &amp; I may yet be able to find her.</p>
<p>Now, dear everybody, for a while, au revoir. I will write every chance I get. Don't worry mother, I'm the lucky one, with me it is Ibis, sed redibis! Your loving son</p>
