Several of our waggons were up moving the baggage & our Company suffered its first Casualty in France Bill Southam coming back with a Shrapnel Bullet in his leg - he was taken off to hospital this morning & I think most of us envied him - I know I did - a few good weeks good rest & change with the probability of being sent to England.
June 30/16There has been a long gap between this & the previous entries but we have been too busy - only time to write the scantiest letters home & the rest neglected or F.S. Cards only & yet with all the work we have been getting through there is nothing fresh
