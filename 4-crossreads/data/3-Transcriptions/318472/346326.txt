<p>11 April 1918<br/>Thursday<br/>An uneventful day as most are in camp. At night RSM. Smith and I went to a concert given by the Kangaroos &ndash; the No. 3 Command Concert party. It was very <u>good</u> but not so good as that given by the Owls.</p>
<p>1918 April 12<br/>Friday<br/>Nothing of any importance going at all. This is a very dull &amp; uneventful place after being used to so much Military work &amp; bustle in the Field At night Smith &amp; I went to Albany Wards Show. A very medium affair of pictures &amp; Vaudeville</p>
