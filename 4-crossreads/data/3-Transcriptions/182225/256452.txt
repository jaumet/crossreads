<p>Fine &amp; cold. We went out on a brigade stunt in the morning &amp; did not get back till about 2 pm. We went over the downs &amp; came into action a couple of times. We took the waggons down to ordinance stores at Fargo &amp; got 320 odd rounds of amunition for firing tomorrow. I was on horse picket at night. Got a letter from Linda &amp; it was just the letter I had been looking for for a long time.</p>
