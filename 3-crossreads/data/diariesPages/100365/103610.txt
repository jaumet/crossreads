- 24.5.16 Wednesday -
Orders are still coming through relative to our move  we have all been instructed to read up our billeting instructions, so presumably we are going to be billeted on the French people for a while.It is very funny making all the men give up their precious kits  we are burning Bags  bags of real good stuff every day.The 12th Brigade of Infantry are holding Field Days on the Desert adjoining our Camp  the beggars keep us awake all night with their noise. It is marvellous what they can do in a short period. Last night when we turned in the Desert was as smooth as glass. This morning on waking up they had transformed it into a veritable maze of trenches.We got a Belfast paper to-day  were all amazed to see how serious the Rebellion in Ireland really was. None of us had any idea it was so big. But of course we do not get any news at all here.The Canal has been very quiet to-day, not many ships passing through at all, although there seems to be a good few anchored in the Bitter Lakes.
