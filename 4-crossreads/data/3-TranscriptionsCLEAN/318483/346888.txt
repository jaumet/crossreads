On the return journey, during the midday heat, I made a small oil painting of the Laffan side of the Wady at about at the ruined hut about half way between Magdhaba & El Arish.
The day following an oil painting, small, was made of El Arish Town was made, also a water colour of the mouth of the Wadi El Arish.  Our visit to El Arish was marked by the most kindly hospitality & thoughtful assistance in our work freely & generously extended to us by the English Officers Military & Administrative.  This brings the itinerary as arranged by G.O.C. to a finish & I parted from the Major who has been so keen a guide & so delightful a companion he to return to his regiment I to proceed to Cairo en route to England.
While waiting for embarkation I spent some days at Abbassia & made studies of horses camels & gear.  I also had a very pleasant stay at Ghezira kit stores where I made studies of horses, gear, & several pencil portraits.
