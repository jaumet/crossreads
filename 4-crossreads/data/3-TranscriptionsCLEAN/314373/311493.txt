  
 heads where they gave up the chase, the people aboard waving umbrellas, silk scarves, handkerchiefs, hats and all sorts of articles. The boys were standing or hanging to every available position on the ship in order to see the last of the dear old city which we would not see for many a day. I was standing right astern and the song "Good-bye Sydney Town Good-bye" was I think sung with more feeling than it has ever been since composed. The land faded all too quickly from our sight as it was a dull day and although I took a snapshot of my last glimpse of the "Heads" it will I am afraid  be no good. Slowly and hesitatingly the men left their positions and set to work finding their bunks. Soon their faces began to assume that pasty and care for nothing look of the inevitable sea-sickness for we had struck rough weather. I slept well that night and was not sick till next morning after going into the cook-house which did not smell too appetising. However, I ate a good breakfast and have not felt any effect since. Saturday 19/12/15. It is very funny to see the fellows lying about the decks looking very miserable and not caring what happens, whilst in contrast a few, not sick, are standing or walking about discussing the vessel, destination, other things about the voyage. Towards evening the weather became quite calm. The meals are very good the menu being porridge, meat (and some times rabbit) bread and tea for breakfast, soup, meat with a green vegetable and potatoes - sometimes plum duff for dinner and tea with margarine and jam for the evening meal, the tea having milk and sugar in it.  Sunday 19/12/15. We had church service 10.30 a.m. the Chaplin speaking from the saloon deck and the men congregated on the stern well deck. The service was very impressive for on looking round one sees the sky like a tremedous dome roof resting on the huge flat and bare surface of the sea, whilst the only spot in the whole scene is this little ship (for it does seem small in such a space) with all heads bowed in prayer. There is no drill to-day of course and the scene on the boat deck is a very lazy and comfortable one with the men in all sorts of conceivable positions and attired, talking writing or sleeping, whilst even the inevitable washing flapping in a soft breeze seems imbued with laziness. The only sign of duty is the sentry at his post and the ship's officer pacing the bridge.
