Mag. good help & anxious to do anything to help me. Great chaos at Central, 3 recievers behind counter & about 100 of us all struggling to put luggage in cloak room. Got away 12.20 p.m. & reported Barracks 12.35 p.m. to report. 
 2 p.m., Thursday Did a little shopping then home & very tired & with bad cold. 
 Wednesday 4 September 1918 A little lecture by Capt. Bryce A.G.H.Q. - ask if leave can be stopped.  He says Matron can if she likes - follows a lecturette.  "She is a very [indecipherable] woman, we all grumble & talk outside!  This latter should not be however we dislike her not in the Army".
