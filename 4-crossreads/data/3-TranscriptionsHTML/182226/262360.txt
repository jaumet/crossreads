<p>Saturday 4 December, 1915</p>
<p>The weather here is great. In the morning everything is fresh, just like spring.</p>
<p>There is nothing much to do here except play cards. Just at present I have gone broke on the game.</p>
<p>I had some good games of handball today, the first time I have tried it, my hands are pretty sore.</p>
<p>This place is a veritable gambling hell, wherever you go you see little crowds round a bed &amp; hear the clink of coins.</p>
<p>I played till about 1 a.m.</p>
