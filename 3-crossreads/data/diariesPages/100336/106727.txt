The population comprises chiefly Greeks Armenians Turks and a mixture of other nationalities very few English The Turkish part of the town is easily picked out by the appearance of the buildings and the towering minarets of the mosques. On arrival at the central station we are transferred to another the Otterman (Aidin) railway which we learn is a line owned by an English Co. it only runs a few miles out of Smyrna We notice by the name plates on the carriages engines that they were built in England. After a run of about 3 miles we arrive at our destination "Paradise" a place that has earn't itself that name. From here there is only a single track to Egherdir about 200 miles. We soon learn that we are to be quartered in the American college near by a magnificent building completed not long before the war Close to the main building in the same grounds was a large church concert room fitted out in the most up to date way also a fine gymnasium with all lates appliances, they generated all their own electricity for lighting.
