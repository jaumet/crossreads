Sunday 20 JanuaryIn a sincere & eloquent speech, maiden speech, Mr. Smallwood in the House of Commons on Friday, drew attention to the gros mismanagement in the Army.,  He instanced his own personal cases of his two sons & he called "for a soul in the army something human".  He said that he would rather a stoppage of any reinforcements until the authorities could use them properly. It is this idea which moved me against conscription. Weather raining a little & generally cloudy but warm.Heavy bombardment on right.
Monday 21 JanuaryRather exciting last night.  The Colonels hut was burnt down last night & all his clothes etc. were burnt & completely destroyed.
