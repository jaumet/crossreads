 "Pretty Good World" is France in the spring  we all feel fit so we are "Pretty Good People"  so whats wrong with the general Scheme of things, well only the War & that will be over soon, we hope & I think so. 
    Two days ago in the long twilight I visited a quiet corner, a  Harold  soldiers cemetery & there I saw the grave of my friend Harry Thomas & many others too whom I had known, a noble little band, quiet, but the brigade cross above them was their emblem of the pride & love & grief of their comrades & of their nation.  That is what is wrong with the world, the war & that will be over soon we hope & believe.
