<p>till Sunday6 evening when Dimock &amp; I went to the Sunday concert at the Royal.  I felt uneasy the whole time I was in there &amp; I kept continually looking round to see if she was there for I knew she was in the habit of attending these concerts but no she was not there that I could see but all the same something seemed to tell me that Ethel was handy.  The next evening (Monday) I met her by arrangements &amp; she asked me how I enjoyed my trip &amp; etc.  I told her a yarn about one thing &amp; another &amp; she asked me what train I came down from London in on Sunday night, now I thought here's a pretty mess for I had neglected to look up the time table &amp; see what time the trains got in.

Luckily she never questioned me any further but I thought at the time</p>
