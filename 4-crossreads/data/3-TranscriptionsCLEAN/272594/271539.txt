  
 Jock & I packed up in a few secs, but we could not leave the dugout for old Fritz was shelling like old Harry it was dangerous to poke your head out, one shell caught a bunch of chaps just as they were opposite the dugout & wounded every one of them, one chap had his leg hanging off as he hobbled down the stairs it was an awful sight but he was as cool as a cucumber, there were no stretcher bearers handy
