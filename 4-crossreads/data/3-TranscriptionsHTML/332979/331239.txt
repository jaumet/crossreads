<p>After bidding Good Bye to my Second Lady Companion I went into the Wesley Hall where Refreshments are provided by Ladies of the Church which is very kind of them. I had a Cup of Tea &amp; a Sandwich which are provided free. The Ladies of Durban are very kind to us, &amp; try to make us feel at Home. After a Wash &amp; Brush Up in one of the Municipal Lavatories which are built in several places for both Sexes &amp; are up to date &amp; very clean, I took another Tram to Stamford Hill which is in another direction I think there are about 7 or 8 different Tram Routes. I <strike>was</strike> asked the Conductor to put me down at Sutton Park Having been given a Card instructing me where to go I left my Card &amp; had no difficulty in finding the address</p>
