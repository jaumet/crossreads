<p>Birmingham No 1 General Hospital - London<br/>May 4 1918<br/>On being granted 14 days hospital leave by the military, I had an invite to the Cornish coast at the village of Penzance. We made an inspection of the Tower Gulf lighthouse and saw one of the worst storms in our stay in the village. The huge heavy waves went the full height and crashed all over and around the Gulf lighthouse - Philo - Landsend</p>
