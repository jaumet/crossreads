<p>Wednesday 14 March 1917</p>
<p>Am doing well at the at the examinations &amp; have had a good holiday, all over on Saturday.</p>
<p>Had dinner with Capt. Pearse &amp; gave him 32 snapshots of the fighting at Rafa &amp; Magdaba &amp; El Arish to give to you on arrival in Sydney, also a MILLS BOMB with all the Powder taken out. Quite safe.</p>
