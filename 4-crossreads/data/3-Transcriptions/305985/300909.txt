<p>22/12/15 &ndash; Xmas eve; on board SS Simla for destination unknown. Egypt I guess, best boat Ive been on yet.<br/>I received a billy can with a lot of odds and ends in yesterday which was very acceptable one chap got a flask of what he thought was brandy but upon sampling it was found to be something entirely different.<br/>Also had a xmas pudding between 3 of us which stuck to your ribs and was not at all hard to take.<br/>I had a bit of breeze with the capt yesterday went in to get paid the large amount of &pound;1 and my way  way of saluting did not please his majesty so he made me do it 6 times and gave me to understand that if I didn't hand it out properly on the seventh he wouldnt pay me, I didn't &ndash; so I grabbed my pay book and pulled out, he called me in later on and after</p>
