6/12/15Rheumatism in feet and dysentery.  Small troubles though and probably due to getting soaking wet last Sunday.  Field bakeries in full blast this morning being one long line of fire.  Aeroplanes landing and setting out circling round to get the required elevation.  Crows are very prevalent on the island, some partridges and a few smaller birds of different kinds.  Owls hooting round the camp at night.  Received word just before bed [indecipherable] would take 80 more cases for Anzac
7/12/15Turned out at 0455 in pitch dark & got down to wharf.  Stacked boxes on pier and subsequently on trawler.  Sailed at 0700, passed French warship with heavy fighting tops and several of our own meno'war.  Made Suvla Bay at 1100 amid some shelling.  A well defined "street" and many dugouts for which a great rush was made on each shell burst, "Royal George' & "Glory" in harbour, had to heave to a couple of times for mails &c.  Pinnaces brought smartly alongside by midshipmen.  Both of these boats looking very shipshape and smartly uniformed officers pacing the quarterdeck.  At 1200 pulled into Anzac.  From the sea the cliffs look impossible and the enemy trenches on Chessboard &c.
