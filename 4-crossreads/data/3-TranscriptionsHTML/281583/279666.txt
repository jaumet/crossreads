<p>6.10.16  Friday</p>
<p>Still raining &amp; windy &amp; very unpleasant generally. I kept indoors as much as possible to try &amp; keep warm. Our stove was fed with coke until it became white hot.</p>
<p>There has again been a disruption in the Train owing to O.C. ordering a Staff Sgt to revert to his former rank of Corporal. He is lodging a general complaint &amp; we are all watch the result with interest. Fighting is very quiet on account of the rough weather which makes all observations impossible.</p>
<p>7.10.16  Saturday.<br/>These two days have been occupied in moving camp again. It was decidedly a very annoying &amp; disheartening order as we were very comfortably situated for all wet weather having a nice big room, but now we have to go &amp; live under a tarpaulin again. However after a fairly strenuous time we managed to rig one on a frame work of wood.  It was a solid job as it was raining &amp; windy &amp; each time we managed to get it in place the wind would get it &amp; away it would go.</p>
