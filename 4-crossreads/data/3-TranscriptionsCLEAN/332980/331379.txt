  
 Train bound for Perth, Several nice Scotch People joined me & at 9.15 am, the Train started, & I had a very enjoyable ride passing through: a lot of Rocky Fern Country with beautiful Scenery in the distance, a number of large Brick Works were passed en route & Gardens which all had a large plot of Rhubarb growing also Raspberries, the High Hills with large Towns with the tall Smoke Stacks looked very nice, we passed through the districts of Larbert, Bannockburn & Stirling were we stayed 15" & off again passing over the Allan River to Dumblane & after 1 hours run the Train steamed into Perth on time viz 11-40 am where I had a Cup of Tea & a Sandwich at the Welcome Barrow, after obtaining particulars of the whereabouts of the Soldiers & Sailors Home, I passed out of the Station & up over a Bridge & in a few minutes arrived at the Home where I booked a Bed for the night, & after a Brush Up, I took a Train, which are very old fashioned & quite a contrast to the Glasgow Trains
