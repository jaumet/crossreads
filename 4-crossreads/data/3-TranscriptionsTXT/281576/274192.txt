 Sunday Mar. 4/17  Glorious day.  Aeroplanes about in droves.  5th Div. Band played for Church Service.  Fine music. 
 Mon. 5.  About 40 of the 8th with Maj. Wooster &amp; Capts. Irving, Catford &amp; Riley marched to Edgehill &amp; attended the funeral of Col. Williams.  It was a very simple ceremony &amp; he was put in a trench just the same as a Private.  The  Night birds" got another knock tonight.  Bob Roberts is going to the Anzac Show, so we are left without a Producer.
