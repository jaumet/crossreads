<p>I'll sing thee songs of Araby<br/>And tales of fair Cashmere<br/>Wild tales to cheat thee of a sigh<br/>Or charm thee to a tear<br/>And dreams of delight shall on thee [indecipherable]<br/>And rainbow visions arise<br/>And all my soul shall strive to<br/>Wake sweet wonder in <strike>your</strike> thine eyes</p>
<p>Where my caravan has rested.<br/>Flowers I leave you on the grass<br/>All the flowers of love &amp; memory<br/>You will find them when you pass<br/>You will understand their message<br/>Stoop to kiss them where they lie<br/>But if other lips have loved you<br/>Shed no tear- and pass them by.</p>
