  
 July 1917 from a tree next door, the old lady having invited another chap & myself to have some. It has been raining all the morning but cleared up after dinner. 9th   This morning the section went down to the lock & sorted out a lot more of the gear for pontooning.   Some of it is to be taken further down stream together with material for the pile driving which we will be doing in a few days. 10th   Nos 3 & 4 section went for a route march this morning for about 5 Km along the river towards Perone.   In the afternoon the whole Coy. was photographed by the French photographer in the town.
