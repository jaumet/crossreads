Wed 22nd May (cont.)A long, low barrack, flea-stricken and deplorably filthy, was to be my abode for the night.
One sleeps on a long shelf-like arrangement on which is scattered a very little matted straw.
This was at 4.30 pm - no food, bedding, or blankets were supplied.A little group gathered outside, (Bob, Pyne, Smithy, and Buck among others).  Buck., an angel disguised as a fat, chubby 3rd officer, pushed sustenance through the barbed wire in the shape of a large mug of tea.   While gulping the tea Bob gave me news that bucked me up.
None of Marconis people are in Brandenburg except one new arrival, all here have left for officers camps.   We are just to remain here till verification of us comes through from London & then, again, we move.   Quite a number of officers here awaiting their removal to officer's camps.   So our stay in this sylvan retreat shall perhaps be short.
