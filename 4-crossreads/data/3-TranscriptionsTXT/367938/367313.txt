 I have had a mail from you, Con &amp; Mother dated Ap. 13th &amp; a Sunday Times wh is much in request from the others for the latest [weights?] &amp; times &ndash; The life &amp; descriptions of dresses appear very paltry to us here. Letters are nice &amp; eagerly looked for &ndash; We know there are some more kicking round but they take a long time to get here. 
 Please thank Con for the letter &ndash; the name &ndash; the regiment &amp; M.E.F. is sufficient address. I only have 7 or 8 envelopes left so cannot expect to do nearly the amt. of writing I intended to. Next week will be too full of watching to do any writing. 
 Impossible to write to the people who ask me to especially girls who have asked for a line from the front. Am I to write about the headless Turks carried out or the flora &amp; fauna visible from this cave. There are no trees &ndash; low bushes only &amp; a yellow broom-like scrub &ndash; ants &amp; snakes &ndash; two kinds I have seen &ndash; Water is difficult to procure &ndash; no washing allowed of course.
