My Darling Eddy,
No doubt you have had a Happy Xmas   &  New Year by the time this reaches you. This is a picture of the place when I sleep. It is a very old   &  rather the worse for wear but we have comfy beds   &  that is a good thing these times.
We had another fall of snow the other morning but it did not last long. Looked very pretty but fearfully cold. Heaps of love   &  kisses  OOO  XXXXXXX From Auntie Eadle
