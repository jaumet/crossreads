  
 last  & tomorrow we are to leave (Six of us & one for Anzac Headqus). Three of the "Irish Contingent" are together. Good old times wev'e had & here we are off to France again. Legge, Palliser & I are in the crowd. Leave Lake who goes home & I start on purchasing a few necessaries, afterwards returning to the Y.M.C.A. club in Grosvenor Gardens    & have dinner. My last night in London & having lost the run of the others, decide to take a walk alone, at least seeing the now familiar Strand    & Hyde Park for a few hours. Enjoy the walk & return to my diggings. A few Belgian soldiers are here & as usual I have to act as interpreter & see to all their wants after which have a long talk with one of the Belgians whose French is very distinct & retire late
