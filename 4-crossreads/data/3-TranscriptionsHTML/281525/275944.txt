<p>2/11/17 Naples<br/>consisting of vegetables and vines. Crowds of people have lately been coming to Venice from Padua and other places affected by the enemy advance. Today was dull and the place did not look its best. Reached Pompei [Pompeii] about 2 and sat down to lunch in the restaurant at the station. Had just commenced when music broke out behind and I found 2 boys standing there with guitars or piccolos and they sang and played right through the meal. Passed through a turnstile into the village which is just like one expects after seeing so many photographs of the place and reading so many books about it. The pavements of the streets are worn into ruts by the traffic and the streets are well laid out &amp; narrow. The house of the Vetti is well preserved and really even now</p>
