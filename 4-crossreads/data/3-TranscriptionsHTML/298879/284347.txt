<p>March 1915<br/>Friday 19<br/>Caps issued to troops. They look real smart in them. Tomorrow military sports are to be held at Mena House grounds. A competition is to be held in the 2nd Batt. in drilling to see which is the smartest platoon. Appetites still good.</p>
<p>Saturday 20<br/>Orderly told us to get all our clothes ready to be fumigated for tomorrow at 10 oclock. We have to make a list of all of our things. Great scrambling. Arthur came to see me this afternoon &amp; brought an Egyptian friend who is studying for a lawyer. He gave us much information about Egyptian History most of which I had already read. Sister scooted them out of the ward as it is infectious.</p>
