which I had left, feeling that I had experienced a taste of Paris life.  Sweet but very high-priced.
I was very surprised on returning to the village to see shell-holes all over the place.  The day before I returned "he" had "straffed" it pretty solidly.  That was the only time he did shell the place during the whole time we were there, and I had been lucky enough to miss it.
A lot of our big guns were in this locality, which made the enemy a bit busy at times, but the village escaped with the exception of that one day.
While in this locality a big "stunt" was carried out very successfully by the 4th Australian Division, which resulted in the capture by them of Hamil and other important strategical positions, and was the start of the general retreat and subsequent final defeat of the enemy.  On this day July 4th. ' 18 no less than 2000 prisoners were taken by this Division.  Shall never forget the barrage which preceeded the attack, and I don't suppose those of the enemy who are still alive and heard it will forget it either.
Ten days after this action we move to a rather fine village
POULAINVILLE.
where we remain for about a fortnight when we move on to a pretty hot place, and a place where one keeps a close watch on the cellars at night time.  Many big guns are here and are not only for show either.
FOUILLOY.
which joins and is really a part of Corbie, is very much knocked about, bombing goes on a good deal at night and shelling is pretty continuous in the day.  Many bridges are here crossing the Somme, and "he" wishes to remove them, to delay our advance.
We are here when the memorable 8th. of August arrives and the excitement is intense.  The enemy is only about a couple of miles from us in the early morning, but by nightfall he has increased his distance very considerably, and is still intent on getting over the ground as fast as possible.
