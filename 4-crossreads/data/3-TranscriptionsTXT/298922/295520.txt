Sunday 29 July 1917
As the Regiment is broken into separate squadrons one in each Redoubt, no Church Parade this morning.
Septic leg better, a Camp is started at Port Said for Septic Sores 8 days each man in turn but I am only just back but a man's BOILERS cannot be too good after 3 years of Tinned dog etc.:-  The rations are better than ever were issued in S. Africa.
I am not grousing but once this Regt. left Galipoli not one single English decoration has been given, Romani Katia El Arish, MAGDHABA Rafa etc. a Croix de Guerre or Serbian Medal came this way, that is all. The men think a lot of these things.
