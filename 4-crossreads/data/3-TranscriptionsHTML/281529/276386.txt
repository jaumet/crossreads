After conference went up to Bn H.Q. with Matthews and from there went up the line and saw Major Dooley.   After conferring decided to let Matthews conduct the attack and returned to Ribemont with Miles.   It was a nervy walk as the Hun put some shells quite close enough.   Left Miles here and riding his horse went to Maricourt and had many adventures in the way of getting lost until I landed right back in Ribemont again on the other side of the River.  Made the pace from here to HEILLY where I called in at Bde H.Q.   Then went by road to Franvillers .   Heavy 6 guns were firing the flash and explosion of some nearly blew me out of the saddle as we passed close to their muzzles.   Returned to the Transport Lines and there met Murphy.   It was now raining dismally.   Rode over to Montigny reaching there at about 2.30 am. and found a billet in a house.    The old lady got up and let me in.    Charlesworth made a bed.   A rude enough place but better than an open bivouac anytime.   "The worst billet is better than the best bivouac" is a true saying and worthy of all men to be received.      My waterproof coat was well saturated and mud covered and I turned in tired out.   The bed was a wooden one of ordinary French type and its bugs soon joined my body lice in rendering sleep difficult.</p>
