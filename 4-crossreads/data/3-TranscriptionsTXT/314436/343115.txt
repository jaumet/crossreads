Miller also states in a general way that:  "Just after the hop over, the (the 17th Battalion) got between his front line and supports and got 600 prisoners without firing a shot being fired.  It was a husly-busly.  Met his supports with very little resistance.  Then struck his reserves on the railway line, and experienced there hard resistance.  Then we got right on to the hill without much wire.  Lots of losses from fight for the mount, masonry, and old aeroplane sheds, principally hand to hand encounters.
"The Third Division suffered considerable casualties.
"The old system of trenches helped us considerably.
"The 18th Battalion, after leaving the Third Division from Supports, came back to support the 5th Brigade;  that was in the afternoon after the counter-attack.
"The 18 pounders put up a barrage for a quarter of an hour(a), rather spasmodically, and on the Mount principally, and other strongposts, and the woods on the right.
"The 6th Brigade came through about 6 p.m. (?) on 1st September, and knocked Fritz back, going over at midday with an 18 pounder barrage.
