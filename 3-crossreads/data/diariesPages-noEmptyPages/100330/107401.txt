told some were left behind, they all looked a sorry lot, being Wet through to the skin, one Private smiled at me said Plenty more Fritz coming which was only to true as another lot of Officers Men came in during the Afternoon, about the same number they likewise was wet through. Up to dinner time I heard from a Driver that we had Captured St Julien a Village about 4 miles in Fritz's Country also that the French who were operating alongside of us had taken Steenstraate. We are now holding the 4th line of Fritz's Trenches, All day Thursday St Julien changed hands several times as it is still raining the Artillery is quiet, also no Aeroplanes neither Observation Balloons are about. This rain has been unfortunate for us as we had Fritz pretty well on the run now he has a chance to recover. Today Friday Aug 3rd 1917
