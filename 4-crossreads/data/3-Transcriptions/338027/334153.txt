<p>Tuesday, 23 March, 1915<br/>Left camp 9.15.  I rode Sammy and from the start he played up and bucked nearly all the way across the desert.  The transport went by road and we went with the Brigade across the desert to Maadi.  The Brigade had to fight their way in against the 3rd Bde of the second contingent who defended it.  The enemy sent out a small party to try and draw us into a semi circle but we routed them and then badly defeated the other brigade, driving them home in disorder, it was a splendid piece of fighting.  We arrived at Maadi at five and after stables had a good &amp; badly needed feed.  Sammy took ill and would not eat, I am disgusted with him, the transport officer threatens to have him shot.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 24 March, 1915<br/>Left Maadi at 8.30 am and I had to ride an old spare draught horse and lead Sammy as he was too bad to ride, but even that did not prevent him from pulling and making an uncomfortable ride.  We passed the Turkish prison at Tura, there are 9000 prisoners there and more are coming to-night as there has been another Turkish defeat on the canal.  After a nice ride but too many dismountings we arrived at Helouan at 2.30 pm and then had to ride a mile and a half from our bivouac to water our horses, Helouan is a great tourist resort but there is only one thing to see and that is the renowned sulphurous baths.  We were all tired and slept well that night.</p>
