  
 to come in and up to two o'clock this afternoon, we suddenly got orders to pack up as much of our gear as we had time to, and to clear out. We were only to be allowed to have the space of half a Motor Lorry. As with us so with all the other departments, each department was packing up their own gear. 
 The Sisters were all sent away without any of their own belongings. 
 The O.T. was the first to leave. We had packed up a Lorry to its fullest extent with Dispensary and O.T. stuff and just as we were getting out of the field, the lorry wheel stuck in a rut in the road and owing to the heavy weight on the Lorry we could neither get it backwards or forwards. This blocked the way for everything as the road was so narrow. The Col seeing what had happened came up to us in a towering rage, cursing and swearing as only he could do, but it had not the slightest effect on Bill. D. the driver. He was as stolid as an ox. There was'nt the slightest alteration on the expression on his face, till the Col. went away then he grinned as only Bill could grin, he having enjoyed the whole situation. 
 We had to unload half of the gear of the lorry before we could get it to start again. This we were no time in doing, all feeling the necessity of rapid action,
