  
 the finish placing us 2 points behind the "Birmingham" - Some strained relation afterwards existed between the two ships over such procedure but tho it was expected, it eventually fizzled out Aug 13th  At 10 AM the squadron proceeded outside for firing exercises, but before proceeding the 3rd Advance party was sent on leave. We returned to harbour at 2.30 PM. Aug 14th  We again carried out torpedo firing and various evolutions in the Flow during the day - the whole squadron taking part. Aug 16th  During the forenoon we coaled ship and during the afternoon Captain Dumaresq of the "Sydney" decided to carry into effect a Glee Party contested by the ships of the squadron, held on shore at the Y.M.C.A. Hut and adjudged by  a person from shore,- naturally "Birmingham" again won 1st beating us by 3 points - nevertheless the show was a complete success, and a credit to the Captain who was himself present and keenly interested - At 10 PM the squadron proceeded to carry out night firing.
