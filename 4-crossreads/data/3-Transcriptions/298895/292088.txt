<p>that if I wished I could proceed to a class for a comm. in the Infantry.  I turned this down however as the shock would be great at home.  My recommendation read- Sgt G. is well educated &amp; in every way suitable for a comm. etc  Has shewn himself adaptable &amp; capable in every branch of the military service etc. etc.  I consider his talents wasted as Sgt Dispenser in this unit.<br/>Saturday 7th July.<br/>  Went to the pictures again last night &amp; thoroughly enjoyed them.  On coming out we started copying some of the antics with the result I nearly broke my arm.  One of the chaps jumped on it when it was resting on a tree &amp; severely strained the tendons at the elbow.  I actually saw the renowned Charlie Chaplin here for the first time &amp; altho' he was not at his best I can well imagine his drawing power.</p>
