<p>Wednesday 11 April</p>
<p>On incinerator.  Inoculated at 11 a.m. which brought a fair sized lump on to my left arm.  This made me feel off colour for the rest of the day.  Snow falling in big flakes.  All are delighted with the wonderful news in today's "Daily Mail" relative to the great push at Arras.  11,000 prisoners captured.<br/>24th Birthday today.</p>
