  
 Tuesday 24th April 1917 Bapaume Harness cleaning and grooming. Took a load of broken wheels to ordinance store outside Bapaume. About a dozen observation Balloons up today (called "sausage" or "spotters" by the boys). They suggest some antediluvian animal rather than an appliance of modern warfare. These balloons are not dirigible; they are controlled by a powerful hawser attached to a tractor engine, which can pull them back to earth with wonderful speed when attacking aircraft are sighted.
