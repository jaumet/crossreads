<p>were obliged to march to the camp at Sutton Veny, three miles away, arriving there in time for dinner. Our party (that is the A.M.C.) are billeted in one big hut &amp; we soon had it fitted up &amp; comfortable. Five blankets &amp; a mattress were issued to each man. The tucker was very good, very much to my surprise, as I had heard bad reports from these Base Camps. Two parades are held a day, &amp; it pays to be present on these roll calls. All were inoculated against Influenza, on the 15th inst., &amp; black kits &amp; overalls for the boat were issued.   Friday the 21st inst. was the day chosen for the Quota to go on Leave, &amp; the next few days was spent in waiting in long queues for pay, clothing, &amp; railway tickets. It certainly will be a treat to get away from this Military existence for fourteen days. Reveille at the early hour of 5 a.m. on the 21st inst. &amp; at 7 a.m. the Quota march off for Warminster to catch the special Leave train, which departed at 8.15, arriving at Paddington, London, at 10.30 a.m.  I was great to be feeling a free man again.  I put up at the Y.M.C.A. Alwich Hut, in the Strand. The place is very comfortable, &amp; clean, meals &amp; bed were remarkably cheap. My first job was to visit the Base Post Office, &amp; you can imagine my feeling on being told on arriving there, that there was no mail for me.<br/>Dinner at the Hut, &amp; a very cheap meal it was too, three courses for 1/.  In the afternoon I visited Hooper &amp; Harrison Regent Street, &amp; they kindly forwarded a cable home for me. As I wanted it to go immediately, I had to pay 3/- a word, &amp; of course the code words that the firm used made the cable much cheaper, than if I had sent it from elsewhere. The next important job accomplished was the calling on the War Records Section Horseferry Road, with that History of the Unit, which I wrote out. Capt MacLean the Official Representative for the Medical Services, was extremely delighted with the epistle, &amp; could not thank me enough. He promised to have the account typewritten, on condition that he could keep one copy for the War Records;  of course I fell in with this idea, &amp; a few days afterwards, I called again, &amp; the job was completed.</p>
<p>In the evening I went to a Dance, held in the Ladbroke Hall at Notting Hill. The function was advertised at the Eagle Hut, Y.M.C.A. and the admission was free. Next morning I strolled round</p>
