<p>working close to us.  We have French troops also with us for the first time &ndash; artillery.</p>
<p>Wed. 15 May 1918<br/>Every precaution is being taken against shell gas attacks by the enemy.  After a busy day's work we have to go through drill with gas masks on for at least half an hour in the dark (commencing 9.30 or 10 p.m.).  The British respirator is a very uncomfortable thing to wear.  The French have recently adopted the type of mask worn by the Germans.  It is much lighter than ours &amp; the eye pieces do not dim.<br/>Yesterday &amp; last night we admitted <strike>quite</strike> 118 gassed, wounded &amp; sick patients in 24 hours.  These were made up of Australians (practically all), British, French, Americans &amp; German prisoners.</p>
