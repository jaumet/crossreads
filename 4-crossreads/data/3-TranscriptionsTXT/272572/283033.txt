fine, under orders & packed to leave. We left Dernancourt at about 10.30 & marched about 10 mile to Montauban [indecipherable] outside of  Bazentin, marching through Contalmais on. The march was slow & hard going, we repeatedly had to stop, traffic being heavy on the road, on one portion we werer shelled. We arrived at our Dugouts at dusk & turned in. Saturday November 4th we were at dawn & after breakfast we marched in fives (single column) about 2 mile to McCormicks post, where we went on duty carrying to the next post (Crest). We had some heavy carries, we got bogged with the first 4 men carry & had to get help. 2nd carry (6 men) we upset the patient, the mud being knee deep. We were shelled during day it rained at night. Sunday fine, 10.30 we moved further up to another post (1 mile) carrying there was better, though long, we were knocked up by night time, having had practically no sleep for 3 nights. Shells fall all round the posts. One carry my party met Infantry going "in" & in consequence, we were shelled all the way, one shell burst very close & smothered us with dirt. Monday done up (no sleep) showery we were relieved at 12 AM & went back to the Dump for 24 hours spell.
Tuesday 7th we left the Dump & went on duty at McCormicks post 12 AM it was raining & my dugout was falling in, so I went in with 5 other chaps in another dug-out. I spent a cruel night, I sat up as the floor was wet. Wednesday weather fine easy day for us, it rained a little. There is an abandoned tank near us, so we had a look at it. It is about 9 yards long (body) two front wheels, working on a kind of lever, it is about 4 1/2 yards wide 8 feet high, all the works were taken out so we didn't see too much. The armour is only a little over 1/2 an inch thick. Thursday 9th we were relieved about 10.30 & went to the Dump for our own spell, it is a nice day. I got
