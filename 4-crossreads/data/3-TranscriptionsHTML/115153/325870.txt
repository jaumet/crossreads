<p>for three days when I was marked by the Doctor to go on to Rouen. The C.C.S. was a siding to the railway line and we were carried by stretcher bearers to the hospital train which took a day and a half to get to Rouen where we were then conveyed to the Hospital by motor ambulances.<br/>I was in the No.11 Hospital at Rouen for 3 weeks, and during that time, while lying in my bed in a tent I happened to be able to see out to the main road that led to the railway station. It made me wonder when I saw, day after day, thousands of troops going to the railway station on their way to the front line, and they were all singing as though they were going for a holiday trip.</p>
<p>At this time Rouen was the depot for all troops that came from England. <br/>One morning a draft of us were shifted on stretchers to a convey of ambulances, and conveyed to the Hospital Ship "St. George" which was berthed in the Seine River. The boat left at 11 am and steamed 80 miles down the River to Le Havre where we stayed till dark and an escort came to take us across the Channel to Southampton. We arrived at Southampton the following morning where trains and motor ambulances were in waiting to take the patients to the different hospitals they were destined for. <br/>I did not have to go very far, as I was taken to a hospital in the same town in an ambulance.

<p>After I had been in bed 4 weeks I felt much better and began to walk about the Hospital grounds and sit in the sun, for it was grand weather at the time, being Summer. The remaining few weeks I was here I had a real good time, as I used to go our every afternoon either to Southampton pier or to one of the suburbs of the City. There were some very pretty tram rides that one could take around the City, and there were also some very nice parks that were worth visiting.</p>
<p>Our next move was to Dartford, a place about 16 miles out of London. At Dartford, I was able to get about a good deal,</p>
