<p>Later in the day I learned that the Huns had attacked along the whole divisional front getting a foothold in one place only at Lagnacourt where he pierced the 3rd Brigade lines but was soon driven out with extremely heavy losses in killed, wounded &amp; prisoners of war. Our battalion had succeeded in holding the attack everywhere inflicting hundreds of casualties, suffering very few ourselves.
