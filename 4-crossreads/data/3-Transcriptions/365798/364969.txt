<p>went ashore to see the "Town". It is not nearly as pretty as many of the other Island towns I have had the luck to see, but I daresay this is owing to being in the Tourist route. Had to be on board at 6 pm. Some 6 of us dined at the Grand Hotel for dinner &ndash; and Gee!! what a feed??! The best I have had for months.</p>
<p>Left T.I. at 6 am on Monday &amp; made westward for Colombo. Saw the last of Australia yesterday Wednesday 24th. I wonder when we shall see it again? There is a strong head wind now &amp; looks like freshening before long. I trust we are not damaged much from being on the Reef, or we may behave badly in a storm.</p>
<p>Were inoculated today 25th Feb, &amp; all our arms are very sore.</p>
