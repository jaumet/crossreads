<p>almost dropping. The trenches was impossible to walk along. Men were bogged &amp; had to be dug out. In going out we kept in the trench for a while, then got out, better to risk the shells than the mud. We made our way all right, when a flare went up we would all drop down. We went on for a few hours, with an occasional shell after us, at last we could not go any further so we just found a place if possible from the cold, &amp; arrived at the camp about seven am. It was easily the worst time I ever had, for three days we were covered with mud from head to foot, boots full of water &amp; trousers wet through. We left the camp &amp; walked to Friecourt &amp; put the night up in huts. The next day we came on to Ridemont, which is about ten miles. I could not walk it, so fell out, &amp; had the good fortune to get a lift the rest of the way. Ridemont is another small place full of troops. Yesterday I got another parcel from Wilfred. This afternoon we had a hot bath at a nearby village. The bath was much needed, the first for a few weeks. We are here in a tent, there is plenty of rain.</p>
