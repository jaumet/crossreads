<p>Sunday Sept 8. 1918. 1496.<br/>A fine morning.<br/>Capt. Toule was severely wounded last night.<br/>This morning the enemy shelled the Village alongside of us. There is a big railway siding here and a lot of enemy material. In a wood I counted 156 German limbers, wagons cookers and field bakeries. All in need of repair and were evidently dumped here for that purpose. There is a new double line railway built for war purposes<br/>most of the joints in the line have been blown up with slabs of gun cotton. He did this to the line at Clery-sur-Somme.<br/>I am on 3rd picquet tonight from 2 to 4.30.<br/>Today one of our horses was stolen at midday. Later in the day it was found in a horse artillery limber driven by Tommies. They had the horse camouflaged by painting a star on his forehead black, clipping his fetlocks and cutting No 118 on the hairs on his rump. Never the less driver Kiely recognised him &amp; claimed the horse. They at first refused to give him up but eventually did so.<br/>There are a lot of ammunition in dumps &amp; empty shell cases</p>
