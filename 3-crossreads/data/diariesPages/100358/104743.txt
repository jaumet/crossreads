Here we had to shelter from rather accurate prolonged bombardment from the German light artillery. He had the range of this road to a nicety. From here onward, a distance of about 700 yards, it was very slow going. The men, thoroughly exhausted, slipped fell and got bogged every few paces. We halted every few yards as each star shell lit the sky. The rattle of the machine guns as these flares went up, showed us that Fritz was keeping a good look out.
