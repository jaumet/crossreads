The Eng. native part of the town niggs. doss [?] in huts. People live well with beaut nig. servants. Got some Ceylon money little elephant as souvenir. One chap got one [indecipherable] about 20 ins. high, a beaut. Not near as much shipping as Port Said. Some of the nigs well educated, speak fluent English. The Cingalese are physically a better race than at the other two ports. They coal the ships out in the harbour off barges. A lot of young nigs scaling about the sides we had some fun with them boxing, singing doing tricks. A very beautiful sunset that evening
