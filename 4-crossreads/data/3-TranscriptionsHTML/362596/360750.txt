<p>France<br/>23/10/18<br/>My dear May<br/>I received your most welcome letter dated the 18/7/18 and I was very pleased to hear from you and to know you were all well at the time of writing. You will no doubt be wondering what has happened to me for not writing as I let about 7 weeks elapse without dropping anyone a letter but we were so busy that I could not find time and when I had time there was no paper or envelopes as one doesn't like sending field cards but perhaps they are better than nothing. Well May I have quite recovered from the touch of gas that I got but the last turn in. I got a few blisters but nothing to harm and you say you don't like the smell of it, the stuff they generate at the school, well there is a gas used over her that is a lovely smell it is just like pineapples and it makes one's eyes sore and run terribly, but our respirators are proof against any of it so we have nothing to fear on that serve.<br/>Yes, I heard Mum was going to the Wagga Show the trip would do her good, a change from Woobalong as it must be very quiet up there now.</p>
