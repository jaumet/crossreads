Sunday 23Move from Rouen at 10 pm after 14 hours stay to Caestre between Hazebrouck Poperinghe via Amiens, Albert Achut Arras St Pol & Hazebrouck. Journey not to comfortable
Monday 24Back to Steenvoorde where we were this time last year about. We marched from Caestre to here yesterday morning & spent the day & night in 1st Div Reinforcement Camp. Expect to join unit tomorrow.The 4th Battle of Ypres opened a few days back & the Australians are in the thick of it. The 1st Div advance about a mile with only 2000 odd casualties. 1st Field Amb had 26.
Tuesday 25Arrive at unit at Steenvoorde to find only nursing section here. The ambulance is much changed & the officers are mostly new.
Wednesday 26Walk to Cassel but did not see much of the town
Thursday 27The afternoon at Abeele to have a look for Geo. Peterson, failed to find him
Friday 28There is certainly a war in progress on the Ypres front & ambulance casualties are usually at about 30% to 50% equally as heavy as infantry.The bombardments are very violent & these moonlit nights favour nightly aerial work on both sides.
Saturday 29Another walk to Cassel & back by the great moonlight which we are enjoying now. The weather has been glorious while here, fine days & moonlit nights.We are moving up to A.D.S. tomorrow. The artillery fire has been very intense of late
