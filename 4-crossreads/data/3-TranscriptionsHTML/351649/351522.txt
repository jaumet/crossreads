<p>as I do not propose to stay in these rooms much longer as I shall be definitely doing something in another week or so:  however I made up my mind not to decide until I had been here two weeks, but one week and one day in London is just about enough for me after 5 weeks loafing on the steamer.</p>
<p>We had an uneventful voyage home, and no excitement of any sort:  there were not many passengers and not very interesting at that:  we had rather a good men's four, who stuck together all the time and made our own fun:  also there were two nice women on board, Mrs. Fred Fairburn &amp; Mrs. Ernest Bruce, both of Melbourne.</p>
<p>London seems cold and foggy and sore throaty, there are a few holes in various parts where Zeppelins have dropped bombs upon the buildings, not much is ever said about these Zep raids so people don't relish the thought of being blown out of bed when so far away from the Actual Fighting line:  long before you get this letter the rotten Dago Greeks will have come in against us:  perfidious &amp; treacherous dogs.</p>
<p>Remember me to Lloyd Brent:  tell Tom not to forget my &pound;12/12/0 to the Melbourne Club due Jan. 18th.  Best love &amp; health,</p>
<p>Jock Ellis</p>
