10/5/18 Franvillers 
Orders (and wise ones) came that all men were to be quartered outside the town. There were very few shelters of any sort but the weather is mild not likely to bring much rain. So I ordered everyone out into a grassy paddock and bivouacs sprung up alround. Made the men dig into the back of a trench. After breakfast rode over to the Wood which was crammed full of tanks, men and transport. The Boche dropped some bombs round about it early this morning. Came back into the town and had some lunch and then had a good ride around the wood again. Returned to the village and had a yarn with an old lady of 80 years who still stays on here in spite of the closeness of the firing line. Today has been most enjoyable in the way of enabling one to ramble around and see the country. Moved out in an open field and bivouacked in a clover patch under a trench shelter. Very wrath with Brigade for not supplying any better cover than this and intend to move tomorrow unless there is an improvement generally. We had dinner right out in the open. The rations went forward at about 7.30 pm. He was heavily strafing some of the villages during the afternoon. With King and others discussed Egyptian Ceylon days.
