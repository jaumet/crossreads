<p>ticket 9 /5 1/2d and at Colchester missed my train while having a cup of hot coffee. I sent a wire to Ipswich to the S.M. to get my haversack which I left on the train. I will have to wait at this station for the next train which goes at 2pm. Arriving at Ipswich I found that my wire had only arrived when the train was going out consequently my haversack was not there. On reaching Thorpe Station I found it in the parcels room. Then I bought a 2d ticket and took the train to the village of Whittingham and started to walk from there to the Annexe War Hospital</p>
