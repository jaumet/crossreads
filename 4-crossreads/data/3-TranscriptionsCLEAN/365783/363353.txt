I drove back to Kandy on my own.   It rained nearly all the afternoon.   Most of our shipmates had left Kandy, Col. Syme, Majors Dunhill & Summons & I were the only officers still at the hotel.  There were also about a dozen nurses & half a dozen of the rank & file.   Late in the afternoon I took a rickshaw to the river & saw four elephants bathing in the muddy water.   Turned in soon after dinner.Next morning (29th inst.) left Kandy by the 7.15 AM train & reached Colombo about 11.   On the way down it was pretty misty but we occasionally got a glimpse of the magnificent mountain scenery.   Saw plenty of rubber tea & cocoa plantations.   The rice is grown on the mountain sides on a series of terraces.   Arriving at Colombo I made for the telegraph office to see whether there was a cable for me.   They told me that there was not one.  Soon after this I met some one from the ship who told me there was a cable on the ship for me - so I bustled back to the telegraph office & saw the officer in charge.   He looked through the cables recently received & found the one telling me that you were all well & that you were leaving by the Demosthenes on 6th Jany.   Going back to town I made a few purchases at Cargills (two shillings for a writing block) had lunch at the G.O.H.
