<p>March 1916<br/>We passed quite close to the English Channel &amp;  the masts of some sunken vessel could be discerned from the train as we passed through. We only touched the outskirts of Calais &amp; it looked a fine big place &amp; after we had passed Calais we passed an Aerodrome &amp; saw a big Dirigible Baloon &amp; its Hanger &amp; was the first Ive ever seen. We got out of the train at 4 pm on the 31st at a siding about a mile &amp; a half north of Hazebrouck. Throughout the trip we we treated well &amp; welcomed by the French people but like a lot of prisoners by our Officers for when the train would stop quards we placed along the line to prevent us getting out of our carriages &amp; were even stopped from buying bread or filling our water bottles. All the horrors of war could also be noticed during the trip for nearly everybody wore something black &amp; Women &amp; children could be seen doing mens work in the fields &amp; vineyards. At every station dozens of young women &amp; children asked us for souviners &amp;  near Calais the kiddies were crying out for bully beef &amp; biscuits.<br/>When we disentrained we were issued with rations &amp; <u>some</u> were allowed to fill their water bottles &amp; then we set off for our billets. We wandered about till midnight &amp; then had to sleep in a big barn at a place called Wollon-Cappel  [Wallon Cappel] &amp; then in the morning we went to our own</p>
