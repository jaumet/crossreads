16/2/19 Bonn Cologne
Left at 1.30 am and reached Cologne for lunch an hour after. Walked then to the Opera house and found that the little Scotch Corporal had not been able to get any tickets for Madame Butterfly so we told him to try the Magic Flute on Wed. Walked round the streets now full of Sunday promenaders and noticed a big park of motor lorries all newly handed over and under the guard of N. Zealanders. To the Apostles Church which dates from 1100 something and has a fine dome and lots of gold mosaic. Enjoyed watching the Sunday crowds and only had one incident of hostile looks. Picture shows and cafes crowded. Germania caf was full and so was Simplicimus so we had afternoon tea at the crowded E FC club item 1  m.
