Very interesting to watch the weeping & wailing of the 30 or 40 womenfolk who collected near the body - (cameras got busy.) In afternoon went from Bab-el-Louk Station, Cairo to Helouan, 15 miles south on edge of desert. Very interesting journey with Mokattam Hills on left & Nile on right. Helouan a pretty little place & great health resort - dry healthy air, hot sulphur springs etc. - Went over Al Hayat Convalescent Military home containing about 700. Saw a Bedouin Marriage Ceremony which was very interesting. Saw in an Australian Casualty List that Capt. G.L.B. Concanon had been killed at Dardanelles.
