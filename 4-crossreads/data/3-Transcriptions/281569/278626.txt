<p>Got up at 6.30 &amp; received orders to stand by for a trip to a place called Behnasa-el Ghebria 55 miles from here. I got the dispatches &amp; left at 9.35 &amp; finally got on the road at 10.5. The going was fairly good for the first twenty miles &amp; then after covering another two miles came on one of the 1st Regts sqdns camps at Samalut they informed me that the Regt HQs was another 3.0 mile so off again, the going now was very heavy &amp; sandy, made Beni Mazar at 12.10 &amp; found that I still had another 16 miles to cover before I finally got to my destination, finally got there after getting lost several times, crossed canals, deserts &amp; ran through graveyards, the camp is in the middle of a huge graveyard &amp; skeletons are laying everywhere, fooled around until 6.35 when I set out for</p>
