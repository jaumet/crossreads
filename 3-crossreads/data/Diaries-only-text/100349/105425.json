The enemy appears determined to regain these positions, he has already sent over several attacks; using bombs lavishly. Had some dinkum stoush with a party this morning showers of egg bombs fell around, but our good old Mills Bomb was too much for him. Reincourt is in front and Bullecourt is being pounded into dust. The enemy shells us furiously and use many "minenwerfers". We are holding a desperate salient here.
4/5/17.
The Boches here are giving us one hell of a fight for it. Fighting backwards and forwards with bombs. We use thousands of them. Have been carrying supplies of them today through a heavy barrage. Don't know where I am now; cannot go observing the scenery these stirring times there
