first I have had for ages
Done a bit of shopping in town this afternoon bought an inkwell for travelling, ink, cigars, & a diary, now I will have to buy another fountain pen when I go on leave to replace the one I had stolen.
The more I see of the average Tommy the more I am beginning to hate & despise them, it makes me mad to see them calmly sitting down in the bus & women standing all round them, do you know I have scarce seen a single one of them yet, rise & offer his seat to a lady young or old, & these are the people who dare to run down & criticise others, theres no doubt we Colonials have our faults but thank heaven they don't lean that way, & when it comes to little acts of courtesy our lads know how to behave themselves.
