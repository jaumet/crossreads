<p>Boat on the Water. I went along Aft and strolled amongst the Married Folk who were making themselves very comfortable in their Deck Chairs &amp; on the Hatchway.<br/>Monday 23rd <br/>Weather still fine and clear with only a few boys sick, although a large number of Women were Sick and very quiet. The Sea was very calm all day and the Boat was rolling slightly, during the Morning a Life belt parade was called but was messed up as the boy's did not know were to line up and after a lot of barracking at the Officer's expense they were dismissed and after instructions were issued we paraded again at 4 Pm with out belts, and was more satisfactory. Up to date the quantity and quality of food supplied to the Troops is very good and all are satisfied, likewise the parading of the Mess orderlies is now satisfactory and all grousing is done away with . After Tea I went aft</p>
