Yesterday all day along the whole line the enemy attacked heavily but was repulsed with heavy loss, about 100 Turks left their trenches last night at 12.10 & attacked Walkers Ridge, then first of all struck our outposts who turned them to our right where they struck Popes, rifle fire laid them out & they retired (into our MG) in disorder, meanwhile one of our MG had been placed outside the parapet with this gun we either killed or wounded every man, 35 dead can be counted opposite Popes alone, 3 prisoners were caught & two officers, 1 Turk & 1 Ger no information could be gleaned from them.  The French made important advances again today at Helles.  Artillery gives us blazes again all day & High Explosive has been landing in our cook house but luckily no one was about, at the beach they got it pretty warm.  Snipers again prevalent

During the night a most violent thunderstorm came over from the South & our friends on the other side made the most of it by attacking but they only got bad for their pains, Enver Pasha has resumed command of the Turks again & has ordered us off the Peninsula at all costs.  Advanced report from Helles today says that during the last two days the Turks have left 1500 dead on the field & they are getting greatly disheartened their equipment is also of the worst, canvas most of it & some have only slippers for boots.  Met Eric P & went to the beach with him to try & find out about Pere, things are booming again at the Cape & the heavy guns have taken up the music again, a heavy sea has been running all day & has caused some damage amongst the works on the beach  Created a bomb proof shelter over the Signal Office.  Snipers got three this morning.  Only a couple of hundred shells today
