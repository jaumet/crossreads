<p>Friday September 28. 1917. (1152.)</p>
<p>This morning is cold and frosty, and there is every prospect of another nice day.</p>
<p>After an early breakfast we were ready to start at 8.30 which we did punctually. We slept in an old French barn along with the band. We had plenty of clean straw to sleep on.</p>

Many of the shops we passed yesterday &amp; to day had the sign displayed in large letters "Debit de Boissons".</p>
