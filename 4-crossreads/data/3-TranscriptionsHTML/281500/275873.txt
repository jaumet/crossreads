<p>Nothing eventful occured during the night but the fun started at day-break for we could see Germans all over the place, we grabbed our rifles &amp; into them we had quite good fun for a good hour &amp; dropped a fair number of the Huns, I know of one I accounted for &amp; Len got 3 more they had evidently been out on a working party &amp; had left it too late coming in so we socked it into them, it was dead funny to see them toppling head over heels &amp; ducking in &amp; out of shell holes as our bullets whistled past them.  I first saw the Huns just as day was breaking I was looking out towards their trenches when something grey &amp; moving caught my eye.  I guessed what it was straight away &amp; got all the boys ready</p>
