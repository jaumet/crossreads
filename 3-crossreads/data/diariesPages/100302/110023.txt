Stand to arms at 3 am. Went right round and inspected everyone. Not very many on fatigue today, it is first rest some of the chaps have had for a long time. After breakfast went down to Battn office and received particulars of Brigade raid 230 strong against 400y trench, which I am to lead. Poked round all morning and went up to observing station and had a look round the rear of the enemy trenches.
Artillery fairly active salvos of heavy stuff going over towards the town but our guns replied in kind. Balloons planes up. After lunch attended a conference re the trench raid tonight. It commences at midnight and a new departure is to be made in this respect that after all is quiet another intense bombardment will commence. It is anticipated that the enemy will be curious as to damage done and a good cluster will go along to the trench after our party leaves. Our shelling ought to catch these people. 
The Coy. stood to arms at 11.45 and punctually at 12 the shelling commenced ? our guns lashing out in fine style for over half an hour. At times the noise lulled temporarily but all the time it was scarcely possible to hear the voice of the person next to you. Lurid gun flashes lit up the whole sky in a wild illumination. It was a good sight.
Our raiding party failed to make a success of the job and did not reach the enemy wire. The reason given was that hostile machine gun fire prevented their further advance but only one man was hit and that slightly. It is considered the failure was due to loss of nerve by the officer. Our bombs did good work.
The enemy retaliation was slight resulting in 1 killed 3 wounded for us. At 1.30 the one minute intense bombardment commenced and was a tame affair. The enemy played a searchlight right down the whole of No Mans Land and it was a tiresome stand to and all were glad when it was over. The smoke from the guns was not very noticeable.
