<p>[Transcriber's note:<br/>This diary covers the period from 6 December 1916 to 17 March 1917. Though it gives little detail about the fighting, it vividly describes the bitter conditions of that winter on the Somme and the discomfort suffered by the troops with their inadequate food, shelter and clothing. It also gives a picture of Private Harris's daily life, with comments on officers and men, the importance of letters and parcels from home, a longed-for "Blighty leave" that did not eventuate, and daily updates on his pay.<br/>The diary is almost in note form, with little punctuation and few capital letters. Line breaks have been introduced in the transcription to assist with readability.]</p>
