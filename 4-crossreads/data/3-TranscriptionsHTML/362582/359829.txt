<p>4.<br/>over a month since I got the last letter. Received one from Dorothy yesterday &amp; she was expecting to get leave to go to <strike>France</strike> England for a week or more. Also received letters from three other Officers in different Battalions. They were all over a month old, so no doubt their letters are held up. It is lovely to get letters from my pals (men) &amp; know they have not forgotten me.</p>
