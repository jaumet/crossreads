  
 November 1915 powerful, but I'm sure they havn't had the results from it they expect. We have had 2 men killed Corpl Macdonald with a bomb & Tpr Lawrence was shot dead accidently in his possie, 5 others have been wounded.  I received several letters during the week from Frank, Doug & Alice Sturt.  Artillery on both sides have been active.  The Turks shrapnel has done us little or no damage.  Several more reinforcements arrived during the week including Segt Fisher & Cpl Sullivan.  The weather has been unsettled & squally with odd showers of rain.  I wrote & posted several letters so as to arrive in time for Xmas & also received a muffler & a pair of knitted socks from Doles.  George Steggles came round to seem last Thursday.  He looks fairly well, his spell at Lemnos didnt do him any harm.  A fair bit of gift stuff
