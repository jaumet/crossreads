<p>when all the old trees in the avenue that is &frac34; mile long thro Busby Park are all in bloom all the world is going there &amp; after waiting an hour for a bus with standing room on it I take Tube to Shepherds Bush where no bush exists &amp; then tram.</p>
<p>I enter into the Court itself &amp; pass through the building See guide &ndash; then go thro the room Then see the Great vine 5 ft in girth at its root &amp; 4 ft 7 in 1 ft above ground Then the pretty Italian garden with its arches in shrub &amp; in centre its low fountain &amp; at far end its Venus hidden grotto. Then I go along the three grand avenues all opening from Kings window and edges with magnificent [indecipherable] &ndash; a quicker growing tree than beech.</p>
<p>Thence I pass along to Chestnut Avenue &amp; walk along to Teddington &amp; then retrace my steps &amp; walk to Knightsbridge (2 Kingston) &amp; meet a Socialists who yarns with me &amp; tells me to call in at Socialist Club Fitzroy Square &amp; ask for Mr Keel &amp; say Hayes sent me. These men I found for the most part to be idealists with impracticable philosophical ideas but a few of them were bomb throwers [by] Hegarty.</p>
<p>Finally reach home having had nothing to eat since breakfast &amp; having walk about 8 miles or more</p>
