I have just been in hospital here for a couple of days, the Doctor having sent me back from "Gaba Tepe".
10/4/15. A Company (only) of 13th Battalion left Heliopolis Camp at 7.15 p.m. and marched with band playing through Heliopolis to Palais de Zebbub (?) Railway Station (about a mile) and entrained for Alexandria. We were cheered by all our chaps at Heliopolis Camp as we marched out, and by the soldiers and crowd in Heliopolis - train moved off at 11.20 p.m. - packed pretty close in train and chaps sleep all over the floor and under the seats.

"Seeang Bee" - A Company of 13th Battalion and 2 Companies of New Zealand's and 1 Company of the 15th Battalion and 1 of 16th - about 1100 troops all told - great military activity in the Port - many transports, English, French and Australian taking troops on board - moved away from the wharf and anchored out in the stream - taking in cargo all night from lighters.
12/4/15. Left Alexandria at 6.30 a.m. beautiful weather and sea but still a little rolling made some men sea-sick - food good and plenty of it - no work only muster parades on deck - it is said we are going to some island off the coast of Turkey which we are to use as a base for operations in Turkey.
13/4/15. In Mediterranean - had a nice shower of rain - passed several small and apparently uninhabited Islands - were served out with 200 rounds of ammunition each - informed we are en route to Island of Lemnos.
