<p>Sat. Mar 8.<br/>The fourth officer of the ship was admitted last night with an inflamed appendix, but he seems pretty right again this morning. Jones is still pretty bad. "Poss" &amp; I gave him another anema this morning. Poor beggar he can't eat anything &amp; has to be fed thro' the rectum. The Matron had another few words this morning about the Pyjama washing, but nothing came of it. Murphy &amp; a few others paraded to the S.M.O. after Dinner, &amp;<br/>after a deal of argument the S.M.O. gave 'em 5 hrs to wash 6 suits of Pyjamas. Things are only middling. Poor old Yank is at Loggerheads with the Sergeant again. He doesn't seem able to do anything right. This ship is travelling slow. We only did 300 miles yesterday. "Poss" had a tooth out today &amp; is suffering from a sore Jaw.<br/>Sun.Mar.9.<br/>Poor old Jones died this morning at 3. Lakin said he died quite peacefully. Poor chap, it's mighty hard lines to die when only a few days from Home. The wind has freshened up &amp; the ship is rolling about a bit. Mr Morrison, the ship's officer is coming along nicely. Kelly, one of our patients is working in Yank's place as orderly &amp; he &amp; Cornwell &amp; I get on well together.<br/>This time next week the W.A.'s ought to be safely Home &amp; we hope to be on our final spurt Home.  I must try and write some letters before Thursday, so that they can go overland to Sydney. I wonder if Lill knows I am coming Home yet. What a glorious time it will be when I am actually Home. Even now I can hardly realise that in a few days I shall actually be hearing B.E. speak.</p>
