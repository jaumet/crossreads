MARCH 1917
14 WEDNESDAY
Fine most of the day, but rained
a little during the day. Cleaning
harness all the morning and
we went up & brought out our
guns from the old pits, & brought
them back to the waggon lines
for a couple of days spell before
going to Ploegsteert (Plug Street)
The 31st Battery relieved us at
our pits.
