<p>Sat Dec 6th:-<br/>278 miles of bad weather.</p>
<p>Sun Dec 7th:-<br/>We are making a course to go around St Paul &amp; Amsterdam Islands. 307 miles up to midday &amp; weather OK.</p>
<p>Mon Dec 8th:-<br/>312 miles today &amp; also maggots in the prunes they put to us for dinner. Of course there was <u>no</u> uproar.</p>
<p>Tues Dec 9th:-<br/>300 miles (dead reckoning). We are in the centre of a rainstorm. Hostile demonstration against the adjutant &amp;amp Colonel of ship. Missiles flying &amp; I must say some of the women are straight shots.<br/>I expect to see the adjutant's name on the next casualty list under the haeding of:- "Died from a bombardment of rope quoits, uncooked potatoes &amp; decayed fruit."<br/>At any rate he was posted "Missing" for a time after &amp;  the beloved Colonel carried out a strategic retreat.</p>
<p>Wed Dec 10th:-<br/>294 miles in wet misty weather.</p>
