<p>December 22, 24<br/>Divvy Transport there &ndash; drinking Cognac and Bitters &ndash; a so-called 'Liquer'.  Together they make a great crowd of rich vitality.  Lofty &ndash; the tall lean erratic diver and swimmer of Sylvestre Cappel &ndash; a typical Digger Transport Type, and a fine picture lazily lounging over his chair.</p>
<p>A rain-sounding wind in the trees, and a dull drizzle from black skies.</p>
<p>December 24<br/>6.<br/>Slow rare rain.  Yesterday a day of buying in Charleroi and Chatelat with one of "Q" men.  Result &ndash; after endless pilgrimages and two bon dinners of Chips and Steak &ndash; two bottles of Cherry Brandy &ndash; 63 F:  Box lemons &ndash; 9F:  and 3 Nutmegs for Rhum Punch 1.800:  6 Tins of Pears 27F &ndash; at the Canteen today, one larger tin 1.25 and Vinegar, Chicorie (a new vegetable) and stray odds.</p>
