 29 April 1918 Monday Moved at 3 A.M. Recrossed the J &amp; attached to Australian Division for a stunt-  We expected to go back for a spell-  My leave further off than ever-  Tonight we go back &amp; start fighting in the morning- fine Limey soil covers everything with white dust men &amp; horses look like millers- Don't worry about me we can't go on for ever &amp; I am fit &amp; well-  Love to all Your son Frank
