 Dear Lock, 
 Thanks very much for the&nbsp;[indecipherable] papers you sent along. &nbsp;It is a very queer case, and should leave a nasty taste in the mouths of the police even if they prove nothing. &nbsp;If they do, it will reopen the [indecipherable] business altho&#39; I think it has had a few set-backs of late. 
 I see things pursue their even tenor of their way in the shop and that weekly returns are satisfactory. &nbsp;The Govt seems to be making all sorts of arrangements to protect the public &nbsp;
