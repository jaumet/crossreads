 Thursday, 22 October, 1914 After stables I felt pretty badly so reported sick and was exempted from duty. 
 I spent the day lying in the sun &amp; late in the afternoon went below &amp; fell asleep. 
 The doctor came down &amp; on taking my temp, which was over 100, ordered me into the hospital. 
 I was the first to go into the hos. so christened it.  I received every attention there and the bunks were much appreciated after the hammocks. 
 Commenced to rain. 
 Friday, 23 October, 1914 I awoke feeling better &amp; spent the day writing to my mother &amp; Edith. 
 The Col &amp; Dr came down to see me, I think they dreaded I was a measel contact. 
 I read a few magazines until I fell asleep &amp; the Dr awoke me, and on enquiry as to health told me I could get up next day. 
 Rained all day &amp; previous night.
