Time is flying & I seem to have so much to tell you.Ada Crossley's husband is a Medical Officer attached to 29th C.C.S. so we see him every day.We are still very happy & comfy  Our boys are spoiling me. It is delightful to work with our own men again. The sisters of 29th C.C.S. are very handsome & well made girls, but they are awfully good & happy with us. I do hope we can stay here together for sometime.  The coloring of the autumn tints are magnificent but it is fearfully cold & the wind is blowing hard to-day, so the trees will soon be leafless.
