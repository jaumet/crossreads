<p>Saturday 13th October 1917</p>
<p>Arrived Southhampton tonight!!!  We did not <strike>arrive</strike> land too rough &amp; had to put back &amp; tranship from the <strike>"Queen Alexandria"</strike> to the <strike>"Antrim"</strike> a bigger boat &ndash; all night we were buffeted about, the Channel very rough. We make another attempt tonight. No Cabins last night &amp; no tucker, but I have a cabin tonight &amp; am on shore at Cherbourg now, sitting down to a good dinner. It's a big undertaking travelling in wartime.</p>
