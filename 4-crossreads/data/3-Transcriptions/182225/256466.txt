<p>Fine with a very heavy fog the heaviest I have ever seen. If you were walking along the centre of the road you could not see anybody on the side. About stables ect in morning &amp; we had a gas lecture &amp; practice in putting on gas helmets. Took the horses out for exercise by Stonehenge in afternoon &amp; I went on divisional forage picket at 4.30 pm.</p>
