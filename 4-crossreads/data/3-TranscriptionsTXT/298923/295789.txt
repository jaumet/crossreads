 3 May 1918 Friday Took up an advanced line from  C  squadron &amp; as usual got shelled.  Sole coming off boot, minor troubles worry a man, such as former &amp; never washing for days etc.  I carried the Mutual Store Plum Pudding &amp; Salmon till today &amp; then 3 Officers enjoyed it, as no rations have reached us for several days.
