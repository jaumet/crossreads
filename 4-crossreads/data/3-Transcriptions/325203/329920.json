<p>A WISH.<br/>I wish that I had lived in days gone by,<br/>With Thestylis and Corydon to play;<br/>To pipe my oaten flute and sing my lay,<br/>With brother shepherds in my songs to vie.</p>
<p>To be the sweetest singer would I try;<br/>In lilting lines describe the happy day.<br/>And when my song was finished, hie away<br/>To tend my flocks upon the uplands high.</p>
<p>For in these modern days we think too much<br/>Of worldly pleasures, selfish needs and fame,<br/>We only strive for riches till we die,<br/>And though there are a few who look on such<br/>As meagre aims, and try to play the game,<br/>I'd rather I had lived in days gone by.</p>
