 To the O.C. A.L.H. , Reserve Brigade Aerodrome Camp,  Zeitoun 
 Dear Sir Will you send a responsible Brigade Officer to take delivery of 51 cases of comforts received from Australia which we are instructed to hand over to your new Brigade and to which represent one third of these shipments in hand. 
 We will have two carts available for you at 10.30 in the morning.  Please see that your officer has this letter or your order to entitle him to receive and sign for the goods. The only condition upon these good is that should there be any private parcels within the cases (we sincerely hope there may not be) these are to be carefully re-bagged or re-cased and sent back to our store at Abbassis and for them you can retain our receipt 
 Yours faithfully For the various Australian Comfort Funds (Sgt) H.E. Budden
