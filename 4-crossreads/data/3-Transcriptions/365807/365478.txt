<p>have it, as it was probably one of the last written by the dear boy; it is dated two days before he was killed &ndash;</p>
<p>It was long in reaching us, &amp; it happens to be the only one signed with his full name &ndash;</p>
<p>We only got one or two letter cards before, signed "Arthur".</p>
<p>We are wondering how he died, probably went into action just after, or a shell may have found their trench!</p>
<p>I hope the thought of his bravery &amp; his duty done, will help you both to bear up bravely also, in this time of trouble &amp; sorrow.</p>
<p>Your loving sister<br/>F. Ferguson</p>
