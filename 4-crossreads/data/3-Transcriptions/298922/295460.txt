<p>Shifted Camp behind another Squadron for 2 days spell, but we are still in the front line &amp; see scrapping of various sorts each day. <strike>Air duels we do not shine in.</strike>  What we would like to know is, RUSSIA'S intentions. The Papers say Starvation Conditions exist here, all I can say re Army rations is they are sufficient. We would like to know the correct &amp; true position of the War, so much is cooked for our own digestion. Thanks for Local Paper &ndash; I get the HAY Grazier at times &amp; am still interested in Saffron, Thistles, Rabbits, Shire Council &amp; even who is Herdsman at CARRATHOOL.</p>
