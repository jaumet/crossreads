FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1919.
Fine & Sunny. Had early breakfast
and marched out of Sutton Veny at
8 AM. Got a special train from
Warminster at 9.30 and came
right alongside the "Anchises"
at Devonport at 2.30. Got a good
two berth cabin & with any luck
will keep it to myself the whole
way over. My word its different
from the trip over.
