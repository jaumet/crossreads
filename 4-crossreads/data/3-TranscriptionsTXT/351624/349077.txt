Both sides are nervous, the constant raids prove the necessity for information. Small lots of prisoners and weakly held outposts are changing hands, yet there are no indications of a big push. Even aeriel activity has greatly decreased. Mild weather, mostly bright days.What a contrast to last year's frightful winter.Left Lindenhock on 28th for St Eloc. I travelled by motor.On arriving  we dumped all our belongings on the side of the road and commenced a vigorous hunt for dug-outs.First party managed to lay claim to all suitable shelter and building material. Along came a tunnelling officer, explained he owned their new home and out they had to go.Attached myself to a party of ten and commenced preparing a sight site. Every man in the group had his view as to how the place was to be built, we were overwhelmed with supervision and when a carrying party was required, few responded. Drew out a suitable mate and searched trenches near-by. Managed to find a good dug-out for three.
