<p>I have received them weeks ago and only thought of answering now Anyhow I don't get them myself too regularly so the people at the other end must not Complain too much Have been reading "The <strike>Male</strike> Imperial Malefactor" quite good reading its mostly about that wicked Kaiser Bill of Berlin quite a good deal has been written about him during the last 18 months</p>
<p>Nothing to report. The whole front is safe and quiet so far</p>
<p>The Regiment is split up in pieces A Squadron is at HASSAN PASHA about 10 miles up the line B Squadron is at Naslet-El-Abid  C Squadron and Regimental Head Quarters are at Tukh-El-Kheil  one troop of C Squadron is back at EL-Minia. We are of course in constant touch by Heliograph Lamp and telephone. The mail for the regiment has a good journey. It comes to me at Head Quarters first I take out all mail for us and send it back to town to be sent out to A Squadron then it comes back to EL Minia   And sent out to B Squadron then back to EL-Minia Then the various details in there take what belongs to them and then it goes back to the Brigade PO. and from there to Cairo for other details.</p>
