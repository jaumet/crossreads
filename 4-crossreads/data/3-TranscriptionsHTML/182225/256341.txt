<p>Fine &amp; hot. Out signalling again all day. The 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery played the 26<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;football in the evening &amp; they beat us by 18-0. My word I never knew anybody could be so knocked up as I was after the match &nbsp;I was absolutely run to a standstill. It was a good game all the same &amp; will do us a lot of good. I got a parcel from Linda with some sweets &amp; socks and a book &quot;Aunt Sarah &amp; the War.</p>
