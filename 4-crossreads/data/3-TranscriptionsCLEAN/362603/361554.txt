  
 Angel Hotel, Liverpool. Letterhead Bulford 2/12/17 Dear Mum,  I have 3 letters of yours to answer but we have had such a cool day to-day that I could not write.  It has been fine & cloudless but too chilly to sit away from the fire & write.  Ellis & I went for a stroll around the Block after 6 pm & we have had Supper & Ellis has gone to bed. Our first parade is to be held at 8 45 am in the morning & during the winter months.  It will be nice & handy.  I will answer Your letters later in the week.  I am enclosing a few snaps.  I must drop a P.C. to Dad & George before "Lights out" is blown We are Happy, Mum Dear.  Do be the same.  We are just O.K. Lots of Love Harry
