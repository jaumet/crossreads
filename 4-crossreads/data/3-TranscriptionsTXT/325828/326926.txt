                         My second reason is that I will get my leave to England just about twice as quickly while I am on D.H.Q that than I would if I transferred now.It is alright Rid & I being so close together like this.  Last Saturday afternoon he came over to see my & we were outside on the grass in the shade of some trees.  It was a fairly hot day & as we sat there yarning it seemed almost impossible for a War to be ragingEverything was quiet, way down in the village the church bells were ringing for the Sunday afternoon Mass.  Occasionally the silence would be broken by the roar of a howitzer battery not too far away.It is getting warmer here every day, & I think we are in for a fairly hot summerI am keeping in splendid health now & I do trust that this finds you all wellI am enclosing a note for Ol in this letter.  Tell her I am sending her two XX this time & ask her if she received my last one with the 2 kisses on.I must finish up now,
