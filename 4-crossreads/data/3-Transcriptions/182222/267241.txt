Out of 1200 men only 40 of us were fools enough to march right up without a sleep on the track but am not sorry as most of the others are suffering from sort of low fever from the exposure to the jungle mist. This place a nest of deadly snakes &amp; brilliantly colored lizards.&nbsp; Spent part of day hunting fruit, snakes, monkeys etc. Monk is a simple proposition. You get some bananas &amp; some whiskey half peel the bs., soak in whiskey &amp; drop at foot of tree&nbsp;in sight of a family of cousins. The winner of the ensuing race&nbsp;</p>
