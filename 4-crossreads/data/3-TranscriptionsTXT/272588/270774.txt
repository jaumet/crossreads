 Monday 23 September To-morrow we are to move to Herbecourt preparatory to entraining for the West of Amiens. Yanks why they are here by thousands the 30th Division relieving us. Tanks are also here by the  the  dozens  &amp; soon I think the Hindenburg line is to be attacked &amp; I think carried by the enthusiastic Yanks. 
 Tuesday 24 September Glorious day.  Move to Biaches or remains thereof via Peronne &amp; thence across river at Halle.  Good march on good roads.  Possibly entrain to-morrow.
