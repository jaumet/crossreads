His was a particularly sad case being the last of a family.  He had three brothers drowned in a Submarine <strike> a fourth</strike>his father went down in a Cruiser &amp; his mother died from shock, truly enough to turn any mans mind.

<p>Once again our moving day.   At 3.30 P.M. orders came for 50 of us to proceed at once to Cape Helles for duty.  Here was our chance at last.    Overjoyed And in my own case as well, serious thought, we packed up &amp; proceeded by pinnace to the "Arragon" the headquarters ship.    Here I looked up my friend Andrews who instantly prepared me a good tea &amp; entertained me with some news.  At 8 P.M. we embarked on the "Hythe" a sweeper &amp; sailed shortly after for Cape Helles.</p>
