  
 Ypres 18/10/16  The "dinkum' arrived early and we issued orders immediately.  The 11  Northumberland Fusiliers took over from us and four of their officers dined with us.  We move tonight by train from Ypres to somewhere this side of Popheringe and then march to Ottawa Camp  (Gd4C65) and after short rest there we leave about 9am the morning after for the Steenvorde area in France.  The English officers very decent chaps and mostly all old campaigners.  Only when the Battalion has to move do you realise the enormous amount of baggage there is.  We have withdrawn one of the mens' blankets from them to be carried on motor transport and have to shift this with our own regimental stuff tonight.  All the officers baggage and cooking utensils as well as office gear, company stores, ammunition and machine guns to say nothing of cookers and the rations for 1000 men. With our original battalion full of trained men all this would be simple but as it is we have a corps full of young green soldiers and this march will be for them possibly their first on service.  During the afternoon I called up the company commanders and reviewed the orders with them and then having done my part, sat down to a game of patience.  The execution of instructions devolves on them and the man in the ranks.  Our guns have been fairly active today but Fritz has not replied.   Bairnsfather's  pictures of the last half hour before going in and before leaving the trenches are very true.  We have an unsettled feeling and cannot fix the mind on anything.  This is always so before a tour into the trenches or a shift.  One delicate matter I have had to fix has been a matter of rather hard potting among some of the younger officers and they had to spoken to straight out from the shoulder.  Their [indecipherable] officers got on to the cleaning up and all the chaps turned out of their billets.  The Tommies commenced to arrived about 9 pm and the CO.
