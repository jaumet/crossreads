Gradually they filed in &amp; I followed &amp; I was directed to a Table where two soldiers were seated, I asked permission for a Bath also a Towel, clean shirt &amp; socks when I was given a Ticket for each article. I gave the Lad a small tip for obliging me, then I had to go a Window &amp; hand in my three Tickets when I was given a clean Towel, a New Flannel Shirt &amp; new socks then I went into the Room &amp; undressed myself. This Room accomodates abut 100 Men at one time. Forms were provided to sit on &amp; Nails to hang the clothes on. After Undressing I went under the Shower of luke warm water, the Boys revelled in the Showers &amp; Soap was consumed in galore. The Boys were naturally dirty &amp; wanted a wash bad, After I finished &amp; dressed I handed my Towel, Shirt &amp; Socks in on a Table provided to be washed &amp; repaired by the Women at the Militiary</p>
