<p>[At top of page] Fondest love to R B &amp; self from your brother Ken<br/>Duchess of Westminster Hospital Le Touquet-Paris Plage France<br/>28th July 1916<br/>My dearest Sister,<br/>Again I am in Hospital wounded, I got it in the thighs, a German threw a bomb at a pair of us while we were chasing him out of his trench, needless to say he now occupies a plot of ground 6ft in length.<br/>Re the wounds, my left thigh has two holes in it both doing well - not causing trouble, can move the leg as I wish. The right thigh is a bit worse, having a deep gash underneath &amp; a couple of minor holes to keep it company this leg keeps me in bed, thank God no fractures so it is only a matter of waiting till they heal up.<br/>My thighs will be pretty well marked by the time I am finished wont they? Things are not nearly as bad as last time dear, I am in a beautiful Hospital "officers", the sisters &amp; V.A.D. girls are lovely, being very attentive, the food in fact everything is OK &amp; I am as happy as a sandboy. The organisation is grand behind our line here dear, I was hit in</p>
