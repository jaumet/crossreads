At about 4.20 we cast off with the band playing the "Marseillaise" and "Auld Lang Syne" the troops cooeeing and onlookers from the shore replying.

The ship's crew at once commenced their business of exploitation. 1 for a room & 1 franc for a dixie of tea. The confirmed gamblers spent the evening at cards and I felt a bit squeamish so got into my berth and read until late. At about 11 p.m. we passed the Isle of Wight and before midnight dropped anchor in Southampton waters off Netley Hospital.
