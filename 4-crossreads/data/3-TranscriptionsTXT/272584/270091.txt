an overcrowded [indecipherable] laying out in the Bay the coaling of the ship was a thing to be remembered 40 men with Leitenant Wagstaff decended into the hold of the collier dressed with trousers and Boots only we were nice and clean going down But you should have seen us coming up we were as Black
as the niggers ashore
the negro Boys here paddle out to the ship in canos and will dive into the water for pennies etc others row out selling fruite coconuts paw paw
we are now on the sea again with a crusser for escort and 7 other ships forming the convoy
