  
 back Jackie Hayes caught me & throwing me over his shoulder started to carry me to a place of safety but the pain was too much so I got him to put me on the ground & he helped me across, the funniest part of all is that I never heard the explosion of the shell I suppose the shock of getting hit took that away but I remember on looking round seeing 3 or 4 more chaps who had been hit & 1 lying dead alongside me Lieut Champion was also cracked, so she had been a pretty successful shell from the German point of view, when Jack got me over to a safe place he laid me on the grass took my tunic off & cut the shirt away & disclosed the wound, it was as lucky a squeak as ever you saw.
