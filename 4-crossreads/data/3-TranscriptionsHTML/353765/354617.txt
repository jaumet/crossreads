<p>3rd to 12th - <u>Turkish attack on Romani etc </u> give the Turks a lead into a trap. 1st L.H.B. as usual, relieving them. Shortly after m'dn't the Turks began the attack with rifle fire &amp; about 1.30 am. the Bde Major roused us to stand to horses ready to move out at a moments notice. Desultory firing till day break when rifle fire increased &amp; their shell fire started. About half a dozen taubes or hostile planes bombed camps &amp; tried to get the artillery as it was moving out. Not successful. Artillery not far from us &amp; Turks mtn battys tried to get it. Also tried to get L.H. column as it passed our camps. Shell bursting a few yards passed our camp &amp; had they burst a few yards shorter would have got over 100 wounded etc &amp; all staff as their target. Our men moved out at daylight &amp; were greeted with shrapnel, Bob Macdonald being the only man hit &amp; he slightly. Wnded came in early &amp; fast. Bombs dropped all round us. About ten A.M. firing eased &amp; their attacks ceased. Our men attacked &amp; drove them back in afternoon, cutting their front &amp; getting in a flank move. Hundreds surrendered. All thro' night a big gun probably 6" howitzer firing on railhead &amp; at a hod about 150 yds distant. About every half hour she would put in about half a dozen rounds. Two operating tables going hard all day. Difficulty in getting w'nded away by train so that were left on our hands. Worked till daylight began to peep then half an hour's snooze &amp; up &amp; at 'em again. Prisoners began to pass in droves of about 200 coming from all quarters. Couple of Turkish field ambulances captured &amp; one was attached to us treated Turkish wounded.</p>
