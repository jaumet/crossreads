It appears to have been written at the same time or at least on the same typewriter as the post card on page 45 which was date stamped 26 January 1918.  Both post cards were typed using a blue ribbon.]On Active Service Abroad

On this card is a donkey that people ride on in Egypt, you can see they are not very big, and the funny saddle they have on them. And you can see the woman with the jar on her head that I told you of them  carrying water in, you should try to carry things on your head and you will see how hard it is.  Goodbye little girl.From Dad
