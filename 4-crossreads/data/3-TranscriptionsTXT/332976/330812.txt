 March 1917 15th   We have had a fair amount of rain lately &amp; the mud has been very bad.  The wind has been blowing very cold from the north for the last few days &amp; last night we got a "gas alarm"   A few shells (gas shells) were sent over but the effect of them was slight owing to the rain &amp; wind.   Fritz was shelling us very heavy yesterday, but our own guns gave him a succession of heavy barrages during the night, &amp; to-day he has been rather quiet. There was a bit of an attack last night, but with not much success.   Fritz
