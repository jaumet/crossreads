<p>Wednesday 17 January</p>
<p>Up at 6 a.m., moved off at 9 a.m.  Snow deep on the ground and has been falling all day.  Marched through Buire, Dernancourt and Meaulte to the famous old Main Dressing Station at Becordel where we spent many a miserable day some weeks back.  Sleeping here for the night.</p>
