  
 both left at 6 Pm & after passing near Eypres & through Vflamintujghe a very much knocked about village containing troops only & no Civilians we eventually arrived at Peselhoek at 7 Pm & after obtaining the Pass & Order we put the Evening in at the Camp until 11 Pm when we started to go into Poperinghe to get the Train, it was a bright Moon light Night but very cold, we had only proceeded a short distance when along came a Motor Transport & into it we climbed & it took us right to the station arriving there about 11-30 Pm, as the Gates were closed & the train did not leave until 1-35 am, a large number of Soldiers, mostly Jocks were lounging about, some talking together in Groups & others laying down sleeping, as the Y.M.C.A. Hut was open we adjourned there for a Cup of Coffee gratis which was very weak & not sugared, one thing in favour of it, & that is it was hot, we got a Dixie full between us & some biscuits & we passed the time away until 1-20 am when the Gates were opened & the boys went through in Single File
