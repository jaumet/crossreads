 search for us . Silli cow they would never have found us in a month . We put the exhaust men to bed and after a good ?brek ? slept the sleep of the weari . The hors especi mine , came home fit and I rode old Zig-Zag again today . He is a great hors . 100 mile between hot dawn is good go in desert countri full of stoni ridg and heavi sand . It was all veri interest and some day Ill tell you more about it . It will alway be enshrin in my memori as a most interest journey : a glimps of the desert 's heart and strang peopl who from it scanti breast deriv food for their flock , herd and themselv . This letter is not for public for certain reason , but you can show it to your pal . Im feel veri fit and look forward as usual to a return home . " East , west ? home 's best " . With love to you all and especi your dear self , I kiss your hand Jack
