Now it is a serious crime not to always have our Gas Helmets with us, one in a special pocket in our tunic and the other in a satchel slung over our shoulders. Of course the Gen. had a staff officer with him. They came across a Sentry \"Ha, Sentry\" said the Officer \"How many helmets have you\" \"Two sir\" said the Sentry, \"You might give me one then\" said the officer and taking it, he handed it to the General. They went on a bit further and came to where a Sergeant had a party of men on parade. The \"eagle eye\" of the Gen. soon spotted that the Serg. hadn't a Gas Helmet, \"Ha Sergeant you on parade without a Gas Helmet, just take mine and show your men how to put it on, and report to me afterwards\" The sergeant took the satchel, and diving in his hand to get the Helmet, produced ----- a dirty towel and a pair of socks.) This is a fine big brewery where we are billeted. We can walk in and get a glass of beer, just when we fancy. Yesterday Mac, Stan Wright, Tom Davis and I went out to tea. Had a good feed of Eggs and Chips, and Brian Aspinall shouted us a bottle of champagne, which greatly improved things.
