<p>district as the lights are nearly all out owing to Zeps,   &amp; you have to "watch out" for the traffic.  One of our men was killed here the other night &ndash; he was a scotch man but had been 2 years in Australia.  He had been married 3 weeks when he got killed. I was one of the men picked out for the firing party   &amp; about 1500 of the men went to the funeral.  We had a large band   &amp; massed bugles blew the last post after we fired 3 volleys over the grave.  Ask Papa to get me a ticket in "Tatts" now   &amp; again will you when there is any of my money over after paying my insurance.  I wrote to him asking if he would write I was in Malta but don't know whether he got the letter.  Hoping you are all quite ok with love to all<br/>from your affectionate Brother<br/>Charlie</p>
