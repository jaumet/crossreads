 We left Roquefort at 0900 meeting the Brigade Staff and started off seated upon two motor buses. We picked up the Divisional Staff and Generals Holmes and Watson. It was a delightful morning and very pleasant riding upon the top od the bus, the country was much the same as we had known already but as we progressed towards the firing line it became very much more marshy and flat and uninteresting comparatively speaking. We passed through the Forest de Steenbecque and also through a long avenue of elm trees. 
 Such churches as we passed had there churchyards closely packed with crosses &c. They evidently bury the dead one upon the top of the other. Nearly every tomb has its headstone shaped as a crucifix and we passed many images, one was very lifelike the cross being sculptured to resemble an elm tree and the figure upon it lifesize. Glass cases containing wreaths are common in the churchyards. 
 Just past Melville we struck a military burial ground full of graves and wooden crosses and here abouts we saw trenches and entanglements, all quite rudimentary compared with our Dardanelle ones. Revetted with brushwood they were very shallow & full of water. The appearance of the whole place hereabouts is that of where a heavy bog has been - all saturated and muddy. 
 Plenty of motor transport plugging along. An aeroplane did a very fine landing in a field close by and we saw 6 high up following one another. Further on we saw a 'plane being bombarded surrounded by fleecy bursting German shells which seemed very thick round it. Intermittent reports of guns all the time. Right up to the firing line the commonfolk carry on their daily avocation and most of them are undesirable and distrusted very much by our people as treacherous. In the event of a retreat the fate of these folk must be hideous.
