<p>Sunday 6 August 1916<br/>After packing up Col. Fuller's private things I left with Him in a Sand Cart for Rail Head where He laid all day awaiting a Train.  The rush of Patients during day kept both Drs. &amp;amp; Orderleys very busy.  They have had no rest for 3 days &amp;amp; nights.<br/>Major Bruxner is left in charge of Regiment.<br/>News came through that Enemy had retired to Oghratina leaving Katia clear.<br/>Infantry went out during Saturday night to overtake Enemy, but failed, many [indecipherable] up.

<p>Monday 7 August 1916<br/>My Birthday<br/>This morning at 12-30 (midnight) we commenced entraining the wounded &amp;amp; at 2-30 a.m. left for Kantara.  The journey was awfully rough &amp;amp; our poor men suffered agony.  Train arrived at Canal at 5-30 a.m., where ambulances met &amp;amp; conveyed party to Clearing Hospital.  Casualty Station 26.  This place is in a most unsatisfactory state, both the staff &amp;amp; equipment being very poor.  Fancy keeping men with dangerous wounds lying about for days without treatment.  There is no hope of us getting away from here before to-morrow.  There is no place like our own Hospital manned by Aus. Girls &amp;amp; Drs.<br/>This place is run by Tommies.<br/>Sent Cables to Aus. &amp;amp. Mrs. Chisholm.</p>
<p>Tuesday 8 August 1916<br/>Lieu. Britton returned to Camp, getting the Col. ready to leave by Ambulance Train for Cairo.  He expects to arrive up there midnight.<br/>I returned to Camp by 4-30 p.m. Train with Ser. Wilson, who was in charge of Officers Requisites.<br/>Regiment left El  Maler for Bir el Abd where fighting was being carried out.  They expected a scrap with Enemy at 6-30 a.m. to-morrow.<br/>Brig. Royston accompanied Brigade.<br/>Drs. refused to operate on Col. Fuller owing to Bullet getting behind knee among arteries.  X Rays was necessary to locate Bullet.</p>
<p>Wednesday 9 August 1916<br/>Went to Rail Head with limbers for Beer &amp;amp; Whisky.<br/>Cleaning up <strike>Camp</strike> Tent &amp;amp; surroundings all day.  Lieu. Close in Charge of Camp.<br/>The Brigade attacked Bir el-Abd at 6-30 a.m. &amp;amp; the fighting continued throughout the Day.<br/>A Train of Camels left Camp for scene of Operations with Food &amp;amp; Forage.  This appears to be the final dash as far as we are concerned for some time to come.  The Turks are retreating rapidly whilst putting up a splendid Rear Guard action.</p>
