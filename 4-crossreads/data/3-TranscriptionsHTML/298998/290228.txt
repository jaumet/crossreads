<p>possessed a small tin of meat and several rations of black bread. Later the soup arrived and with it the odious smell of decomposed fish and vegetables, which sickened me. The Russians and many Englishmen, ate the stuff greedily and with apparent relish.

<p>21st &ndash; 31st   Numbers of men have returned from reprisal camps, 600 arriving in one day. Thousands of parcels have arrived recently but the bread is mostly mouldy and unfit for human consumption. The men are all in a frightful state, starved, sick, filthy; their clothes</p>
