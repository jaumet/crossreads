One Joe Ford, a cobber of mine, was going for a wash when a big brute started up in some cut grass. Joe went one way, snake another, but he was nearly on the brute. But the big joke occurred at night. Our section slept on balcony- verandah over the slope. Under the hut is an old cordial plant. Iron roof lies about 1ft. under boards. I spread w. proof out & lay on it. During night woke suddenly. Heard one of the boys swearing & at same time some reptile slid under me, below boards, stopped, seemed to circle & next thing tapped me smartly between shoulders. He was merely trying a broad crack over which I’d spread my sheet. I jumped several yards & landed on sundry gunners, who woke & cursed me. Someone else repeated ‘snake’, the chap who woke me up yelled "Dinkum – Snake , boys, he crawled right under me – – ear!" Then the rush started & in ten seconds the MG’s were all inside the hut. This morning a Jamaican told us "big snake under this floor – zin look out for that one"
