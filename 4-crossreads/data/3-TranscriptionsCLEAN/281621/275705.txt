  
 July, 1917 Sunday 1 Hampton Court on the river & later at Richmond. The river at Hampton Court is very beautiful & some of the side drains especially nice. 
 Monday 2 Torquay Devonshire at last. The run 200 miles in 4 1/2 hours is most glorious. At "Kister" Somerset is particularly nice as well as Devon. We stopped at Westbury, Taunton, Exeter & Newton Abbott. 
 Tuesday 3 Torquay is a beautiful town, situated on the shores of Tor, bay, & presents from the bay a very fine aspect. Its houses, fine as they are rise up tier after tier from the shore & are almost hidden from view by the very heavy foliage. The coast is particularly rough, the cliffs being of red 
 Wednesday 4 sandstone. The "Princess Gardens", pier & pavilion are also very nice. Devonshire cream & fruit need a chapter by themselves. At Cockington, I saw peaches, figs, grapes tomatoes, cucumbers & melons grown under huge glass houses, in the "Fruit Garden" 
 Thursday 5 Further west is the seaside resort of Paignton, smaller than Torquay yet equally as beautiful. In fact it is purely a place for pleasure & it has been built with that idea. Dellers Cafe is very chic & the music also very nice. 
 Friday 6 For the last week I have been having a most glorious time in & about Torquay, Oddicombe Baltacombe, Cockington Paignton. At Cockington the house of the old family of Cockingtons, the church, village & fruit garden are most interesting. Along the coast the scenery is grand made 
 Saturday 7 up of red cliffs. Tennis with a couple of girls at the house is the mornings recreation. Great air raid on London to-day & wild rumours reach us as to its severity. Dellers Cafe at Paignton is unique. One of the most remarkable things about Torquay is that there are two gum trees growing & doing well & tropical palms also down
