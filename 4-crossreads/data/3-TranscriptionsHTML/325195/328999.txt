<p>9.11.15<br/>Tue 9th<br/>The Turks have been very busy all day trying to get a shell onto the old paddle wheel boat stranded on the shore but so far they have expended a large quantity of large shells &amp; only secured two or three hits. With the exception of a few shells flying &amp; occasionally a warboat opening out everything is very quiet; Our spare time is generally put in playing dominoes, cards or writing; the long promised trip to Lemnos is about to come off within a day or two.
