<p>received any promotion or extra pay but that <u>may</u>? come along later, anyway I am not worrying.  Ern Thomas is just outside picking grass to feed the bunnies.

<p>I have drawn a &pound;5 from the firm as I have to pay the servant a small sum &amp; I have no time to do any washing or mending now.  I am glad to get away from Bulford now.  This is a much nicer place in the summer time &amp; is healthier.</p>
