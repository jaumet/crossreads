<p>We only remained here about 2 days before getting a move on to Balloul a big railway station, where we entrained for the Somme.  We were bundled into trucks in fact there was that many in the trucks that we could not move, thank goodness we only had to do about 8 hours travelling and that was quiet enough, as luck would have it, it was night time and so we did not notice it so much as if we were travelling in the daytime.  We disintrained at a place by the name of Candas, and after a short march we sat down on the roadway to have breakfast, after breakfast we began our march, which I may say took three week's to do, because we were a bit too soon, and we were not wanted for a certain time.</p>
<p>Anyway our first billit in this part</p>
