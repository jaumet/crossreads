Aq had big clasps  -  Fancy wading thro this old Labrinth especially that of St.Thomas Aq  -  It was strike>hard  easy to read but how boring  -  Augustine would have a lot of history for he lived when Alaric sacked Rome & talked to fugitive patricians & plebs & has put on record the history of that frightful period  - 
 I saw his garden & promised to send him some terra cotta colored Bougainvilleas  -  I advised him to mass his Poincettias & get a big color scheme this way  -  Also Amaranthus  -  Both must do splendidly in this hot moist clime  -  I then saw the College the fathers have built & their church - the only freestone building in Suva  -  They had to import the stone from Sydney  -  Much of it is still wood but gradually, as funds accumulate stone will replace the wood  -
