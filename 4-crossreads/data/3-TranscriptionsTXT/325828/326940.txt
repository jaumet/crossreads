  An Afterthought   7.6.16. The mails for Australia close here as follows June 1st June 15th July 13th July 27th So that after my next letter which (OV) will be dated June 14th there will be a spell of 4 weeks instead of only 2 as it is now.  You will know then if you do not receive them for 3 or 4 weeks after the 15th mail closes. I will write every week tho' in case it is altered Love from Leo.
