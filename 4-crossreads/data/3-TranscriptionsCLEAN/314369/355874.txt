 After a very quiet night we receive a little mail   &  I get Richies letter dated June 18th glad to hear all well We are getting very sick of it all. The mens health is breaking down under the constant strain   &  hard work 'C' company's Sick list averages about 10 men to Hospital each day. Later Receive Mum's Letter but we are not able to answer them from here. At 2 pm a man in my trench got his head nearly blown off by an explosive Bullet.
