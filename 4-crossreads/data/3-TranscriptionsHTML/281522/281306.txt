<p>29/5/17 Bouzincourt  <br/>for lunch about 1 p.m. and cut out the afternoon parade. Assembled all officers at 3 p.m. and an Engineer lectured on the prismatic compass &amp; map reading. At mess we had quite a crowd as about half a dozen artillery men are attached. The band played during dinner and the King was drunk in the wine of the country with musical honours. After I criticised the morning's work, Bunning followed with a lecture on Advanced Guards and another short speech about their application to our own selves by me closed the discussion. After walked in the garden and had a long talk with the old Monsieur and chatted about industries, socialism, strikes, Algeria, crops, the inevitable War &amp; a little local scandal. Then home "chez M. Dupray" to read and to write and to count the days to my next permission  &agrave; Paris and the stupidities there.</p>
