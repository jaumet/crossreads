<p>from the one I took with Nickie last Monday &ndash; It was a fine trip, reached The Palace about 3. p.m. had time to do the Galleries &amp; the Grounds &ndash; some of the girls had not been there before &ndash; caught the 4.30. p.m. boat for Richmond. Oh, the River Thames is beautiful &amp; we thoroughly enjoyed every inch of the way. Also highly amused &ndash; boats of all kinds, but really have not time to describe them &ndash; Folk having afternoon tea on the river, boats moored along the banks, tucked in under trees, looking very gay, girls &amp; boys in gay clothing &ndash; spirit lamp on table with kettle boiling. My, the lovers here  are most brazen &ndash; no modesty at all &ndash; worse than the Australians in Egypt. The House-boats on the Thames are a sight to see &ndash; must try to get a picture of it &amp; send you.<br/>Reached Richmond at 6.15. p.m.</p>
