<p>last night we sang "Abide with me" very impressively, &amp; it affected me in the same way.</p>
<p>X Tuesday 17 Sept. 1918</p>
<p>I understand the stunt is to come off tomorrow morning. This afternoon B &amp; C <strike>the</strike> bearers went up the line, &amp; we have stacks of stretchers ready. This morning, Freddy Cocks &amp; I made a large number of walking wounded notices, with the help of Bugler Easther who made the stencil.</p>
<p>I understand that tanks &amp; the usual side shows are all ready, &amp; from observation I can quite believe the rumour that 700 shells per minute will be the extent of the barrage. Fighting on the same scale will take place north &amp; south of us, so I can see it developing into some big battle.</p>
<p>Last night the planes came over &amp; did a bit of zonking, but they had to keep very high on account of the sad ending to one or two of their raids</p>
