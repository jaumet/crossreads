<p>August, 1915<br/>Friday 27<br/>Col: Spencer Brown (Brown) offers me a job adjutant of all Light Horse Details in Egypt when I get well &ndash; This means <u>not</u> going back to Gallipoli &ndash; We hear rumours that the 7th Division is to be given a spell &amp; withdrawn first chance. If this was certain I might take the other, as it means promotion for certain - I am to remain in bed yet another few days, so am not too fit yet &ndash; Lieut Henry left for home by "Euripedes" yesterday, his trouble weak knee, which I hear was bad when he enlisted &ndash; "entre-nous on dit avec froid pied"</p>
