Diary

Jan 1st (Paris. cont.)
New Year's Day -
Army & Navy Leave Club
Windsor Hotel
With my friend I visit Bois-de-Boulonge, a reserve of 2.000 odd acres once used for hunting but now an immense park greatly frequented in summer.  It has artificial lakes & cascades and is most popular with horse riding parties.
Return to town and thence to Wagram.
A cold & rainy night.
