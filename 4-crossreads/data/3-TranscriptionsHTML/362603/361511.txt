<p>Red Cross letterhead<br/>Bulford<br/>26/8/17<br/>Dear Mum,<br/>Your letters of the 16th &amp; 24th June have arrived &amp; I'll answer them now.  It has been raining Cats &amp; Dogs &amp; our Garrison Cricket team played Tedworth Garrison all through it.  Our Team were just beaten by about 4 Runs.  I watched it for a good while.  There were many international players both past &amp; present engaged.  Billy Ali. knows a fat lot as You will see by this letter.  We are still comfy at Bulford &amp; what if we do go to France.  We are liable to die from any accident just the same as in France.  But we'll be here months &amp; months yet.  No, Mum, I can't write to all of my Friends.  I've written nearly 800 letters since I came away &amp; that averages over 8 letters a week.  I can tell You that it takes some doing.  I do not know anyone of the name of Forbes but all the others are still with us.  They do write but so much of our mail goes astray.  Sandy is getting old &amp; cunning now.  It would be great to see Him running about here.  Fancy the Gardeners still asking How we are.  Tell them that there are lots &amp; lots of their Countrymen in France.  I saw the "Olympic" in the Mersey.  She had 8000 of them for fatigues in France.  I only have 2 stripes.  That's enough.  I don't want any more &amp; even if I did I won't get any so all's O.K.  Hope Uncle Bill Miller gets on well.  Ida can't Keep Him.  He'll have to go Home to His people in the Country &amp; do a bit of Farmwork for His bit of grub.  What sort of Yarns were George &amp; Dad stringing</p>
