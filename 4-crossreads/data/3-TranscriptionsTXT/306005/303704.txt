 18-1-17 Thurs 18th Had a visit paid us by two Taubes early this morning &amp; the Anti Air Craft guns fired a great number of shells at her, but the Taubes were too high (out of range) they dropped no bombs &amp; came in from the West. The Squadron now do Regimental drill &amp; I have the Sigs out on visual work, we commenced this morning; it is a lot of rot taking the men out mounted as the horses would be much better off resting after their Rafa trip, but a bit of work to get the men fit will do them no harm. We have been having perfect weather; It is rumored we may get 5 days leave to Cairo &amp; Alexandria shortly.
