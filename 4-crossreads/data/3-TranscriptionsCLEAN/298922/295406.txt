 Brigade is camped close to the Beach so it is not a bad spot for bathing, you need not worry about the enemy he is a long way from here now. Mr. PEARSE will get McKinnon & Lavender to send along the B- he takes to Australia for me  unloaded . 
 After the Troop Train had pulled up & commenced to unload - the R.T.O., i.e. Railway Transport Officer, rushed along calling out for the guard, saying "How do I know the train has arrived finally. The Guard reports to me."  Of such is some of the Red Tape Brigade.
