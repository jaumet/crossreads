dug-out, and when he was being moved to the hospital he thought that he was going back to the firing line. I knew how bad he was at the time but was so pleased to see him being carried away from the danger that was with us for days. And at present he is in the same camp with me looking first rate after six months away from us all.
One cannot go against human nature so why worry about getting back, until you are absolutely fit. I would be very pleased to hear that Irene had been accepted for active service, if you could only realise Lillian what it is to be a soldier and not fight, or a nurse and not help on A.S. I would go through fire and water to help any nurse. Lillian I know it would be hard to let her go but you are not sending or letting her go to the same place as we. They would do it no doubt. Any of our nurses that come over here are well cared for and look out for any person who would attempt to interfere with a nurse. Never Fear, while we are still in the land of the living, or any soldier.
You need not worry further about any of our boys as they are all at present ok.
