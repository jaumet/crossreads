Dear Mum: -
This is just a little account of our scrap that I thought would interest you &amp; if possible would like Ruby to see it, as I cannot spare time to pen her a duplicate.
I am answering your letter of July 2nd under seperate cover.
Give love to tell, Kit &amp; all at home, &amp; accept the best of love &amp; kisses from your loving son
Birk
Keep this account in sight as much as possible, so I can give you more details when I come back &amp; compare with my diary.
