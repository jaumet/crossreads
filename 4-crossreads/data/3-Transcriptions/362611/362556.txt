<p>9 January 1917<br/>Dear John<br/>I had a chat with Walter yesterday in Wandsworth Hospital, and although you will probably have work from Leo, (who had seen him the previous day) you will perhaps like to have a few lines from me as a 'progress report'</p>
<p>Walter tells me he is making capital progress, though yesterday was not a particularly  good day  for him, the reason being that his old splint was taken</p>
