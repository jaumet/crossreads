<p>Friday 3 [2] August 1917 [1918]<br/>Town 4 p.m., shopped for N. Woods.  Pt. 200 sent.<br/>All goods high prices just now viz., 1 pr. satin bedroom slippers, Pt. 30 (6/-).  Tea Liptons with Kinnaine &amp; Manning, garry drive home (Pt. 15).  Lovely evening light &amp; days already growing less hot.  House we live in is one of the oldest about.  These barracks were built in 1801 or thereabouts by Napoleon &amp; are over 120 years (perhaps 1790 odd) &amp; ours they say before then.  No wonder it seems to be crumbling away to ruin &amp; is full of fine dust.<br/>Hear Gen. Cox has gone up the line, another stunt coming on.</p>
