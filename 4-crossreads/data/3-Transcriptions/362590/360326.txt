I started the ball rolling by giving a &pound;1; then subscriptions of money, boxing gloves, bats, foot balls etc started pouring in from all directions, &amp; at each successive donation there was a heartier cheer, till the Major sent down a message asking what the H&mdash;l I meant by allowing the men to cheer in the lines &ndash; so it had to be stopped.</p>
<p>Each man will give a subscription of 1/-</p>
