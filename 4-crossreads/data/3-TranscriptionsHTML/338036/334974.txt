<p>[5th Nov. contd]<br/>to Snowy Challis.  Supper with [indecipherable] from my hut.</p>
<p>Tuesday 6th<br/>At 11 am word came to us to go away in half an hour &ndash; so without further ado I flew around and packed things in a hurry &ndash; eventually falling in in drizzling rain with full gear up at midday without time to bid Buck goodbye.  The march to Havre Station which followed was not only strenuous but long and the road being bad it made things uncomfortable.  However the silver lining came and we eventually entrained in fairly good quarters and after a short wait was soon speeding on our way.  During the night we were fortunate enough to obtain a doze &amp; did not notice the monotony of journey.  The train must have made excellent progress for when we awoke at about 7.45 we were not far from St Pol.</p>
<p>Wednesday 7th<br/>Passing by Aire we made Hazebrouck at 2 pm &ndash; a rather good journey and leaving our gear at Reinforcement Billets we were free to see the town until 6 pm.  I had dinner of ham &amp; eggs tea &amp; bread &amp; felt good oh.  Ascertained  that our Div was resting with two other Divs in the line but that our Div would be moving up again soon.</p>
