whose we didn't know &ndash; we all laid down for a while and then went on a bit, but the officer in charge was lost and a few yards further on we found ourselves between the fire of the Turks and our 16th Battalion &ndash; the bullets zipped everywhere amongst and around us and many of our chaps fell wounded or dead &ndash;  amongst those near me Crowley &amp; Johnson fell badly wounded. The fire became too hot for anything and those of us left scouted [scooted] into the head of a gully into which the officer cleared for shelter singing out for us to follow &ndash; here most of the bullets flew a little high over us but many went amongst us &ndash; I went back and brought Crowley in someone else got Johnson and some others who had fallen when we ran into the fire &ndash; the bullets were still as bad as ever and it was very unhealthy anywhere there.

A good many of our men were wounded during the day in part of the trench I was in and one near me who exposed himself above the trench was shot dead through the heart. Sgt. Mitchell very pluckily exposed himself to pass sandbags up from
