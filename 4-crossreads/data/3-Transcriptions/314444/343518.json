<p>Dear Ivy &amp; Beryl</p>
<p>Your parents will have already received my earlier letter re poor old Jim ere this reaches you and Billy has written you also. We are sending you as many of Jim's personal belongings as can be sent as we, who know you, know what and how much you would like. We know the sympathy that is yours, but feel sure that the spirit that steeled your hearts <strike>for you</strike> to allow him to do the right thing by enlisting will now assist you in your time of dire distress. Since my last letter I have had plenty and long</p>
