is not midsummer yet by a long way.
Tues. 2nd July
Left the Ambulance to go as Detail to Machine Gun Squadron.
14th Johnny launched a heavy attack on our lines just before dawn this morning. It was really a German attack, not a Turk. Rumours have been going round for some considerable time that Johnny and Fritz have been fighting among themselves of late. There seems to be some truth in it. When the German shock troops attacked, they made excellent progress and for a while the situation was critical but the Turks failed to rise to the occasion. Instead they refused to fight, and opened fire on the Germans from behind. 
When the Germans surrended, Jacko came up in a body of about 500 and did likewise. They said, and the Germans admitted it, that they (the Turks) had been kept two days without water in order to make them fight for the Wadi Orjan which we hold. This savage treatment had quite an opposite effect, and they refused to fight at all. When the Turkish prisoners reached the Wadi, they literally threw themselves into the water burying their faces in it, and gulping it down in great draughts.
The slaughter of the Germans caught by our Artillery at close range was heavy. Over 120 passed wounded through the F.A. to-day. The dead are estimated at about 200, and there are 300 German prisoners. Well over 500 Turkish prisoners have been brought in. Our casualties have been very light, amounting in the Anzac Division to, I believe, 20 killed, 47 wounded and 6 missing. The German objective was (I have heard) first the Wadi Orjan, and then Jericho. The result must have been a terrible disappointment.
16th To-day Johnny has been shelling the Regiments and the road to Wabir very heavily. In the afternoon
