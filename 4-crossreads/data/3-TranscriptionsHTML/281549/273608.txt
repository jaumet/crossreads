<p>Thursday the 1st of Feburary I was issued with some new clothing, In the afternoon I had some more practice at Bomb throwing, In the evening it snowed very heavily.</p>
<p>From to-day Revielle is to be at 7 am instead of 6 am, Owing to the weather being so severe. The papers say that this winter is the most severe for 23 years.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning snow fell very thick &amp; heavy , I had some great fun snow balling.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I went to the villages of Steeple Langford, Bamford &amp; Wishford, for a walk a distance of about 18 miles.</p>
<p>The snow remained very thick on the ground from Sunday till Wednesday the 7th when the sun showed itself for about 4 hours, The snow thawed &amp; made an awful mess in Camp.</p>
