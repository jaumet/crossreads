  
 [The next  line is in shorthand] Wednesday July 4, 1917. (1066.) Fine but cloudy to day. There was a very heavy artillery activity last night & while I was on picquet several enemy aeroplanes came over, but did no damage here. The King visited some camps not far from here today, and inspected troops. The Battalions in our Brigade were practising for the Sports this afternoon. Last night I was on picquet from 12 to 3. Word has came through that the Russians have had a series of successes & captured some thousands of prisoners. 
 Thursday July 5, 1917. (1067.) Fine but cloudy and rather cold. There was a sports meeting at the 37. Battalion in the adjoining paddock & it was largely attended. There were a fair number from other Battalions in the Brigade present. The sports consisted of foot  racing, including a quarter mile event, a sack race, a spoon race, throwing the cricket ball, long jump, and alarm race, etc. All the officers were present & assisted in carrying out the programme & acted as judges. I saw Lieut McNicol. He is looking well & fit. There was a very heavy bombardment last night & early this morning. I was on picquet last night from 9 to 12, and to night from 6 to 9. The Russian success continues & the Italians have shown the way in reprisals, & dropped messages stating that it would be repeated for every crime committed by the Austrians. 
 Friday July 6, 1917 (.1068.) A first day, bright blue sky & fleecy clouds. The enemy bombarded several fields this morning
