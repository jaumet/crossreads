<p>Moascar<br/>July 20th 1919</p>
<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>A short letter to you to acknowledge yours dated July 4th for which many thanks.  You mention matters bearing on the break-up and my letter July 18th to you also deals with the possibilities of working conditions on my return to England.</p>
<p>Well don't worry if you find too many difficulties in studio hunting.  I propose taking a roaming holiday with you &amp; looking around say for a week in search of a broken down shanty that might give us shelter &amp; breathing room for the Autumn, that is August <strike>one week</strike> end of, to Sept., end of.  The only Damascus blade will be myself.  Sorry but I refuse to load myself with souvenirs.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I say goodbye I hope finally to the Desert sailing for England I more than hope on or about 28th.</p>
