and the Fog Horn was blowing very frequent. I timed the Log by my Watch and it registered 1 Mile in five minutes, so at that rate we don't expect to make Devonport until 4 am tomorrow. The sea is very calm and during the day it cleared up and it was enjoyable up on deck. The Boys are all well and their Appetites good so we are a happy Family. The Evening was spent playing Cards and Reading until Bed Time.
 Saturday 21st 
After sleeping well in my Hammock I awoke and dressed at 7 am and when going up on Deck I could see that we were anchored at Plymouth close to three other large Steamers with Troops on board. During the Morning a Transport Officer came on board with a list of Men to sail by her, a little later I was sent for and was informed my name was not on the Roll, but was given the option of going away without my Papers or Pay Book and waiting for them to be sent out by a later boat, or going ashore
