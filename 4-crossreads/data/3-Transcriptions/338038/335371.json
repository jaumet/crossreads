<p>raid.</p>
<p>Have very little news about any of the boys. I had a long letter from Gerald asking if I could tell him anything about Les,  <strike>but</strike>  to which I sent him all particulars I could, just as I gave them to you, but I fear they must seem doubly inadequate to him &ndash; However, it was no use trying to garnish what must be a terribly distressing occurrence, on account of the awful uncertainty.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Ath Cochrane a few days ago &ndash; He is still going through a school at Oxford.</p>
<p>Have seen nothing of Arny since April. As we are now in another Corps, and removed by 50 miles from part of the line he was in.</p>
<p>Must stop now. With all my love to yourselves &amp; Pat<br/>I am your loving Son Terence</p>
