<p>On the S/S "Douglas"<br/>14/5/18</p>
<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>I am sitting watching Douglas &amp; the beautiful Isle of Man fade away in the distance.  It is so sad to leave such a lovely place especially when the dearest Aunt &amp; Cousin in the whole world are to left behind also.  But life is made up of sad partings &amp; we have to be brave.  It makes us long for Home so much when we feel this way.  It revives &amp; we live again the partings from loved ones in Australia.  But enough of sad regrets.  We live from day to day.  One is much like another.  I can see the Cumberland Hills &amp; the Welsh Hills if I look for'ard.  The air is very clear &amp; the sea is like glass.  I had better start from Bulford on my Holiday trip &amp; give you all details.  I set out on Wednesday last at 8 a.m.  I arrived in London at noon.  I had dinner at Marylebone Station &amp; went out to Harefield as escort for two Patients.  I returned to London &amp; went straight up to D.J's.  I saw Devereaux &amp; Mr. C.L. &amp; had a chat with both.  I looked over the old Photo of the Picnic where I ran that funny old mile race.  Oh the funny guys we all look especially George who resembles a German Professor</p>
