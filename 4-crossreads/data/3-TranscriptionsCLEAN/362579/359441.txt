  
 Had some of the lovely Devonshire Cream   &   in fact, seem to be eating all the time. Last night Mr. Copp took me to a Concert given by Patients   &  Nurses from V.A.D's. Hospital. It was awfully good   &  they were pleased to have me, quite proud of a Sister from the Front. They wished me to wear my red-cape, so I did. 
 Mrs. Copp stayedat home because she is not too strong yet. We did not get back until 11 p.m. she had a lovely supper waiting   &  when I went to bed, found it had been warmed   &  was real beautiful. So I'm getting quite spoilt. Mr. Copp has gone to Church while I'm writing this   &  Mrs. Copp is talking to me, so please excuse mistakes   &  if I get all over the shop - Am to go out this afternoon but shall tell you all about it later. 
 Stay here until Tuesday then on to Penzance until Saturday next, back
