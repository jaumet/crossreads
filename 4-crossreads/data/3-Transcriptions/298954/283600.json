<p>Tue 2nd Apl. (cont.)<br/>We alighted at the Bahnhof.   What was apparently the Trawler's Quay is very similar to the Fisherman's Basin at Hobart, but in this instance a battle-cruiser in dock and a network of steel-trellis at a submarine yard provided a background which little old Hobart has not!</p>
<p>The main court of the Bahnhof was crowded, and the advent of an Englander followed by an unteroffizier and three soldiers carrying baggage caused quite a sensation,</p>
<p>I earned the regard of my escort by buying them beer and coffee in the Wartesaal;   after the first drink the braves always addressed me as "Mein Herr".   We kept up quite a conversation with my 20 words of Deutsch eked out by French phrases.</p>
