<p>" Only a Letter "</p>
<p>Youre looking tired &amp; weary,<br/>And you feel you cant be cheery.<br/>And from your dirty trench you cannot roam<br/>Theres a sight to stir your heart,<br/>Makes all care &amp; pain depart<br/>A letter from the dear old folks at home</p>
<p>Maybe its from your brother<br/>Or your old grey haired mother<br/>Or sweetheart true who sends the welcome line<br/>But it sets you at your ease,<br/>When that message oe'r the seas<br/>Just tells you all the folk at home are fine,</p>
<p>Theres the other side to tell<br/>And it don't sound half as well<br/>It seems to give your heart a sudden wrench<br/>When the mail is given out<br/>And you find without a doubt<br/>Youre the only one forgotten in the trench</p>
<p>In your throat a lump will rise,<br/>And tears start to your eye's<br/>You wonder why on earth they fail to write</p>
