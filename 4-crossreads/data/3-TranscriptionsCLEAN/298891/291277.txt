Dropped anchor at breakfast time in harbour of Melos where we rode at anchor all day & saw a lot of shipping. Such dull land & puny little white villages like grave yards & windmills. All so white in the glass barren ribbed treeless hillsides. Walked deck for exercise after dinner. Pulled out dinner time as usual. Lovely smooth going. Young Parker from Abergevenny trying to be spoomy.
