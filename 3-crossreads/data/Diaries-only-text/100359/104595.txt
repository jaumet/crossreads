The Church Bells have been clanging all day since about 5 this morning at 10 o'clock a huge procession was formed and passed through the main street of the town to the Church. It was quite an impressive affair. First came the children of Mary" in their white dresses and veils and garlanded with flowers, then followed a few thousand more women and children. The priests chanted a verse of the Mass, and the girls joined in the chorus. After these the men and boys came along, all hats off. They carried banners and figures of the Virgin Mary and also joined in the Chants. At the tail end of the procession came the priests and altar boys. The priests in most gorgeous vestments and the boys in scarlet robes and lace surplices. They also sang and what singing it was. It sounded glorious those fresh young voices, and did one good to hear them. Mac.D. I. are on S.P. again, so don't have to attend any Parades. The rest of the crowd were given squad drill and instructions "how to salute properly". All this, after a year and nearly a half in the army. No wonder the crowd "play up" at times. Bricky is very busy building a new incinerator. Frank Woods and Wrighty are his fatigue.
Wednesday 16th
Mail came in today. Got another letter from Lill. Pay day too, received 20F. went out with Bricky to help him choose a present for his wife. Plenty of work for "Sanitary Sams" The Col.caught me with an apple in the garden and carried me, but dear old Cobber "Maud" was so overcome by my touching appeal that she discharged me "without a stain on my character." The crowd are having more squad drill and are improving wonderfully. They actually "formed fours" correctly, once and their saluting is almost beyond reproach.
