 7th December 1916 Gerarat Thursday 
 I went out this morning with a special patrol going about 12 miles forward of our present position to reconnoitre and take bearings of the various positions. No Turks were encountered en route but every indication of recent patrolling by camel patrols which they doubtless send out under cover of darkness of course we do the same so its all in the game of war. We saw the Minerat of the Mosque at El Arish from a high sand hill so we have seen  some  of the place which we are going to take (I believe that is the arrangement) El Arish is a rather large city with about 30,000 inhabitants that was before the war. It is an important trade centre and is on the direct  [indecipherable]   caravan route between Jerusalem and the Holy Land generally and the Suez Canal  El Arish I believe stands on the Egyptian border beyond it is the Holy Land. Dozens of patrols are out each day and night constantly on the qui vine.
