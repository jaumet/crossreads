Detail have been obliged to participate. I enjoyed it immensely and hope we have more of them. I bought "Uncle Silas" a book mother advised me to read and I enjoyed it very much. I trust you are receiving the photos I am sending. I have posted in all three large bundles, one including negatives. I will be able to send you some more soon including a number taken on our route march. I have not discovered Sterling's whereabouts. He might be camped near here without my knowing. I wrote a note to Mrs. Sharpe for his address but have not received any reply. Have you Mrs. Sharpe's address. I send my letter to Ashfield, 29 Palace St., but they vacated that house before I left Australia. I intended to number my letters consecutively, but have forgotten what the last number was, so I am numbering "6" on speck. I think it is about right. With best love to all Your loving Son Eugene.
