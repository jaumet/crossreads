<p>War Diary<br/>"Horse, supported by a mixed detachment of the 4th Australian Infantry Brigade."</p>
<p>The casualties in this force amounted to 1000 of all ranks, but very heavy loss was inflicted on the Turks, not only in the desperate hand-to-hand fighting in the Trenches but also from artillery bombardment.<br/>Three machine guns, two of which were used at once against the Turks and 46 prisoners taken, as well as three trench mortars, 300 Turkish Rifles, 60,000 rounds of small arm ammunition, and 500 bombs.  Judging by the heaps of Turkish dead in the trenches, and observation from the Kaiajik Dere trenches, which command the Turkish line of retreat, and owing to our artillery getting at the Turks during the retreat, it is estimated that the Turkish losses must have been at least 5,000.</p>
<p>Brigadier General F.G. Hughes wishes to record his highest appreciation of the fine work done by the 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments in this series of actions and also of the excellent work by the 8th Light Horse Regiment who assisted the carrying on the defence of these trenches and successfully repulsed all counter attacks.<br/>The General, in bearing testimony to all this work is fully alive to the strenuous and continuous duties in No. 4 section, Russells Top, from which trenches they were taken for this special task.<br/>The casualties have been very heavy in all ranks, and in addition, to the wounded, he deeply deplored the loss of Lt. Col. C. Reynell, Captains H.P. Fry, P.I. Callary, A.J. Jaffray and Lieuts. G.A. Leake, W. Cameron and G.H. McBean, and the grand men of the Brigade, who, one and all did such splendid work.  Of the original Brigade Officers who left Australia, the following only have not been sick or off duty -<br/>[In left margin]  8th Sept.</p>
