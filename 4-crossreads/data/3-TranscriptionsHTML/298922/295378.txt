<p>Wednesday 21 February 1917</p>
<p>Now being issued with HOTCHKISS Automatic Rifles, 1 per troop &amp; busy building up Horses again by giving them a pick of the green CAMEL Bush etc. It is spring time here.</p>
<p>"It may be a case of the blunder we die &amp; then we retrieve our blunders" but I hope to learn to save my man.</p>
<p>&amp; many MOSQUITOES. Did Jackson send you a batch of Australasians which followed me from England.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ferrar has never ceased to send me the English Punch ever since I left. Jim Ayre tells me the Garden is looking very well at the old place.</p>
