Cross to have Tea and spend an Evening with another family who has Relatives in Australia. It was the same family I visited two years ago next month before I went oversea's to France. I found them all well and they made me very welcome, they are a jolly family, Husband, Wife, two nice daughters and a Son. I passed the evening away in giving them some of my experiences on Active Service. I had such a good time that it made me long for my Dear Old Home, which I hope I soon will return to. At 10 Pm I said Good Bye and thanked them all for their kindness, they directed me back to Holborn and on the way I witnessed a very smart turn out of a Borough Fire Brigade, who had received a call. I was just passing the building when a large Bell rung and in a moment the Huge Doors opened and in out came the Reel, followed by the Steam Engine, Ladder Wagon and the Ambulance and all was soon on their way. I continued on and after reaching Holborn I caught a Tube home.
