  
 Sunday 1/9/18 what an awful night God only knows how it is any of us are alive the shells were bursting only 10 & 15 yds away at times & no one was hit, the splinters all went forward. At 6 a.m. we moved forward still under fire to about 400 yds with dug-outs. no sooner got here than Young Riley was blown in half, Cec Gill, Bert Cobb wounded, Bert Mitchell killed, Wally Rodgers Badly wounded. Stretcher carriers coming in fast now & so are hun Prisoners galore, carrying our wounded. Raining heavily this morning but sun shining again. I wonder how much more of this I can stand. Will have done 3 years in 5 days time. Just written above  when shell landed &#126; few yds in front of us killing 4 horses & wounding 2 drivers one had his foot blown off. Our Boys still advancing & have taken Peronne casualties very great, no support much from Artillery. Much quieter than this time yesterday. May stay here all night. Letter from Nell with &#163;1. enclosed "good old Girl". 58-6-6 - 101/4
