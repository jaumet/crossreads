  
 be fairly mobbed. The answer I "one" What is it? "Australia"!! Some of them say two Australia & Tasmania. But that wont be taken unless there are some Tasmanians around. We have been a very happy family on board but it will be nice to get on land again and see a bit more of the world. They have never had service on board since we left; which I think is a pity. but it  however we will be able to have church parade again pretty soon now. My word you appreciate the home Sundays when you get away like this; you will hear real old bushies here say that; whom you would never think had had a home for years. I have managed to escape the mumps so far and am feeling jolly fit on the whole but for a few bru bumps which I have received through rolling out of my hammock two nights running. It is a most horrible shock to land wop on the floor when you are sound asleep especially when the hammock is hung from the roof. Think I will sleep on the floor in future; it is safer when a person is such a wriggler like me. Kind regards to Dick & Miss Stirling.  Love to Boys.  If we don't get any worse time than we have had on board the "Awful troop ships" this is going to be a picnic.  Must stop now. Good bye Mother dear.  fro Your loving son Rob.
