G.O.C. sends congratulations to the Regiment in carrying out the mounted work satisfactory, specially during this fierce Heat.  Telegram through to the effect that Officers Mess Stuff has been looted during transit from Salhia.<br/>Harris &ndash; the Col's Groom up for Insolence, got 7 days 2 Field punishment.<br/>Weather much cooler to-day.  Col. Fuller in Camp all day.<br/>During our stay at Kalia we found much correspondence &amp;amp; pictures of a most filthy description.  Letters written by women in England write to Officers of the Warwickshrie Yeomanry Regiments in a way that is positively repulsive &amp;amp; we conclue that there must be much sexual mania in the Yeomanry ranks.</p>
