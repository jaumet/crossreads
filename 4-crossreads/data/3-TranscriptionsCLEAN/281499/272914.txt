  
 75 % of the men engaged, it was the hottest engagement as ever I have been in & how I escaped is a mystery for the air was stiff with bullets they were singing past like a swarm of bee's, my only dread in those charge's is the fear of getting hit in the stomach, for that is the worst place of all & there is very little hope for one & you die a lingering death apart from that once I am over I don't care so much. The Germans were there in hundreds & you could see their heads over the parapet like a row of palings, & those of the boys who were left made pretty shooting at them  Our officers suffered heavily again Lieut's Lancer, Finlayson, McIntyre, Philips, were killed & Mallarkey, Steels & a few more are missing, while nearly all the remainder were wounded.

 was wounded so he had to carry on like myself & act on his own. We got all the wounded in I think & the remainder of the Battalion rallied together in an old trench half full of mud, I had a great weight lifted off my mind when I heard that Len was safe it is simply marvellous how we live through it.  I saw him once right down on the German parapet rallying his men & bombs & bullets were like hailstones From here we made off back to our own trenches nearly 3 miles away for the attack had failed & we were a sorry looking lot as we slowly ploughed our way through the mud now knee deep again after the heavy downpour I was about the last man of the C. Coy home for my leg was very painful & I was absolutely done scarce move one leg after the other so done up was I, & cold & miserable don't mention it.
