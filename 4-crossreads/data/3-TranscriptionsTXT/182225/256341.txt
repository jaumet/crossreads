Fine & hot. Out signalling again all day. The 27th Battery played the 26th football in the evening & they beat us by 18-0. My word I never knew anybody could be so knocked up as I was after the match  I was absolutely run to a standstill. It was a good game all the same & will do us a lot of good. I got a parcel from Linda with some sweets & socks and a book "Aunt Sarah & the War.
 
Its a wise man who can keep his temper, for any fool can lose it.
