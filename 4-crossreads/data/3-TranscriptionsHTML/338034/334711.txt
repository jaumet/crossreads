<p>The engineers and a party <strike>of well</strike> from the Regt. have been sinking wells near the beach for the past three days. They have secured good supplies of fairly fresh water at only a very shallow depth. A Division of mounted men or even more will easily be able to water here. Small bodies of Turks have been coming in from Shelal (15 miles East of Rafa, &amp; 30 odd miles East of here) &amp; giving themselves up to us. Some have been armed &amp;  some have discarded their rifles previous to arriving here. We have taken about 30 of them since we came out here from El Arish.</p>
