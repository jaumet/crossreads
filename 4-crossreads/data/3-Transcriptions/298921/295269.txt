<p>October, 1915<br/>Monday 25<br/>This morning I viewed brother "Turk" again, beautifully clear &amp; the bay calm with gunboats &amp; Hospital boats as before - <u>Tucker</u> "Bonelli" beef &amp; biscuits but it is good to be on the job again.<br/><u>Taubes</u> flying over &amp; also our aeroplanes not much shelling &amp; all hands busy preparing for the Winter by digging in &ndash; Sleep rather coldly but will soon get accustomed to that.<br/>Many improvements have taken place in saps roads &amp; trenches since I left &amp; the smell of dead Turks is not so bad.</p>
