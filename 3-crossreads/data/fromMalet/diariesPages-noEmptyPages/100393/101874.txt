It contained a lot of drink which made some of our men very merry.15th Aug.At 6 p.m. on the 15th August my battalion moved to Vauvillers and stopped there that night.16th Aug. The next morning at 8 a.m. we marched back to Vaux sur Somme, for a few days spell, and made our camp on the banks of the river.It was a treat to get back out of shell range where we could have rest and get cleaned up a bit. Fortunately about this time the weather was good and as the river was so handy we spent the next few days in practise for more attacks and swimming. The first thing to do was to get clean shaven wash some under clothes. That done we were comparatively clean felt something like ordinary human beings once more.We were in the river each day swimming races were got up which gave us interest. Bathers of course were an unknown identity.20th Aug.On out third day there we began to get wind of another attack. At this time there was also a large movement of traffic.
