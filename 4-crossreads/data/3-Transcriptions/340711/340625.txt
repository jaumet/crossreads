<p>Went to La Petite Chaumiere during day and found that Madame etc. refrained, according to Catholic custom, from eating even eggs. Speaking of the war, she cried a little because of the hardship it had spelt for her, and telling me in answer to my question, that the war had failed to make the people of France more religious. My first sermon in France---it was only a matter of minutes---but I pointed to the sacrifice of Christ, the injustice that was done him.</p>
<p>Saturday, 22.<br/>On picquet.</p>
<p>Sunday 23.<br/>Spent a rotten night (Sat. night). Slept in Saddlery "Shop"---very draughty. Went to Croix-du-Bac. Service rotten. Presbyterian Minister. Work rest of day.</p>
<p>Monday, 24.<br/>Weather fining up a bit. Half-a-dozen aeroplanes up at one time, and a couple of hundred shots fired at them. Usual routine. Went for first time to Divisional Baths on fringe of Armenti&egrave;res. Two letters from W. also papers.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 25.<br/>Weather grand---though ground sloppy underfoot. It will be a week before it dries up. Exercising horses a pleasure in the sunshine. Aeroplane bombardments intermittent throughout the day. In afternoon took ammunition to 18th. Battery lines. Old Lewis very complimentary. Letter from M., (No. 3) including photo A.---her letter and letter C. also C.C. and Chronicle.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 26.<br/>Went to Baths in morning. W.O. in charge. Harness cleaning in afternoon. Heavy bombardment commences tonight.</p>
