tired. Our route lay over the Hills consequently it was very cold.On the way we passed Several old time Castles ruinous buildings which were once French which the English destroyed in the battle of Crecy.The high trees on either side of the Road made the trip pleasant at places the trees were that tall bushy that the limbs entwined with one another, formed a green canopy which was lovely to look upon.We passed through Frug Les several smaller towns reached our resting camp at 5 pm. All the way through the villages are all holding Tommies who seem to be doing more flirting than fightingWe are now 28 miles from the firing line have to travel 23 miles tomorrow which will take us up to Divisional HQ from which we are to receive fresh orders.The firing can be plainly heard from here it does not make one feel too pleasant.
