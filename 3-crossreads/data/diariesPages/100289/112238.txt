a busy day. Horse stolen from Transport; endeavouring to find culprit
13.4.17 Friday
Fatigues again. Plenty of sick coming through, can hardly expect anything else considering the hard work the boys have been through lately.
Saturday 14.3.17 
Reveille 6.15 Am. Route march 6.45 AM. A bit of a strain considering we have only been out of the line a few days. Few of the boys on leave to Amiens overstepped the mark were put in the "boob" by the Military Police.
Sunday 15.4.17
Route march again before breakfast. Leave to Amiens cut
