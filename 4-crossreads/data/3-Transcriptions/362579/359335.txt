<p>We went to Afternoon tea to an Aust. Battalion on Tuesday   &amp;  had a lovely afternoon. On Friday, three of us Dorothy, Annie Bell   &amp;  self went with 3 officers to another C.C.S. Sports   &amp;  it was awfully good. We were the only Australians there, so in the boom.</p>
<p>Sister Bell's brother is a M.O. here   &amp;  a grand fellow, he came with us to the Sports. It is awfully nice for her to have her brother here. He is a  very clever surgeon. One of our Sisters went on Leave last Sunday   &amp;  to-day</p>
