<p>Dear Norman<br/>Just to say that "All's Well" with me, and like "Johnnie Walker" am "going strong". Weather has been intensely cold, &ndash; 30&deg; of frost but Spring is trying hard to pop its nose above ground. Kind regards to Mrs. Norman &amp; all your folk.<br/>Sincerely yours<br/>J A Reid.</p>
