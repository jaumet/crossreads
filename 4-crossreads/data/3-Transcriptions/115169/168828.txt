<p>Dec 22nd We coaled ship, and remained a few days, during which ship was cleaned and 24 hours leave given to each watch</p>
<p>Dec 26th at 3.30 PM the "Conde" returned to Kingston, having been on a cruise in Gulf of Mexico, on completing her firing &ndash; Unfortunately in the evening our captain Mortimer Le Silver was taken bad with slight malaria attack, but this was only mild, and on the morrow</p>
<p>Dec 27th at 9.30 am we proceeded to Port Royal and there awaited arrival of mail steamer, - all ratings awaiting discharge for England were got together, and sent on board her, - on arrival, we brought back our mails, and proceeded to sea at 11.15 a.m. en route for Bermuda &ndash; This enabled us to carry out our Xmas festivities, as owing to so many men being on leave Xmas day, whilst at Kingston our Xmas feast was postponed until the men had all returned, and so at 11.30 the dinner was served out,- during the forenoon</p>
