  
 15 March 1918 Friday Still at the Wadi Remounts came from Col :  Mc Leans   today mostly Americans, we did hope to be relieved but no word yet, still cold & wet. On Outpost again tonight- the Wadi opposite is lined with Jacko's but they leave us alone for the present, it is too cold & wet for any fighting & both sides are so tired out. We  have been [indecipherable]  but still have no Bivies, it may seem strange but 20 miles changes the climate here from the warm Dead Sea to the snow clad mountains.
