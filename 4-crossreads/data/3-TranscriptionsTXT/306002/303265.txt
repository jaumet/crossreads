 27.8.15 Fri. 27th.  Just as we got nicely settled in bed last night the rifles &amp; machine guns opened fire &amp; after the quiet time we have had I began to wonder whether the Turks were charging or not but it only lasted from 15 to 20 minutes so we lay back &amp; slept the sleep of the just, &amp; found this morning that it was only a demonstration, one of the lads on Popes was wounded with shrapnel as the result.  At 3 o'clock this afternoon all the guns &amp; warboats opened fire on the Turks trenches on the left flank at 4 oclock, the charging commenced &amp; the fighting has been very heavy all the afternoon, some regular English troops are taking part &amp; we hope for good work from them, they are the Connaught Rangers from India.
