I believe he offended the 2nd Bde some time back told them they had never done anything yet, &amp; they should take an example from the 1st Bde, yes old Hearn worked us &amp; got good results too &amp; we always got a fair deal.<br/>Since he has gone we don't know where or how we stand.<br/>Plenty of liquor knocking about in the lines tonight, most of whisky too, it bangs the world how they get it<br/>I note they are moving a lot of our heavy guns from this quarter   going to Peronne I believe <br/>16th Packed up &amp; left early this morning, while we were in platoons &amp; waiting</p>
