<p>Tuesday August 14th<br/>Very fine day. Had our fire alarm as the O.C. promised yesterday, went off O.K. Everybody in the camp is looking forward to Pay day. Was reclassified today &amp; recommended for board by Senior Medical Officer. Went up to him this afternoon, but could not be put through, we have to go up tomorrow morning now. Another fellow &amp; I went for a very nice walk round the cliffs to Portland, (we could not go into the town owing to it being out of bounds), &amp; back by the Weymouth road.</p>
<p>Wednesday August 15th<br/>A dirty snob of an Officer came round on inspection of huts today &amp; owing to things not being to his liking, he put the whole Company on C.B, it hurt the troops falling in for Roll call every hour from 5 pm till 9 pm. Went up to S.M.O this morning, but as he was very busy, our board was put off till 2 pm this afternoon, went up this afternoon at 2 pm, &amp; my word they do give you a thorough examination, also ask <strike>all the</strike> a terrible lot of questions. I got B.2B.H, so I may get back to Australia after all, of course I have to go through another board before I get on a boat roll, this class will carry me back to Ausy.</p>
