<p>Dar Mum,</p>
<p>March 9 1919</p>
<p>If you could not do 44 miles in a nice comfy seat, just imagine the soldiers doing 6 &amp; 7 days on the floor of a cattle Truck or as Ellis &amp; I did 19 Hours without a move hardly.  We felt as if the bones were cutting right through our flesh, but it is a good distance all the same.</p>
<p>I am glad that the horse is a good one.  Those animals are always getting something the matter with their knees or fetlocks.  Mrs White aught to be O.K.  Those things are only infectious to the part &amp; do not effect the blood as a poison.  I should like to see young Nat Cohen but I have not His number or unit so although we might be next door to one another we cannot find one another's wherabouts.</p>
<p>I can see you "blowing your bags out" as we say in the army, as a Temperance Society President.  It would be a good place to start those concerns over here.  Great numbers of the poorer class in the country villages always make Sunday night a night out.  Mum &amp; Dad &amp; all the family get togged up &amp; all set off for the Village Pub.  Pa gets several large ones with a handle &amp; all have a drink.  Then Pa fills 'em up agen &amp; even the Baby in the pram gets a dhrop o' the cratur to stop is squealing.  They are brought up on beer in this country.</p>
<p>Well, Mum, I've no more news just at</p>
