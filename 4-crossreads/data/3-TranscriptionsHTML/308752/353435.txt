<p>April 4th 1917<br/>The last three days have been miserable cold &amp; wet &amp; that cursed mud is everywhere. Only a few walking patients have we helped along.  I believe the wounded are being conveyed in cars along another road. Another German Aeroplane brought down two of our Observation Balloons, but luckily the Taube was brought down also. At 9 p.m. we received the splendid news that the Division was to be relieved tomorrow.  The last three weeks except on a couple of occasions have been an easy time for us bearers, it has been rather interesting being in so many ruined villages that the Germans have held for two years. The conditions were not to be compared with those we experienced last October &amp; the beginning of November, so do not get the idea that we have been having a trying time.  It is the infantry who deserves the praise. Why look at the last three days I have been living in a dug-out, whilst different companies of the infantry have been fighting, &amp; the weather no too good either. As I have stated on numerous occasions these men are the real heroes in the war. Tom Ross is stationed at the next Post further on, he is well &amp; hearty as usual.</p>
