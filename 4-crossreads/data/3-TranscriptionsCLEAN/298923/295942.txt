  
 3 October 1918 Thursday (X to X crossed out) Fever still bad- we have never been up to strength this year, altho' reinforcements come in dribs & drabs-   I return paper cutting with this re July 14 fight,  MINE  "It was the vigorous  infantry  assault" it should read " dismounted " there were  no  infantry there. If Turkey makes peace I hope I shall not be sent out of Egypt- X Dolly has just moved to Villa Montrose Pension Heliopolis- where Mardi stayed.  I never met her hubby but she should get one of the best. X   I cannot but feel glad that the fighting is over here & I have seen it through from Gallipoli to the Canal & to Damascus
