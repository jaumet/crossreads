go to see things for myself. Some of other men camped about here disputed the Corpse Factory theory, and said the chamber in which the dead bodies and the boiler were, had been used as a cook house, and that a British shell had bored through the wall and had exploded inside thus mutilating the bodies I consider the latter explanation to be the correct one* At 6 PM came the order :-"Get ready to go up to the line in half an hour's time." We all got a good issue of rum, and by 7 P.M. were on the march, the road leading into the line being for the most part covered with a layer of wood. Such are generally spoken of as "Corduroy roads". We were now right in the heart of the Hindenburg Line. As darkness came on, the enemy fire increased, but being in good condition after the rest at Frise the men paid little regard heed to the shelling at this stage.
* Being interested in this, I examined the newspaper reports on the matter while in Hospital, and there found the correct explanation. This is the evidence of Captain C.E.W. Bean : "In the wall is a hole bored clean by a British shell which penetrated and exploded inside. thirteen Germans were lying there with the dust of that shell explosion over them. One had been thrown into a copper, one behind a wagon wheel, and the rest on the ground." Anzac Bulletin No 92,p 6, Oct 11th, 1918.
This gruesome subject was written up and discussed at great length by in the London Press, and a lot of arguments, and evidence were adduced to support the Corpse factory theory. Many of the English and Australians, whom I met about Hargicourt, really believed the story. When being brought back from the line, on 3rd Oct, wounded, I heard the driver of our wagon on the subject. He had seen the place and said: "it's no corpse factory."
