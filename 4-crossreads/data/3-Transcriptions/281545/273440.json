<p>when we arrived at Watteu a station ahead our Sergeant in Charge of the party reported us to the R.T.O. who ordered us to take our kits out &amp; put them in a Carriage on a Goods Train &amp; after about 30 minutes wait we returned.   Strange to say we were stranded at this place last year being over carried from Audurique, when we first arrived in France.   After a few minutes run we arrived back at St Omer at 2 Pm &amp; had to carry our kits over to the Loco Sheds &amp; then into the Electric Light Station, were we had to sleep for the first night.  My Mate &amp; myself slept in the Boiler shed alongside the Boiler with several others, the remainder slept in the machinery Shed, <strike>as we were all very tired, we soon turned in early</strike> although some had to start work straight away.   My Mate &amp; myself went for a stroll up the Town as it was his first visit here &amp; my second I piloted him around, took him into the famous Notre Darme, Cathedral, which he enjoyed very much, after wandering around &amp; having a good hot Tea we came back to the Depot &amp; turned in &amp; had a good sleep.  We were aroused at 5.30 am &amp; had to sign on at 6 am, &amp; after preparing an engine for work we stood by all the morning until 2 Pm when we were ordered to proceed to a place called Arques on the Bologne Line to back a Train up to Wardreques, although I did not know the road I had to go steady, leaving the Depot at 3 Pm I arrived at Arques in 15 minutes, were a Train</p>
