<p>MAY&nbsp;&nbsp; MONDAY 22&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Very windy &amp; cold again. The docter would not let me out this morning&nbsp; I asked him for medicine for my cold yesterday &amp; again today but have not got it yet. Its a very rottenly run hospital anyway and none of the docters take any interest in anybody.</p>
