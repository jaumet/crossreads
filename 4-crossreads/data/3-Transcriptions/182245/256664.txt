<p>MAY 1917</p>
<p>29 TUESDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; cool. I went before</p>
<p>Gen Grimwade in morning</p>
<p>with six others re S<sup>t</sup>&nbsp;John&#39;s Wood</p>
<p>but he did not give us any</p>
<p>information. Went round by</p>
<p>Bailleul after &amp; saw some</p>
<p>old TKS boys - Lionel Bigg</p>
<p>&amp; one of the Moor&#39;s. Poss Nivison</p>
<p>was attached to the 26<sup>th</sup></p>
<p>Battery during the day. I came</p>
<p>up to the pits after dinner again</p>
<p>Building all day.</p>
