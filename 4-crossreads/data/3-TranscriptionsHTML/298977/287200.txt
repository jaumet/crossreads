<p>DARDANELLES,<br/>7th November 1915</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>Your letter of the 7th September and Father's of the 18th both came to hand this week, also three papers, which of course I was very pleased to receive.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that that remarkable letter of mine from Egypt should have had to be given a bath.  It strikes me if you wanted to keep it so much, the best and easiest thing to do would have been to take a copy.</p>
<p>With regard to Photos.  I had bad luck with these.  I had a lot taken and had them at the Developers, but we left Heliopolis in such a hurry that I did not have time to get them, so I suppose its good bye to the lot.</p>
<p>Have not seen anything of Charlie Witney yet.  I had a letter from him this mail, but it was written in Sydney when he was on final leave.  I understand he is now in Egypt, but expect he will be over here any day now.</p>
<p>You might send me Willie Stewart's Reg No. etc., I May be able to look him up.  Understand Frank Eather's Brigade is again over here.  They are a good way away from here however, and it will mean a day off to find him.  As soon as I can get the necessary leave, however, I will look him up.</p>
<p>Tell Father that the Magazine's he packed will be much appreciated by the Boys over here.  I suppose it will only be luck as to whether I see any of them, but someone is sure to enjoy them.</p>
<p>Things are pretty quiet here now as to what they were but still they don't give us too much time for sleeping.</p>
<p>It suddenly struck me that to-day is your Birthday I'm sorry I did not send along greetings earlier, so as to catch the date, but better late than never.  I'll enclose best wishes for the day and also for a good and Happy Christmas in this.</p>
<p>Hope you have a good Xmas Dinner and a better one than mine.  I often wonder what it feels like to have your legs under a table again.</p>
<p>No more news this time.  Still going strong.</p>
<p>Love and best wishes for Xmas to all.</p>
<p>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
