Entered the Mersey at 8 a.m. We disembarked at the Liverpool Dock Railway Station, at 10. a m, and entrained for Salisbury Plainat 11 a.m. Before leaving the docks, I had a last look at the <strike>old</strike> trusty Transports which had borne us <strike>so bravely</strike> safely through the perils of three oceans. The voyage from Melbourne lasted 66 days.</p>
