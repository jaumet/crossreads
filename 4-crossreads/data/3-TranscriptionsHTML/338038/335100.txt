<p>Gallipoli Peninsula<br/>16th June 1915</p>
<p>My dear Mum<br/>Your much looked for letter of the 3rd April which Father mentioned in his of same date has not arrived so far. I hear all the Artillery mails have been somehow mixed up and so had to be sent back to Alexandria for re-sorting. There must be quite a bunch of letters for me somewhere, for as I told the Pater with the exception of his letter received last week I have not had any for weeks.<br/>There is nothing much to write about. Things are fairly slow. Ever since I have been with this Battery (Three weeks now) we have been in the one position. Sometimes we go 2 and 3</p>
