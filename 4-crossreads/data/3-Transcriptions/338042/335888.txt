<p>June 6th.<br/>A little better &ndash; My complaint is a most common one just at present &ndash; It very closely resembles "influenza", and is possessed by a great number of the troops in France  - "The Spanish Student"<br/>June 7th<br/>Some marvellous stunting of Bristol Planes up in the Aerodrome &ndash; Also some accidents &ndash; After a spell of two days I again return to the boards, but fail both to raise a voice &amp; also a smile &ndash;<br/>Still ill &ndash; but undaunted</p>
