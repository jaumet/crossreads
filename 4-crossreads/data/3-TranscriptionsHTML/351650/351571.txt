<p>It is very trying on board with nothing to do at all, especially after the strenous life of a drought year.  I fill in every morning by working at the medical books I have:  and by the time we arrive in London I should begin to become tolerably proficient.</p>
<p>Billie caught the train at Ararat alright and then came onto Adelaide where he arrived 1&frac12; hours before my boat train left for Outer Harbour.</p>
<p>He came down with me and saw me off.  We also saw Uncle Loo there and two of his daughters, he was engaged shipping some much silver bullion away on this boat from the Broken Hill mines of which he is one of the secretaries.  Well goodbye Kit Rd. woman, best love to you &amp; Tom.</p>
<p>Tell them to bring in enough sheep for sale to reduce some of our overdrafts and, if the double 'The Lintie-Kingsburgh' comes off for <strike>Melbourne</strike> Caufield &amp; Melbourne Cups, collect my &pound;2000, &pound;10 off Sam Allen &amp; get yourself a new dress.</p>
<p>Your affectionate brother in law,<br/>John Chute Ellis.</p>
