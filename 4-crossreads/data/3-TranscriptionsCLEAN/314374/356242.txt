(58)Leave England for Australia.
After I returned form leave spent a few happy weeks at Weymouth Hospital.  Every night the nurses and Doctors used to have private dances and I was their pianist.  The night before I left England for Australia they gave me a little send off and presented me with a very nice pocket wallet.
The Doctors often used to take me for motor rides to the various camps they visited, and one day we had a picnic to the Upway Wishing Well.
On 16th June 1919 we left Weymouth by train and travelled through the beautiful South of England arriving at Plymouth that night.  Next morning we boarded the "Ormonde" and that afternoon set sail and the shores of England were soon out of sight.
The "Ormonde" was a fine new steamer of 15,000 tons and had not been altered into a troopship.  We had 2164 persons aboard, the majority of us being hospital cases.  Included in this number were 145 wives of Australian soldiers coming out to Australia.  What a contrast going over to the war in the troopship "Kyarra" was to coming home to Australia in the "Ormonde".  On the "Ormonde" I was in a four berth cabin on the top deck with port holes, electric light, electric fans, with a fine bunk (with sheets &c) and the food, served in large dining saloon (with stewards to wait on us) was excellent.
We had the whole run of the steamer - no part of the ship was out of bounds.  The first few weeks on the boat I wasn't able to get about very much on account of my leg, and had to go to the ship's surgery every morning to have it treated.  We had a delightful and very pleasant trip back to Australia, the only disappointment being that we returned Via The Cape - the same way as we went over.  We were a hospital ship with a lot of serious cases aboard and we came this way to avoid the heat of the Red Sea.
Our first port of call was Capetown where we spent two happy days.  I sent a cable home from here.
Then called at Durban where we were again welcomed and entertained by these hospitable people.  Only had one day here this time.  Then sailed across the ocean and after fifteen days arrived at Fremantle and set foot on Australian soil again.  We were given a rousing reception here and entertained to tea and motor rides up to Perth.  The Post office here was besieged with the men sending telegrams home.
Left Fremantle next morning and after another calm trip across the Great Australian Bight arrived at the beautiful city of Adelaide.  Here we were again feted and next day left for Melbourne where we arrived after a two days journey.  Cars met the steamer at Port Melbourne and we were taken to private houses for lunch.  In the afternoon we were taken for a long car ride, then back to tea, and afterwards to Her Majesty's Theatre, where we witnessed a performance of "Going Up" - having seats in the reserved circle.
Then, after supper, we were driven back to the steamer again.  By now over 1000 of the troops had left the steamer - some at
