<p>Tel-el-Kebir<br/>29.3.1916<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>There seems a fair amount to tell you this week. Various things have been happening, one of which is that I have been made a Captain. Seems a big jump for a start but I suppose I will get used to it before long. Up till now I have been Adjutant to Colonel Hughes but he has now put me in command of the 43rd Battery which I take over today. It is a pretty fair responsibility, but it is a much better job than Adjt in as much as it gives one a chance to improve, whereas a staff job keeps one right out of touch with Battery work. I am sending you a cable this week-end telling you</p>
