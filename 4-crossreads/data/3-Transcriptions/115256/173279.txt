<p>Wednesday 20 January 1915</p>
<p>Yet another death occured to-day, making to date for the whole convoy six.  Out of these, one was the boatswain of the "Themistocles", and of the remaining five, three occurred on the same ship, with one each from the "Vestalia" and the "Borda".  The burial to-day was very impressive.  At a quarter to three, "parade" was sounded, and at 3 p.m. the fleet stopped and the men were called to attention.  The body being committed to the deep, the buglers then sounded the "Last Post".  The call, which was excellently played, rang out clearly across the waves.  The convoy then proceeded on its way.</p>
<p>The mail, to be sent from Aden, closed to-night at 6 p.m.  I sent away a great number of postcards, not that I could give anybody much news, but a card marked "On active service &ndash; passed by Censor", will I suppose, be somewhat of a novelty in Australia, at least for a little while.  Even if I do not get large mails while I am away, I shall deserve them judging by the size of my outwards mail.</p>
