<p>&amp; myself went down to the stoke hold &amp; helped do some coal shovelling.  Had a good look through the engine room &amp; went right down the shaft tunnel.  Wouldnt like to stop down the engine room too long.  It was fairly warm.  Passed 2 steamers today. One was a tramp &amp; other McIlwraith McEachern's steamer "Katoomba".  Had a good look through a telescope at them.  All section leaders today issued with field glasses.  All our equipment is now complete.</p>
<p>Monday 28th  [Dec]<br/>On stable picquet today.  It is a quiet easy job.  B Troop exercised their horses.  All the troops on board were medically examined &amp; as a result several will have to go off at Albany.  We are nearly there now.  The vessel has slowed down &amp; we will go in at daylight tomorrow morning.  I have been getting some letters</p>
