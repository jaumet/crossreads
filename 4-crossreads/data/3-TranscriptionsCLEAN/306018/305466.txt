Went to the Soldiers Club there had a shower bath & a shave & then went on to Moascar.  Had lunch there & went on to Alexandria by the 2-10 train.  Had to stand a good part of the way as the train was crowded. Went to the Windsor Hotel , had a good dinner & went to bed.  Was feeling very tired as I had very little sleep since Saturday night.  Reported for duty next morning at 9 oclock.  The time soon passes as they knock off at 4 oclock.  Went with Sgt Long to afternoon tea at Mrs Cornishs place.  They have a scotch nurse for the 3 youngsters & they are great kids. 
 25th to 29th Find work here very easy, have plenty of time off to knock about.  We got a big mail in on the 27th I got 6 letters & 2 more on thew 29th.  Have been going pretty strong answering them.  On Saty
