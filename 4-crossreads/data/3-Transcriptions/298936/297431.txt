<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Saturday 2</p>
<p>Heavy duty in Artillery Lane which was no different to the fatigue of yesterday with difference of staying all night.</p>
<p>No cases to [indecipherable].</p>
<p>Getting quite used to Beachy Bill now.</p>
<p>Last night there was a little doing on the left for at sunset there was a heavy artillery with mostly the firing being from our own guns.</p>
<p>After dark there was heavy artillery fire which of course sounds like a rifle range only heavier with the addition of the sharp repeated cracks of the machine guns.</p>
