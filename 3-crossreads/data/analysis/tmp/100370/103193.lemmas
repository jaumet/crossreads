 When I did go into an uneasi doze , I was sudden awaken by the feed bag be whisk out from under my head in a veri summari fashion . I sat up amaz , wonder for the moment what had happen . Then I becam awar of the form of a hors loom up in the black alongsid of me . I recaptur my pillow , but he refus to budg , till I got up and chase him . Henceforward the night was a nightmar . Three loos hors were promenad round , and as sure as I doze one of them would grab my pillow , and when they did not wake me up do it , I dreamt they did . Next morn earli , the 13th , we hook up again , and reach Camp about ten o'clock . The rain , which had clear up in the night , had commenc again , and we arriv in a delug . The bearer , we found , who had gone on ahead of the transport , and had reach Camp the night befor , had had a wors time even than we . They had spent the night , huddl in a bed tent , in their wet cloth , without a solitari blanket between them . They must have had a rotten time . The view of the countri from here is singular peac look , and with the fruit tree just break into bloom , and the hill just touch with green , it is veri beauti . One would never dream that war had late swept over it . This Camp , howev was declar insanitari , and on the 18th we move to anoth about a mile and a half from the Jewish Coloni of Rishon Le Sion [Rishon le Zion] . We are just about sick and tire of the wet season , and are long for some continu fine weather . We get a few day fine , and then five or six day wet and cold . But there is no doubt of the benefici effect on the Countri . Green feed is spring up everywher , the orchard are a mass of blossom with the most delic ting of green just show . The lane are ablaz with anemon , and small yellow flower under the prick pear
