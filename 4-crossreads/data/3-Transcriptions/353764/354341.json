<p>Sunday 21st Nov 15<br/>Was Fairly quiet day as far as Military work was concerned.  I made a thorough inspection of Melbourne &amp; Suburbs by Motor Car &amp; found the trip very pleasant.  We wound up the evening by visiting Mr Hart, Chief Director of the Griffiths Bros, &amp; finally returned tot the Boat at 11.55 pm.<br/>The places visited were Melbourne E Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Kew, E Kew, Auburn, Prahan, St Kilda, &amp; others which I do not know.</p>
<p>Monday 22nd  Nov 15<br/>The Day broke with a very dirty wind blowing &amp; sleeting rain.  At &frac12; past 9 the 17th Brigade Artillery whom we had called for marched onto the pier, to the accompaniment of Martial airs played by the bands.  The people were allowed on the Pier, but there was a very poor showing, the crowd not numbering over 300, &amp; after the send off we had from Sydney, made us think all the worse of Port Melbourne.<br/>At 12 oclock the anchor was weighed &amp; we headed for the West.<br/>What a Sea!  Every time the boat came down the Nose would break the sea &amp; send it in showers</p>
