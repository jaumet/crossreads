<p>3rd Aust. Gen. Hosp.<br/>B.E.F.<br/>France.<br/>26.8.17</p>
<p>My dearest Mother,</p>
<p>Strange to say I'm in the same town, when I first came to France   &amp;  next door to 1st 8th African Gen Hosp. &ndash; Everything is greatly improved   &amp;  this is a very comfortable Hosp. I've had a move now, from the 3rd A.C.C.S. to the General.</p>
<p>Left Dorothy where I last wrote from but cannot say if she is there now. We came here Friday &ndash; took the whole day travelling by train. Sister Kelly   &amp;  I got orders Thursday night to be ready next morning to leave at 9 a.m.   &amp;  arrived here about 6.30 p.m. very tired out   &amp;  down hearted. I daresay it is the best for us   &amp;  no doubt you will all</p>
