Our Camp is not as I expected to find it on Sand, it is more like a mixture of Sand clay and beats down very hard, the camp is kept "Scrupulously" I dont think that is spelt "correctly" clean, and in front of each tent the men are building low parapetts they just dig out some of the sand clay mixture of which I spke. and puddle it up then stamp it in between two planks and there you are. when these parrapetts are white washed they look nice. some of the tents have designs in front of them perhaps a shield with number of Batt etc. done with little round pebbles. some a Rough copy of the Aus. Coat of Arms. they look very nice, and they men take a lot of interest in their different designs,
