<p>[Picture postcard - back]<br/>Carte Postale<br/>Napoleon is buried in about 6 coffins.  One has to look down to see the coffin as it is below ground level.  I believe it was an idea of Boneys to have all the nations of the world bowing down to him &amp; so they buried him this way.  Everyone of course bends over to see the coffin.  The figures surrounding him (I think) represent his campaigns.</p>
