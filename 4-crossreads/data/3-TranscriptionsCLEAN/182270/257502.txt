WEDNESDAY, JULY 9, 1919.
Fine, but a bit cold. Jo drove me to
Pat Hurley's & I met Eric & Barney
Perkins there. I inspected 360 wether X
bred hoggets there & bought them. Went
on to Barney's place on Round Island
& inspected & bought about 280 ewes
& 155 wethers. Went on to Kickerbill
then, & Jo brought me home. Saw
the Mackays & Sy & Laurence & Grey
from Cattle Creek at Kickerbill.
Tickle round the Mountain and
at the fence at Boundary
well
