<p>I must start a furniture removers business, it should turn out a success after all this experience. Received a big mail 16 letters, was greatly delighted. Who should spring a surprise on us (Eric &amp; I) in the afternoon but Carl Gow. Do you remember him. He came to some of our evenings.  He enlisted a fortnight after me &amp; had been in Gallipoli four months, a great experience for him, he is a lucky fellow. In the evening we took a stroll over to the Y.M.C.A. hut, where a big concert was being held, arranged by the 30th Battalion. Met a great number of friends who were on board the Beltana with me, some of my old patients greeted me by "Hello Matron"" I had almost forgotten this name, as the Tent Division look after the sick, &amp; I have been drilling all the time amongst the stretcher bearers. Who should I meet at the concert but Eric Conolly, Will Anderson, Ren Rabbidge, &amp; Capt. Ward. The latter I have not seen since we disembarked.</p>
<p>Sunday 27th February<br/>Impressive service, Captain Ward in charge, spent most of the afternoon with him. He took my photo which you have received. He is a great sport &amp; well liked amongst the men.</p>
