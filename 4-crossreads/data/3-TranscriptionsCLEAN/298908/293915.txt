Have been reading "Our Mutual Friend" nearly all day long it is a very interesting book & one of Dickens best.It is now 10.30 & I am just scribbling these few lines before going to bed after a highly successful night of "bridge".  I play this game practically every evening after tea & am considered a first rate player (sounds like skiting but true nevertheless) well Bob Modral & I hit them up by over 3,000 points, the last 2 rubbers we scored 1,897 while our opponents got 136, some rapid scoring if you like & they fancied themselves when they started I don't think they will be very keen for revenge.The last 2 nights I have slept on deck but the dew is far too heavy to be healthy so I am coming down below for a few more nights, in this part of the world the dews are exceptionally severe they will wet you through during the night.
