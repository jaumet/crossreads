  
 things the University Buildings, which are at present used as a hospital for soldiers, we also went through Bournville, Cadbury's model village, Chamberlain's residence, and much of the English country areas. We then went for tea to Mr L. Sames' home & spent a very pleasant hour or so there. 
 In the evening we motored back to town & the three of us occupied a box at one of the Variety Theatres & enjoyed the programme very much. Oyster supper at Pape's Hotel followed & Alan & I then dodged off to the Soldiers' Club & arrived there by midnight to find that all the beds were taken. 
 Nothing perturbed we got two blankets & a cushion each for 3d & slept on the floor of the billiard room in company with a score or more of other "swaddies" as happy as could be.
