<p>11.5.15<br/>Tue. 11th.  Feeling a bit the worse for wear when I awoke this morning, a bad cold &amp; a bad head, went a good way towards putting me in a bad humor, had a rifle parade on deck before breakfast but I was feeling sick &amp; went to Corporal Gabriel &amp; was told there was to be no sick parade to-day.  I then went to the Surgery &amp; tried to "hum" a dose of cough mixture from the A.M.C. men.  When they heard we could get no sick parade one of them went to the Lieut. Col. who went icy on Gabriel &amp; we had a sick parade at 11.15 a.m., in consequence.  We have been passing small islands all</p>
