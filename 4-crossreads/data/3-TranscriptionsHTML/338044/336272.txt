<p>A heavy fog &amp; very cold during the morning. Awoke at 6.30 am &amp; set forth to St Sever Church at 7 am to attend communion. Bitterly cold. Return for breakfast &amp; to work until 12.30 pm. After lunch take a trip home &amp; again come away for our usual Sunday afternoon trip, this time to Maromme another pretty little village close to Rouen. Meet here a French sentry, guarding the railway &amp; have a yarn with him  Witness the most interesting spectacle of this sentry halting three motor-cars passing the cross-roads &amp; <strike>den</strike> demanding their passports &amp; photographs  Also he was most particular in the execution of his duty. Unexpectedly meet a young Belgian soldier, a fine chap, speaking English well &amp; he had been in Sydney &amp; Melbourne with the Belgian training ship boys in January 1915. He is a native of Li&egrave;ge &amp; took part in that grand defensive which saved the world. Wounded</p>
