<p>If we get a month or so to polish up in France we should go into the firing  line very fit.</p>
<p>I had lunch with Leslie at Serapeum about 10 days ago. His Battalion is leaving very shortly for France so I expect to see him over there. He looks very well, but like me has had no news from home for some time. The last I had from you were written on 20th March from Kurrajong, so I am looking forward to running into a lot of back mail over in France.</p>
<p>Have been hearing regularly from the Sis and hope it will be possible for me to get a trip to England to see them one of these fine days &ndash;</p>
