 am not aware of the casualties further up at Cape Helles, but presume they were heavy.  The landing up there was a hellish affair.  The "River Clyde" a 3000 ton Steamer was run ashore with 2000 men in, in order to expedite their landing.  It is said that she took the ground further north than was intended right under Seddul Bahr fort &amp; not one man out of the first batch of about 200 reached the shore.  It was then decided to abandon the attempt for the present &amp; the remaining men stayed huddled up in the tween decks the whole day, whilst a rain of bullets swept her decks the whole time.  It is said that wonderful &amp; self sacrificing acts of valour were performed by our men throughout that trial.  At night the landing was accomplished with small losses. 
 3 p.m.  Another big shell just fell in the water about 200 yards astern of us, so I guess the Goeben must be having a go across from the Dardanelles. 
 11 p.m.  It is now a beautiful night &amp; everything is still, except the continuous rifle fire on the shore, the occasional bursting of shrapnel on the hills, showing up vividly in the darkness &amp; now &amp; again the long rolling sound of the Warships guns as they reverberate up the valleys.  One can hear the long swish of the shell until it finds a bed in the turf, let us hope amongst some of the enemy.  Even the little village of Maidos is still burning peacefully.  Its not often you see one burn so peacefully.
