 Erected entanglements today right across gully and also laid a rope of barbed wire among undergrowth  keeping it about 2ft 6ins high. In Pedler's dugout after evening stand to arms like  a big cellar 15ft underground.

Fatigues working all night, tamping &c.

No 75's  today. "Dinkum oil" received and 1600 and I volunteered for the job of being the last to leave this position when they do go. Stores &
