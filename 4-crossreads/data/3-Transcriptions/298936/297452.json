<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Saturday 23</p>
<p>Decided to give the job best so applied to Staff Serg. to allow me to get back to stretcher work &amp; let [indecipherable] take my place.</p>
<p>They both thought me mad for batman's job is notoriously "good" but I fail to see it absolutely.</p>
<p>Arrived back at camp before dinner &amp; began to feel worse.</p>
<p>Capt. Conrick said he was glad to get me back &amp; I shuddered to think of going on sick parade so turned into dug out &amp; took some medicine.</p>
<p>Temperature 102&deg;.</p>
