<p>stop the men from going, they are a bad lot these last lot of ours. Last night a prisoner escaped from the Guard room again more trouble for the Sergt.<br/>29th. Yesterday afternoon I had a severe attack of pains in the stomach, had to lay down all the afternoon, they went off during the night.<br/>This morning although it was drizzling rain we went for a route march about 10 miles, &amp; by the time we finished we were all wet through.<br/>All No 1 platoon were on the Lewis gun this afternoon till 4.30 after that we all went out on the parade ground &amp; played games of all sorts, these are a part of the training now.</p>
