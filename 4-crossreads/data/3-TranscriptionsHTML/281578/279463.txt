<p>but I don't like it. Tuesday 23 April  Had nothing to do all the morning. At 3.30 p.m. we left this easy snap &amp; marched back to where we came from on Saturday. This time D Coy were put in the tents instead of the shed. The New Zealanders took our place in reserve. Passed over cultivated fields - France seems to be cultivated everywhere - &amp; saw a good many guns on the way. I got a parcel from Elsie, a tin of biscuits she made, cocoanut macaroons, &amp; they were very tasty &amp; acceptable. Aub also got two parcels. Had a chat to Frank Mattocks today, he is a Lt. in the A.S.C. attached to this Brigade, the 4th; was at the Maitland High School with me. Fritz startled us by pouring some big shells right over tonight. Wedn. 24 April Capt. Wallach read out orders this morning, including one by General Rawlinson, commanding the 4th Army, saying he expected every man to hang on to the last in the defence of Amiens, &amp; as we are going to that front by 'buses today, things are going to be very warm; oh well, a man can only take his chance. It is cold and misty today, yesterday was quite warm. There was a battalion parade this morning - after dinner we moved out in full marching order a mile or two</p>
