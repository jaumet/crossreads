<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>I told you how I arrived back from leave amongst ruined house with their furniture and materials lying everywhere. &nbsp;As we went forward in the wake of the advance, we saw the same sights and more, and then we thought we were done with it for a while by going a great way back in rest. &nbsp;While we were there, too, the newspapers boomed with the good news that the Germans had accepted our conditions and we thought the war was over. &nbsp;It has turned out a ruse typically German, and since then ten of us have been sent forward again amongst the same sort of ruins that are on all sides in these areas.</p>
<p>We are in a house, pretty comfortable, in beds, do our own cooking, and have it fixed up for ourselves pretty conveniently. &nbsp;The weather has been mild the last few days, but the rain&nbsp;</p>
