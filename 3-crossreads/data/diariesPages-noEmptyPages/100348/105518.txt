17/1/16.
Arrived at Port Melbourne at 8 A.M. Some one releived me of most of my money. Have heard this is a common nuisance on troop ships. General leave granted. I went out to North Melbourne to see Holdsworth. Found him at home and we had a jolly day of it; you bet I enjoyed being in my home town. There was some disturbance in the city; as I was returning to the ship about midnight I got into a rather a boisterious crowd. I don't know what it was all about but some misguided burst of patriotic enthusisiam I believe. Anyway a couple of the fellows at my table received cracks over the head from policemen's batons. I returned to the ship alright.
