<p>4<br/>The ghosts of prayers and cries and tears<br/>The Ghosts of Good deeds done<br/>Passing and Shuddering, gliding by<br/>Solemnly, one by one<br/>Silently, one by one</p>
<p>5<br/>Ghosts of Faith and Hope and Truth,<br/>Memories brought from the Womb<br/>Of byegone days, (what a host there are)<br/>Passing again to the Tomb<br/>The still and Desolate Tomb</p>
<p>6<br/>Ah me, they are only Ghosts to day,<br/>But the Sin that slew them is here<br/>Lusty and strong, astraddle the  <strike>tomb</strike> Graves<br/>Of the past I held so dear<br/>The Past with its memories dear.</p>
<p>7<br/>They pass, and a lonely road of pain<br/>As I bow my head, I see<br/>For the tender Joys of a nobler past<br/>Will never come back to me.<br/>No, never return to me.</p>
