& these words: What did you do in the great war eh? the reply is "fatigue": got a letter from Harold dated 20-3-16: my arm swelled like a young leg of mutton & I was very crook: I must have got a bit delirious for I was under the impression that I was patching up wounded men at the dressing station: I was very feverish & the cockles round my heart got cold & started running up my back bone in little shivers, a la the "Flues": concert:
Friday May 26th Billets: fair day: "stand to" at 3 am while our guns gave them a shake up: went on sick parade (the first since I enlisted) & the Ghurka ordered me a couple of days off: laid down all day & turned in to sleep early: The boys are working very hard on fatigues at night & since we have came here the trenches have undergone some changes for the better:
Saturday May 27th Billets: up at 8.30 am: fair day: I felt pretty right again so done my bit cleaning up: heavy bombardment by both sides in early morning also plenty of machine gun & rifle fire: shrapnel from an aero' shell came through the tiled roof of our billet: Alf & I went for a feed as I couldn't eat yesterday: while Alf demolished eggs- a -cook I got outside of a whole tin of preserved pineapples much to the surprise of Madam: after dinner Fritz started shelling with shrappo' & coal boxes: some of the shrap' came through our roof: one "coal box" landed in the middle of an old house & up she went. (mafish house): our guns
