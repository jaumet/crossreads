Sunday 23 January 1916Had a good sleep and did not get up till 8 o'clock.  Sam & Miss Line came in their Woolsey car;  we drove to Chatswood, got Dora and went out towards Hawksberry [Hawkesbury].  Did not get there but saw some wonterful county for roughness.  Played the flute.
Monday 24 January 1916Got back to camp at midnight.  Very cold night with heavy dew;  blankets quite wet from sleep outside.Musketry all day.Spent all the afternoon trying to ring up Mosman;  succeeded in letting them know I wanted to ring up but did not get any further.  Telephones bad for the temper.
