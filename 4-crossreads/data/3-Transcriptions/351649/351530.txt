<p>The Chestnut Troop, R.H.A.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Robertson</p>
<p>I just got a letter from you full of interest, a lot of things about everybody in it:  dated March 12th at which time you had arrived back at Togamain, [Toganmain] after what seems to have been a strenuous summer holiday.</p>
<p>So Kirby eventually arrived in Cairo, he seems to have had a varied experience between then and leaving Gundaline.</p>
<p>Old Wilkie will be a hardened soldier by now, the fellows with him will like him.  And I was glad to know Robertson (Duncan) had a commission.</p>
<p>I have been expecting a cable from Burrabogie when you get the first good rains:  surely we can expect some May rains this year:  it was pretty dry in Jan., Feb., &amp; March according to the Australasians which I get weekly.</p>
<p>There is a good mail service to all troops in France, and also every convenience for getting cakes, cigarettes and any other comfort you wish for.</p>
<p>The only draw back is that we are constantly moving from place to place:  for the last three weeks we have been doing solid manoeuvres with the cavalry, a good sight to see them in thousands.  You see these horse artillery batteries</p>
