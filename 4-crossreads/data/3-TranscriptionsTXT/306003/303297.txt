23.3.16Thurs 23rdThis morning Reid & I went out to the sand hill, but failed to get in touch with Beni Suef as a bend in the Nile with its high bank on the eastern side comes between us.  We came back to camp at dinner time & found Major Smith had all the men fallen in early this morning & told them he wanted the men to fall out who had anything to do with the canteen raid last night & he would crime them later otherwise, the whole Sqd would have to do 2 hours extra parade both morning & evening, & as there was no response to the invitation to fall out; the Sqd put in this morning doing musketry drill; & had a route march this afternoon, I put in the afternoon teaching the 6 new men signalling both, Bult & Hargreaves are trying their hand at it.
