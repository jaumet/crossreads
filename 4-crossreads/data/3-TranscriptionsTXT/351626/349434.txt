Hut E. 8. Woodcote Convalescent Camp Epsom England 20/10/1915Dear Mother,I think there will be a mail leaving tomorrow which this letter should catch.  I expect to got go out on Furlough in about a fortnight. I can walk a bit without even a stick   & broke my record since 7th June by walking about three miles with a stick.  Of course I will go   & see our relations if I get a chance.  We get a free pass to travel anywhere to spend
