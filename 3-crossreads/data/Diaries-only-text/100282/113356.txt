this morning, you would be surprised at the amount of stuff the men are short of these "requisitions" are divided into 3 distinct parts viz. A.B.C., the first coloumn A is for articles that never have been issued, the next, B. for articles that have been lost by shell fire or through action of the enemy, this coloumn practically covers all deficiences, it is a good loop hole for stuff that has been lost by them or thrown away owing to some of them being too lazy to carry the gear. I might say that nearly all shortages fall under this coloumn, otherwise they would be made to pay for the stuff the next coloumn C is for exchanges, that is to say that whatever you have under this heading, you have to put an article in return, all old worn out dirty clothing equipment etc are exchanged for new stuff through the Quarter Master in this way, I don't know what the troops would do if we did not go near the firing line sometimes
