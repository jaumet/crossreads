good of the rest of you.  I would like to get some photoes of you all about the house.  Marie also sent me some nice snaps but she spoilt one by putting a blot over her own face.  I hope you had a good time at Crookwell & hope you got out to Woodville for a while as it would be great for you there with Bruce & Auntie Eva is always so good.  Oh well I think I will have to say au revoir.  Love & kisses to all, whips to your self.
