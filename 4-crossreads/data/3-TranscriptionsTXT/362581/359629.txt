My darling Eddy.
My dearest little chap, you will be just now having a good time with Auntie Belle's birthday by the time you get this card.  Then soon will be Xmas excitement. Wish I could be with you all but shall try   &amp;  get out soon.  You will have some playmates now   &amp;  what a happy time  you must have at school. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. From OXOX XOXOXOX  Auntie Eadle.
