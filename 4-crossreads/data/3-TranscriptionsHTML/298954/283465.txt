<p>1917<br/>Sat. 2nd June.<br/>I returned to my interrupted tea still rather suspicious &ndash; taking the precaution of closing switches and preparing for transmission from the accumulators, since the dynamo was not then running.  No signs of life in the 'phones.  At 4.45 pm. there was a rush on deck &ndash; a 'plane motor could be heard just outside and I got on deck just in time to see a bomb drop off the port bow and a message attached to a sandbag fall on deck from a seaplane just overhead.  The machine was a small two-seater biplane &ndash; a German Naval Ensign was clearly visible flying from one of her stays &ndash; and she was flying so low that her pilot and observer could be distinctly seen.  The latter was apparently ready to do some serious bombing.  I made for the bridge for orders, but before I reached the companionway instructions came down "not to use the wireless"!</p>
