Sunday 2 July 1916Slept until nearly 9 o'clock & did enjoy it. The day turned out to be beautifully fine with a fair breeze blowing. Remained quietly inside & got a little mail written, but found that the sitting yarning hindered me a good deal & really very little writing was done. A beautiful peaceful evening & lovely sunset. Very quiet night.
