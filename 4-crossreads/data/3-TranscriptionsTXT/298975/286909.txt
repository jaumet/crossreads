for King or countryAs night fell the sea got worse also the sickness I faced going below about 7 PM & managed to swing a hammock & hop into it. It proved more comfortable than it looked & I slepped without a break untill 6 in the morning.
We sleep & eat in the same place & it is very stuffy in rough weather when the port holes are closed. Otherwise things are good
