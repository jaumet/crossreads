<p>fair number of bombs to hunt me out of England. That is in a decent job not at one of the training camps though I very soon get tired of that. I fancy it is Harry's eyes that keep him across there then again it is only right he should stay as someone has to fill the Job &amp;amp: I think his case as deserving as any.  I haven't seen anything of Oram for ages I don't think there is any need to worry about him He hasint seen too much of France &amp;amp: I have heard he isent too bright either.  His men dident give him a very good name in the line.  Of coarse I don't know what he is like we were in different companies. Have you ever met Littler since he returned he was a fine chap in or out of the line. He got his commission I think I told you his Father was killed shortly after he came to France No there arint many of us left half a dozen would be the very outside. Well I cant think of anything else to write about so shall have to close for this time. Love &amp;amp: best wishes to all<br/>Your sincere son Clyde</p>
