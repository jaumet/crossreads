<p>Dear Beat &amp; Family<br/>Just a line to let you know i am alright hoping this note finds you all the same. Well Beat i am still in the same camp and likely to be for a few more weeks yet as my knee has gone again and they have put me on Tempory Base just knocking about cleaning up about the place there are no shells and bombs here to be ducking away from. I met Jin Walker from Greta the other night the wound that he had was a bit of shrapnel hit him on the shoulder nothing to speak about he said he hardly felt it. Well Beat i am just going down to the post office now i am expecting a parcel from England today and if you dont mind you can send me over two plugs of my favourite tobacco Conqueror. From your loving Husband Tom</p>
