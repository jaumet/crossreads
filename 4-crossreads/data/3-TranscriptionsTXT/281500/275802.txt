 This afternoon while I was waiting for the carts to come down to the dump I went into a big woollen mill there are nearly all young girls and women who are working in it. I noticed most of the machinery was made in Alsace, nearly all the wool from what I could see of it was very fine and carded. Pay day again and some of the boys are broke already, gambling as usual. Was down at the railway station early this morning there were hundreds of Germans unloading trucks. 3rd  Church parade this morning and the first one we have been on for a long time the 3rd Batt had their band out and it was very poor especially the cornets. We all got our 2nd blanket again last and by heavens it was wanted for you can't sleep with one blanket
