<p>being asked all sorts of questions of his experience in the Water, several of the Women danced with him, after staying there looking on but not dancing as my rope shoes were unsuitable I came back and had some Supper of Cocoa and Bread &amp; cheese, the Cocoa with Milk in tins were given to us from the Australian Comforts Fund and Boiling Water is supplied between 8 and 9 O clock Pm from the Cook's Galley I turned in at 10 Pm and had a good sleep rising this Morning at 7 am. After Breakfast word went about that the Man who fell overboard had been placed under arrest during the Night and was now in the Cells under armed Guard for threatening to strike the Captain and making an attempt to go overboard again and will be handed over to the Police and charged with some offence when we arrive at Durban. During the Morning Church Service was held on the Forward Deck and a collection taken up for the Mercantile Seamen's Widow's and Orphan's Fund and a fair sum was given by the Boy's. After Dinner a Cigarette and Tobacco issue was given to the Troops from the Australian Comfort's Fund which was very acceptable. After Tea a Magic Lantern Picture Service was given down Aft and a good crowd joined in the Singing, and a Song Service Forward was held for the Troops and so passed a pleasant Sunday for all on board in good Weather.</p>
