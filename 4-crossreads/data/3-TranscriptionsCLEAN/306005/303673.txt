We ran into all the Generals in this part of the world here.The sea has been too rough to get the wounded on board yet, but they are fairly comfortable in Hospital tents; Just before dark Lindsell & I went out & run a telephone line from the centre Outpost to the one on the right & it was after dark when we returned, looks like rain again tonight.
