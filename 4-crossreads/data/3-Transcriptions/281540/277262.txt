<p>12/11/15<br/>Air washed clean everything standing out very clear to the eye.  Raining nearly all morning and cold too.  Enemy &amp; ourselves both quiet no artillery firing on land but warships up Suvla Bay rumbling.  After lunch with Curnow went to B8 and through telescope could see Turks much busier then usual.  Strings of laden mules and horses passing and repassing, for the first time visible in two places one higher up the winding track.  Many soldiers moving along also.  Could see parties gathering wood, but how unfortunate it is the naked eye can see none of these unaided else how many kills we would get &ndash; but then the distance is too much for our rifles.  Along firing line -  Pedler digging in right down feet below ground level.</p>
<p>Bazeley took an unexploded 75 shell to pieces, - a lovely piece of delicate mechanism every part most beautifully finished and turned.  Base of shell for about 9" full of black powder.  High explosive striking pin &amp;c forming separate part connecting with nose.</p>
<p>Went round back of hill, now completely altered, walking right down comparatively easy what was previously extremely steep. <br/>Terraces, cook fires, working parties, spoils from tunnels provides good building up material for reducing grades.  Big mail reported at beach.  Bomb reported to have landed on 23rd Battn &amp; killed a few wounded others.  Dam stick bombs are b &ndash; o.  Have had a few narrow escapes damn 'em &amp; they'll probably get me yet</p>
