<p>Ribemont  18/12/16  Interior economy all day. A village of creamy slush.  Prisoners under guard at work on the road.  Not a bad little village this but full of soldiers and most uncomfortable.  Some new reinforcements arrived for us.  A very worrying day not feeling very well and a great deal of annoyance over shortages in the way of socks and other necessary things and turned in early feeling very tired.  Ribemont would be quite a good little place in days of peace.  It is some size and on its outskirts is D.H.Q surrounded with trees now all bare of leaf.  The old church is in a sea of mud and its square is used as a dump and other things for rations and stores.  Bunks are fitted into all the buildings.  My room is in through a stable door and has a cow shed next door where cows champ their food in the darkness.  The room is very comfortable and has a couple of old hunting scenes on the wall and a religious certificate.  Awakened late by the Adjutant with orders etc.</p>
<p>19/12/16  The 21st moved off early.  Ice was lying thick all over the ground and the air was very sharp and cold.  Orders out for inspection by General Legge so busied myself making preparations.  Some men to the baths today.  At 2 pm the ceremonial inspection took place in a snow storm of powdery flakes which soon turned the ground white.  Result satisfactory very few comments and tremendous improvement from his inspection when we came out of the line first.  Our last reinforcement having had only a little training were not on parade with us but had a separate inspection.  Result was complimentary.  Colonel Somerville very obliging re ordnance issues.  Snow thick on ground.</p>
