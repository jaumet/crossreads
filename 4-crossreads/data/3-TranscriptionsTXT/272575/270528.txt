 Wallington 13.2.18. Dear Old Bett. It's high time that I sent you a line, to tell you just what Ive been doing, in these stirring times, but this will only be a short note.   I landed here on the 4th and have been here ever since, I really intended trying to hunt up some of the relatives, but the time has simply vanished so after the first couple of days I decided to stay here alltogether for no matter where I went I could never receive a warmer welcome.  One day last week I met Lilian Church, whom you may remember, "the Girl that you forbade to Kiss me, - at Ross more.   we went to Westminster Abbey together but could not see all of it as there was a service in progress, we then went and had a cup of Tay, at the Corner House "Strand" &ndash; then I took her back to the Hos. &ndash; Yesterday I went to Edmonton, to see one of my mates who is or was in Hos there, only to find that he had left that morning ..  I came back to London, walked from L'pool street Stn. down to Threadneedle st. then on along Cannon St. to St. Pauls. and on entering found a sermon in Progress so did not see all of that Edifice, it is a fine place, and would take quite a long time to see properly.   Tomorrow I may run up and see the Tower, and if possible the Museum.   I may be able to do it in the time
