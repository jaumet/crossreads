<p>with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Edmonds.  On Friday Dick, E. &amp; I went to Salisbury again.  I went to The Close while Ellis &amp; Dick went around to see the sights.  They visited "Old Sarum".  I saw an aeroplane flying around the Cathedral spire.  It seemed very strange.  Mr. Freemantle hates to see them do that.  He is always afraid that one will hit the steeple;  but whether He worries about damage to the steeple or to the airman I do not know.  We came Home by the 7 p.m. train.  The one which leaves at 11.15 p.m. is rather late.</p>
