<p>Sister Weiss invited us to an afternoon &amp; we had a lovely time Dorothy sang but I was sorry I did not hear her, because I had to leave at 5 p.m. &ndash; had another engagement for afternoon tea.  We don't have afternoon tea here until about 5 or 6 p.m., so you see I shall be quite continental when I return.</p>
<p>We have had some lovely donkey rides down here &ndash; wish I could bring one home &ndash; Eddy would love one &ndash; They are very clever &amp; not at all silly, so I wont mind people calling me a donkey.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday we had a delightful day.  Left early in the morning for "Aboukir" another Rest Home on the coast &ndash; which has a Noah's Ark (that is supposed to have been in the Crimean War) where some of the sisters sleep &ndash; we were round over to it &amp; stayed there about one hour, watched some fine swimming &ndash; displayed by the nurses &ndash; others got into goun &amp; were rowed to the shallow water &amp; are taught swimming there.  None of us went in for a swim &ndash; returned to the beach, got donkeys &amp;</p>
