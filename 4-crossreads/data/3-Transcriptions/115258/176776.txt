<p>however they are issuing us with plenty of oil and grease for out saddles and it makes beautiful slush lamps, I am writing this by the light of a piece of rifle rag stuck in a tobacco tin full of castor oil, and it is quite as good as a candle.</p>
<p>We are still all wondering how conscription went - there have been two or three rumours about it, but as they have ran[?] both for and against; one cant believe anything.</p>
<p>The country is beginning to get very pretty round here now; the early wheat is coming up and the niggers are all at work in their fields with their little wooden ploughs <s>and </s>&nbsp;with donkeys, and cattle and camels pulling them and their wives hoeing up the hard patches. I&#39;d like to own some of the big flats here; a six furrow plough going round them; the niggers would wonder what had struck them when they saw their whole plot turned over in one act - they only scratch the ground about 2 in deep and dont plow out any weeds, so their crops dont get a very fair spin, but it is wonderful how ^<sup>well</sup> they grow.</p>
<p>Hope you are getting too dry a summer.</p>
<p>Love to Mother and the boys</p>
<p>Your loving Son</p>
