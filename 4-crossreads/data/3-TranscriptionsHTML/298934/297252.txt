<p>country would have been very pretty.  We kept passing various troops in trenches Gurkhas etc.  All over the ground were empty shell cases.  The Lizzies were like a ship's funnel, and contained balls as big as billiard balls.  Soon afterwards we got into extended order, dropped our picks and fixed bayonets.  By now we were under a deadly rifle fire.  The ground was quite flat and there was no cover.  Already we were tired with running such a long way with our packs on.</p>
