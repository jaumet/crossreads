I can see very little difference in London from the first time I saw her in 1916 there seems just as many people about as ever there was, but there is a big difference in the food line, if you haven't got your food cards you would nearly starve that's a certainty, it was a lovely moonlight night so I strolled down the Strand into Whitehall then went over past the House of Parliament over Westminster Bridge the old Thames looked so quiet peaceful with the moon shining on its silvery surface I lingered quite a while enjoying this then I walked home down Victoria Street to my diggings
