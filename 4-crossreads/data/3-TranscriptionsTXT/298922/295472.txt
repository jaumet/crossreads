 A party out for WOOD, brought in 4 Turkish Cavalry. One was riding on a Light Horse Saddle which was made in  Melbourne !!  I think Joe very ill advised to try &amp; come. Who would look after the Letting of the House &amp; what would become of MOTHER, the Garden etc. etc. Besides surely one is enough. Joe's responsibilities are more than mine &amp; does he really think he would be doing the right thing coz I don't. I doubt if JOE FIT any way &ndash; the war will be over in a month or so, I'm sorry as I know Joe's feelings but he would be mad to come.
