<p>place honoured by our presence was the zoo.  We did not go much on that, all the exhibits were separated by about a half mile walk, the fun was in getting there.  Underground, surface &amp; overhead.  On our return we had tea at the same place where we were presented with theatre tickets for "A Taylor-Made Man".  It was very good with plenty of fun.</p>
<p>The next day we met a Sydney man at lunch &ndash; from Artarmon &ndash; once Manager of the N.Y. Theatre, George St.  After that we went to the movies where we saw G.P.O. - Martin Place &amp; George St. &ndash; that woke it up I can tell you.  After tea we went to a Review but it was not much chop.  The next day we made straight for Coney Is. &amp; put in the rest of the time there.</p>
<p>The next day &amp; night I slept &amp; the following day no leave was granted &amp; the day following that we set sail with our convoy, 14 ships, a cruiser &amp; destroyer.</p>
<p>At present we are going dead slow through a Scotch mist or some such abominable curse with 15 more destroyers, seven mine sweepers &amp; two derrigibles.  We expect to get in to-night &ndash; Liverpool &ndash; at 10-11 p.m.  Thanking you for your good wishes.</p>
<p>Yrs. sincerely<br/>Harry</p>
