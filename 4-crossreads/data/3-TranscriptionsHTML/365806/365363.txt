<p>Rec. 17 Feb</p>
<p>France 16.12.16<br/>Dear father,</p>
<p>We got orders last night to shift up &amp; join the battalion today, so our chances of being out of the trenches for Christmas are very remote.</p>
<p>The adjutant has just sent for me so I will have to go.</p>
<p>I saw Caesar in Wentworth hospital London before leaving, &amp; had a day in town with him.  He has a slight touch of pneumonia but is quite right again now.</p>
<p>Give Dorothy &amp; mother a kiss from me, &amp; tell them not to worry.</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Keith</p>
