<p>the line as I do not know where she will land (at Suez or Said) but she and Batemans will travel together to Benha &ndash; about  1/2 hour from Cairo and I can meet her there at least.  Lines are like this ... [line drawing of positions of towns in Egypt &ndash; Cairo, Benha, Alex, Pt Said, Ismaiha and Suez]. Both Said and Suez trains join together art Ismaiha and the Alexandria passengers get out at Benha about 3 hours  express from Alex.  I may be able to meet her at one of the extremities if I get word intime as to her place of arrival. However I have written to her at Aden giving full particulars of the journey and Batemans will know what to do and she will follow them.</p>
