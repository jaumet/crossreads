  
 neglected you, but when we become settled down again I will write as regular as possible, now when you know there isn't any danger it doesn't matter so much but when we start fighting again I will keep you & the Mater posted up. We are being organised again & receiving heavy drafts of reinforcements preparatory to a scrap in spring at least that is what we think they are fixing us up for. We have so many new faces now both in officers & men that one feels quite a stranger in his own regiment, after we have what is called the next "thinning out" Parade there wont be an old hand left. Well dear I will close now with fondest love from your loving brother Ken to self, R & B.
