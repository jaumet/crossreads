I omitted to mention change in Imbros. The ravages of the storm could be seen. The Egyptians gone etc
Friday 3rd DecI left list of goods to be got at Canteen with Eltham & we made a start for Panaghia about 10 oclock - Lieut Sparrow, Sergt Warner (N.Z. Artillery) Sapper Bates (6th Brigade) & myself. We decided to walk in place of riding Donkeys & I quite enjoyed the trip which proved very exhilerating indeed. Up over the hills - down rocky pathways & ravines. The sky was overcast & the clouds were low - quite enveloping the high peaks & as we passed through them we got quite damp. We passed some Greek hamlets. Built of rough stones but they looked comfortable. Here & there were spaces in the Valleys which were cultivated & the old time custom ploughing with Wooden Planks & oxen could be seen.
