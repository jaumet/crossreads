<p>whole thing.&nbsp; The sausages first burst into flames and then</p>
<p>exploded and fell to earth.&nbsp; Each would contain two expert</p>
<p>observers so their loss would be no small one to Fritz.&nbsp; That</p>
<p>night the Germans were evidently very angry for they threw</p>
<p>things at us for hours.&nbsp; We didn&#39;t mind his shells that night</p>
<p>though, we were so tickled about his bal<sub>^</sub><sup>l</sup>oons.&nbsp; The Boche</p>
<p>still shows a preference for Churches when he starts shelling.</p>
<p>Only this week he picked out two tall steepled edifices in</p>
<p>Armentiers - he didn&#39;t touch anything else, he just wanted to</p>
<p>try a new gun or something.&nbsp; Mind you a church steeple makes a</p>
<p>fine target and must have the same impelling fascination for an</p>
<p>artilleryman as a window in an empty house has for a small boy</p>
<p>with a stone in his hand.&nbsp; The man behind a gun seldom sees what</p>
<p>he is firing at and therefore does not get the satisfaction of</p>
<p>observing the damage he does.&nbsp; An opportunity to knock over</p>
<p>something visible like a church steeple must be very inviting</p>
<p>and after all there seem to be plenty of them to spare.&nbsp; Every</p>
<p>little village, every hamlet even, has an enormous church with an</p>
<p>equally big steeple.&nbsp; I won&#39;t go so far as to say that the</p>
<p>country is over churched but there are a great number of them</p>
<p>vacant.&nbsp; The rectors are at the war - not as chaplains but as</p>
<p>combatants - the male portion of the congregation is at the</p>
<p>war and the women folk are far too busy working to go to church.</p>
<p>The Germans do not often trouble Armentieres but when they do,</p>
<p>we have only to plunk a couple into Lille and they stop at once.</p>
<p>Lille and Armentieres are within about six miles of each other</p>
<p>and it is said (I give it for what it is worth) that British</p>
<p>Engineers tapped the Electric supply xxxx cable feeding Lille</p>
<p>and for four months lit Armentieres at the Huns&#39; expense.</p>
