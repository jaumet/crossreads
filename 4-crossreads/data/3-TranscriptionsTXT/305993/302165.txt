31.1.196 a.m.  Left Alexandria for Taranto Italy.  The transport fairly packed up & the troops highly satisfied that they are going to be demobilised & see their dear old homes again, some having been 4 years away.
Feb. 1stMod. gale & high sea, vessel labouring heavily hundreds of troops sea sick & making a fearful mess all over the ship. Stove in some glass port at B Troop Deck No. 1 hatch in which we have 600 soldiers.  The troop deck flooded forced to ease down & repair the damage to the sad discomfort of those that were allotted there.  This happened at 8 p.m. last night & we reduced speed to 1/2 speed for 11 hours until 7 a.m. this morning.  Still blowing hard & high sea & shipping heavy sprays, at 3 p.m. we passed the Island of Gavdo South of Create.  The wind & sea abating we put up more speed.  The condition of the men better having got over their sea sickness & had a concert during the evening in the 2nd class in which hundreds gathered & spent a very pleasant evening.
Feb. 1st 1919Fine weather, troops doing well & all happy.
Feb. 2 1919Off the Greek Islands & making for the Gulf of Taranto.  Heard this day of friction existing between Gen. Allanby [Allenby] & the Australian troops through an occurance that happened at a town in Palastine near Jersulumn.  It appears whilst the Australians were asleep at night some of the natives approached their tents & murdered some of them creeped in whilst asleep.  The Australians approach head quarters regards the deed.
