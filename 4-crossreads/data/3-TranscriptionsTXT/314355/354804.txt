 [Sketch with the title "Church Plan Borre".] May 19 The big gas shelling for tonight seemingly postponed again.  Now about 2 a.m., only one stretcher case through &ndash; a 3rd Batt. officer, with the tiniest of wounds in the thigh, carried in from the car.  Les put him on a stretcher, and the shell dressing removed, revealed a scratch and faint spotting of blood. 
 Two Tommy runners, down from Pradelles through Borre, wearing shorts.  Three R.S.B.'s going up to Strazeele:  one mouths an oath with &ndash; 
 "Got them bloody running pants on &ndash; only want them spiked shoes!" 
 Passing the M.G. Camp this morning, they doing physical jerks under an instructor, and the sun burning down, coming back they were ranged in parties about other instructors &ndash; they swinging loaded ropes in a circle, the chaps jumping over them as they swung under their feet. 
 Late yesterday afternoon a 1st Batt. chap through, Ted, asked him what they'd done down at Sercus. 
 "Oh drilled Christ out of us!" 
 The 1st Brigade were "resting" and the M.G.s are in reserve.
