<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>I am in receipt of advice to the effect that No. 4399 Private G.V. Rose, 30th Battalion, is returning to Australia per transport "Port Melbourne" which left England on 5th July, 1919 and will probably arrive in Melbourne about the 22 <strike>15th</strike> August, 1919.  Further information as to the exact date of arrival and time of disembarkation will be published in the press when available.<br/>It should be noted, however, that owing to possible mutilations in the cabled advice, and other causes, this notification may not be correct pending verification from the roll after the arrival of the troopship.<br/>Any further inquiries should be made to the Staff Officer Returned Soldiers, Military Head-quarters, Paddington N.S.W.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br/>J. McLean, Major,<br/>Officer in Charge, Base Records.</p>
