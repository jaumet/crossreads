We walked up the slope from the beach, and suddenly there broke upon one the realisation that all this time the guns had been thundering.  Suddenly an empty stretch of desiccated scrub rolled on before us: the homely chatter of the beach was forgotten: there  was nothing but a noise of guns and wind: and for the eye nothing but the black and white telegraph poles, the wires winking in the sun and the imperturbable larks rising and falling.
