<p>should, in the ordinary course of events have these sheets of typed matter before them in far away Australia. The subject is enticing to me, it may not be quite so much to you, and as there is not much more of the night left I must away. Therefore, once more, good night, good night, good night, deferring till the morrow further pleasure of conversing with you.</p>
<p>Good night: [A line of Xs and Os] Caggi<br/>Good night: [A line of Xs and Os] Joe<br/>Good night: [A line of Xs and Os] Kitty</p>
<p>3.9.15. 11 p.m.; My Tabbie dear: Your letter is dated 20 7.15. Glad that the photograph on the mantlepiece brings to you pleasure and that the old man has not become too aged to be worth not thinking about. He is satisfied to know that you are givn interest by his picture.<br/>The brown baronia has wafted its perfume from the room at 219 to this in which I am working the machine, my nostrils react to the particles that have come all the way around the world keeping up a bond between you and me. Ask Maria what she thinks of the power of the baronia to do so great a feat in travelling? Are her funny remarks and jolly stories still in the ascendant? I fear not, because she required to be in need of much to make her shine the most. Tell her that the other day I was talking with the man, a gentleman of colour who lights my lamps, he told me that he is not married, that he lives with his mother and several children, that he has to keep them, also that a man in Egypt cannot marrie on twenty piasters (four shillings in our money) per week, but that he can do so very well on thirty piasters per week. What think you all of that? And when he has above that income he is all right.<br/>I have not heard of Bruce since he left Heliopolis. The sox from Joe have not yet come to hand, they will soon be here.<br/>It is remarkable how little the average medical man cares for looking after his patients, Dr Darling is a good stand by for you. Some one told me tonight of the article on the Antirabic Institute in the Australasian Medical Gazette. I may see it some day.<br/>Glad that you like my account about the Dardanelles. I hope to have the opportunity to go there. At the begining of this week I wrote to General Ford asking that I might be sent across, but so far no answer has come, if it is not here tomorrow I shall write asking for a personal interview.<br/>Knives for the French soldiers. By jove this is becoming a savage war indeed. Yes I remember Dr; Butler at the congress at Auckland. Buddie did not remain long at Santa. In her last she told me that she had been sent on to Moss Vale. Such is life in a convent. Kitty had a long stay in the Maitland district. Hope that she enjoyed the time. She is such a mery body that she would make herself happy anywhere.</p>
