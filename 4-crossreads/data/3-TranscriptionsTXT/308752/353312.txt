 Sunday 9th January. Impressive Church service. I believe the Dardanelles are evacuated &amp; all the Australian troops which are withdrawn are camped about 16 miles from us, I may meet some of my friends. 
 Monday 10th Jan. Visited the engineers who have just arrived from Sydney. Met a number of my friends including a few of my pals from Neutral Bay, Jack Reid, from Oaks Avenue, Bob MacDonald from Grosvenor St. &amp; Jack Kernigan. The engineers brought a piano with them all the way from Australia, it is a real treat to hear some music again, the long evenings will be far more enjoyable now. 
 Tuesday 11th Jan. Monotony broken a little to day, had our first training in digging trenches &amp; dugouts, very good exercise as a matter of fact the officers do not really know hat to do with the men. 
 Wednesday 12th Jan to Monday 17th Jan. Same routine drill &amp; digging trenches etc.
