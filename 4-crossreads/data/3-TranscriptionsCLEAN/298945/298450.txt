  
 last night we sang "Abide with me" very impressively, & it affected me in the same way.

 I understand the stunt is to come off tomorrow morning. This afternoon B & C  the  bearers went up the line, & we have stacks of stretchers ready. This morning, Freddy Cocks & I made a large number of walking wounded notices, with the help of Bugler Easther who made the stencil. 
 I understand that tanks & the usual side shows are all ready, & from observation I can quite believe the rumour that 700 shells per minute will be the extent of the barrage. Fighting on the same scale will take place north & south of us, so I can see it developing into some big battle. 
 Last night the planes came over & did a bit of zonking, but they had to keep very high on account of the sad ending to one or two of their raids
