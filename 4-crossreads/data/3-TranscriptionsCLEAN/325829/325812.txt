Once the men got acclimatised this ceased, & we were not troubled with it again whilst in the valley, at the end of May the flies died owing to the intense heat. On May 11th we were attached to the Australian [Indecipherable] Division & for a time the rations were most unsatisfactory, & during this period our men were doing a lot of road making in a dirty, dusty camp, & in consequence septic sores increased suddenly. Fortunately rations improved & on May 22nd we went up to Ain Duk & took over a section of the front line & with water handy & a clean camp things greatly improved, we were very free from sickness here, Unfortunately as it turned out later our Hdqrs which were nearest the water suffered most, the transport next & then the C.B.A. Squadron in order, from the ravages of Malaria. We then moved back to Solomon's Pools, travelling by night in two stages & had a very wild trip & on arriving at Solomon's Pools Malaria began to develop, & from that time onwards we had a lot of it, & it always developed with any sudden change of weather. We then moved back to the valley & had a certain amount of Malaria.
