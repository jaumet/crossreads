Saw great numbers of orchards also the largest olive ranch in the world. Also saw two reservoirs and at one of them had dinner with the men, the food being very good. Arrived back at L.A. 3.15 pm then Sam and I went for stroll round the business streets and I went into the "Broadway Department Store? and bought stamps for the post cards.
