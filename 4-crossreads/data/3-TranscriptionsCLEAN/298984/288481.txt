abrest of its Wind (12-30)  Like most of our coast it is an uninteresting looking place. Anchored at 11 PM at Semiphore  Not much of a place to look at
Sunday 4thThe Port Dr came on & looked us over. The S.A then taken of in a decent tug. Apples were sent on board  Colliers were tied on each side & in the intervels between "Smokos" a little coal was put on board. Being Sunday I heard the men got 5/- per hour  Puled the anchor up at 10 PM & made another start. Played Poker until midnight won 1/11
