<p>for Gallipoli at 7 p.m.  20th Bn left behind on "Saturnia".</p>
<p>Saturday 21st Aug. 1915</p>
<p>General clean up &ndash; ship now in a far cleaner condition than when we boarded her.  The latrines are now fit for use &amp; the ship is habitable.</p>
<p>This morning I have counted over 100 ships at anchor in the Bay &ndash; Mudros Bay as it is called.  It is a circular bay of good proportions.  The shore line is mostly tenanted by the military &amp; seems as far as I can see from the ship to be under cultivation &ndash; fodder etc.  About &frac12; mile (?) inwards the land rises by a series of gradual declivities &amp; so the whole has the appearance of a huge basin.  The mouth of the bay is narrow &amp; is protected by booms &amp; nets.  The channel for entrance is narrow.  Hostile ships, underwater craft etc are absolutely debarred from entering.  The bay forms an excellent base.</p>
<p>Left Mudros Bay 5 pm for Gallipoli on S/S "Osmanieh".  Great send off through lines of British, French &amp; Russian battleships &amp; cruisers.  Noticed H.M.S. "Agamemnon".</p>
<p>Visibly impressed by speed of "Osmanieh" &ndash; travelling 18 knots easily.  Did 26&frac12; knots on trial speed.  Belonged to Khedivial Mail Co., passenger route Alexandria to Constantinople.  All lifeboats slung out &amp; life belts ready.  Boys in good heart, singing &amp; laughing in chorus.  The beginning of what we have longed for during months past is now at hand.  What will the end be.  Victory!  Yes.  Victory or nothing.</p>
<p>Arrived at <strike>Gaba Tepe</strike> Anzac (Gaba Tepe a few miles further south) at about 12 pm</p>
