  
 There is a 'buz' round - from the wireless station - that 3 British Cruisers have been sunk by German Submarines in the N.Sea  -  The Aboukir-Hopple Cressy Euryalus is one of them  -  We hear that they attacked Kiel harbor - doubtless by Order - also - that the Allied left wing of our armies have thrown the German right wing back  -  We'll hope its true  - 
 My personal equation isnt very much - a fine swim this morning & a few minor cares to attend to  -   Yesterday  ie Friday aftn  -  I was ashore - (Grantala medicoes have been  here 2 weeks & not  allowed ashore ) -  Haggard & I went together & explored the park & acclimatisation gardens  -  We got to a point marked Zum Ficus - wekk we'd been   there  to the Figs - that was to our right - We went Zum? Cedoela - to our left & explored - Cedoela odorata from S America are tall fine trees - of the pole type - reaching high up - 30 - 40 feet  -  I never - till now - felt what a fine thing it was to have a  common  scientific language in common with all the world  - My German failed me at once but here was Latin= clear & plain - The order too was on the porcelain plate - Meliaceae - so you instantly knew exactly where you were & what your plant was
