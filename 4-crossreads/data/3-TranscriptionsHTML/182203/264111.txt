<p>I'm not worrying because it may be quite alright &amp; if not I cannot do my work if I think too much of myself. Fortunately we have lots of interesting things to do &ndash; changes &amp; serious work. I'm feeling very well &amp; surprised at myself for being so cheerful &ndash; I'm not thinking of my own troubles, they are very small compared with the poor brave soldiers trials. Oh, we are seeing some awful cases. If this war continues much longer, there will only be men with limbs missing left. Hope to hear from Fred soon. Have not heard of George or Norman. We cannot find out anything about our friends. No records office here &amp; the regiments are always on the move. <br/>It is very wet &amp; muddy but not nearly so cold as last week. Live in our macintoshes    &amp; gum-boots. Am making very little progress in my French. Shall try to send the book for Eddy in a few days. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. From                                                    Yours lovingly.
