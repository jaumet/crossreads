<p>air ship, "Silver Queen" flying along the coast. Her rate of speed is between 30 and 40 miles an hour. This is the first time I have seen her. She is employed looking for submarines, she has already sighted two but her bombs are a failure, they burst as soon as they toutch the water. The Turks are using a lot of ammunition this last day or two. This morning they are throwing them about. The French got busy and let fly some 9.2 shells at 10 A.M. I was watching them burst. An awful explosion smoke and dirt hurled into the air a hundred feet high. The Sgt Major of the R.N.D. R.E. Head Quarters is making a wooden cross and erecting it over the grave of Corp Aubrey of our Head Quarters. We had no time to do it, as the Battery was going to Anzac<br/>11/10/1915<br/>German aeroplane over 8.30 A.M. flying very low, our guns opened fire on him. Very hard target. Three of our men that were wounded, arrived here last night at 9.30 left again for Anzac at 10 A.M. Today is dull with indications of more rain. Still no signs of our leaving the peninsula.</p>
