getting home as I have to spend at least two days in Sydney to have a Turkish Bath & get any clothes etc.  However Kismet.  Still it is annoying I should have liked to be home for Xmas.  This is a terribly dull boat.  Nothing to do, nothing to read, and I believe that they will fete us in Melbourne & Sydney which means more time lost.
14.12.18I personally have now given up all hope of spending Xmas on land.  We have only just reached Freemantle [Fremantle] today owing to a heavy head wind & sea most of the way from Colombo.  Also we have to undergo short quarantine of two or three days & call at Albany to put off the Westralians
