Saturday 29th JuneWas put on as Hut Orderly. Have missed the Signaling School as the others went to it whilst I was in Hospital. It would have been interesting Walked to Sutton Veny & found a lot of my old mates out of the 11th Reinforcement still there. Drew  2 from Savings Bank Got my Photos they were rotten
Sunday 30Went to Sutton V again
Monday 1st JulyStill on as Hut Guard
Tuesday 2ndBeing Hut Orderly or Guard I do not go on Parade. Sweep & clean the Hut up & see that every thing is put away correctly - Nearly every camp has a slightly different idea as to how blankets should be folded & other things arranged There is usually a 'Blueprint' illustrating the correct method on the notice Board One makes it look all right on the outside & shows all odds & ends under
