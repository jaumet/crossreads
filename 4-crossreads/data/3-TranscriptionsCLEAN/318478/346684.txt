  
 En route to Lemnos Feb. 2nd 1919 
 Dear Mick 
 The wicked sea we suffered on our voyage from Taranto to Malta evidently gave "The Mission" its sea legs for the voyage from Malta to Crete was a joy ride. 
 The Island Crete is really wonderful, better than Teneriffe, steep foot-hills rise bang up from the sea & are surmounted by higher contours until ones eyes wander up amongst snow clad mountains with here & there the outline lost in clouds.  A perfect place for a painting tour.  Unfortunately we dropped the hook in the evening and were under way next morning  1st  (this morning) at 11  10  o'clock.  No time to sketch even had I felt that way - really I was content to look on as my idea is to save myself for Gallipoli, also a touch of malaria produced a not uncomfortable feeling of lassitude. 
 The 'Princess Ena' is making quite good weather of it & the Skipper & first Engineer keep a fatherly eye on me & would if encouraged
