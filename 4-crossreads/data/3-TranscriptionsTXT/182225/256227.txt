1916   SUNDAY 12   MARCH
Fine. Had lunch early and Mrs Lloyd, Jo, Linda & Self got a car and went out to Cronulla for day. Had afternoon tea at the Hotel & drove up to the Entrance to Port Hacking  My word things have changed wonderfully down there lately. Its quite a town where a few years ago was only scrub. Saw Jessie for a few minutes. Got back in time for late tea, and got back to camp at night.
