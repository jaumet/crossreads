 Monday, 8 January 1917 
 Real Riverina winter's day. 
 Bombed during day &ndash; 22 Killed, 15 wounded out of Egyptian Labor Corps &amp; a few horses &ndash; 2 L.H. At 9 o'clock last night 4 TAUBES came over in the moonlight &amp; dropped 40 odd bombs &amp; played their machine guns on us. I don't know results yet but they rattled about our Bivouacs &amp;  yet we are told we have the supreme say in the air.   Uncanny at night one Officer called out LIE down &amp; inadvertently dropped into a Bucket of Water. 
 Going out tonight on our postponed Stunt, should be a good scrap. 
 A Bedouin Dog stole our Bacon, that is worse or as bad as a Taube.  Bivouaced at Sheik Zowabin.
