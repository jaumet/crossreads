13th July:- ThursdayOut at 6.30 am & as the prickly heat rash is very irritating I see the doctor in hope of getting something to ease it, but he puts me into a dirty room called a hospital & says I must stay here for a few days. My luck, as usual  & Tommy doctor's brains   However, as there is not even a bed in this dungeon, I politely take myself off &  go around the ship at leisure. Rather rough to-day & the sea is very choppy. We have a new Sergeant's mess, which is much better   No submarines or mines so far. Nearly collided with a tramp steamer about 11 pm. Sleep in my usual bunk.
