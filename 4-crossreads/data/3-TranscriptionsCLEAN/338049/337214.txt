  
 Friday 4 Jan. Morning stables as usual. On parade detailed to run line with Lieut Stanbury. Left about 10. Ran out of poles so dropped drum & went to [Menis?] Divn. Had dinner at Sergts Mess. 
 Collected mail & rations & then returned home about 5 p.m. Finished up with 23 letters which I could not read in one night.
