 I confess that that little relaxation made me tire and as soon as I am off duty make a "beeline for bed, but ne'er a wink of sleep for Fritz's big guns soon get busy and the shells come screaming over us each one seeming to get nearer and nearer until at 1.30a.m.  we listen intently and hear the order given to Matron that we must all get up and go down to the dugout and be prepared to walk for five miles to Bus and possibly we might have to evacuate the Hospital.
