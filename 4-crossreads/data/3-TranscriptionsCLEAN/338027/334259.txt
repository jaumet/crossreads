  
 Thursday, 22 October, 1914 After stables I felt pretty badly so reported sick and was exempted from duty. 
 I spent the day lying in the sun & late in the afternoon went below & fell asleep. 
 The doctor came down & on taking my temp, which was over 100, ordered me into the hospital. 
 I was the first to go into the hos. so christened it.  I received every attention there and the bunks were much appreciated after the hammocks. 
 Commenced to rain. 
 Friday, 23 October, 1914 I awoke feeling better & spent the day writing to my mother & Edith. 
 The Col & Dr came down to see me, I think they dreaded I was a measel contact. 
 I read a few magazines until I fell asleep & the Dr awoke me, and on enquiry as to health told me I could get up next day. 
 Rained all day & previous night.
