<p>end and will wire you if I succeed in procuring it. I could only secure a day at home but if necessary could take more.<br/>Myself, Clarke &amp; Ellis are the only experienced men here out of a staff of fifteen and that is one of the reasons why I am kept so busy. One certainly gains a fine experience in these country centres as one has every  kind of case to deal with and not merely one particular section as in a larger Hospital.<br/>A Major has been sent up to take charge here now and I have been  acting as his clerk during the past week but I have had enough of it already and am arranging to get back on to the Ward work next week. As Clarke had been in the A.M.C. longer than I had he has been made acting Corporal but the pair of us run the hospital between us, as I can choose whichever work I prefer.</p>
<p>I can't think of any more news now so I will say au revoir till Sunday next I hope.<br/>Eugene.</p>
