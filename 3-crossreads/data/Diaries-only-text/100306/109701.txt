10/2/17 Firing Line Le Sars
Chief excitement during the day was doing the Disposition Report. Four men wounded in front line. One of our sergeants has been missing for a few days was discovered blown to pieces. Out in No Mans Land is an old German hospital dugout full of dressings etc etc. Word arrived of raids by 1st Div. on Maze and our action. The bombardment opened up at 8 pm and was fast and furious. We had 6 wounded in the retaliation which followed. Our patrol was out in No Mans Land at the time and had an anxious few minutes. Went up to Bunnings dugout getting some m.g. bullets round the ears. Massie had wonderful escape today. Talking to 4 men when a shrapnel burst overhead and killed them all on the spot. His coat sleeve was torn, pipe chipped, respirator ruined and helmet punctured but he had no hurt. Digging the grave is hard work and Padre is to come up before dawn.
