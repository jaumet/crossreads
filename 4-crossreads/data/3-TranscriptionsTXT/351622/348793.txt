 9 March 1916 Thur Called to see Jim Fay last night &amp; also Jack Kater. Reinforcements arrive. Dug a new cess pit the best part of the day. During the march yesterday we halted &amp; rested at the A.S.C. where I weighed myself to the surprise of putting on a stone &amp; a half since I joined the army. 
 10 March 1916 Fri Practising getting kit's ready all the morning. Aeroplanes here are very common. You see them overhead all day. Spent the afternoon on the water-waggon so never had a thirst up. Met Lieut McK. Paid again this afternoon so the old water proof sheet candle &amp; pack of cards will be in full swing to night.
