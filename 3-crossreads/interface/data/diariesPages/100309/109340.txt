16/5/17 Mametz
On Courts Martial all day and acquitted one man who was being wronged by a little group of unscrupulous young perjurors. Other cases mostly that A.W.L which seems to be getting more prevalent as time goes on. About 4 Divisions of Cavalry moved up commencing early in the morning and we now hear that the Germans are in retirement again and, I suppose, doing their wretched destruction as they go back. Orders out for our move to Bouzaincourt tomorrow and a furphey that the Corps is being relieved. Had a yarn with Colonel Forbes about recent operations. Colonel W.R. Watson C.B. H.D. is a good sort and comic in his remarks about things in general. A dull day with some rain in the afternoon and and a foggy haze on the scene. At mess we drank to "the King" and on the tables we had white violets and blue with other flowers culled from stricken woods. A meeting of the big Sports Committee tonight.
