<p>But if the artillery get a bad time, how much worse the infantry get in any attack is easily imagined.</p>
<p>The artillery suffer when they have to man the guns, at the same time as the Germans are doing counter battery work:  then the gun and all its crew often get lost.</p>
<p>But the infantry are simply wonderful, and I take off my hat to them:  I have seen a lot of good divisions as we live <strike>am</strike> with their forward companies when doing forward observation:  fighting continues all over Europe at the same terrific pace, but will calm down soon owing to the weather.</p>
<p>I have not answered your letter really in this one, but will do so in my next:  we are amusing ourselves in rest with Divisional manoeuvres in the wet.</p>
<p>Goodbye for today &ndash; best luck to all at Toganmain.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>John Chute Ellis</p>
