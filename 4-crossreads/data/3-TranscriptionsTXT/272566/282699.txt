 Wednesday 7 November 
 Fine &amp; Sunny but the roads are dangerous. Trip to A.D.M.S. Office at Scottish Lines Busseboom &amp; 15th Field Ambulance. To 5th D.S.C. Workshops for another saddle spring. Booked seats in Poperinghe for some of the boys &ndash; at the "Duds" Show.  This reminds one of a 1st Class performance in London.  Everything was perfect last night when we were there, and the Hall was packed Met Norman Broadbent Cards and writing after tea.
