<p>for our eyes running for half an hour we were O.K.</p>
<p>On arrival back at the trench we built a fire &amp; made a petrol tin full of Bully Stew but it came out blood Red, owing to some Idiot peeling the beetroots &amp; putting them in. Anyway we were too hungry for a hot feed to let little things like that worry us so we just "hopped in" and there wasnt much of that stew left to tell the tale.</p>
<p>Next Day we decided to have a shave, not having had one since leaving Bussy, and I was just going to get outside the trench to get some water from a shell hole, when a shell landed about 15 yds away killing 2 Artillery signallers who were going over to their battery. We hopped out &amp; ran over but they were both gone beyond help.</p>
<p>Somehow I forgot all about the shave and decided to leave it till after the Stunt and we were out of the line again.</p>
