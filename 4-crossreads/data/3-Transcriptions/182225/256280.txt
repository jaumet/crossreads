<p>1916 &nbsp; SATURDAY 10 &nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>Another rotten cold bleak day. We are still lying out in Table Bay. The Colonel went ashore and tried to arrange for boats to get us ashore tomorrow but could not get them, however he says he will try to get them for Monday. Lieut General Thomson came aboard and inspected us or rather the boat in the morning. The &quot;Benalla&quot; (an Australian transport) with Carmichaels Miners on board came in in morning &amp; they had a rout march through the town. They left Sydney 11 days before we did &amp; went to Colombo first. The 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery went on duty at 6 pm. I was on guard. We worked the guard 4 hours on &amp; 8 off and its much better than the old way of 2 on &amp; 4 off.</p>
