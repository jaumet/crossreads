<p>1918<br/>Oct 28<br/>them I was her cousin from Australia. her girl friend that I had met was around the corner, working in trousers. The rough castings of the shells were turned in lathes and picked up by an overhead crane and tested in water for flaws by a man who worked a compressed air device. Then the driving band was forced on. The explosive was put in, in some other factory. In the afternoon we inspected another munition factory where 4.5" shells were being made. our guide was the Boss' daughter, and we were not allowed to talk to the girls. I was let try my hand at putting a driving band and after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, got it on. We were given afternoon tea afterwards. After tea I took my munition girl &ndash; Annie Turk to a music hall and saw her home afterwards to Govan.<br/>29 Oct.<br/>Next day 29th October, a party of us went to Yarrow shipbuilding yards. All these parties started from The Victoria league Club in Buchanan</p>
