 20 April 1916 Thur As soon as we had breakfasted Ken Marsh & myself left for a trip to Bailleul. A fine town. Inspected the church & saw the door which the Germans prized open to gain admittance to the steeple. Went also to Meteren & Strazelle doing altogether about 20 miles. Saw old trenches. 
 21 April 1916 Good Fri There were no hot cross-buns on the doorstep this morning. A very quiet day slept nearly all day. A very busy night kept going all the time. One poor cove was brought in with a temperature of 105 & after getting to work for an hour I brought it down to 101. The search lights are watching for aircraft.
