<p>are Dad's friends, the model "Zanderboys"?  Suppose they still come to the mugs' tennis on Sunday afternoons.</p>
<p>Mum tells me that you are a little brick in trying to cheer her up.  Keep it up, Mick, for my sake, and it will not be long before I return to Sydney.  Any news of interest you can read in Mum's letter.</p>
<p>Ever your loving brother,<br/>Eric.</p>
<p>Hope you will be able to send me a Torchbearer occasionally.  Up to this, I have not received any, although you have given me to understand that you have sent some.</p>
