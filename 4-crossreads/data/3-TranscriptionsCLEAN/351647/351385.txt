life isn't a joy at all.
I saw Dr. Lethbridge the other day, he doesn't look too well & I don't wonder as lately he's been having a particularly tough time.  The conditions of things are so rotten too.
Today it started with snow then rained & now things are so sloppy again.  Last night everything was quite hard & nice but all the same I nearly howled with the cold.
Last week early our Adjutant went to Paris for a little trip.  His place was taken for the time by a Mr. Lynnot, a very nice little thing but such a fuss pot & a ditherer, bleats a bit too & lots of times I could knock his silly 'ed orf.  But still he's rather a decent little sort & means well.
Playfair is back but has not taken on his job yet.
