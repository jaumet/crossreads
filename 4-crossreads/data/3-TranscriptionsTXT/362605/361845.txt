 Dear Dad, Mum George, 
 This is about the 50th time that I've sat down to write to you &amp; although it is very late I will write a few lines before I go to bed.  I have been very ill with a cold &amp; catarrh mostly the latter &amp; it took me just a fortnight to get well.  I have about one attack a year over here which is very good considering the awful climate.  I've only had 3 attacks since I arrived in England.  We have been very busy too which made it worse &amp; Ellis away of course.  We cannot get enough accomodation &amp; we have 2 Auxiliaries to this place making over 3000 men in all. 
 I expect to go on leave on Monday next for 14 days &amp; of course I'll go to the Island again.
