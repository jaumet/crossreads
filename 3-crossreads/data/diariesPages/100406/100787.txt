was, as usual, terribly fast. I learned three new Dances. The French Quadrilles (all Chasseing, Chain Changing Partners) the "Pas de Paliniers", something like La Rinka, 2R. 2L. 4 alternate R L,  Circle + Ditto - Waltz. The "Varsovienne or Redowa" this one is a regular Brute, 3 side steps R,  circle, 3 side steps L,  circle again Mazurka Time. This was a rather Select Dance, but all the same the Ladies used to breast the Bar for a Beer when they wanted it were not above using the same Latrine as the Men. Open Latrines are the order of the Day here. Isolated ones being placed alongside Doors of private Houses. A few of the Ladies were told to retire. We found out later that they had associated with the Germans when the latter held this territory. All people who had any dealings with the Germans are black listed here.

I'm always speaking of the coarseness of the country people in France. Another instance, (a) Drewel a young French was suffering from Syphilis when asked what ailed her her invariable reply was "Malade of the ?".
A number of 1915 men are leaving here now, nearly all 5th Division.

Went to Belgium today instead of work. While on the way a Tommy Officer asked me if I could do anything for a Belgian who had just been blown up by a "Dud". I had a look at him, but it was impossible to do anything. Fragments of shell fully 3 inches
