To think that I stopped away because I was getting short of money as if that made any difference to her, she reckoned I put her on a pretty low level to think that I thought she was after me for my money or what she could get out of me.  She told me off properly &amp; made me promise never to do such a thing again.  I felt very small &amp; vowed to myself that this would be my first &amp; last experience of such things, at any rate we parted</p>
