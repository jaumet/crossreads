<p>The 8th were to move off at midday to open up a new A.D.S. but the order was cancelled &amp; they remained with us. Very busy during the day, especially with walking wounded, the 14th Brigade having bumped a snag. Rumours of us being relieved very strong tonight.</p>
<p>Tuesday 3rd Sept.<br/>Very quiet day. The 8th still standing by &amp; waiting for a further advance before moving forward. Sent up supplies of dressings to the A.D.S. Felt very off colour with one of my severe headaches. Fritz over during the night bombing but nothing was dropped close.</p>
<p>Wednesday 4th Sept.<br/>Still quiet &amp; very little doing. A few gas cases during the night &amp; the car which brought them seemed to bring a lot of gas with it as several of the fellows were sneezing a lot. It was what we call sneezing gas, it being designed to make the wearing of the mask impossible &amp; so allowing a deadly gas to get to work. Practically no cases through. News by paper good, we having penetrated the Switch line, Drocourt-Qu&eacute;ant with 10000 prisoners.</p>
