<p>Saturday 5 August 1916<br/>Summer again. Trotting round to battalions in the morning &amp; afternoon, going also to Division where I looked up Leo &amp; had a nice cup of tea in the kitchen with him. He was well. Coming home I had the good fortune to meet Rid who was being towed behind a motor lorry on a bike in a cloud of dust. In the evening put on a spurt with letters because the mail was to close in the morning.</p>
