The real Egyptian, I now think, is about the finest of all the Arab races, but it takes you some time to find out what the pure article is, and unless you look in other classes than 'merchants' I'm afraid you'll find very little of it indeed. One can get a good object lesson on this by going into any shop of these self same merchants. Costly silks and cloths covered with Egyptian designs hang round the walls and, on the shelves, are gold or silver ornaments inlaid with scarabs and hyroglyphics, and wonderfully carved ivory elephants, crocodiles or pyramids, all looking most truly Egyptian in work and design. Yet if you look more closely into them, you find "Made in Japan" or some other country carefully camouflaged on all the articles, so that it can be clearly seen; but not noticeable unless carefully serched for.
