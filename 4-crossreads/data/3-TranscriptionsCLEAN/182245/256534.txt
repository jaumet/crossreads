JANUARY 1917
19 FRIDAY
Fine with  cold wind blowing. We
packed up & left our billets at
Strazeele about 10 AM & came
up to our positions at Armentieres
The waggonslines are about four
miles behind the lines. Jesus Farm. We have
good covered stables with flaged
floor so we have no mud. We
have small huts to sleep in, & are
very comfortable though crowed.
I was lucky & got a bunk to sleep
in. I came up driving lead of
a G.S waggon, & was lucky to
get it as I came straight to
the waggon lines, while the
others went up to the pits & did
not get back till all hours
of the night. I was on picket
at night. Well I have got to
[??w] at last after a year &
14 days in the army.
