<p>Endeavoured to get leave ashore but had no luck in that respect.</p>
<p>Jan 15th Frid.</p>
<p>Got up early in order to go to Cairo but not having entered my name over night no pass was available.  Only a select few get to know of these things, I notice.  Cliques which to my mind are disgusting.</p>
<p>However, later in the day I got a pass to go to Alexandria and had a glorious time.</p>
<p>I did not go to the native quarters this time but found my way to the European part and considered Alex - to be a fine city.</p>
<p>We were taken to various places of interest by young men who were students.  We spent a very pleasant hour or two walking through the museum.  Ancient Egyptian statues, jewelley, minimum 2000 year old etc. were to be seen here.</p>
<p>We strolled through a beautiful garden in which were the ruins of an ancient castle said to have been built in 108 A.D.</p>
<p>We had not the annoyance of streetsellers pestering the life out of us to buy, in this city.  A fine square is to be found in the centre of the city.</p>
<p>The sail over to the "Kyarra" and vice versa in the small boats was not altogether a pleasure owing to the eratic movements of the boatmen.</p>
<p>The U.S.A. warship "Tennecale" was in the harbour near by us.  The streets of Alex &ndash; were very busy</p>
