Just a note to say the air cushion & the Havelock tobacco have just arrived & I'm very very grateful.  They both fill a long felt want.  The pillow is most swanky & in our colours too.  I shall be able to flaunt it.
Judy Morrice & Duncan Macfarlane came today, they are Lieutenants in the R.F.A. [Royal Field Artillery] but I don't think are altogether enraptured with it.  Our fellows & Tommies don't mingle somehow, they don't understand one another.  Their minds are totally different. We have far more in common with the Scotchies somehow.
Got quite homesick today, it was a nice spring day, warm & bright & a heavenly south wind & in the distance a band would persist in playing "Rag Time Violin", "That Mysterious Rag", "Rendezvous" & "In the Shadows".  I was up in the wood above & came upon a Australian Infantry man & we talked of the dear old land.  He was a rough diamond but a good sort
