 France 21.9.18 
 Dear George 
 I received your very welcome letter dated the 10/7/18 &amp; very pleased to hear that you are both keeping so well. 
 I believe Auntie is very bad sorry to hear it &amp; I expect to hear the worst any day now. 
 Glad to hear that you still get your motor trips I have had plenty of late following the troops with rations only we have those big lorries. things are going some now &amp; Fritz is getting well paid back the americans are making quite difference &amp; they are great boys Something like our own boys and not afraid of Fritz our boys have got Fritz bluffed. 
 All the Originals are going home this week 16 are going from our company tomorrow &amp; by the time you get this letter they ought to all be home in Australia We expect to be going out for a long spell it is about time &amp; I can tell you they get the most out of the Aussies &amp; they are not getting a fair deal. 
 The slips of paper you sent struck me very funny I would like to have seen the finish
