25/9/15 Memo. Rum issue wants careful watching ? great stuff to leak if not supervised. Remarkable how well all our shirkers and wasters have turned out over here. They are playing the game and settling down to real hard work splendidly. Being away from drink other temptations has a lot to do with it I am sure. The trouble is to get them here. The wasters who are big strong men and just have outbursts of animalism are alright ? the weak vaccilator who is a slave to a vice and has no "guts" drops out by death or disease long before he gets as far as this. At 1630 went up to "conning tower" ? the highest point of the firing line where a little sandbagged stronghold is being built by engineers for our use for control of operations. Suggested arrangement of fixed small mirrors on different faces of the work but with the reflecting mirrors grouped side by side in front of box so that the whole panorama would be before the eye of anyone while sitting at the ?phone. The only objection is that one .75 shell would blow all the sandbags they like to put there away and wreck the whole show while it would be constantly suffering in the daily bombardment. At 1635 the siege battery started and put lovely timed 6 inch shells into Abdul's Lone Pine defence sending geysers of earth 50 feet into the air and leaving huge craters
