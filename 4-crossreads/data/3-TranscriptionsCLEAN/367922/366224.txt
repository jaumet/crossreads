 Dear Mr. Fry, It was with feelings of the deepest regret, that I read in the paper this morning of the death in action of your eldest son, Dene. 
 It seems just a few weeks ago that Dene came to wish me "Good-bye" at the School, & little did I dream that it would be a "last good-bye". 
 I always had a warm affection for both your lads Dene & Allan. They were so manly straightforward & natural. Both have died as they lived - noble boys, "Heroes both". 
 Accept my heartfelt sympathy for you, Mrs. Fry & the family in your very sad & double bereavement. 
 May God in his mercy give you both strength & courage to bear up against the sad blows you have received of late. 
 "Two noble lives - nobly ended". for God, King & Country. 
 Faithfully yours & in deepest sympathy, James Gilbert
