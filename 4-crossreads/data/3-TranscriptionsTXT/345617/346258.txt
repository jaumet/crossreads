Decembre 2Resting today on account of having bad feet. Have just heard that I have been awarded a Bar to my Military Medal. Section engaged on strong points and Corps line defence work. Weather getting much colder & we had a little snow this morning.
Decembre 3Most of the Section are putting out wire on Corps & Support lines & other defence work. I am still taking things easy just looking after a little H.Q. work. We are reported to have had a set-back near Cambrai.
