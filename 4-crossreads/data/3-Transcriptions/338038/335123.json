<p>IV<br/>now steadied down into the old hum-drum, and so it will go on I suppose till one or other side makes a fresh move.<br/>Weather still fairly hot here and flies fairly troublesome, but we should soon be getting a cool change.<br/>I dare say this cooked up sort of existence will tell on a man in time, but personally I feel as right as a trivet and fit to stick it for many more months if necessary. There is a rumour afloat about us being taken out for a spell for a while, but while that would of course be most enjoyable, I think most of us would as soon see the thing through here and have a good spell afterwards, as the general impression is that the end is not far off.<br/>I heard last night that Eric Lenehan has been suffering<br/>IV</p>
