  
 Continued     (4) How I won the V.C. 
 Just a bayonet stab through the gizzard & a crack from a bullet ot two. But I nerved my strength for the conflict & just as the darkness came down I was under their parapet resting & knew I had beaten them brown. For this was the scheme I had worked on Twas a little bit mean you will say But I knew that the turks were half famished & fought on a biscuit a day. & the tins of Fray Bento's I carried I chucked in the trench then & there. as I heard the poor beggars pounce on it I knew they were caught in the snare. Next morning broke calm & peaceful What a shame that we soldiers must fight Twas a pitious scene met my vision with the first rosy quivers of light When I peeped in the trench not a turk sir was left of that legion accurst For they'd whacked the Fray Bento's between them 
 & each man had perished from thirst. 
 Thats my tale & if you know our mob sir You'll know how our Colonel can smile He said to me Pte Juggin's You've dished up the beggars in style Promotion! some say I deserve it. But thats really nothing to me. I don't want honour or glory but thats how I win the V.C.
