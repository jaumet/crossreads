Wednesday drill etc Thursday Most of time doing clerical work acted the policeman again my prisoner once more being discharged. Through having an enemy on picquet was reported for being late & giving impertinence but will live through it. My turn will come. Friday: & days following general routine work on Thursday started to prepare Nominal rolls Pay Books and attestation Sheets for men departing. Friday Our 1st  2 men sailed in the Valdarha Saturday morning we led horses & loaded them on the boat & it proved a pretty picnic. My four were rather a trouble & the exertion expended during the morning was sufficient for a week  most of us were saturated with perspiration We arrived back at Camp 11.45 AM having had no breakfast. However on the way home about 12 of us trooped into an hotel & counter lunch had just been brought on. We scoffed the lot much to owners annoyance. Happened to meet Guy Parker on wharf now a Lieutenant. 4 of our men sailed on this boat. My turn comes next. In the afternoon whilst playing cricket was hit on the leg with cricket ball. Caused awful pain & could not walk after it.
