  
 Sed Miles, Sed Pro Patria 
 S.M. Herald, 5 July 
 Captain Arthur Gardere Ferguson. Killed in action June, 1916. 
 God's gift to youth, fair happiness, And Fortune's gift, a life of ease, He flung aside for battle stress, For toil, for peril overseas. Hearing above the drums the Voice That leaves the valiant heart no choice. 
 Oh, not of laurel wreaths at all That clarion Voice spoke, high and clear, Not even the patriot's stirring call To arms rang loudest in his ear, But just that one plain call to man That has been since the world began. 
 The call to man to be a man, To play the part a man should play; Nor heed the risk, nor pause to plan, Nor seek for less austere a way. But just with soul and muscle knit To do the work that's definite. 
 The bloody mystery of war He served, God's faithful artisan, And slept, his day of service o'er - (Salute!) a gallant gentleman. And marvels that those living yet Mourn with such passion of regret.
