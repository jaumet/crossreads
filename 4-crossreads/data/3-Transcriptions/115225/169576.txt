<p>we went to Picquigny to the canteen. We went for our French lesson in the evening &amp; I took a letter I had written in french (to Suzanne, who with her family had&nbsp;evacuated La Cr&ecirc;che when Fritz came through up North &amp; they now live south of Paris) for Zita to correct for me . I was so confidant that it was pretty well correct that I told Jno I&#39;d give him a franc for every mistake that I had made &amp; I may say that the same letter cost me twenty francs</p>

We took Zita &amp; Marie to a concert in the evening. given by some Tommy cavalry (6<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;or 7<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;Brigade) whho were camped in the neighbourhood.
