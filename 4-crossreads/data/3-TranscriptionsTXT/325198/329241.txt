 12 February, 1916 Maadi The usual cleaning up parade this morning &amp; half holiday this after noon. To night I am on in charge for the stable pickquet.  The boys in the mess room where I am writing are gambling for all they are worth &amp; they make a deuce of a noise over it too.  Bill Ross is suffering from a swelled face &amp; it looks like mumps but the other morning when our troop leader Mr McKenzie asked him what was the matter, Bill told him the face ache &ndash; This afternoon quite a number of boys went out to the races &ndash; I think the Colonel was running a horse &amp; they wanted to get on to it. To night for tea we did well as so many were away &amp; Cookey our mess orderley  put on Blanc Mange &amp; preserved peaches &ndash; Yesterday the boys had to draw to see who was to leave the troop as we were one over strength &amp; C Troop wanted a man, the "lot" fell to Rogers, one of the reinforcements &ndash; The weather seems to be getting warmer now, to night it is bright &amp; clear &amp; not too cold.
