<p>28/5/16  Sunday</p>
<p>Went to first Mass at 5.30 am.   29th 30th &amp; 31st marched out at 3.30 am for Moaske. Three Battallions of Tommys moved in about 10 am, our fellows gave them a bit of borax, such as &ndash; Have you got a Woodbine chum &ndash; Have you got a Piastre on you Chum. Had two good swims. Sent my camera although a bit knocked about, over to Frank, somebody must have pinched all my films, only had two films to send away. It looks as tho we will not move out till the 15th Battalion are ready.</p>
