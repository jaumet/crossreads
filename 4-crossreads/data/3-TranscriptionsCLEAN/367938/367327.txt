  
 at Saltwood. I shld. like to bathe tonight if I can - as have not washed or changed boots for nearly a week & the walk will be a saviour - - - - - 
 Have'nt heard of Geof yet. Don't think they'll go to France while we cant move. 
 We have lots of Regt. funds & now's the time its needed to keep off sickness - about 450  but cannot lay my hands on a penny of it . 
 I wd. like to have been with Phil at the march past of the troops going away from Sydney. They are arriving in Alex. now. 
 The papers you sent have been good reading - the accts of our splendid position here are however most misleading: now fully understand "still slowly advancing" & "otherwise calm". Cannot say too much except that they hold higher hills than we do & shell our swimming beach & trawlers, & that this unit holds the same ground as the day we arrived here & went straight in to it, except that the snipers who used to crawl along the valley underneath us, are now exchanged for our snipers. 
 Sgt. Barry of Syd. Sqdn had a periscope glass cut on his head yesterday - otherwise the lot are still
