<p>sheets ready to move up. Had some breakfast very late, got in with the last batch without any rush. A nice drink of tea (with plenty of sugar) went well! Had a wash, cleaned my teeth &amp; had a shave &amp; felt much livened up. Watched an aeroplane rise up from the aviation ground nearby, &amp; fly around &ndash; my word, he was a beauty, turned head over heels, corkscrewed round, fired his machine gun, &amp; flew low over our tents home. Had a good dinner at the sergeants mess, just pinned up the stripe I took down in England, &amp; went in with the other 4 chaps, it was nicer having your tucker brought to you on a plate, than being pushed &amp; squeezed to get in early in the crush. Wrote short letters to mother &amp; Elsie today, but they will be censored &amp; I can&#39;t say where I am. The others went in to Calais after tea, but I didn&#39;t fancy the 5 mile walk back to the Overflow Camp so didn&#39;t go in, saw the town last evening. I went up to the Y.M.C.A. in camp, talk about a crowd! There</p>
