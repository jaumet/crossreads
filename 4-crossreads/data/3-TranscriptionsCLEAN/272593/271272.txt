Capt Mckenzie came back from England this morning & we were all very pleased to see him, I hope he takes over the Company, though I can't complain about Mr Edgely he has treated me alright, but Capt McKenzie is a rare sport & is very popular with the Battalion.Had a short lecture this afternoon on danger of frost bite for the temperature at present is very low something like 10  below zero & if you don't keep moving something is likely to happen.Took over Battalion Orderly Sergeant for B. Coy tonight  they are short of Sergts.Made out a complete nominal roll of my platoon today this involves a fair amount of writing
