<p>Sniping has got very bad here now, both from machine gun &amp; rifle. Had one experience with <strike> the </strike> a sniper, on going forward to the cutting, about 8 Am. there is a piece of road about 100 yds to get along, This sniper snipes at the last fifty yds. The cpl. the day before was sniped, in this place, so I was expecting it this morning, but never the less I got a shock when I heard the ping of a bullet going past [me?], I ducked, looked for a place to hide for a while, then decided to run, got a few yds only when a nother came which only made me run the faster. I was thank full when I reached the sapp. Was not in much danger, for the bullets <strike>when</strike> went high, but I think that this is the first time that I have been deliberately snipped [indecipherable]. Comming back that evening with two friends we were in the sap, our heads must have shown over the top, for we had a machine gun turned on to us. We are back now in the house where we had such an exciting time the last time, in changing over then, just as the Co [indecipherable] &amp; intelligence officer left the building, a shell landed a few yds away from them, killed the I.O.</p>
