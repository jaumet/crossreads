<p>October 1916<br/>27th   I have been riding around in one of the pontoon wagons all day.  We went to Miminetz Wood R.C. yard &amp; took a lot of material out to Longueval  "dump."  Although it has been raining <strike>contin</strike>  continuously, we have been bombarding Fritz very heavily all day, but very few of his shells have come over our way.<br/>28th   I had an easy morning &amp; this afternoon I rode in to Fricourt to the Post Office &amp; Headquarters.  Light rain has been falling during the day &amp; the ground is terribly muddy.</p>
