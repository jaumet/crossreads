<p>On their way North with  four Motor wagons. They were delegated to see us  too. The rest of the Staff   &amp;  equipment left that morning by  train for the North. So we know now where we are going but shall not be with them for 12 days yet or more. Dorothy   &amp;  the rest are having a quiet time, but the rest will do them good. We returned about 4.30 p.m. Got to bed quickly but only had about 1 &frac12; hrs so felt very sleepy all night. Yesterday slept like a log   &amp;  did not get up until dinner time 7 p.m. Shall write more next time. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses   &amp;  happy you are all well.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
