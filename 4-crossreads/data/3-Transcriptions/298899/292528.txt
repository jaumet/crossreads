The S.M. had been told that I was left behind &amp; was as wild as possible &amp; when I appeared he seemed to take it as a personal offence &amp; all at once lost his temper &amp; told me that I was not playing the game &amp; that I need not ask him for any more privileges. This set me off &amp; I gave him something to think over telling him that I wanted no privileges from him but that I would demand it. He quite lost his head at being spoken to like this as he rules this crowd with a rod of iron. I then went on night duty but there being nothing doing I managed to get 5 &frac12; hours sleep to make up for shortages during the last few days. My conflict with the S.M. had to come, he has been looking for it all the time &amp; I expect more developments.</p>
