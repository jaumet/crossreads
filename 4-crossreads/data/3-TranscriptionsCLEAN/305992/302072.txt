  
 Manitau a large 12,000 ton liner of the Atlantic Transport Co. of London arrived. The crew's agreement having expired, they refused to take the ship from here to England. So consequently concription covered them as per law of the British Isles. They were replaced by Indians & the white crew dealt by the naval authorities & put on one of the B.I transports to Bombay under arrest & will be tried there by Court Marshal & probably lose a great deal of their money in expenses & also imprissoned there. They were on the steamer which brought off our troops & appeared a very low class of British sailors & especially firemen. Yet to refuse to proceed in a troopship in such a out of way place as Basra they deserve severe punishment, which no doubt they will have later. Some of the firemen we have on our ship would do the same & are just a poor type. In fact I.W.W. to the core, if they had the opportunity, but are well kept under & in hand throughout.
