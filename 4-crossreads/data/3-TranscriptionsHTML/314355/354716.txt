<p>April 5, 7<br/>39.<br/>Leaving Hoograaf tomorrow at 8 a.m. to entrain at Gottesveldt midday.</p>
<p>This afternoon with Roley K. walking to .., in this tiny village three separate butcher shops &ndash; two with real meat, joint signs hanging by the doors.</p>
<p>A sky of wove grey all day:  not a sign of white cloud or sun.</p>
<p>La Somme<br/>April 7<br/>40.<br/>Longpre Les Amiens<br/>A long journeying in cattle trucks from midday yesterday till midnight, in the early hours unloading train, then a marching to school house billets in Longpre les Amiens.</p>
<p>Turned in at 5 a.m. and slept till near midday.</p>
<p>This afternoon with Adj. to the Madeline [Madeleine] Cemetary by Amiens.</p>
<p>41.<br/>At Godi. our truck was deep in fresh horse dung and piss, past St Omer we were lying in deep fresh straw &ndash; grouted near Hazebruck [Hazebrouck] from trucks alongside:  in the station at St Omer by us was a coal train:  half a kilo from St Omer we'd a glowing brazier on an iron stand:  and at Calais we burnt the step half through, a good trip and a comfortable one, spoilt by the hurried detraining in thin rain.  Detraining would have made a finely coloured impression &ndash; a swift lyric of gold and silver, a Dudley Hardy rather than a Frank Brangwin.</p>
<p>42.<br/>There's a lot of loose talking of a bomb or a shell having got Amiens Cathedral;  but Les F. hears today from local people that yesterday closed with the Cathedral whole.  Don R. tells of the great white building opposite the Musee de Picardie being a compleat ruin.</p>
<p>43.<br/>Today &ndash; remembered it talking to Adj. &ndash; Geoff's birthday, and no letter written to him.</p>
<p>April 8<br/>44.<br/>Late afternoon:  a day spent in the Billet drawing and reading.  The stack of folding chairs violated and the Billet like a Euchre hall, only Bridge the game.  Tables, old school picture lesson wall cards, on the four's knees.</p>
<p>Rain and dull cloud.</p>
<p>The Boche over last night, and bombs dropped by the village:  but slept through it all.</p>
<p>No pay yet, though its been available since yesterday.  Tucker bad:  Neeve has evidently taken to heart England's great effort &ndash; boards and notices over France and Flanders, "Eat less and save shipping", "Waste prolongs the war", etc. etc.  Must rub him in next issue of "Gheitz".</p>
<p>Coloured sketch &ndash; yesterday's &ndash; of Amiens from the village hall.</p>
<p>Rumours:  the Boche attacked two of our Brigades with 4 Divisions, he came a large abdominal.  A vague whispering yesterday was of his attacking at one point and losing 10 kilos of his new territory.</p>
