<p>Dear Nell</p>
<p>I opened your letter while lying at one of the Brooklyn wharves &amp; am only just answering it.  I put it in one of my uniform pockets &amp; only found it again today.  In any case it would have got to you no sooner, as when in N.Y. [New York] I was out at 10.30 a.m. &amp; back at 12.30 m.n. a.m. I did not get a great quantity of writing done.</p>
<p>We have had a great trip right through fine all the way.  We called at Wellington first putting in 2&frac12; days there but only got a few &ndash; 10 &ndash; hours leave.  The rest of the time I put in in route marches.</p>
<p>Tahiti was our next call, there we put in 5 days with 50&percnt; leave each day.  We had a great time there feasting on all sorts of fruit from coconuts to bananas &amp; oranges.  The people gave us an all round good time.  I managed to get off every day &amp; on the Sunday afternoon three other chaps &amp; I went for a spin in a Tin Lizzie.  It was a great run</p>
