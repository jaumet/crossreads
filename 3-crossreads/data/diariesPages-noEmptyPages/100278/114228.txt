though tonight I am feeling very much better, but last night I felt absolutely rotten, so I went to bed early, but could get very little rest, for the boys were celebrating Xmas Eve in our hut, were keeping their spirits up with cocoa rum more rum than cocoa I should judge by the row they were kicking up, these were the names of a few of them Freddic Turner, our C.S.M. Jack Hayes (Q.M.) Sgts. Price, Mackie Bellchambers, Wilson Cpls. Tin Bill Bradley, all decent chaps, songs chorouses were going round all the evening but about 1O O'clock the performance showed signs of degenerating for the rum was beginning to tell things were getting boisterous
