<p>2.  &amp; walk 2 or 3 miles &amp; get back before dark.  I am taking a walk every night that it is fine.  I went to Church at the little old Milstone Church on Easter Sunday.  It is so quaint &amp; I had to sit up in the Chapel near the Altar, as the wee Kirk was full.<br/>On Thursday I had to go to Southall Hospital on Escort Duty.  I delivered My Patient &amp; being only a little way from Richmond I went to see Mrs Harbert.  Everyone was out, but the maids admitted me &amp; I sat by the fire, &amp; amused Myself at the Piano till Mrs H. &amp; one of the Girls came Home.</p>
