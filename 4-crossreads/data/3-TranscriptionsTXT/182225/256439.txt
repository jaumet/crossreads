NOV. THURSDAY  16   1916
Fine, but very dull & bleak. The coldest day we have had yet. I was on the manure waggon driving it about a mile to the other side of Fargo Hospital  Poss & Bill & self went over to a concert at the YMCA at night & it was very good. My word its a treat to hear good voices singing good songs after the trash we have given us at the shows round the camp. Was issued with two sets of colours for the 3rd Division Artillary
