<p>him with silent respect. Ober Lt Gerard Felmy came down to Huj in a 2 seater Albatross Scout, introduced himself to Claude, &amp; warmly congratulated Claude, on the fight he had put up. (G. Felmy had brought Claude down).</p>
<p>He then asked Claude if he had seen the Holy City. Claude had'nt so Felmy took him for a joyride to Jerusalem &amp; then over to Ramleh, (the Hun aerodrome site) where he was guest of the Germans for over a week.</p>
<p>They invited us to take his kit over, (as he had nothing) &amp; drop it on their aerodrome. Capt Jones went over with Claude's kit &amp; came down to within 100 ft of their aerodrome &amp; dropped it. They were all out waving to him. We sent letters to Claude, his mail, photos to both he &amp; the Felmy's, &amp; a letter of thanks to them for all their kindness.</p>
<p>Felmy came over to our aerodrome a few days later in his scout. Our "Archies" were blazing into him &amp; shells bustin' all round him. He looped the loop over our aerodrome dropped a large message bag &amp; went off like hell.</p>
