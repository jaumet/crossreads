 Friday 19 January 1917 [1918] Off 5-8 &amp; went Cairo to shop for Hewitt, an English boy off to England with 5 other pts. from one ward. Had a sad note in one Indian shop, remarked to a man who showed a very old coin given by Aust. soldier &amp; secured by him from Turk at Gallipoli.  "Lots of our Aust. boys are lying there dead".  He said in a  very  voice tone not to be forgotten.   Only  Australians madam,  only  Australians?  The tradegy in his face &amp; voice made me question &ndash; he has lost 7 sons, &amp; there are 13 orphan children already in his family.
