 January 1917 shell fire, but don't know to what extent. On the 14th Major Genl Chauvel inspected our camp here &amp; was well pleased with the appearance of horses &amp; men.  Major Genl Watson inspected us the following day.  Sports were held at Hassaniya but our Regt didn't take part.  C Squadron played the 7th 2 games of football, the first was drawn &amp; the 2nd C Sqdn won by 5 to nil.  The weather has fined up again but the nights are cold.  Things are quiet again on our front. 
 20th Jany I went over to Hassaniya &amp; got some maps.  Saw Jean McCarthy &amp; Stan Rogan I stayed with them for a couple of hours &amp; got back here just before dark.  I got a letter from Cousin Carrie in London.  There was an Australian mail last week  Got 3 letters 2 from home &amp; 1 from Doug also some papers including "Gazettes"  This place is getting monotonous.  Have been here 2 months now.
