<p>away to friends. When I came back of course I had to make a fresh start. Most of them of course insisted on my taking my thing back &amp; so I'm now settled down again very comfortably. The reason for the bungle was that barracks were occupied by a number of English yeomanry who received their orders to proceed to the front. After we, who were taking their place, arrived there, the English men received orders to cancell all previous orders. There was not room for both of us, for the two days we were there, we bivvied in the barrack square, &amp; so we had to retire. The English officers were a most inhospitable crowd. We arrived there after a long march, at about ten o'clock at night. We were not invited into their mess, nor did we see the inside of it from the time we reached there till the time we left. We very effectually got our own back. They were preparing to go, when they received orders to leave behind some men &amp; four officers, &amp; we immediately invited the four to become honorary members of our mess, which invitation they accepted. All the time we were there we fed in a shed adjoining the kitchen which was usually used for kitchen orderlies.</p>
<p>In making a fresh start now after a break of some days, I've got plenty to say but very little time to say it in. Orders to go to Kasr-el-nil a second time prevented me from finishing this letter. We are just back again after staying there a day &amp; the reason for our return is that we have received orders to go to the front</p>
