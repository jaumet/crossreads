<p>a Belgian, a big, tall, rosy-cheeked lass, blue-eyed---clean-minded&mdash;nice girl---but rough compared with our own city girls of Australia.</p>
<p>Friday, 26.<br/>Usual routine.</p>
<p>Saturday, 27.<br/>Orderly Sergeant for day. We commence to shift to the old infantry "humpies" situated in the orchard at L'Estrade---nearer to Office. It is a very ragtime shift. Went to baths. Trouble with Bdr. Boag and Campion. Warned them for Orderly.</p>
<p>Sunday. 28.<br/>Nearly everything shifted. We have the afternoon off. I wrote a little, but slept till stables---under a cherry tree in the orchard.</p>
<p>Monday 29.<br/>At Menegatte C. Sub had covered in stables, but here the whole battery horse lines are in the open---two lines, one for each section. Usual routine. Hauled out of bed at 9.30pm. to supply two teams and accompany the Left Section---four teams in all-to Gun Pits. Cpl. Waters to take four teams to Right Section. Night---drizzling rain intensely dark, was highly strung---it was my first trip into the unknown. The strafe had been heavy all day. Went right to the Pits themselves. Returned 4.am.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 30.<br/>Morning in bed---slept till 10.30am. Had to attend Orderly Room to give evidence re Boag and Campion.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 31.<br/>Usual. Went into Steenwerk for tea with Prouse---pate, eggs, chips and coffee. In a butcher's shop where we got the pate I saw the most exquisite type of face and hands I have seen in France.</p>
