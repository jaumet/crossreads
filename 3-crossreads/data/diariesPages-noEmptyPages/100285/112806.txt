praise for the marvellous fighting they have done.
This afternoon after tea Lindsay I went for a walk down to Shearwater a very pretty sheet of water from which the Camps round here drain their water supply it lies in a lovely little valley clothed on both sides by beautiful trees pretty little cottages are sprinkled all over the place there is a nice little path road which runs round the lake is largely patronized by the girls round this quarter, I took my camera with me got a few snaps on our way back we met Jack Gribble I had not seen him for ages we had quite a long yarn, he wants Lindsay I to come round to his diggings tomorrow meet a few more of his pals, Jack has been in trouble over his Italy stunt
