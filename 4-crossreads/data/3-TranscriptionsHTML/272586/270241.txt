<p>[Letter page with large tab on top, written on this side]<br/>I can't say how long we will be here not long though, just while some of the boats take on coal etc. I wish I could get ashore but theres no chance of that unless I swim.</p>
<p>We got news to day from the front the first we have had since we left. things in general seem to be going on much as ever. some of the lads are preparing for a swim I think I will join them. There's absolutely nothing to write about so I will desist.</p>
<p>Much love to one &amp; all</p>
