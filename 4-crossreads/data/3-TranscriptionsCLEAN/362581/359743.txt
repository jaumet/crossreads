 My darling Eddy, 
 I have just received two letters No 20   &  No 21, with your lovely little letters enclosed. The pictures are beautiful   &  you are quite clever at drawing. I wrote to Aunty Etta yesterday   &  find the mail does not close until today. I have not time to write one to them, so you tell them I am better   &  had a very nice outing yesterday. Sister Martin, Craig, Hart   &   I had afternoon tea in Cairo, then drove along the Avenue beside the River Nile . We had a glorious afternoon. The Nile River is at its  highest tide now - looks like a rough dirty sea - The Bull-rushes are beautiful just now. Fondest love   &  kisses From Auntie Eadle
