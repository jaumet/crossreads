Reported Head Quarters & got KIT, Cuth Fetherstonhough has the D.S.O.!!!  I met his wife. May get a job as O.C. 1st L.H. Training Regiment at Moascar but nothing certain yet.  Went Hospitals & saw all the wounded & got news. My Sergt. Major has been killed. I brought a watch from England for him, & many other good men. I feel going back after missing all the recent fighting, D.S.O.s & M.C.s have been won while I was away.
