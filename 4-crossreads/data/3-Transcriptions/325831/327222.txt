<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>Am back with the Bn again &amp; in the best of condition. It is very cold but am at present quite comfortable in a shelter hut. Shall write you again at first chance. Have got no more note paper handy at present. Saw Keith a few days ago. He was with Gen Holmes. May have a chance to look him up tomorrow &amp; think I know where he is.</p>
<p>Best love</p>
<p>Yours affectionately</p>
<p>C.R. Lucas.</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>Am at present commanding the Battalion but only for a short time no promotion.</p>
