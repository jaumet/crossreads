<p>Frid. May 3<br/>The doctors took about a quart of Fluid from one of our chaps this morning. He seems to be pretty bad.</p>
<p>The doctor says he will fill in my Board Papers tomorrow. I commenced Letter 18 to M.S. and told her all about it. Perhaps I was wrong in doing so, as I am a long way from Home yet, and she will be awfully disappointed if the Board happens to fail. Gee! but I hope not. The very idea of being <u>Home</u> again makes me feel about 10 years younger. Anyhow I'm going to hope for the Best.</p>
<p>Bill Beards and Mic Lean came to see me. They were going on Leave.</p>
<p>No mail for me yet.</p>
<p>Sat. 4<br/>The doctor said he would make out my Board papers today but he must have forgotten.</p>
<p>George Lawson came to see me and brought some Cigarettes. A Lady came round just before Tea and said "did we mind her leaving us a few eggs". Of course we said wib be delightful; and Eggs figured on our menu for Tea.</p>
<p>Wrote Letter 19. <br/>Sun. 5<br/>Corp. Carr came to see me today and promised to send some Jam and other good things. Food is not of the Best in this Hospital and a bit of a change will be welcome.</p>
