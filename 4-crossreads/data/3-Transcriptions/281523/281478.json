<p>14/9/17 Ypres &amp; Dominion Camp <br/>road but very heavy shells were landing right on it causing batteries around to evacuate.  We made a big detour to the left and escaped the bombardment.  Caught our car at the big dressing station and drove back through Dickebusch home. Spent the afternoon working out details for the relief and taking things easy.  The band gave a programme during the afternoon.  At 6.30 Kellaway put on a concert in the Y.M.C.A and I sent Major Dooley over to preside being too tired myself.  Col James came in for a talk after mess.  The concrete pill boxes are a characteristic of the front up here and are very strong undoubtedly -  solid concrete and steel rails.  The left battalion H.Q. has several direct hits daily.  The C.O. in one place was most apologetic for the bad odour about and said it was a Colonel of the Northumberland Fischer and his Adjutant who were buried inextricably in debris.</p>
