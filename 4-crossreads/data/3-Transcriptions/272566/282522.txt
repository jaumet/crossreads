<p>Tuesday 20 March</p>
<p>Slept in a double bed in the cellar of a ruined residence at No. 7 Rue de Republique.  There is a terrace of fine places here, all smashed about.  We are now busy clearing out the debris of Nos. 3, 5 &amp; 7, the bottom floors of which are to be used as a dressing station.  The second floor and the attic, <strike>are</strike> being in a sad condition, are quite unsafe.  Our flags are now flying in the front garden.  Shells are still coming over.  The stories of how the 30th Battalion troops of the 8th Aust. Brigade entered Bapaume &amp; raced after souvenirs are very amusing.  They marched out wearing women's hats, mens top hats, straw hats &amp; German head gear.  The guns are coming up in pursuit of Fritz and its a fine sight to see caterpillar tractors drawing the heavy guns along the Albert-Bapaume Road.  Infantry are moving slowly with mounted troops out in front as scouts.  Some of these are coming in wounded.</p>
