March 1916
We passed quite close to the English Channel the masts of some sunken vessel could be discerned from the train as we passed through. We only touched the outskirts of Calais it looked a fine big place after we had passed Calais we passed an Aerodrome saw a big Dirigible Baloon its Hanger was the first Ive ever seen. We got out of the train at 4 pm on the 31st at a siding about a mile a half north of Hazebrouck. Throughout the trip we we treated well welcomed by the French people but like a lot of prisoners by our Officers for when the train would stop quards we placed along the line to prevent us getting out of our carriages were even stopped from buying bread or filling our water bottles. All the horrors of war could also be noticed during the trip for nearly everybody wore something black Women children could be seen doing mens work in the fields vineyards. At every station dozens of young women children asked us for souviners near Calais the kiddies were crying out for bully beef biscuits.
When we disentrained we were issued with rations some were allowed to fill their water bottles then we set off for our billets. We wandered about till midnight then had to sleep in a big barn at a place called Wollon-Cappel then in the morning we went to our own
