turned in in the YMCA tent - which is a sort of free hotel to all travellers on the line.
Next morning I found the place, got rid of the natives & having lazed away the morning in the sun & canteen I got the new natives & caught the five oclock train which unfortunately refused to go any further than Deir sinneid so I spent the night there &, having sent a wire in the morning to announce my arrival caught the seven train and arrived up here about lunch time
