<p>Friday 13 April</p>
<p>On Incinerator.<br/>Showery weather.<br/>Lance Corp. Marlow went to Beaulencourt to Div. Headquarters where Gen. Birdwood presented him with the Military Medal ribbon.  The Tanks have so far been something in the shape of a failure, 6 out of 12 were hit yesterday by direct shots.  Others got caught in Fritz's wires.  4th Division got fearfully cut up at Bullecourt.<br/>All this news comes from Gen. Birdwood.<br/>Before breakfast this morning we were tramped off on a Route March for half an hour.  We are wondering what officer has gone mad.  Snowing heavily in evening.</p>
