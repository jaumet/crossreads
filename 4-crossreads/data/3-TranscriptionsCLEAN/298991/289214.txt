  
 Sunday Sept 16th Misty nearly all day. Was put on Quartermasters fatigue so I never went to church. Went out picking blackberries this afternoon, there are a good few bushes about here, but many berries. They are not in comparison with the blackberries in Australia, rather small, with hardly any taste ot juice. 
 Monday Sept 17th Still misty windy & cold. All clocks were put back an hour this morning at 2 am, on account of the "daylight saving system". It is the end of the summer, but from what I can see of it we haven't had any summer yet. Pay day today, but has my pay book hasn't come back yet I couldn't draw any. Went to see Dr Lynn a conjurer in the Gym this evening he was very good. 
 Tuesday Sept 18th The wet & cold weather has apparently set in, as there seems no hope of it breaking. This camp is just about full now. There are a good few "big heads" today, after yesterday.
