<p>Disembarkation day.<br/>We commenced unloading stores &amp; forage &amp; transport at seven a.m. &amp; then horses Tas Inf then D.S.C. then ours.  It was great fun they came down the gangway in 3 jumps and as soon as they felt Mother Earth under them they went cranky &ndash; they were so fit that they bucked reared &amp; played up like yearlings. One man had five ribs broken whilst unloading.  They stood there for some time &amp; it started to rain when all the horses were off we were told that the train would not be ready until six so we had to take them back on to the boat feed them, have our own tea then take them off the boat again and lead them about1/2 of a meter to the siding where we commenced trucking about 9 o'clock, it was a hard job out of the 300 odd horses only about 5% went up the race they nearly all had to be practically carried or pushed up bodily with ropes &amp; slings, they gave us all we knew one fell back out of the truck but was unhurt we finished about eleven and we took our seats in the train utterly worn out and journeyed all night to Cairo which we reached at 5.30 we slept as best we could all through the trying voyage.</p>
