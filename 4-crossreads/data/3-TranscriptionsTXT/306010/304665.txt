typical, sleepy little French Villages surrounded by fertile cultivated fields, in which the people were working getting in the last of the crops. I have already more than once described the beauties of the rural country of France so that shall not do so again. The roads were perfect & as I had a bright fine day for the ride & no mishaps with the bike, no hitch whatever occurred & I rode into St. Omer at 2.45 pm. - exactly 4 hours after leaving Wimereux. Three kiloms. this side of the town therode road passed through the biggest British aircraft Depot in France. Great hangars & workshops  alive with men of the Royal Flying Corps at work, and last but not least the machines - stacks of them! Aeroplanes, - bi-planes, monoplanes, etc. I saw several go up, skimming across the turf & then rising in the air like great birds.
