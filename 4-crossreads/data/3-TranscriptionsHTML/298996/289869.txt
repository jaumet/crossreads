<p>28-3-15<br/>Very funny when the deck hands came along to wash the decks a 4.A.M. this morning some of the lads would not move when they were told so they had the hose put upon them which ment they got a good soaking. Then the Language began to fly. It is very warm this morning and the lads are laying all over the decks in the shade. Church parade the afternoon. What a grand night it is tonight nice &amp; cool with the moon shining across the bright deep blue sea. We are in the Indian Ocean now.</p>
