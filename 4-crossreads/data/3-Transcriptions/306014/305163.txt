Just before he left Australia a sweet wee girlie had come to him &amp; told him that she was going to continually pray for him, and she told him to tell all the boys that she was praying for them too. And he told us. Since then I have often seen, in imagination, a tender form kneeling beside her bed, remembering us before <u>Our</u> heavenly father's throne.</p>
