<p>The township is situated just inside the entrance on the slopes of the eastern headland. In the harbour awaiting our arrival were the troopship "Kanowna" with about 500 men &ndash; a similar number having been landed Thursday Id. All these were from Queensland.</p>
<p>On Sunday 6th I held service on the "Kanowna" at 11am immediately after ours; and also at night many of the boys joined in a service of song held on our deck, they being on their own decks which overlooked ours, as we were alongside each other.</p>

The ships included were Sydney, Encounter,; three destroyers, Parramatta, Yarra and Warrego; Submarines AE1 and AE2; troopships "Berrima" and "Kanowna", Storeship "Aorangi".
