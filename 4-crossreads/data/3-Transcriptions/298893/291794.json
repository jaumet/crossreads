<p>19th Batt<br/>Popes Post<br/>25-11-15</p>
<p>Lieut Boyden,<br/>I have examined bombs on Monash &amp; Hintons posts &amp; found 13 defective in Monash &amp; 9 defective in Hinton's. The bombs have been exposed to the weather &amp; need more attention. I have replaced the defective bombs with new ones &amp; in addition have placed 2 boxes of 6 second match headed Cricket Ball bombs at Hinton's Post &amp; 1 box of the same pattern bombs at Monash Gully.<br/>Would you mind informing the N.C.Os  in Charge of the bombs to see that the bombs are not exposed to the weather.<br/>Thanking you<br/>A Gray<br/>RSM</p>
