<p>53<br/>12-10-16<br/>Frank Goodear (Postal Staff) &amp; I went in to Poperinghe on bikes this afternoon &amp; stayed in there for tea. We had a good look round the old place. Had our photos taken by a very nice young lady. Coming back pulled up at a wayside cottage &amp; had a lovely cup of coffee &amp; a good yarn to the old folk. It is remarkable how fluently they speak English. Called in to see Juliette &amp; had another cup of coffee there, we are gluttons for coffee.</p>
