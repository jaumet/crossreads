17th After watering & feeding animals we had breakfast and at 6.45 am were ready to move off. Very little progress was made to-day as the Engineers who were leading the convoy were being continually hung up through their horses jibbing.
Luckily I had a good team of mules which I was driving four in hand from the box and not once did they stick me up. We had a halt for about an hour for dinner and at 5.45 arrived at Fressin our camping ground for the night.
18th By 7 am we were on the road and after a good days trek arrived at [indecipherable] at 9 pm.
19th Raining. Owing to some hitch the convoy was delayed till 12 noon when we left arriving at Strazeele about 7 pm. Here we joined the battalion.
20th We are supposed to be resting but are instead making preparations for a trek to Armentieres which I believe will take place to-morrow.
