Last night I went &amp; saw "The Show Shop" at the Globe" it was very good, I got home pretty late &amp; had a good hot bath for it was my last night in glorious London surely one of the finest cities of the world. I shall never never forget the time I had there the kindness of the people, the pretty girls, the taxis the play's &amp; the roar of old London, it will sound in my ears for years to come &amp; I shall always look back on it with pleasure<br/>at 10 minutes to 8 this morning we left her for good, for our leave was up &amp; we are returning to; what.<br/>I am writing this on the boat that is taking us away from good old England, it took us 70 minutes to do the 60 odd miles down some</p>
