<p>Tues. Feb.17 (cont.)<br/>We are steaming very slowly along the Canal.  The water is very calm &amp; one would hardly think the ship was moving at all as she is so steady.<br/>Wed. Feb. 19.<br/>Woke up this morning to find the ship slowing down, as we were nearing Port Zufic. There were a number of other vessels anchored in the Harbor. We were not near enough to shore to see what was going on; so our stay was not very interesting. I washed a pair of slacks last night &amp; put them out to dry on the roof of the Isolation Hospital. They were dry in about a couple of hours. If I am allowed to keep all the clothes I've got, I shall have quite a fair outfit. We had quite a good Dinner today Roast Lamb &amp; vegetables.<br/>We took in quite a big consignment of Red X stuff, which ought to last us till we get to Freemantle. About 3 p.m. about 100 Light Horsemen came aboard. Most of them wore feathers in their Hats which gave them quite a "jaunty" appearance.</p>
