had it been in actuality, my the wings of my machine would have been sadly perforated, but as he was unable to train his gun either on to the Pilot (myself in this case) or any vital part of my machine, such as engine or petrol tanks.  The Flight Commander who had been watching the scrap through a pair of glasses, complimented me on the way I handled the machine.The weather for the past few days has been very unsatisfactory from a pupil's point of view, but it is fairly decent above the clouds say at 6,000 ft. but then of course it is surprisingly easy to get lost.  I think one of the finest sensations that anybody could wish for is to be in a machine at 3,000 ft on a clear morning & watch the sun rise.  It is gorgeous, really, & there are no two ways about it.I am keeping in splendid health, & enjoy living every minute of the day.So poor old Georgie Reid has gone!  He was a great old man & a man who was proud of his position as High Commissioner for Australia.  I remember forming one of a Guard of Honour for him one day at the S.H.S., & he shook hands with us after it was over.Must close now trusting you are all keeping well,With much love to you all,Your loving son,Leo.P.S.  Penny postage has been abolished in Gt. Britain thus the 1 1/2 d stamps on all my letters.  Same for inland postage here.
