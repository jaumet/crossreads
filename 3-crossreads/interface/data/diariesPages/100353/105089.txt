After passing several barren islands land again disappeared we were once again surrounded by a glassy sea covered by a yellowish scum. Locusts, doves a quail came on board together with other denizens of the desert. The heat of the Red Sea is of course proverbial but it quite exceeded the most sanguine expectations. The men lay about in the steaming air pouring perspiration. The animals were like dead, the tar in the planking bubbled boiled, any iron exposed to the sun was heated to burning. Add to this the air was filled with a thick cloud of desert dust which seemed to make things hotter.
