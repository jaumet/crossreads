are in their wrong battalion are going to return to their proper units.
There was a pretty short issue of rations this morning I don't know what was the cause of it. Fairly big mail in last night and a very welcome one to, seeing as how it is some time since we had our last tour. When we rose this morning it was very misty but it turned out a lovely day, the weather has been remarkably fine and mild of late nice sunny days and bright cold nights, the days though are very short it is practically dark at 6.30 in the morning when we rise and dark again at 4.30 so the nights are very long.
Had to act Coy S.M. today in place of Jack Price, got on alright althow it was a bit strange.
