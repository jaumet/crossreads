22-3-17tea, then drove to the station the train left at 6.15 PM, I had a very enjoyable evening & the the best 3 weeks I have had in my life & it is the only time I have regretted leaving Cairo. We arrived at Kantara at 10.30PM & found Dev High waiting for me on the station (Jessie had sent him a wire) We went to Mrs Chisholms for a drink of cocoa & then to Dev's home for the night; Heard that Vern Harris Kingsford & the rest of the lads only left here this morning Jessie & Florence sent "The Sentimental Bloke:" up for Dev also one for me. Besides a supply of sandwuiches & cakes for the journey
