  
  Raily  Railway (Inner Circle) at the Back of the House is a large Shaft for Ventilation purposes & one could hear the Rumbling Sound as each Electric Train passed along. When we went inside there were two more ladies who had arrived during the Afternoon so I was in Good Company 5 Ladies & Mr Smith & myself, we were soon seated around the Tea Table & all enjoyed the Compliments from one to the other. After Tea Mr & Mrs Smith took me around to see her Sister so after bidding the Young Ladies Good Bye we took a Low Train Underground to Waterloo. This Train goes down under & along a long Street, it has 3 Stopping places & there is 2 Lines, it goes underground for about 1 mile & then up again
