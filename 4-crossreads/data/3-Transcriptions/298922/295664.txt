<p>Monday 31 December 1917</p>
<p>Inspected by Lt. General Chauvel our old Brigadier this morning. I go so soon as the Railway is available to take me, so will see Jerusalem very soon I hope now.</p>
<p>Current topic of conversation is the failure of Conscription. This may let JOE get away but I do hope he won't throw up his job. We all remember the anxiety before he got it &amp; it is more secure than ever a Station Manager's.</p>
