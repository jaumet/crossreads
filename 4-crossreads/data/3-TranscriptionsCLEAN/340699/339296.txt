it through a telescope - it's only a mile or so away and I could see very plainly the huge gaping rents in the church roof. four Hun (planes came near to see the damage but got such a reception they ducked and dived to escape being hit; bobbing like dinghies after a liner has passed. All known and unknown curses on them!
Bois d'Escardonneuse 16/7/18.Yesterday evening I got on with my picture and hope it will end as well as it has begun. We yarned a bit after dinner and then I turned in, fairly early. After reading a little, some Jerry 'planes came over and as usual out went the candles. The guns were fairly active, some of them being of a particularly noisy type and I couldn't sleep. It was a lovely clear night, but at last it began to cloud up a bit and out of one a schweinhund darted. They got the searchlight on him, but the guns did no good. I fell asleep but woke to a terrific bombardment. It proved to be thunder and guns.The rain came down in a deluge and kept up till this morning. After breakfast I arranged for 3 new stretchers 4x3 and will get the first .tomorrow. This morning it was misty and swelteringly hot and I did a portrait and by the feeling in my head I think there'll be another storm this evening.

After noon an orderly arrived with a stretcher and for lack of pliers I stretched a canvas on it with my fingers with calamitous results to my knuckles. I regret that I took any notice of the clever people who told me that it was impracticable to take with me for use this and that tool of trade. In future, if I can have my way, I'm going to work on
