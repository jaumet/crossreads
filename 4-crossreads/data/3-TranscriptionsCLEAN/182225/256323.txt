JULY   SUNDAY 23   1916
A nice warm day. Had a church parade in morning & fell out with the Presberterian & other Prodestant denominations & went to the YMCA hut. It was very like a salvation army meeting outside a pub. A couple of fellows from Mooki came up in afternoon & had a yarn. Polishing up to go to London tomorrow.
