<p>July 1st 1916  Saturday</p>
<p>Very cold last night &ndash; slept beautifully &ndash; very nice day but on the cool side &ndash; On Guard all day &ndash; C Section busy fixing up a hospital for clearing purposes only. About from 5 till 9 pm, we witnessed in the distance at Ypres &ndash; an aeroplane duel also heavy firing &ndash; went for a stroll around the Village &ndash; quite a treat to get a glass of fine beer 1 [centime] per glass &ndash; Tea &ndash; coffee &ndash; cocoa 1 [centime], postcards 3 [centimes] per dozen, the people generally are so natty &amp; clean to a fault almost. (2/7/16  Sunday)</p>
<p>Nice cool day &ndash; Got permission to go to the Cathedral for 11 o'clock Mass. It was a very nice service &amp; happened to be High Mass, they finished up with a procession of the <strike>of the</strike> Sacrament around the Village, they carry out Catholicity to the letter here. The Cathedral was erected 1821 &amp; beautifully finished inside, lovely carving etc. Father [blank] speaks English very well altho the sermon was in French. In the afternoon I went for a stroll thro some of the lanes &amp; thro the farms. The Germans were in possession of next Village Hazebruick for 3 days, the Tommys &amp; Australians came &amp; drove them back to Ypres, the women tell me they had all their stuff packed to clear out &amp;</p>
