<p>Sat. 10.  Kept busy in Blanket Store.  Weather still frosty.  Finished Letter to M.S.  Concert Party going strong, but most of the crowd got very bad colds.</p>
<p>Sun. 11>  Went into Albert with 2 G.S. waggons &amp; drew 1000 Blankets from the 7th F. Amb.  Plenty of Patients arriving &amp; departing which keeps me busy in the Store.  Church Service in the Concert Room till 7.45.  Made our Night birds rehearsal rather late.</p>
<p>Mon. 12.  Reg Hancock &amp; Murphy were evacuated today.  About half the Amb. are sick in Hospital.  Got some more mail today. One Letter from Kath, one from Mother &amp; one from D.O.L.  Horrie Playford came along with his Cornet so now we have quite a first class orchestra, Violin, Piano, &amp; Cornet</p>
<p>Tues. 13.  Quite an exciting day.  Early this morning a number of Taubes came over &amp; dropped bombs, but didn't do much damage.  Just after Dinner a Patient was having a shave in the Barbers shop, when he collapsed, seriously wounded.  The pack store is next door.  A chap was cleaning a rifle there, when it went off &amp; the poor beggar in the shop got the bullet thro' his arm &amp; made a big hole in his side.  Of course there will be an enquiry &amp; somebody will get into trouble.  The Concert is going good, but my partner, Blanton is suffering from Trench feet &amp; can't jig about at all. I wrote out some Programmes today put a sketch of an owl in one Corner, &amp; it looks very well.</p>
