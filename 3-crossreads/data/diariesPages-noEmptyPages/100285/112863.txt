this shower cooled me down gradually then we went out had a plunge in the cold water bath, by this time we were as white as snow feeling fit for anything from here we went into the hot room again had a good rub down with a rough towel then upstairs onto a couch covered up here we had to stop until we regained our normal temperatures, when we got dressed, just before we went into the bath I weighed myself stripped just tipped the scales at 9 st 10  lbs after coming out I weighed again I was exactly 1  lbs lighter that gives you an idea how it pulls one down, we were an hour a half going through all these processe's, when it was all over I never felt better in my life, we then walked back to our hotel settled our accounts made over to the station for our train, we had a fine journey back
