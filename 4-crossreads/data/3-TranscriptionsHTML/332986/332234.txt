<p>21-8-1917<br/>Fine day. Plenty of 5.9 time shrapnel fired at our baloons. Men jumping out. Enemy aeroplanes busy. Taubes over during the night, got a warm reception with machine guns, and anti air guns. Another gun blown out, leaving us with only one gun</p>
<p>22-8-1917<br/>A very successful stunt started at 5.A.M. The heavies were at it all night. The 18 pdrs started at 5.A.M, and eased off at 7.A.M. starting again at 7-30.A.M. The heavies still firing at 7.P.M. Just witnessed a fine aeiral victory. 4 Hun planes over our lines, The anti opened up on them, they turned, and run into a fleet of ours, who promptly brought down two. A beautiful dive was made by one of our machines  The other two got away our planes after them, too much speed for our planes. Shelling around our camp, this morning. Moving camp, left section go this evening, remainder tomorrow, 300 yards away. Shod 2 horses for Col Winters. Some pot in charge of a heavy group. Friend</p>
