Down as He likes then He can get on well enough.  We don't do all our washing I might state.  Our Hides & a few Hanks are all that we ever do.  You say that I do some travelling about.  My travels except to the Isle of Man are all Business & sight seeing.  I only want to go to see Auntie & Uncle & Marie otherwise Bulford or as far as I can reach comfortably on the Bike would do me.  Why do you know that sometimes for 10 days I never go out of the gates.  I reckon I'll have pretty near finished gadding about by the time I come Home.  You bet the Army pays fares but mungaree no.  But I get the mungaree in the long run.  I am really not out of pocket over it in the end.  Give my Best Wishes to Mrs. Doyle & the Kiddie.
