14 13th Battn Inlying Picquet again to day. Turks blew one of our trenches up this morning at "Courtney Post" injuring a great many. Big Battle in progress down at "Krithia" the air seems full of bursting shells. Turk Artillery pays attention to us again this evening and give us a shower of Shrapnel bullets killing 4 and wounding 7 A Doctor had both legs blown off.
15 Stand to Arms at 3 this morning. Turk guns again busy, they pour a great many shells into our Batteries but little damage done. Aeroplanes report Turks doing a lot of sapping out on our left. Down for a dip this afternoon must have been hundreds in the water when over came a couple of shells and burst high in the air some of the lads make a dash for the shore while others remain paddling about, there were three men wounded. Although dangerous it has its humorous side. Lessons in Bomb Throwing this evening.
16 Had a good nights rest. Turks shelling our Supply Base hevily this morning. HMS Humber exchanged shots with Turkish Field Battery out towards "Lone Pine" position but seem unable to silence them. The Turks have one gun out there which our boys have named "Beachy Bill" and another on our left near "Anafarta" which they call "Lonely Liz" they cause no end of trouble to us. The boys in fireing line get busy this evening with their machine guns, So does the Turk sending showers of bullets overhead sighing like wind they fairly whistle.
