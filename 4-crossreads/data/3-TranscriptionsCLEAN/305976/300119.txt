  
 14th. What a beautiful place it seemed after our absence. We anchored just off Watson's Bay & the Medical Officer came on board. We were then ordered into Quarantine for a week. This caused much dissent among the Troops as we were a clean ship. All Sydney were wearing masks so the passengers on the Manly boats told us. Next day we went into Quarantine at North Head & were compelled to stay there for a week. That week seemed to me to go very slow, However we were well treated there having nothing to do.
