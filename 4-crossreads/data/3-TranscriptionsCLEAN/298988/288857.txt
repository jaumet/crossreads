Wireless news just came through to say that some Turkish prisoners & guns were taken & that the moral effect on our boys of the big gun fire was excellent.  This was signalled from Gaba Tepe wireless station, which was erected by our Troops as soon as they landed.  Just went & had a look outside & I can see Shrapnel bursting all along the hills, lighting up the sky in a wonderful manner.
April 27th (Tuesday)The bombardment went on intermittently all last night, increasing in violence at daylight this morning.  The French Troops that landed in Asia Minor, off Tenedos Island are forcing their way across the plain of Troy.
I can just imagine how the outside world must be watching with eagerness these operations.  I daresay too, that they know more of it than we do here.  Have been speculating how long we will be here.  Perhaps they may send us away with a batch of Turkish prisoners, after we get the rest of our Troops landed.  We also have the rations of our men still, as they had to carry enough  with them to last three days.  As today is the 3rd day no doubt they will be getting pretty hungry.
10 a.m.  There are 9 Troop ships in charge of two Cruisers just making their way towards Lemnos, so perhaps they are going for more men.
10 p.m.The whole business has been going on very solidly all today. The Queen Elizabeth has been assisting at Gaba Tepe most of the day. Watching through a telescope
