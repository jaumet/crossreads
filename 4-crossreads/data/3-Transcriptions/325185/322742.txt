<p>would X Ray the hand &amp; if there wasint anything left in I could come out so here I am. This is a very fine place. About thirty miles from London. It belongs to a Mr Harrison a big shipping man. (Owner I presume). They have accomodation for sixty patiens. It is just voluntary aid. Mr Harrison's daughters attend to the patients. They have a trained nurse to look after the worst cases. I can't tell you what the house is like I don't know what we have to liken it to. There are very fine grounds to the house. All of which are open to the patients in fact the whole place is at the disposal of patients. Inside there is a very fine billiard room &amp; table. Then a large room for a recreation room with a piano. Which needless to say gets pumped about a good deal</p>
