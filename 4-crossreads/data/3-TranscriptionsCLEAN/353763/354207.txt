These straw - conically pointed huts are of course the typical house of these natives tho well known but it was interesting to see them all the same  -  The huts were neat & clean & the compound quite clean  -  The German curator I expect sees to all that  -  We've had also a peep at his house - from the exterior - just at the back was a colony of those handsome but very noisy birds - the metallic starlings  -  They were nesting & parliament was sitting  -  They were all speakers & all made the utmost use of their privilege of saying a few words to the rest  -  I saw no listeners  -  Their nests are large & crowded together at the end of the branches  -  Now & again the weight is too much & down comes branch nests eggs & young birds  -  A tit bit for snakes carnivores & accipitrines  -
Another thing interested me - in a bee hive hut open all round   -  and thatwere meteorological instruments - bulbs & thermometers - dry & wet  -  A rain guage stood outside in good position  -  Yes there was a good German brain
