 a lot of correspondence &amp; house work to do.  We have had a spell of wet &amp; windy weather lately but it has been nice since about 10 a.m. &amp; it is a lovely evening.  I should like to go for a walk but I must try to write some letters first. 
 Well, Dad, I am writing to Mum so I'll have to give Her some news.  Kind Regards to Otto &amp; Chris &amp; those whom you meet who are interested also to Mr. A.H. &amp; E.L.J. if they are not too much above it. 
 Fond Love Harry.
