<p>29-4-16  [Saturday]<br/>I took a day of today to see the Pyramids.  I didn't have as good a time as I would have liked because I could only raise 40 P.T.  Still I managed pretty fair with the assistance of  the Y.M.C.A. &amp; had a good look around.  It was too poor to have my photo taken but still I was sufficiently lucky to escape being punished  I nearly got caught at the Barrier going in but the crowd shoved one through<br/>[indecipherable] &amp; peninsula</p>
<p>30-4-16<br/>We were inspected by the  <strike>Prince? of Wales</strike> today.  We were formed up at 3.0 PM &amp; the inspecting party arrived at about 4.40 P.M.  Bluey Heydon went into Hospital today he has several overlapping toes &amp; the Dr. suggested cutting off 3 of them.  There was a lot more mucking up the day before yesterday the boys burnt a lot more shops the result is that Birdwood came here yesterday &amp; promised to make it hot for them &amp; ever since we have had to mount extra gaurds &amp; fire pickets so</p>
