<p>The battle of 971<br/>Previously owned by a Turkish officer who had to retreat in a hurry.  All day and the next night we toiled up &amp; down the gully without stretchers no time to scarcely eat or rest just kept going all the while with our dying loads, the fire of snipers was awful they killed three chaps in front of me my escapes being miraculous.  Our lads went up these hills &amp; knolls like monkeys and literally drove the enemy back at the point of the bayonet the Turks made no stand until they were at the foot of the coveted hill then they counter attacked and rather strongly, we were supporting the wounded of the N.Z. &amp; the Gurkhas I cannot say too much for their brave ends, the Maoris are just the same, never a groan.  The heat and flies were intense and the dead Turks soon decomposed, we were only allowed one bottle of water for 24 hours, but I was lucky to find a dead Turk and I took his all, our men are knocked up but there is no rest until this battle is over, it is Hell and if we survive it what an experience to have been through.  During the previous night a whole army corp Kitchener landed in a fresh place with great success and are attacking  as I write, something has gone wrong however.</p>
<p>Sunday 7th Aug<br/>We had to go on, thank God we have proved ourselves, it took us so long, through no fault of ours, but every man has been a hero, we never know when our turn comes next it is fearful on the nerves.  The Col has turned up but our gallant little Major worked hard in conjunction with Capt Francki.  The Hill was captured again during the day thanks to the British reinforcements that kept arriving all day &amp; night.  The Austs are getting cut up fearfully.</p>
