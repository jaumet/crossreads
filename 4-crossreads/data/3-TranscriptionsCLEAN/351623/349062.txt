  
 began to think that Aussie was slipping back some. It was a good welcome after being away over 4 years to have things to eat with that. I would not give to a pig. So there is little wonder that the men called an hurried meeting & decided to march right out of it altogether, go over to Sydney on one of the Manly ferries. After they got to Sydney what their plan was seemed a bit hazy I think. But I can safely say the men would not have went to their homes, they would probably have went to Cricket ground or Victoria Barracks. Between 350 & 400 marched from the camp. Just before we got to the main gates they called a halt to wait & collect our kits. While we were waiting there Captain Carmichael came along & addressed us, & wanted the trouble stated to him. He spoke fair enough because he knew that the men were in the right. Anyhow he got the majority of the men to wait & not go any further till he went back to camp & inspected the conditions
