  
 28.8.15 through on the 'phone, but this morning we heard from Bde. H.Q. that the Connaughts bolted three or four times later in the night & the 3rd Bde. of Light Horse were sent to reinforce them & as no reports have come in on the 'phone we surmise the result of the attack was far from satisfactory.  The Lenster Regt. was condemned here by English officers as well as our own & we were hoping the Connaughts would do something brilliant to uphold the good name of the English Tommy, but I am sorry to say they appear worse in the eyes of everyone here now than they did before, especially as the Connaught's are practically all regular soldiers, even the Indians are not backward in condemning the English boys here & their Officers appear worse than the men.
