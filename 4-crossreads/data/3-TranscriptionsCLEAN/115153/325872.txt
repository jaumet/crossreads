  
 I happened to acquire a position in the orderly-room, which afforded me ample leave from the camp, which was run on very strict lines in reference to allowing much leave. As it was July and the holiday season at Weymouth which was a favourite seaside resort, there were always crowds of people about, and nearly all from other parts of the British Isles. There was a good promenade on the beach front and entertainments, mainly picture theatres and vaudeville shows. The places of interest were, the ruined castle which had a prominent position near the cliffs away at the end of the promenade, and the White Horse on a hill a few miles from the other end of the Promenade and right on the beach. I went with a party for a picnic to the ruined castle and while we were there we had a very interesting cruise around it, for it still revealed signs of how strongly it was built in order to repel any foe that might have attacked it in olden times. We did not visit the White Horse, but could see it plainly from the Promenade as it was in the form of white chalk bed on a green grassy hill sloping up from the sea. We were at Weymouth when our turn came to leave for Plymouth, the port from which, we were to sail to Australia. The night before, we were warned to be ready to move off, and in the morning we marched to the station where we embarked on the train to Plymouth, which place, we arrived at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  We detrained and were organised into special groups and then filed up the gangway on to boat which was called the "Pakeha". Not long after we were on board we were issued with our hammocks and eating utensils and allotted to our respective mess tables and sleeping places. The M.O. of the ship sought volunteers for the Hospital staff, and as a result I got an easy task to last me the whole of the voyage. In doing this work such as this one gets lots of privileges such as better food and sleeping accommodation than the ordinary soldier gets. After lying in the stream for two days we steamed out to the ocean on our long journey home, and for the first 2 weeks we wore our lifebelts continuously owing to the presence of submarines
