Now the last few nights have been very moon-light, &amp; in all probability, the Turks have noted the course &amp; &ndash; if they intended attacking, they would first secure us, to prevent our giving the alarm.</p>
<p>I propose, that we cut through the scrub on our right, and take up a high position overlooking a track, which in all probability they would take coming down."  My suggestion was taken, &amp; we crept along the bank till we struck what appeared to be a track, I gave up my rifle to the sergeant, while I crept up this, to see if it offered a chance of progress, the scrub was so thick that a rifle would be too slow to get into position &ndash; This seemed to have been a track once, but was apparently abandoned to foxes.  I thought we could get along it though, &amp; came back to report.  Up we crept, 4 of us &ndash; the sergeant &amp; I in front, the other 2 behind  Sometimes there was only room for one to push through on our hands &amp; knees &ndash; at others just force our way through holly &amp; fuzzy bushes.  We had not gone far, before it got very dark.</p>
