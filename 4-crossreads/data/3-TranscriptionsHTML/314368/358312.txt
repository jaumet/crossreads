<p>on board is the Y.M.C.A. This association supplies us with reading and if needed writing matter and materials.</p>
<p>I do a good deal of reading, looking at the ocean is interesting for a while, but a chap soon gets tired of it. I have seen very little animal life since coming on board, with the exeption of a few flying fish have seen no denizens of the sea, of any kind.  News to a certain extent is restricted, as everything passes through the censors hands so I shall wait till later to send you along a longer letter Ida, I may not write this time to the boys so you can let them know how I am when you write.<br/>My permanent address will be.<br/>Pte. G.T.E- No 1647 2nd Rfts.  54 Battn<br/>Intermediate Base. Depot. Egypt.<br/>All letters sent to this address will be forwarded on to me.</p>
<p>Hoping you are all well at  home<br/>With fond love.<br/>Your Loving Brother<br/>Gordon</p>
