<p>The weather which has been quite remarkable the last 5 weeks seems to have broken as far as the sun is concerned, for both yesterday &amp; today have been quite dull but one good thing the temperature has risen &amp; its nothing near as cold as usually.</p>
<p>26th.  Went down to Plymouth last night &amp; had the usual look round but things were very quiet &amp; uneventful.<br/>Had another rotten route march this morning, they are making things a welter properly now &amp; are trying to be regimental.  I can see some fun if they insist on carrying it out, for at this stage of the business no one is inclined for any silly stunts &amp; the whole Camp fed up with the delay of ships for Australia, just think scores of us have been hung up here for 6 weeks &amp; no one seems to know when we are going to get away.  I would far rather have been left at Sutton Veney.  I am sure I was far more contented there than here, besides the saving of money.</p>
