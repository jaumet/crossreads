<p>For Brigadier it appears that&nbsp;WT station will take a long time to repair therefore if you do not require to hold the station for military purposes I agree that it should be abandoned will you give your own orders as you think fit but I think you will require a fairly large garrison at Herbertshohe and someone there to treat with the Governor. &nbsp;I am proposing to admiralty to return the whole of the troops in this vicinity until things have settled down here 0800</p>
