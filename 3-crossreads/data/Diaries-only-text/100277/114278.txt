the party had to carry A frames etc to the sap where the work is going on the trench is nearly full of water we have a pump working on her all men have great big "gum boots which reach nearly to their thighs. About 11 oclock I thought I would take a run down to the canteen get some stuff for the boys myself, so I borrowed one of the 3rd Battalion's mens coat, for each Batt. runs a canteen they wont serve other Batts you know, they are easily told by the colours on our tunics, each Bn. having a different color, so we swap coats now again when we are near one anothers canteens so as we can buy some things, well I put the borrowed tunic on, forgot to throw my box helmet over my shoulder
