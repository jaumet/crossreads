 17th Dec 1916 Dear Beatrice, 
 It is Sunday this morning my duty with other was to clean up the cook-house floors. 
 This proved a fairly easy matter as the floors were of concrete and we used buckets of water and hard brooms. 
 As far as jobs go for privates or sappers it was not too lead especially ok this time of the year when theres snow outside and warm ovens in the cook house 
 After yesterdays snow fall the cold of last night was so intense that theres ice almost everywhere this morning 
 The parade ground and all pathways and roads are now glazed with a thick covering of ice, upon which it is difficult to walk 
 Shallow waters of the marshes
