 My dear Mother, 
 I posted home a douzen post cards in an an envelope the otherday, but have not written since about nine days ago I think. The last letter I had from you was dated 26th Nov. but I believe another mail will be here in a day or two. I am still on the HQ job only now we are living at the YMCA &quot;Corner House&quot; and its not bad i can tell you. Its the nearest approach to being a civilian a person could possibly wish for over here. We have &nbsp;no parades - just go to the office in the morning - sit down and start work, and when knock off time comes just get up and walk home. Then we have beds to sleep in, niggers to make them and niggers to wait on us at table, and we have quite respectable civilised meals.
