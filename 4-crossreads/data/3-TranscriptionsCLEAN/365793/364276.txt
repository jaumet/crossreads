  
 damned upstart of an Officer gave me 3 days CB, & said he had let me down light  Talk about injustice, I felt like slathering him out  First they mess a mans papers up & he misses the boat home" & then they drag him up for practically nothing.  Just drew a quidlet & am now 26/- overdrawn. Drill & miserable sort of a day 
 27 On Physical drill this morning - pretty rough isn't it on a PU chap? Unable to trace packs. Senior MO says I can get an eye at Weymouth instead of returning to Harefield
