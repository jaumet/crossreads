B Squadron1st Regt A.L.H.3rd September 1916
My dear MotherIt is Sunday afternoon and we have just finished stables for the day so I might as well start a letter to you now.No more letters have come from you yet but on Thursday I got six "Guardians" some Stock & Station Journals and a "Dagetty's Review" so they must have discovered where I am in the paper office anyway.I also got a jolly nice letter from Dora and Stella and Mardie both wrote saying they had sent parcels, which the whole tent is keeping an eye open for but so far they have not arrived.Those shirts you sent me are jolly nice and I wear them always now: yesterday there were three shirts per troop given out from the war chest so we drew lots for them and I got one, a kahki cotton one, but swapped it away for a frannel as I have got your shirts and one of my frannels is worn out.Does not the war news look hopeful the last few days Romania in and Greece seems to be coming.6 Sept.I left this on Sunday afternoon and went to Church Parade and have not had time to finish it since. The Church Parade was the best one I have been to I
