  
 15.9.15 Wed 15th The Despatch rider came a cropper late yesterday afternoon, the horse he was riding has been hit 7 times before but only slightly & yesterday a bullet entered his chest & brought him down, the snipers were very busy & poured in a  volley as he fell but the rider managed to get off the road & into a sap without being hit, but he lost his despatches & decided to wait until dark to get them as the snipers were making the road too hot to get them in daylight; A party of 25 men & an Officer was sent from this Regt this morning as a body guard to Div Head Quarters  only men who have been here from the start & have not been away sick or wounded were sent. Capt Smith was the Officer in charge; &25 men of the 25th L.H. came here to replace them. Had another shower of rain between 3 & 4 oclock this morning but our 'bivy' turned the rain well a very fine day after 9 oclock when the clouds cleared.
