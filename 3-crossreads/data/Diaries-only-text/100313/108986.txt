7/12/17 Locre Bailleul, Hazebrouck
Rose at 6 a.m. and was agreeably surprised to find it a rather warm morning and no hardship. It was dark when Bunning and myself rode into Locre and there met Colonels Brazenor, Duggan, James and others. We embarked on a motor bus and drove off for Leulinghem near St. Omer to witness a demonstration with trench mortars. Our route lay through Strazelle, Hazebrouck. First we ran out through Bailleul where (being the first Friday in the month) there was a small procession of women and children carrying a banner into the Church. From here we ran out to Strazelle the country being bleak and there were not many troops about. Thence to Hazebrouck. Along the fields there are many root crops in silage heaps covered over with turfs. Hazebrouck is quite a good little town and we passed out through Ebblinghem and Renescure to Arques
