 Broadmeadow Camp Melbourne 3rd June 1915 
 Dear Mother, I have left Langwarrin, and as you will see have been sent to here. On Wednesday we had word to pack up &amp; go to Melbourne Barracks and I thought it was to get some pay &amp; leave, but no such luck. We were all bundled out to Broadmeadows Camp and I am as far off leave as ever. I do not know when we are going away, but it is rumoured that the 6th Reins 7th Battalion (to which I am attached in the meantime) are leaving about the 20th of the month &ndash; surely I will be able to get home before then. Next time you write address it to the 6th of the 7th, as of course they do not know me as the 2nd Reins of the 13th Batt here. 
 I think Dene wrote to me the other day, but addressed to Langwarrin, &amp; so I did not know where we were going from there I told a lad there to send it on home to "Dene Gully". If it comes back would you please send it on to me here? By the way, Mother I have not had any pay since landing in Melbourne (thanks to the Red Tape which rules the roost here) so if you have a couple of bob you do
