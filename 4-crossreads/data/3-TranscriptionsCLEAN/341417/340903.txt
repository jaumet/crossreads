Dear Miss King
Just a PC to let you know that I am still alive and well and come out in one piece after the Battle of Oct 4 which we took part in. It was awful in the trenches on account of the rain but nevertheless we gave Fritz all we could give and as you know we pushed him back up in Flanders.
That was the second fight we took part in the other being on the 28th Sept at Zillebecke Bund
On the 2nd of Oct before we hopped over Fritz counter attacked and we all stood up on the parapet and we simply mowed them down. They ran away from us something like on the other side of card but more of them.
[Refers to actions at Polygon Wood and Broodseinde.
