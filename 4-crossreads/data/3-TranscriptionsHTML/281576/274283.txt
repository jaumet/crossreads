<p>Wed. Sept. 26 (cont)  Ralph also got a piece in his leg, but it only grazed the skin.  He fixed up my leg &amp; also put a bandage on Westy.  As soon as things got a bit quiet I hobbled along to the D.S. on the Menin Road.  In the excitement I took the wrong turning &amp; wandered through the wood, where a lot of our big guns were.  Just as I was hit our barrage started.  It was a beauty, &amp; very quickly silenced Fritz's Guns.  On my way to the D.S. I met a couple of other chaps slightly wounded, &amp; we got aboard the first car we met &amp; went to the M.D.S. [Main Dressing Station]  Here I saw Sgt. Seymour &amp; Maj. North dressed my wound.  From here we went by motor lorry to the Can C.C.S.  Our crowd were at the D.R.S. [Divisional Rest Centre] opposite &amp; very soon came to see me.  Maj. Wooster, Mac, Brian Aspinall  &amp; a whole crowd of 'em.  Bill Gamble brought me Tobacco &amp; Cigarettes.<br/>IN HOSPITAL<br/>At the C.C.S. they gave us Porridge, Biscuits &amp; Cocoa.  Then we were put aboard the Hosp. Train &amp; brought to No 22. Gen. Hosp. Camieres  Here we changed our clothes &amp; had a Hot Bath, which was most refreshing.  I was very soon asleep, &amp; did not wake up till the Orderly brought round Break. on THURS. 27  <br/>Am in A 10 Ward.  It is a big marquee &amp; has 60 Beds.  It is an American Hospital &amp; the nurses &amp; staff look after us well.  We had Porridge, with plenty of milk, but no sugar, bread &amp; Butter &amp; Tea.  At 10 the Doctor came round.  He marked me for X Ray.  I went down after dinner, but they were too busy, so I'll have to wait till tomorrow.  After Tea the Yanks played Baseball.  It was quiet thrilling to watch.
