1 Oct, 1916RomaniThis morning we had to turn out of nice comfortable blankets at day light & pull down the tents - Its a good joke following in the tracks of the 1st Bdg and cleaning up their camps for them.  In an hour there was a great change in the look of the place, where the tents had been were bivvies of all sorts & descriptions, the boys are some class at rigging shelters now.  This afternoon we had to parade in front of General Chauvel who gave us a lecture & presented a DCM to a chap in the 7th.  Perce just came along & warned me for Gaurd, not a bad job considering we move off in the morning - I received a pretty decent lot of mail last night there was a letter from Bert dated 10 Sept so hes going pretty OK as yet
