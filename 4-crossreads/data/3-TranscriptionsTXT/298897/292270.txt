 not know as there was a large entry for the race &amp; it was a very severe race &amp; the times were good.  It proved a disappointment but it was no good kicking about it.  The brigade concert at night was a first class one &amp; was a fitting end to a good day. 
 Wednesday 26th April Very hot day, quite our hottest.  The night did not bring its usual cool change &amp; it turned out to be the hottest night I have yet experienced.  Had a very quite day. 
 Thursday 27th April General drill out on the desert, the officers brushing up their drill at our expense.  Inspection of camp during afternoon.  On guard for 24 hours commencing at 6 P.M.  My first shift 10 P.M till 2 A.M. &amp; two prisoners to watch, strafe the beggars, I won't be sorry when they are sentenced &amp; sent off. 
 Friday 28th April Still on guard &amp; feeling very tired as the weather is hot one of the worst guards I have yet done.  More mail in &amp; a letter from France, Will D. giving me our first authentic news of my late unit being in France.
