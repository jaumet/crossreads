<p>Am very sorry to hear poor Les has lost his place again. Oh well it won't be long before the shipping starts again. They are only waiting to smash the German fleet up. I don't think it will be too long before they come out now. Of coarse it will make things worse as there are sure to be some slip through. They will have to be yarded. That is where out chief danger lays. What is the use of looking for trouble wait until it comes. This will be the last letter you will get from me for some time. Will write from the first port. Excuse this short note Father but it is all bustle &amp; work now.<br/>I have lost twelve lbs in weight since arrival here will have to pull that up. Love &amp; best wishes to all.<br/>Your sincere  son  Clyde<br/>N.B. Havent heard from Bert or Les.<br/>Wrote but don't know if he received my letter.<br/>Clyde</p>
