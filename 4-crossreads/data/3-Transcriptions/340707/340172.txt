We breakfast on bread &amp; butter &amp; salt &amp; chocolat &amp; then I return home &amp; sleep to 2 pm.</p>
<p>I look up Capt Rouquerol &amp; find he cannot dine with me, this is fortunate as my fortune consists of 70 fr. &amp; this must last till goodness knows when.</p>
<p>Then I run across for Duke &amp; find that he has not been in his office &amp; is sick I profess my intention of seeing him at once &amp; the Colonel gives me a U.S car &amp; away I speed to find him.</p>
<p>He was simply exhausted &amp; we set out to buy for tonight's dinner 6 small veal cutlets cost 7 fr 50 &ndash; Sardines are 2.25 f a small tin a small cauliflower costs 3 fr. Unfortunately our guests do not arrive but send a little note We eat the dinner ourselves &amp; then I visit Mde Brisson &amp; have some difficulty in finding the place but it is only within &frac14; hr walk from my home.</p>
