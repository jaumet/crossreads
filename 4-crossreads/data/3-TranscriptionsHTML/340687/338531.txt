<p>August, 1917. Wednesday 15<br/>Fine day and some showers On first parade &amp; guard at 9 with 4 men. 5 prisoners. Rotten guard usual routine. In aftn. S.M. butted in as prisoners were playing cards and promised us awkward squad and later reprimand by Major me. Eventually nothing occurred. I was quite right. Ticklish time and didn't get much sleep at night. Few showers.</p>
