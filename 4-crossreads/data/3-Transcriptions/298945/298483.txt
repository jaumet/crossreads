<p>Friday 27th Sept.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning we left Tincourt by train, &amp; this morning I am writing my diary at a table in front of an open window which faces the hilly part of the village of Etoile. This is the village where we halted for a day on our way up to the offensive, and, arriving a little before the others because I was part of the baggage guard, I was lucky enough to <strike>find</strike> be able to hire a room at 5 francs a week. There is a sheeted, &amp; eiderdowned double bed &amp; other little luxuries which make the room a veritable paradise after the horror of the Somme country.</p>
<p>Being foolish enough to let the cat out of the bag to Garland (the W.O.) I am now faced with the possibility of an order from the Colonel prohibiting <strike>the</strike> sleeping in private rooms. I must try to circumvent such an order, I think, at least the room would be worth the money if</p>
