<p>&amp;we intended to move things early next day to get aboard if possible. to our surprise the Trawler who had left in the morning came back without taking off any of the cases sent over. Things looked blue for us to get ours away in view of this. We concocted a scheme to try &amp; work ours in on the same boat &amp; to move them early in the morning. I took first watch till about 1 am &amp; instructed Eltham to wake me at 3.45. This he did &amp; we bustled all our stores aboard before any one was moving.</p>
<p>Monday 6th Dec<br/>About 7 am our Trawler was off and we settled down to the trip. Called at</p>
