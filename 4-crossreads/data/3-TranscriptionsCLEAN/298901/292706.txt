stuff from the other depot was partly successful here, the Major in charge proving very obstinate until I stood up to him.  It is often the case with these infernal men, they treat an Australian with a consideration refused to one of their own, simply because we speak to them more as equals & are not backward in arguing with them if necessary.Passing through Amiens the damage was more noticeable than before, as each day it is shelled.  One street was almost destroyed as a fire occurred & several houses were dynamited to check it.  Arrived back at Daours about 7 feeling very tired & turned in about 10 P.M.  Did something over 60 miles in the car but saw nothing of note on the roads bar a few Yankees, their stirrups being of the pocket cowboy style & several French Howitzer guns mounted on Rubber wheels drawn by motor lorries.  It is noticeable that a lot of their artillery is moved in this fashion, the lighter guns going right inside the lorry.
