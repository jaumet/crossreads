23-5-1620 native women & children, one very old man & one young man whome we brought back with us.  the women refused to come in with us & were left out there also the old man;  We burnt all the Bedouin homes we came across & found quite an assortment of military equipment in most of them;  At 10 oclock this morning we found 6 sheep with no owner, so they were brought back to camp by Cpl Morrice & 2 men;
It was 6.30 when we got back to camp with empty water bottles & horses just about fagged out as they were kept going pretty constant all day in the soft sand, & they had no water all the time they were out;  We found a mail awaiting us when we returned which cheered us up a bit;  We saw no Turks but the 5th L.H. caught sight of some & managed to capture one of them but there was no fighting;  the Turks always retire when troops from here go out to meet themHad some long range signalling today
