27/7/17 AveluyA fine warm day.  Specialist training all the morning.  General Paton was here and talked mostly about nothing.  Leaving about 10 officers over I gave them a little tactical exercise to do including making a field sketch and placing outposts in position for an outpost company.  Bill May was in to lunch and Stockfeld to dinner.  At 1.30 pm marched out on a route march via Bouzincourt to Martinsart and home.  Halted just outside the former and marched through in style with band playing and troops at attention.  Coming through the wood at Martinsart we found plenty of Huns hard at work on forestry.  Our water bottle discipline needs improving muchly.  a comic sight &ndash; a giant Scott marching along a diminutive little Fritz carrying a score or so of water bottles.  Our chaps have a great sense of humour and see the funny side of everything that occurs.  Formal mess without the band and the King's health duly drunk proposed by me supported by Thewlis.
