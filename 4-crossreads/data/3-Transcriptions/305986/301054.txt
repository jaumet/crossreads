<p>14.1.17 In billet in Country been here two days, have been feeling rather crook on it the last two days, went and saw the quack this morning and have got a day off. I had to go back to Albert on the 11th to get some gear, gee I was cold, I went in a limber and as limbers have no springs, it was a rough ride, we were just nearing Albert when it started to snow and it kept at it up till we got home again. The old Padre here is starting a band and he's as pleased as Punch about it too.</p>
