3/11/17 Florence
had a good journey to Florence having for company three Italian officers who are very ceremonious in their greeting of each other. Got into Florence about midnight, and no one meeting me, felt very strange and solitary. However spied a fly and it ran me up to my hotel, the Grand Hotel Baglioni, which is not far from the centre of the town and the station. They were full up but my room having been reserved ensured me getting in. Apparently a good big and comfortable place. In most of these hotels there is someone who speaks English and everywhere French is well known. Today has been an exceedingly pleasant mild sunny day and tonight is very agreeable. A good bedroom with a bathroom opened off from it and a double bed.
