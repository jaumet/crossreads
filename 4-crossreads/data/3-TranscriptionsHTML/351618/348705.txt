<p>Monday 13th Dec<br/>It was overcast to-day &amp; things were a bit quiet. There was a little shelling late in the afternoon &amp; "Beachy" was active till well on in the evening. I went down to the Lowland Battery and had tea with QM McLaren &amp; SM [Sergeant Major] Burrows. I found SM Scarrott of our Headquarters. He was supposed to have left for Egypt the previous evening with despatches but the boat did not go.</p>
