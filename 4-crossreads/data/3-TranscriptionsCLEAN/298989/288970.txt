30/1/16Sunday, all slept in until breakfast and afterwards lay about in the warm sun until dress for parade at 1030. Church parade at 1045. Padre Stewart, officers as well as the men wearing drill order web equipment. Very warm standing in the sun, the parade was a nice compact little square with the 23rd & 24th parties and the 40 of the 6th F Engineers we have attached.
Pioneers being reorganised and a special fatigue formed for permanent dirty work. Josiah Thomas of "D" Co (son of Australias postmaster General) is one of these men. Cowan our A.M.C Corporal is a champion runner having done his 10 miles in 58 minutes. Joe Slater is the champion 100 yard sprinter of Australia.
A good many small sand lizards running about and also some chameleons. King showed me an insect about 3 inches long whose color is exactly that of the small brushwood about. After lunch as President presided over a gathering of the men and officers and chose a Sports Committee. A boxing tourney to start at once  50 in prizes, and a big general sports meeting to be held next Sunday week. Spendlove hammering up boxes and other conveniences for the test - he is alright away from beer. Mitchell ruptured.
Some time after we reached camp here, two stragglers came slowly over the skyline laden with their kits. "Burke & Wills" they were dubbed at once. The pack tins the camels carry the water in are called fantassas. No water has arrived today and Q.M has had to go down to the railhead about it. We still have no ammunition here and tomorrow start trench digging.
