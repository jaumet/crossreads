<p>1916<br/>Oct 2nd   I have now been away one year &amp; six months of which has been in France   We are still at a Dr.S near Poperinghe, Belgium, after coming back from our first part in the Offensive 1916.<br/>Oct 9th.  The weather here is now very changeable &amp; every day is windy with an overcast sky.  However the days are not cold and we have had very little wet weather.  The trees are gradually losing their leaves and some changing in colour to real autumn tints.  All the crops have been gathered, the wheat stacked, hops bagged &amp; the flax stripped.  In fact the country is much the same as when we saw it first.  To-day I visited the local aerodrome &amp; had a good look at the planes &amp; had their business explained fully.  We are moving within a few days ostensibly to St Omer but after that our destination is obscure.</p>
