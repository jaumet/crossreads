I quite expected one from home but was disappointed - must wait a little longer. I'm most distressed at not hearing from or of J - yet. I have a great battle to keep myself from thinking the worse - suppose shall receive an explanation some day. Fortunately, we have plenty of work & not much time to waste on thinking. Dont worry about me because I'm very well and quite understood when we parted that I should have to cultivate plenty of patients. The weather has been much brighter lately, so have managed to go out
