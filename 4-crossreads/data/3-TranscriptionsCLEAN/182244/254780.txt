  
 :Anecdote: 
 Col Howse told me the following at Anzac, about himself. (October 3rd week. 1915) 
 A well known Country Medico & distinguished soldier, announced to his wife one evening as soon as the war broke out. 
 I have just received a wire my dear telling me I am wanted for the war. 
 When do you set out? 
 To night. Will you come to Sydney in the Car? 
 No. But when you reach Sydney see a Mental Specialist (Chisholm Ross.) tell him that you are an old Man with a wife & large family and ask him to confine you as temporarily insane in an hospital.
