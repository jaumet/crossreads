War takes its toll of bravest and best of men they sayAnd true it is for all our hopes were garneded in a dayThe colonel, major, adjutant, were shattered by a shell,As gentlemen they lived and as heroes all they fell.
Yes they got our brave old colonel still I guess he's marching onTo a greater path of glory just as such as he has wonAnd the boys who used to follow when the enemy defied,Will be prouder still to follow when they cross the great divide
