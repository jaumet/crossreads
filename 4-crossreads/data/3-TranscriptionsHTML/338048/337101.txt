<p>Saturday July 15th<br/>Another fine day and though for a part of the day in the Bay of Biscay sea was very calm.<br/>Lifebelts had to be worn all day (we had to keep them with us previously) and discomfort resulted.</p>
<p>Played a game of cards called "five hundred" with Pynor &amp; Frost and it took us about 6 hrs to finish it. Slept on deck again.</p>
<p>July 16th Sunday<br/>Real lovely day sea as calm as could be. We have had real marvellous weather during the trip and even Bay of Biscay becomes a millpond for us. Meeting of old Wesley Boys held in afternoon and photos taken of the group. Total number present 13 including 3 offices (1 man absent).</p>
<p>Large number of whales seen in all directions. Evening very light. I was reading in the natural light at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>July 17 Monday<br/>Woke about <strike>3.30</strike> 4 a.m. owing to the "Laconia" blowing siren and wondered what was the matter. It was raining slightly &amp; therefore the air was misty, Laconia blew a <strike>serious</strike> series of blasts with about 1 minute interval several times until about 5.30 a.m. when she signalled us "If destroyer escort has not been sighted by 6 a.m. ships will make port independently keeping strict watch for destroyers which are in the vicinity" However just about 5.50 destroyers were just discernable and in about 9 minutes were abreast with us. There were four, one for each ship. Ours came close to us at a great speed and then signalled "What is course &amp; speed". Later "I will zig-zag ahead unless weather gets <strike>too</strike> thick in which case I will take position astern". She then went ahead &amp; has been zig-zag ahead of us except when weather was pretty thick &amp; she fell astern.</p>
<p>We are now separated from other ships the Warilda with her destroyer being the only one in sight. Good speed is being attained &amp; the old Medic has dropped behind. All day the little destroyer kept up its zig zaging &amp; we made good progress through what is supposed to be the dangerous area. Slept below</p>
