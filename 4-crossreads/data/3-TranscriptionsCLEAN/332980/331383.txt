where a large number of steamers could be seen passing both Ways, we kept the view of the Ocean for a long way & eventually arrived in Aberdeen on time 2.25 Pm, had a nice Luncheon at the The Red Cross Free Luncheon Rooms, then asked a Scotch Lad to pilot me up the Brae (Hill) to the Aston Hotel which I intended to make my quarters, It was only a few minutes walk & I soon was at the Hotel & up four flight's of stairs & introduced myself & registered my name & book a Bed, after a Wash & Brush Up I went out & had a shave & started on a Tour until Tea Time, The first Car I took was going out to the Bridge of Dee along Union Street which is the principal street in Glasgow Aberdeen, & then along Holburn St, for about 11/2 Miles passing through some beautiful House's built of Granite, of a Grey colour, as Aberdeen is Known as the Granite City, it is a beautiful Sight, as the Houses of 1 to 4 story's are built back from the Footpaths
