Wretched & ghastly fighting took place here for several days but all was in vain.  The casualties were frightfully heavy & shamefully cruel.  The line here was consolidated on the Rododendron Ridge.  And so all failed.  The trenches were made to look pretty, winter quarters were prepared & from then on we looked at the impregnable mountains  & admired the barren scenery until ordered to evacuate after having endured a few days of a most severe winter blizzard and all the miseries that cold can bring.
