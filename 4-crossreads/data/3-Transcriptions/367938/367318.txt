<p>issue this morning &ndash; which just saved our lives as it was very cold with a strong breeze blowing: dug out the regiment about 3.15 am, moonlight: in the support trenches the ledges &amp; holes are small (unable to make bigger ones as the hill gets too much cut about) &amp; the men getting out look like those big white bugs one sees in holes in green logs; just fit. &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
<p>I don't think I told you the way Bean the correspondent was saved the same morning &ndash; He was up on the Post &amp; nearly became a "has been" &ndash; A bomb was thrown by a Turk &amp; missing all trenches, rolled down the communication sap in front of him &amp; under two stretcher bearers carrying a man down. They noticed it &amp; promptly dropped the stretcher down as these bombs have good spreading effect. The body was blown in half &ndash; mostly over Bean &ndash;</p>
<p>The Post referred to is called in the official map the "Bloody Angle &ndash; &amp; it is nothing now but a dust heap on the top with Turks &amp; Australians continually digging saps through &amp; bombing one another. Day &amp; night the explosions are going on about 100 yards from our flank. Many men have had their hands &amp; arms blown off in</p>
