<p>stretcher.</p>
<p>All day receiving, dressing and loading cars for A.D.S.</p>
<p>The lads took the village Hermies in such a style as only they could &ndash; and they received their wounds as they always do.</p>
<p>Turned in about midnight last night and up early this morning.</p>
<p>Rations, 1 load to 14 men and bacon in proportion.  Rumours of all kinds around of big victories, of great prisoners and elation.</p>
<p>Three died on stretchers here yesterday, and to be buried today.</p>
<p>Today if I get the chance, I"ll read some of "Romeo and Juliet".</p>
<p>92<br/>In the Bapaume Cemetary, at the end of the main entry walk, behind the crucifix the Boche has a great semicircle of officers graves, graves of Majors, Capts. and Lieutenants, the ground over them is heavily hidden in trailed ivy, held in by a low wooden ledge, and each individual grave has its own separate headstone.  These are perfection of their kind:  about 3.4 high and 20" wide, thick dull grey stone, reasonably simple and the proportions in lettering and plan design finely wrought.</p>
<p>Each is different and glaringly so, different as the long terraces of houses and public buildings of Marseille.</p>
<p>93<br/>Yesterday morning left La [indecipherable] for an outpost in the fields.  Party, Capt. Lee, Billy, two others of squad, nice men, Finlay, Finnes, and two unknowns.  Cold afternoon &ndash; snow and blizzard.</p>
<p>94<br/>Yesterday confirmed the word that one of our squads leaving for the Batt. had been knocked.  The squad &ndash; Blaidem, Harry through the back the shell piece penetrating into the abdomen.  Max and Jack Batchker the other two, the 4, one I don"t know.</p>
<p>95<br/>This afternoon over to the chateau near Velu to grout from the 3rd Batt. canteen.  Managed cigarettes and [indecipherable] but nothing else about.</p>
<p>96<br/>Cliff brings word of a big mail for us with tomorrow"s rations.</p>
<p>97<br/>Some of the lighter side of our advance &ndash; of the Rabelaisian side.</p>
<p>In Bapaume &ndash; hanging from the window of one of the partially standing villas &ndash; a pair of women"s ---:  underneath "Australia will be there!"</p>
<p>Hanging from the half remaining iron bracket of an old estaminet"s sign, a chamber &ndash; and the estaminet renamed, "Chamber of Horrors", and on an old post in the middle of a wreck, an old civilian hat &ndash; "The one we"re all after".</p>
<p>And prisoners &ndash; the art of ratting them.  New tales as told of Frank:  Frank according now to tradition, on Monday "bought 20 Boches for 5 francs" and if his bag is the criteria, then he invested well.  Frank"s speciality is watches.</p>
<p>We were yarning last night, Bill and self.  Bill had just brought down a walker, and comparing notes of work during the after attack of Hermies.</p>
<p>I said something about one of our chaps wearing a Boche cap &ndash; and so losing his turn for dressing.  "I remember that chap!" says Bill &ndash; "Frank sighted his arm lying over the blanket and secretly sighted a wallet.  Frank dived at it &ndash; and "Chuck it, lad &ndash; you"re the third that"s been after that."</p>
<p>98<br/>Mail tonight &ndash; 3 letters and one from Times Book Club.  One from Mater, and Geoff and one Betty.  Will keep Mater"s only.</p>
<p>Times B.C. sends list of Beerbohm"s work and will send for "Yet Again", 5/-, Happy Hypocrite out of print.</p>
<p>Troops till late &ndash; after rum issue round a brazier yarning.  Capt. Lee leader and we spent a good night.</p>
<p>99   April 13<br/>13 in the post, the date the 13, and the day Friday, and my 13th month in France &ndash; and my 3rd stunt.</p>
<p>100<br/>No. 100 entry last year &ndash; a letter to Times B. Club, this time one ordering Beerbohm"s "Yet Again".</p>
