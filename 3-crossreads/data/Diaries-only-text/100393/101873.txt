Australian Corps. The advance continued right on to the end of the day. The situation was absolutely in our hands. Dead Germans were everywhere. Prisoners and wounded were continually passing through to our aid posts and back areas. Great numbers of guns of every description were captured. Large quantities of material, stores and ammunition were captured. The Germans were running as fast as they could. German machine gunners put up resistance in many places but were quickly dealt with in the "usual way," and their guns captured.
That day the German lines were penetrated a depth of eight miles.
When things had settled down a bit for the day and our positions consolated, the Germans began to shell which inflicted casualities. We must expect to have casualties in an attack. The Germans did not counter attack, they were too much shaken up.
That night things were fairly quiet. Except for German ?planes, which came over on their usual bombing stunts, nothing unusual happened.

Again the next morning at dawn the attack was renewed and advance continued. This, I think, was a greater surprise still for the Germans because he did not think us able to make another attack so soon after the big one of the previous day. Practically the same thing happened this day. Prisoners, guns of all calabre and material of every kind were captured. At dusk my battalion moved to the vicinity of Harbonnieres in reserve to 1st Australian Division and kept that position until next day.
10th Aug.
The attack was renewed
