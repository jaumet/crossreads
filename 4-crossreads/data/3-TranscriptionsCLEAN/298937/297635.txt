I am weaker constitutionally then when I arrived.  unless I could not stand nearly as much now as I could before the Peninsula days.  I hope I pull round in England.Left the wharf last night amid the shouts & cheers of a few yachting parties in the harbour.Anchored near the breakwater for the night just as the Havanford did when I was leaving for the Peninsula.  Swimming party went on last night but it was too dark for my short sight.It is still very hot & I am looking forward to a colder climate.
