<p>[Friday 11 August 1916]</p>
<p>Lot of men have been in to see me Bushies mostly -Sisters at very top here same Routine &amp; Tucker as in No 1-  This hospital was at Lemnos &amp; the Sisters all experienced.  They cursed the L.H. keeping them in Egypt- till this scrap came- now they are happy- got something to do.<br/>These are the DINKUM sisters.  No 3 General was the Hospital at Lemnos in all the mud etc &amp; no conveniences.<br/>Some more 1st LH Officers came in last night.  Knocked out by Camel ride after being wounded its hell in those Casolets.<br/>Poor Lt Ronny Macdonald killed yesterday 8 officers out of 1st LH.  [indecipherable]</p>
