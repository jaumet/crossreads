<p>30.9.17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>I am tired tonight &amp; I have just written a long letter to Mum so I'll answer your letters perhaps Tuesday or Wednesday. This is Bridge I cross many &amp; many a time when walking with my Salisbury Friends. I am enclosing a view of Bourenmouth too. I walked right along the Prom. But I did not walk up the Drive. There are peculiar Cliff Lifts at either end of the Prom &amp; I got to the top of the Cliffs in one of them. The Bathing Beach is on the farther side of the pier. I did not go on the Pier. I will do that next time D.V. It is the Prettiest place I've yet seen in England. I hope that you have quite recovered from your accident now. Well, Dad I can hardly keep awake. Regards to Otto &amp; my old Travelling Companions. How is the Garden &amp; the Orchard. Love to you all &amp; Ida, Wal &amp; the Kiddies.  From Harry.</p>
