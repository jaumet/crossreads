 1917 Mon 18th June I told my Hun hosts I knew nothing &amp; returned to the hold.   Foolishly I told the Captain what had occurred and half an hour later was dumfounded to see Rees and Campbell on the poop telling Willie all about the ship and her routes and Campbell was giving Willie a photo of the "Waitotara"!! 
 And Rees had previously cautioned me to be "very careful"! 
 "Little Willie" grinned maliciously at me and thanked me for "telling my friends the news". 
 As a direct result of this information the "Wolf" cruised on the Suva-Sydney track for a considerable time looking for another "Wairuna". 
 Fri. 22nd. The "Winslow" crew came aboard &ndash; a queer looking lot of Scowigian "lime-juicers".   At 11 am the vessel was towed out &amp; two ordinary bombs placed on board.
