MAY 1917
9 WEDNESDAY
A beautiful warm day. Cleaning
harness all day, but I got all
mine finished & wrote a few
letters. The 26th Battery played
H.Q rugby in evening & we
won by 26 - 5. Fritz doing
a bit of shelling all day.
The roumer about Russia
was without foundation
thank goodness, & we hear we
are pushing old Fritz back
everywhere. Got a letter from
mother to say Alan had
the Military Cross.
