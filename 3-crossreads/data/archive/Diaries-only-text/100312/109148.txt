and went to the Hotel Metropole. A splendid city and I was chagrined to find it necessary to leave at 8.30 in the morning. The city appears the best I have seen in Italy so far. The Cathedral is a most beautiful place built nearly entirely of marble pure white and a mass of graceful pinnacles, each of which has its statue, big or little according to its size. The whole effect is one of lightness and airiness. These plains and cities of Lombardy are rich and would be great booty places for an invader. This is the most populous town in Italy. After dinner went out to have a look round and also to have a look at the Cathedral by moonlight. Unfortunately there was no moon and a rising fog. In front of the Cathedral is a very busy train terminus and centre. The rapacity of Continental hotelkeepers is almost beyond belief.
