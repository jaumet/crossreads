<p>Friday 4th August<br/>2nd Anniversary of the war &amp; still going strong. My poor old mother must be worn out waiting for it to end.  The 3rd year should see the end however.  Altho' personally I cannot see the end.  It will be a glad day for all when it does come.  Spent the day lounging about it being rather cool &amp; I could not settle down to anything.  Our existence once more becoming monotonous &amp; as I am not working in the Hospital I seem to be out of things rather.  We pass sick through mostly getting a few wounded occasionally.</p>
<p>Saturday 5th August<br/>Orderly Sergeant.  Very little doing.  Had a visit from a friend in "Estairs" who rode out on horseback &amp; stayed to tea.  After tea went for a stroll &amp; in looking for a battalion found myself well up amongst it.  By chance we came on a battery firing alongside a house, the guns being screened with branches etc.  'Tis remarkable how the residents carry on their duties seemingly oblivious to danger.  Familiarity breeds contempt</p>
