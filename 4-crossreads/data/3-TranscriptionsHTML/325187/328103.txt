<p>[Wednesday 27 December 1916]</p>
<p>Wet last night but the sandy soil is not as bad as France-<br/>Quite a lot of shipping is going on here now,   We hope for better rations soon-<br/>Posted letters by Camel escort yesterday, hope they arrive.<br/>Hungry Armenians who have been working for the Turks come in all day- All Christians now!!! No doubt our success will help the Sheik of Mecca.<br/>We are bombed daily but High Explosives in sand do little damage except to Horses, &amp; a man is not supposed to have any here.<br/>I can hear a Turkish gramophone we captured playing Casino airs from the Ottoman City.  Oil sheets were the best Loot</p>
