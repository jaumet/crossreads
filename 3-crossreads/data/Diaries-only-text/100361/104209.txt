Sun. Feb. 17. 
Beards and I are on all day. Our "P.M." day we call it. Lovely day too. Just the sort of day to go for a Picnic with B.E. Got a Letter from Jacko. He informs me that Billy May got the Belgian Croix de Guerre. Good Luck to him.
Commenced Letter No 8 to B.E. Funny thing, I was looking thro? my diary this morning and find that I wrote last years No 8 on this date. 
A good number of the officers are away, so things are fairly quiet.
Mon. 18
Another Glorious day. The Gothar attempted to raid London yesterday but only one of ?em got thro? the barrage. 
Wasted the afternoon in going for classification and found it's not on till tomorrow.
Tues. 19
Went before old Von Hagan for classification and was told to carry on. Glorious weather, Carr came back from Leave.
Wed. 20
Bill Beard went to Tidworth to apply for a job on the Motor Transport. It was a 60 mile ride on a Bike and he was knocked up when he returned.
The new Housekeeper arrived last night. She is a much younger person that the last one. Bert, the Chef, returned from Leave.
I really ought to write some Letters, but there is nothing to write about.
