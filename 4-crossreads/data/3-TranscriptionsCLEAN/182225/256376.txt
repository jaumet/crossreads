 1916   THURSDAY 14   SEPT. 
 Fine but very cold in morning & evening. Out with the rangetaking ect class all day. Poss & self went up to Larkhill afterwards & I got a letter from father & also a draft of 25 from Uncle Richard. We went to the "Maple Leaf" pictures ect afterwards & they were not too bad. There was a football meeting of the 27 th  Battery in the evening but there was not much business done except electing officers for the Club.
