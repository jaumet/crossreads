<p>Sunday 13 February, 1916</p>
<p>Got fed up with camp so decided to walk to Ismalia to get a good feed. I covered 26 miles, 2/3 of which was desert, in 11 hours (some going).</p>
<p>Left camp 12 midday arrived at Ismalia about 3.30, left for home about 7 p.m. arrived&nbsp;at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>In town I met Harry Glover who&nbsp;is a 1<sup>st</sup> Lieut in the 2<sup>nd</sup> division artillery. I also met Bombadier Baselly &amp; his friend Ives from the Egmont for our last meeting see Monday Jan 3<sup>rd</sup> &#39;16) we had a good yarn &amp; something to eat in lieu of a drink, we were very pleased to see each other again &amp; he invited me on board Egmont.</p>
<p>The walk I did today is the stiffest I have ever tackled &amp; I feel quite proud of myself. I also met -----Robinson, a friend of Ken Hamiltons. It is a small world.</p>
