<p>19 &ndash; E deM<br/>(sgd)  J. H. O'Halloran  Major<br/>O.C. Troops  A68<br/>Colon, 3rd Sept 1917<br/>For my own part I did not believe the above as all the officers and nurses also the N.C.O.s were allowed leave ashore and I have found out since that the NZ. troops were allowed to land as the following will show which appeared in the Panama Journal of the 5th.<br/>I should be pleased if you will kindly make public the high appreciation of the N.Z. Government for the cordial reception accorded to the N.Z. Hospital ships on recent passages through he canal.<br/>This was sent by the Governor General of N.Z. Lord Liverpool  who had it sent through the British Minister. Why then could not the Australian Government have had an opportunity of thanking the Panama Government for the same thing by allowing the Australians ashore?  Something wrong somewhere.<br/>Are the NZ troops so much better behaved than the Australians that they should be allowed off and not us?<br/>Mules are used here instead of horses</p>
