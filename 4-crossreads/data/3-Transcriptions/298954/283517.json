<p>The compressed air was clearly audible hissing away in the torpedo tube not six feet from my bunk;  the torpedo-doors had been lowered (I heard the slight metallic clang as they touched the ship's sides) and the crew were now lying flat on deck.</p>
<p>I could see none of this through the bulkhead of course &ndash; but I could imagine it only too clearly.</p>
<p>In the hospital the two doctors stood under the blue lights, first-aid action packs on their shoulders.   They were staring fixedly through the door and &ndash; waiting.</p>

<p>Inwardly I was shivering all over and "Hail-Marys" were rushing through my head at a terrible rate but I was surprised to find myself under excellent control to all outward appearances.   I event managed to crack a joke with Wolfe.</p>
