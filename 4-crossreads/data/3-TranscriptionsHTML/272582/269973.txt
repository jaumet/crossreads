<p><u> Shirts, flannel, and Singlets, cotton.</u> <br/>228 of these articles have been drawn from A.O.D. and 150 pairs returned unserviceable to A.O.D. A double issue of these articles is authorised, therefore the number returned to A.O.D. unserviceable is more than it would be if each man had his full issue. In some cases, the shirts, flannel are not drawn, and in others, singlets are not required.<br/> <u>Jackets, Cardigan.</u>  <br/>44 have been drawn from A.O.D. and 26 returned unserviceable. 26 have been issued to replace those unserviceable, and 18 issued to reinforcements who have "marched in" not having one in their possession.<br/> <u>Laces, prs, leather.</u>  <br/>193 pairs have been drawn from A.O.D. (and all) to replace those rendered unserviceable.</p>
