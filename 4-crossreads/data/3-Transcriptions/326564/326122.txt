<p>could wish to see, I was riding in front with the driver &amp; we were going down a hill, I noticed a chap carrying a load just in front of us &amp; he looked round when he did I beckoned him to rush the car &amp; I would give him a hand on, just before we got opposite he makes a dash across the road but never noticed a motor byke that was tearing up the hill, he stepped fair into the bike, &amp; there was a loud crash &amp; both sides were sent spinning to the road &amp; the mans rifle clattered like tin on the stones, it happened right under my eyes &amp; I made sure the man was killed, I jumped out quick &amp;amp lively &amp; run over &amp; picked him up he was dazed &amp; weak but wonderful to say</p>
