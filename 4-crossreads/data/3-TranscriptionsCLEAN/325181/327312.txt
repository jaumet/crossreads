  
 9th  Charged in face of a murderous fire, took 3 lines of trenches. Losses very heavy - "Still it was a great victory" -  5 out of 8 of us (mates) left. 10th Had good quiet time on left flank. Digging & building hard. Picture us digging deeper & deeper into beautifully hard rocky clayey soil. Millions of flies buzzing round - Bullets zip-zipping above shrapnel bursting near our trenches & best of all near the X Turks X  Rather warm too. One man on each parapet is watching the enemies trenches for a chance of getting in a shot or noting where our shells fall. No wash yet & no shave. War supposed to be over in week - perhaps!
