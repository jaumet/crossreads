<p>Monday 16th Aug. 1915</p>
<p>Entrained at Zeitoun at 1-30 am for Alexandria.  Arrived latter place about 6 am.  Embarked at once on S/S "Saturnia".  Met Arthur Gray on board.  Had a long chat with him about home etc.  Left Alexandria about 7 pm.</p>
<p>The "Saturnia" is the dirtiest most stinking ship I have met in my experience.  Packed like sardines aboard (3500 troops about) the atmosphere in the mess decks below where we are supposed to sleep, is foetid &amp; suffocating.  The lavatories &amp; latrines are unapproachable, human excrement &amp; an indescribable mass of filth in the shape of decomposed meat, bread, straw &amp; other refuse floats around in rank pools of urine &amp; putrid water.  Little fresh water is available &amp; the food is disheartening both in quality &amp; quantity.  I have heard frequent complaints of bugs &amp; lice &amp; body vermin &amp; I am not surprised.  The ship is a disease breeder &amp; thank God our journey upon it will be short.</p>
<p>I sleep on deck where one has an opportunity of breathing the pure ozone.</p>

<p>Life belt parade at 3 pm.  Quite a parody of a show in itself.  I can imagine the state of affairs on the sound of an alarm.  Hell would then be let loose &amp; mad riot reign supreme.  There are two battalions &amp; several "details" aboard.  Life belts are short &amp; the boats are not "efficient" by any means.  Inoculated for Cholera 4 pm..</p>
