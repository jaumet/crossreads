<p>Bayoud<br/>Thur 25 Jan<br/>Last night went on gaurd.  Col came home late roaring a treat &amp; overheard him say  that we were to shift.  To day things moved some.  Men have already left for Hassaniya &amp; we are to move tomorrow morning.  A Reg of Yeomanry &amp; 3 sects Camel corps are releiving us, twice as many men to do the work as we have.</p>
