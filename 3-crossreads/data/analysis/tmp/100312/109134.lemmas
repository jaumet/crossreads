 1/11/17 Napl After dinner went up to the Via Roma by train and found the street full of a crowd walk up and down . Mani of the shop were open . The chief Mecca of the promenad was a big arcad in which are mani cafe and good shop . There was also a string band play and peopl of the better sort evid put in most of their time walk up and down . The beggar are dread . Two poor littl boy about 6 ? one crouch asleep against the wall on the pavement , the other , blind , sit silent with his poor littl sightless eye and small face turn up toward Heaven . In out of the way place round corner and up side street sit these poor devil of all age clamour for alm . The inhabit quarrel a lot among themselv and exchang blow with stick and fist accompani by a great deal of tongu thrash ? just like the Gyppi !
