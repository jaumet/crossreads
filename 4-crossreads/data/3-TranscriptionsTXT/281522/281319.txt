7/6/17 Bouzincourtfield firing course which carried us right up to Mouquet Farm now an innocent looking little debris heap covered with grass. We found a skull in a shell hole and several bodies of dead Germans still mouldering and unburied after nearly a year. The new chums gazed on these with fascination. After lunch a heavy shower wet most of us and not very many elected to remain for a swim. Passing the Corps School met Col. Fitzgerald and stayed there for the afternoon looking round. A fine organization and highly comfortable. Word through that Messines ridge is taken and 6000 prisoners. Gave little Christian her doll and she was delighted. At the Regimental office had a long talk with Madame and some of her lady friends about the war and things in general, getting all the local gossip. Am looking forward to my permission to Paris and hope that the doings up North won't dislocate arrangements.
