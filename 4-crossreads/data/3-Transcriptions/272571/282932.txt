<p>July 12th<br/>Intended to have a sail up the River Nile with M. but much to our disappointment we could not get a boat to hire so we decided to go out to Heliopolis.<br/>We had a walk round this beautiful place which is built out in the desert.<br/>Returning to the city we had tea in Groppi's and then drove home in a "gharry".</p>
