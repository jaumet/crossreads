  
 September, 1915 Wednesday 22 Much cooler at night now & days shorter, am trying to read a bit of Military Law etc: but have an ex-actor in my room a Comedian with a Banjo -  who does not consider the serious side of our job. He is an Officer of sorts.  Sorry I was not sent to England at first when wounded, but did not anticipate being here so long.
