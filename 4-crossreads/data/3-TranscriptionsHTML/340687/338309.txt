<p>January, 1917. Friday 5<br/>Rained in morning fine in afternoon but cold evening with moon and later misty rain. Stayed in bed all morning and got up about 2 p.m. and on to job taking ropes for windlasses. Our working party didn't come so we deepened some more holes and knocked off at 10.30. Fritz's aeroplane manoeuvring above and apparently a Rumpler. [indecipherable] came back early unwell. Ingram home at 12. Usual shelling. Planes active in afternoon and balloons up Mueller back &amp; Dowling to return. We are staying in with Division but Army Corps may go out soon.</p>
