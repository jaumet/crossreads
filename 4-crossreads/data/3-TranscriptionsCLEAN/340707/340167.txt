Guns are fired near Champ de Mars but so far few people are stirring so we attend concert in Theatre in Champs Elysee a beautifully furnished place with a roof of hidden light which illuminated the frescoes & the building but which was itself invisible. 
 After performance we visited Boulevards. Crowds have now arrived but beyond trying to [indecipherable] or forming a chain across the street & enveloping people & then romping round them in a circle there is little excitement. We enter cafe Grand & beyond a little larger & noisier crowd it is the same. 
 We descend to Taverne Olympia & there matters are livelier. Everyone dances with anyone & place is a revel of victory nest & return to Boulevards. Processions are formed & in one place road has been torn up & every vehicle stopping owing to difficulty is attacked by crowds. Further along dancing is common. 
 Altogether considering the French temperament it is a mild display but perhaps the long time since cessation of hostilities has somewhat damped enthousiasm or perhaps I shall see more on the night when peace is signed ie Tuesday, Thursday & later on it is fixed for Friday.
