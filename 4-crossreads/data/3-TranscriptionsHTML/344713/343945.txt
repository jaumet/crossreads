<p>Thurs. April. 12th: -<br/>"Fritz" enfilading road with small artillery &amp; caught a few of our fellows lining up to a stew dixie. Tant &amp; Hall W.</p>
<p>Fr. April. 13th: -<br/>Moved back to sunken road behind village early this morning.<br/>Bn. moved their posts forward about 1000 yds tonight &amp; had the job of wiring the 'phone up through the village.</p>
<p>Sat. April. 14th: -<br/>Moved with Coy Hqrs to Sunken road on our left of Demicourt tonight.</p>
<p>Sun. April. 15th: -<br/>Early this morning "Fritz" put over a bombardment on village &amp; outposts &amp; at daybreak began an attack extending right around to the division on our left flank.<br/>He took a couple of our posts prisoners but only after they gave him a lot of losses &amp; after being driven on to keep up their attack by their officers. They had to at last get their "Flamenwerfers" into action.<br/>Hard luck we have absolutely no artillery supporting us for we had "Jerry" in the open coming in packs like football teams.<br/>After suffering great losses from M.G. &amp; rifle fire he "gave up the ghost" &amp; his stretcher-bearers were busy all day under the White flag getting the remnents worth collecting in.<br/>The dead around our outposts</p>
