  
 Well my dearest sister if anything happens to me "not that the nerve has failed me or that I anticipate trouble", but one cant go on for ever, always remember that I tried to do my work to the best of my ability & for any past misdeeds & riotous living I hope the Lord will pardon me. A soldiers life is hard & one lives a strenuous life when the opportunity presents itself. I am so sorry about Owen but dont worry prisoners of war dont get such a rough time as the "shrieking press" states. He will no doubt come well under Prussian
