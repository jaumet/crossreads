The weather has improved and we are enjoying some nice fine days and some beautiful white frosts They are real stingers, and my hands are still so cold and helpless that I can hardly write, although it is nearly 11 A.M. I can see trouble ahead this winter. There are rumours afloat that we are moving again shortly, this time somewhere up into Somerset. The rumour may be true, I cannot say. We will not be any better off than we are here, and we can not be any worse, Certainly we will see a little fresh country, and that will be something for here there is nothing to see, and nowhere to go, and life in the camp, is too monotonous for anything.
I wrote a letter to Harry some time ago, but received your letter telling me that he might be leaving in Sys. I fancy it said as I did not post it as I have been expecting to hear from him at any time, so far I have not heard and still have the letter here unposted have received one letter and one Sydney mail since I came here. They were sent along by Mrs. H. I meant to tell you long ago not to bother sending papers for we seldom get them. I have not received one quarter of the Papers sent me. I fancy they go to Headqrs and then are sent out to Hospitals etc. some are sent to the front but insufficient Transport facilities sometimes stop delivery and only a few get through must stop now with much love to all from your loving son Chas.
I think I told you that I had a letter from Sister Nell. She is at Le Hospital 117 Auxiliarre Les Andelys. F.
