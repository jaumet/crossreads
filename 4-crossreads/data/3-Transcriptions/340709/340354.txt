<p>27<br/>weird effect. The light at sea remained visible till about 9 o'clock after which it disappeared. As we have extinguished both the leading lights of the port it is unlikely that any vessel would attempt to enter till daylight. I telephoned t l that effect to the Major &amp; turned in. I awoke at daylight but nothing was in sight. Nevertheless, the Military officers had decided to take no chances; their men were in the trenches at 5 o'clock &amp; a strong guard was posted over the stores. These were withdrawn at about 6.30. So ended our first scare. By the bye today is my birthday but I can receive no greetings in this out of the way place. This afternoon I went for a trip in the "Lili" which has now been thoroughly overhauled. She behaved very well &amp; in future will be our "flagship".<br/>Thurs 8th : Today we went to Karl Hafen, an inlet on the Western shore, in the "Lili". She is a brute; broke down about half a dozen times, generally just as we were in uncomfortable proximity to a shoal. A good deal of excitement was caused at one island visited by us; the natives rushed hither &amp; thither evidently in great trepidation. Some climbed cocoanut trees, others ran behind bushes &amp; into the plantations. The natives have a way of climbing the trees peculiarly their own. First a small length of rope is fastened to their feet, holding them about 9 or 10 inches apart. They then place their hands around the trunk of the tree &amp; press against it with their feet. Thus they mount to the top much in the manner of the monkey-on-a-stick of our childhood's days. They generally carry a large knife with them which they use to lop off the cocoanuts and branches.
