4/4/16.
At Marseilles docks at 7 A.M. Was out at dawn watching for a sight of France.
Got quite a thrill when two submarines rose to the surface about half a mile away, till I saw that they were flying the French Flag. A very busy port this;
the docking space is very conjested. Saw and enormous four funnelled Hospital ship. the "La France". Four, ridiculously small tugs swung our ship into dock; on the end of the dock sat a french soldier catching small fish like sardines. Landed at 1 P.M. and marched through the streets to the railway siding. The French people seem elated to see us. Entrained immediately and I got into a first class compartment, it seemed luxurious after travelling in trucks. Left for Northern France at 2 P.M.
