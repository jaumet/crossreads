January 1918& had afternoon tea at the Casino San Stefano.  It is a fine place with a covered in garden & quite a popular resort on a Sunday.  The orchestra give  a concert & the music is splendid.  It is right on the sea shore & is quite charming.  Must be glorious in the summer time.  The worst part of the trip to Alexandria is the coming back on the midnight horror.  It takes about 7 or 8 hours to do the 120 miles & there are generally a fair number of passengers, only officers are allowed to travel first class so it is impossible to get a comfortable seat.On the 26th I went to the Races at Heliopolis.  Had  a good afternoons sport & managed to pay my expenses with a few piastres to the good.  On Sunday I went out to dinner to Mrs Briggs.  We had a great feed, with Yorkshire pudding first I have had since I left home.
