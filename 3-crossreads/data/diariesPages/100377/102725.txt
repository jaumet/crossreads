Got up at 6.30 very sleepy. Got ready for moving off to Winchester. Moved off at 9.30 with one kitbag for Station. Very hot march, and was glad to arrive at Amesbury. Left Amesbury and proceeded down South. Pretty scenery down that way. Saw Southampton in distance when we came in round for the line to Winchester. Saw large 4 funnel ship at wharf. Arrived Winchester at 2 oclock. Marched through city had a long march about 5 miles I think, and hot dirty too. Our camp is last on the list from Winchester. This camp is not as good as Amesbury. Very tired glad to get a sleep. Wrote to Millie Beatrice.
