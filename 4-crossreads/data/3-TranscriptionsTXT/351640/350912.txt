 been hit at Galipoli, though not seriously.  He is probably back in the fighting zone before now. 
 On opening the papers, the first matter that met my eyes was picture of General Bridges midst a number of his officers and men, the picture is a very good one.   R.I.P.  Germans as employees appear to be having somewhat of a bad time in N. S. Wales.   I note that Clarence Bridge is putting up for a seat as an alderman.  Wonder did he win?   That Herbert Wood is t6o be nominated for the Armidale seat, vacant by the death of Col. Braund.  Did he get in?   That bounteous rains have fallen over the whole of N. S. Wales.  Good. 
 Did you get any of the surcharged postage stamps from New Guinea?  A Lieut Moor was court martialed in connecton with their sale.   And Beeby has joined the ranks of the Liberals.  Such is the game of politics as she is played by some people.   Legge as successor to Bridges has much leeway to make up, as a teacher he has been all right but as a soldier he has not inspired respect.  Let us hope that he may do all right, he was in the 4th, with me long ago. 
 I have looked through all the papers.   You are liberally supplied with war news of all kinds, ad when the daily budget is added to by the illustrated journals at the end of the week you are better informed than most people in this part of the world, when chance offers tome I look through the Graphic and such like publications, but I am kept close at work in my present show else it would not run smoothly, and I am very desirous to make it a success because it was not believed to be possible to run it smoothly, however it is coming to be recognised that the view taken officially and by outsiders was incorrect. 
 I do not think that I wrote that when the 131 men started for Australia yesterday morning, were on board the train and I was leaving in the motor with Colonel Barrett, a cheer was sent up from the carriages in my honour, not one but three, it was very good of the men to recognise my kindness to them.  Those present were taken by surprise and so was yours truly. &nbsp; However it will reach to the ears of the General and others and will tend to show them that my reign here is being effective, I am very anxious to make good in this command to set at naught the months of suffering that fell to my lot while I was with that fellow Martin.  I shall get even with him yet.  He did me great wrong.  Yesterday morning I was talking with General Ford, he told me that if Martin dared to make a bad report about me he would not allow it to go through the office.  That is satisfactory and will serve to protect me from an incompetent creature, who under the guise of being my senior officer might be 
 [Colonel, later Major General, James Gordon Legge CMG CB, 1863-1947, school teacher, barrister and army chief of staff, commanded the 1st Australian Division on 24 June 1915 after the death of General Bridges. He was transferred to command the 2nd Australian Division on 26 July 1915, and served with them at Gallipoli. He became ill in October 1915 and did not rejoin the division until after the evacuation from the peninsula. He later served in France before returning to Australia in 1917.]
