<p>Sighted Arab dhow (small sailing ship) in distance on Starboard bow at 2.15 pm.  Had pleasure of seeing it through telescope; quite a treat for we have not seen either land or a boat since leaving Australian shores.  Passed Cape Guardifui 5.15 pm just visible on port bow; very hazy.  Weather getting cooler &amp; days shorter.  Very bad head-ache today.  At noon we had travelled 6550 leaving 1746 to go.</p>
