<p>28.11-15. First Sunday in Advent. 2-15 p.m. Jerome has just brought to me from Gezeirah, a bundle of letters which went to Lemnos and have come back. I must read them.</p>
<p>One from Sir Thomas Hughes. If you see him please ask him to drop Springthorpe as he is on the <strike>right</strike> wrong track. Ramsay Smith &amp; Barrett, tell him from me, did the best work of any men in Egypt, while Springthorpe and other trippers were wasting precious moments and abusing those who were spending every moment getting ready for the emergency which came, like a thunderclap, on the 25th &amp; 26th of April. I shall write to the gallant knight myself.<br/>A letter is finished to him so no need for you to bother. I am very sorry that he took a hand in the press.</p>
<p>One from Ivy Macdonald too. I will receive reply in due course. Another from Nurse Abel, who if her projects have been carried out is, before this date, in England. Those from Mollie bears heading "Moss Vale 12th Septbr. 1915" and 19th of same month. From "219 Macquarie St." the 11th 15th and 20th Septbr. Last from Pat Watt.<br/>Joseph dear yours was 11th Septbr.:&ndash;</p>
<p>Jim Roach told me in his letter about the man he met at Sargeants. I am pleased to think that all the men would do anything for me. I shall answer the letter from Pat Watt at an early date. You have not to pay the rates or other accounts for the Shirley Road property, Walker must do that. Ted wrote to tell me that a brother to Jimmy had arrived. My acknowledgments must have gone forward congratulating them upon the new arrival and wishing him good luck. Mrs. Norrie has written to me. I sent her word about Ted. when I returned from Anzac. Let us pray that old Parsons does the correct thing. Glad that you had quite shaken off your cold. All other matters have been answered in earlier letters to you.</p>
<p>[Sir Thomas Hughes MLC (1863-1930), solicitor, politician, and first Lord Mayor of Sydney. His sons Geoffrey and Roger served in WW1; Roger Hughes was killed in action in 1916.].</p>
