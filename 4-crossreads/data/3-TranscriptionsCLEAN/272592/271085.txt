  
 The following is a parody" on "Sing me to Sleep" & is a great favorite among the boys 
 Sing me to sleep, the bullets fall Let me forget the war & all Damp is my dugout cold is my feet Nothing but biscuits & bully to eat 
 Far far from Pozeries I want to be Where German snipers can't pot at me Think of me crouching where the worms creep Waiting for shrapnel to sing me to sleep 
  Refrain  
 Sing me to sleep where bombs explode And shrapnel shells are &agrave; la mode Or the sand bags  in front of me  behind me you'll find Corpse's in front of you corpses behind 
 Refrain
