Sunday 13 February, 1916
Got fed up with camp so decided to walk to Ismalia to get a good feed. I covered 26 miles, 2/3 of which was desert, in 11 hours (some going).
Left camp 12 midday arrived at Ismalia about 3.30, left for home about 7 p.m. arrived at 11 p.m.
In town I met Harry Glover who is a 1st Lieut in the 2nd division artillery. I also met Bombadier Baselly & his friend Ives from the Egmont for our last meeting see Monday Jan 3rd '16) we had a good yarn & something to eat in lieu of a drink, we were very pleased to see each other again & he invited me on board Egmont.
The walk I did today is the stiffest I have ever tackled & I feel quite proud of myself. I also met -----Robinson, a friend of Ken Hamiltons. It is a small world.
