EXTRACTS from Soliloquies of a SubalternSomewhere in FranceBy Eric Thirkell Cooper
(1)"The Contemptible Army"(Humbly dedicated to H.I.M. the German Emperor.)
No over-medalled Army ours,To plunder, rape or loot;Or call upon Celestial PowersAs partners, while we shoot
No little children dread our name;For us no women pale;And undefended towns aflameMark only "Culture's" trail.
Perhaps our knighthood hasn't shone,Whilst churches burn and fall;We're just content to carry onAs ordered - that is all.
