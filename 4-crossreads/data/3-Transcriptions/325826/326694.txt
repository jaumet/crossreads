<p>4.  Gwen is educating me up to Rudyard Kipling, she often reads it aloud to our little party.  I told you I think that we had added to our party a Mr Leckie.  We all do French together too, take it in turns to read a paragraph &amp; then translate it.  Gwen's accent is good &amp; she corrects us &amp; does the general over-seeing.  So you see what a profitable time we are having.<br/>Oh I haven't said anything about Freemantle or Perth, but there isn't anything much to say because I was distinctly disappointed in them &amp; we only had a short time in which to look round.  Also it was a broiling day, which under ordinary circumstances would have been tolerable but coming from the cold of the boat trip &amp; arrayed in warm clothes it was rather roasty.  It felt just like coming home to get back on the "Malwa" &amp; I feel as if I wanted to smile at every one of the stewards &amp; just yell at the top of my voice only I preserved my dignity &amp; didn't do either.  Instead I went straight to my cabin to get into something cool &amp; was so delighted to find a wire there from "me daddy."  I wonder did you get mine, I hope so.</p>
