  
 an appreciable one, being the last one of my holiday. At 6 oclock I returned to London, & obtained a ticket for Shanghai at the Drury Lane Theatre. The play was splendid one, the best I have seen for a long time. The music was devine, especially a song called oHome, which one of the Leading Artists sang - 7 encores altogether. Old Australian favourites took the leading roles - Dorothy Brunton & Ivy Shilling. They received a great reception from the Australians, who gave them the "Coo-ee" in the old Aussie style. After the theatre I made my way to the War Chest & had supper.  I stop here the night, so as to be handy for the train in the morning. 
 At 7 a.m. the following day, I report at Victoria Station & catch the train for Folkstone, arriving there about 10 oclock    At 3 p.m. we embark & have a much more pleasant trip across the Channel that the previous one, arriving at Boulogne about 6 oclock. The next item, if that march up that cursed hill to the Rest Camp.  Here we obtain tea -  bread & jam ,  rather a contrast to my tea the previous night.   Reveille next morning at the delightful hour of 4.30, breakfast at 5, and obtain our rations for the train journey - sardines, cheese, bully-beef & bread.   Most appetising tucker "I don't think". March down to the Railway Station, & board the train and eventually start off about 8 a.m.  Of course in cattle trucks, you can guess that it was hard
