 The electric trams are similar to Australian only somewhat different in construction & driven of course by native drivers, the conductors often calling us to "come & have free ride". The police are very obliging & wear blue uniforms & brass letterings that are always polished up well. The natives all fear the police & run for their natural on their approach. Europeans are very scarce & we only saw a few all day. 
 Down all the streets are natives with a brass plate on their coats showing what hotel they belong to, & they pester like the rest to - come & have good dinner 2/- or so much, even saying the menu off on the spot, They parade the streets all over the town & to take one may mean a long walk to his particular joint - the natives live in their own quarters
