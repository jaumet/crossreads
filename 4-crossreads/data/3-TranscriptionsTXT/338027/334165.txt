 Friday, 16 April, 1915 
 Received some stray mail from Aust.  Reports state that there is a big engagement on in Mesopotamia in which a lot of Aust. are engaged, but it is hardly probable that they are so far south.  It seems that it will be some time before the light horse are wanted, as there is no use for cavalry in this war, at the front all the lancers &amp; cavalry are fighting in the trenches.  If they keep us here much longer they will have to stable the horses as the desert heat will be too much for them. 
 My Doctor Capt. Hume Turnbull said that I can go out on Sunday. 
 Saturday, 17 April, 1915 One hundred &amp; sixty light wounded, sick &amp; maimed are expected here to-night from Lemnos, I believe they are mostly frost bite but we will know more later news is kept very secretly since the Austs departed. 
 Received more stray mails this past week has been a splendid one for me.  Paraded for my discharge to-day going out to-morrow, got drilled for first time to-day in the same old uniform that now seems part of our life.  Had a few visitors Bob Ker and other L. H. mates also C. M. Lutherland came in to see me.  Two charming ladies came with flowers to put in the wards and I helped them, one is a journalist so consequently I have an invitation to tea at Koubeik.
