He looks much better since his trip to England. At Lemnos we had very good drinking water. Almost anywhere over there one gets good water by sucking & the two Water Carts used to cart it for the Cooks & we used to go & fill our own water bottles. The Hospitals' supply came from a huge Condensing Plant which condensed the salt water. I don't think the water supply ever failed at all. I do hope the boys have had rain & also all the other poor devils on the land. Was very glad to hear that Will was better & trust he will not get another attack.
