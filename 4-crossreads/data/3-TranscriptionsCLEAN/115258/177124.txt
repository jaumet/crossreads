A common one, that is in most Y Emmas is "When did you write to Mother last?" and in this YM there are "Character is what a man is in the dark" and "Genius is one part inspiration and three parts perspiration - Slog in" also "If you sware at Home, sware here; we want you to feel at home" etc. That jolly nice cake Mother and Miss Anderson made came while I was at Port Said so Harold and I took it over to the hospital and gathered three mates there; and got a cup of tea each from the Red Cross, and then attacked the cake. It was beautifully fresh and was not a bit broken and was voted A1 by all concerned. I went to see Capt Trelawny again this time. He was at home this time, and no doubt! he is a jolly nice man. He is a commander now! I went and saw him in his office one morning and he asked me to come up to afternoon tea, so I did, and was introduced to some naval officers, and had a plesent afternoon generally. I was greatly amused at the nigger flunkeys there though. You see The Port House is a two story affair; the family live upstairs
