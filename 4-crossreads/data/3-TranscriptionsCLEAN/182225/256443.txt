 Fine but bleak Came on to rain a little during the night. Took horses out to graze ect in the morning & cleaning harness ect in afternoon.  We had an impromptu concert at night & the prizes won at the Brigade sports were given out by General Grimwade. The prizes consisted of silver 1 st  & copper 2 nd  medallions. I got a copper one for the wrestling on horseback which 27 th  team won.
