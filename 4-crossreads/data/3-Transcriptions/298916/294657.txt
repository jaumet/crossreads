<p>Toast "The King" "The Sydney" &amp; several others. When my turn came for dinner there was the Chief Officer, Teddy. Third officer, Roberts &amp; myself. Pinto the Cabin boy filled all the champagne glasses excepting mine which he was about to do when the Chief officer smacked his lips &amp; said "Here's to the King" without moving off his chair, &amp; gulped the champagne down. He, being the senior officer, it was his place to propose the toast. He then called Pinto in &amp; had some more &amp; would have been going strong only the bottle was empty. The soldiers drank to the Sydney in tea &amp; water &amp; then got drunk on Hobart beer. So much for the A13's appreciation.</p>
