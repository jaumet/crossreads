 they lay the dead and let the Hawks eat them. They have a lovely [indecipherable] gardens here. I wish I had known I would have brought more money, then I could have bought some lovely things here, to send home. 
 I have sent a Photo of the 9th A.L.H. to Nell for you to get, I am sitting on the end of the stool. That was taken in the last port we was in. My word I will be pleased to get some news from home again. I expect you will have had some of my letters by this time. I hope so at any rate. If you send any parcel to me at all put in a box of  Euth  throat menthols jubes also a tube of Anaglesic Balm I have found that very usefull several times lately. 
 We have a fine Leut in charge of us, one of the very best. We do not have to do much work only two hours a day on board. There is not much happens on board a ship to write about. There are six ships all travelling together with a Man of War for escort, so we feel fairly safe. I keep taking En&oacute;s Fruit Salts to try and keep in good health, it is three Shillings a bottle on board. It is just as well I keept two Shillings a day other wise I would be always broke, it is surprising how quick money goes. 
 W. Batts brother is on board with us also Dick Parnell and one of the Hams from Tambellup. Remember me to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Delaney also Tommy Norrish's lot. We are only allowed to write two pages now, because of the censure having to read them. I suppose I might see Jack Norrish soon now. Has Uncle Johnny come over yet. If you see H. Prisse any time Remember me to him. 
 I saw five Hospital Ships in the last port we called at, they look very pretty of a night they are light up from Bow to Stern with either Red or Green lights about a foot apart. Well I must close with sending you my best love and best wishes and Remember me to the Boss also all friends. I expect that you are having some fairly hot weather home now. How was the bush fires this year. 
 I remain Your loving Son
