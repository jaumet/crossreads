This afternoon we had an inspection from General Plumer the whole Bde. turned out, I had charge of the Platoon again
Last night the German's raided the 20th Bn. but what a shock they got for never a one of them got back alive, the 20th had an old score to settle with the Hun's for they made a successful raid on them while they were round Armentieres but this time the tables were turned with a vengeance
There is to be a big turn out to night for the Serg.'s are going to have a big spread a drunk I could go if I liked but there will be too much grog there for
