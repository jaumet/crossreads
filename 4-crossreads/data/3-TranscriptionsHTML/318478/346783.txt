<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>Two Golden Butterflies skim gracefully over the House tops of Cairo.  I say Golden Butterflies because Maurice or Tim failed to instruct me properly in the intricate nomenclature of aeroplanes or they lost interest too soon.</p>
<p>These two beautiful Machines swoop, twirl, &amp; describe beautiful curves in the air and note you that even the Kitchener Kite (Cairo Hawk) perhaps the most wonderful of flyers is impressed and keeps out of the way.<br/>[Drawing]<br/>I am about to find out if I go on board tomorrow or Saturday.</p>
