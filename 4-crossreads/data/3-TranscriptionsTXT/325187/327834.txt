 [Wednesday  29 March 1916] 
 Luxurious Bathroom &amp; cool Bedroom. My duty work seems to try &amp; settle claims for damage to crops, by Camps etc:- Using the water pumped at the Railways &amp; Town Council &amp; all the questions of a Town Council, Sanitation, Bounds Town Police etc:- How long will all this last! I forcaste a change back up North again  very  soon. Senussi are funished I think.  Gyppies are rogues if the British paid nothing, it would serve them right, they claim for all sorts of imaginary things &amp; lie thro' a 10" board.
