1916 April 23 

At daybreak we entered the roadstead at Suez dropped anchor at sunrise. Signalled for health officer customs. Breakfasted. received instructions to berth at docks. made fast at 11 a.m. Everything of interest. Natives of the lowest poorest class. Cripple. Horse landing entraining. One broke tumbled over pier. rescued. Niggers fight like children. Disembarked after tea entrained for Fel-el-Kebir. in coal truck. Arrived at camp at 2.30 a m. to bed at 4 a.m. Oh! The bumping jolting of that train ride. a nightmare.
