  
 27.3.15 Sat. 27th.  Dismounted for a change & we put the day in cleaning equipment.  Penny & Nelson received a pass out from dinner time, I went in after tea & met Penny at the Kursaal at 6.30.  The Kursaal was very good we then went to York House for supper, had a good time there learning French, arrived back in Camp at 10.30.  Merga Mack, Jack Plush & Fitzgerald had to-night out & arrived in camp about 10 oclock & Mack was paralytic.  By Plush's account they had a royal night of it at Shepherds with some officers (infantry) that Mack knew.
