<p>Up at 8 a.m. breakfast, stand to all your meals.  Wonderful what one can put up with. &amp; what he will eat when hungry. Still rain &amp; more mud.  Do a little fatigue &amp; dinner &amp; consolidate our dugout. Line up at canteen in valley for hour for bottle sauce &amp; chocolates. [indecipherable] &amp; mud. Transport difficulties. Tea &amp; scrap. Camp fire &amp; humping of logs. Song &amp; Hymns round fire before turning in.</p>
