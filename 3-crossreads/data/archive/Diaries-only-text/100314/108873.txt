21/2/18 Selles
Afternoon Rode down to the Bombing ground and saw all "D" Coy working hard entrenching with pick and shovel. Then back to Battalion parade ground where were "B" Coy doing their artillery formations. It looked very well. Then made for A Coy who were doing the picture of a raiding party and who later went down for a bath. Tried a case at Orderly Room and then had some afternoon tea at the Mess. The old RSM (Cadwell) now wearing his ribbon of the Croix de Guerre Belge presented by the one and only Birdwood yesterday. After mess yarned with the MSelles and then settled down to a busy evening of writing and detail.
