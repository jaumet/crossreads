TUESDAY, MAY 6, 1919.
Fine. Digging tree holes for the
drive in morning. Then Eric, Owie
& Mrs Cadell came out. Eric took
me over to "Beauly" to inspect
X bred ewes in lamb, but
did not do a deal as they are a
very weedy lot. Eric & Peter & I
then rode round my part &
valued it at roughly 3.10.0
Marj. jo, & Owie met us at the
Middle paddock bore for lunch.
The Cadells went home after &
Marj. also.
