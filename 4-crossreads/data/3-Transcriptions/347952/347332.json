<p>ships steaming towards the Dardenells. You might think by this time as we <u>knew</u> we were just on the point of going into battle that we would be all very quiet &amp; saying our prayers, but that was not the case, we were all as lively as ever &amp; singing songs &amp; playing games just as if we were on a nice sea trip. At 11 o'clock up came the anchor &amp; we were off, we just crawled along, we were all made to go to bed early as we had to be up at 3 in the morning, I could not sleep I was two excited I kept going up on deck every now &amp; then it was a lovely starry moonlight night. I lent over the rails of the ship thinking of you all as I never have thought of you before. We knew we had no easy task before us as our Colonel told us that dozens of us would never get ashore &amp; he was right too. Well Mother darling I gave all your photos a long farewell kiss I also had a note in my pocket book to be sent home to you in case I was toppled off. I always carry my wallet with the photos in in my left hand pocket over the heart. At last the ship cam to a standstill about 4 in the morning of April 25th 1915. We could just distinguish land about 2 miles off with mountainous hills towering up, the excitement was getting intense</p>
