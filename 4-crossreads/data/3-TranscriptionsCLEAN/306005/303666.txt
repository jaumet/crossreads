24-12-16seven miles from El Arish we met these & were issued with 6 handfulls of oats per horse for a feed when we got to camp; we then continued our journey & it was daylight when we pulled up at the troughs to water our horses & sunrise when we arrived in camp; had breakfast & all slept till dinner time. I then went to the wells had a bath & took a ride to the beach only a few hundred yards away to find the pier run out & boats unloading & a good many tommies in swimming so the minesweepers must have cleared all the mines out & horse feed & rations now come by boat & saves a long camel train across the desert; 2 Taubes came over at dinner time dropping
