<p>Mena House<br/>The Pyramids<br/>Egypt<br/>1 March 1915</p>
<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>This begun at 2-10p.m.  At 9-30 I posted a letter to you, as also a brief one to Mollie.  Something will be written hereon &amp; on after following pages as they will be the last that can be sent on without my pen being subject to the censor.</p>
<p>My wards are practically empty, almost all of the patients having been moved to another hospital this morning.  Tomorrow, if arrangements can be made, I shall go to a place called Sakarah, where tombs of various kinds are to be seen.  More of it anon.</p>
<p>This is St. David's day made famous in English history as being the one, upon which, the Welshmen fought well near Agincourt, under Edward the Black Prince, <strike>in the beg</strike> in the middle of the 14th century, and the fight being in a field where leeks grew, each Welshman had a leek placed in his Monmouth cap, and ever since then the leek is a badge of good &amp; valliant service worn by loyal Welshmen upon the 1st of March in their caps or hats.  Henry the V is made by Shakespeare to say to <strike>Llewellyn</strike> Fluellen:&ndash;<br/>"Flu: ..., and I do believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Davy's day.<br/>King Hy: I wear it for a memorable honour;<br/>For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman<br/>Flu: All the water in the Wye cannot wash your Majesty's Welsh plood [blood] out of your pody [body], I can tell you that. ..."</p>
<p>The sun shines bright and all is fair without.  I may run into town later on.</p>
<p>You should just see a tiny girl her elder sister crossing the sand beyond, each carries a basket on her</p>
