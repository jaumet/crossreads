  
 of French pictures were shewn, the charge was very reasonable being only 6c each & a good seat, needless to say the hall was crowded with soldiers & civilians, the pictures were a first class lot & in intervals French songs were sung by Frenchmen, one gentleman saying in English "Come sing to me" & having a splendid baritone voice, the boys gave him a splendid reception. 
 The programme was finished at 8 pm, taking three hours, we made our way back to our Depot after some supper turned in. 
 Thursday 23rd. We are now standing by & do not know when we will be required again & as the engine had been washed out & lit up again, we may receive a call at any time, so I am spending the day writing letters & the Diary. 
 At 4 pm word came along to prepare for duty by drawing our rations & oil stores and sign on at 18.45 for a run to Montignie. As I took the engine out first last trip my relief decided to take her out on this the second trip, the idea was to give each set, a chance to see the part of country what we were passing
