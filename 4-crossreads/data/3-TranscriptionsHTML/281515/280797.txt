<p>small parties down to the beach where we washed our clothes with sand &amp; while they were drying we went in &amp; out of the sea as we thought that by the time that the sun had gone down our clothes would be dry, a Gun called :Beachy Bill" used to send a shell now &amp; again if there was a crowd on the beach, he must have got a good view as every now &amp; again he would sent a shell over &amp; of course he would be sure to get someone each time</p>
<p>&amp; after about a week or so during which time we were kept at work each night in three reliefs digging more trenches down to where there was a well &amp; where a lot of men had got killed while waiting their turn for water so a trench was dug to give the water carriers a better chance as the water supply on the Peninsular was bad &amp; all the water had to be carried, half a Pint of water was each mans allowance each day for all purposes &amp; some days we got a Pint!</p>
<p>Sickness broke out amongst the troops, Dysentery &amp; malaria Fever was amongst us &amp; the men were very weak &amp; suffering constantly with Dysentry &amp; about September 20th we were relieved &amp; sent round to Popes Post round to the right not far from Quinns Post, Courtneys Post &amp; Walkers Ridge which were all occupied by my brigade the 5th Brigade A.I.F.</p>
<p>About the end of September I began to feel queer &amp; got a touch of Dysentry &amp; was losing a lot of Blood &amp; one one morning I stood up while we were at Popes Post &amp; fell down again I could not stand &amp; the doctor was brought &amp; took my tempeture &amp; I was 102"</p>
