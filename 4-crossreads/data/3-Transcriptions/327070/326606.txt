<p>Wednesday 2 February 1916</p>
<p>A beautiful bright sunny day with a cool breeze blowing from the N. Sea wonderfully smooth &amp; very little motion noticeable, not as much as one usually gets when going to Manly.</p>
<p>Orderly officer of the day &amp; up at 5.30. Kept going during the day attending to the various duties, getting the men off the decks &amp; their hammocks &amp; blankets below, cleaning up the troop-decks &amp; getting the ship ready for the inspection which is made by the Commander, Colonel, &amp; various other officials each day at 11 am.</p>
<p>At 2 o'clock a special meeting for officers &amp; sergeants was called by the colonel &amp; instructions issued about the method to be adopted in case of submarine attack. A practice with ball ammunition was given in the afternoon but could scarcely be called a success. With further practice we can look for some improvement.</p>
<p>At night the boxing contest was continued.</p>
<p>Ship's run to noon was 362 mls, with 281 mls still to go before reaching Colombo.</p>
