<p>my name first.</p>
<p>I told them as much of Eks yarn as I could remember and filled in the rest myself, in fact my tale would have made any ordinary man cry, but it was no good this time and after Ek had "corroborated my Statement" the major said "4 days pay stopped" and bang went &pound;. And now Comes Christmas and being out of the Line we decided to have a good one.</p>
<p>We all put in 10 Francs per man that is roughly 8/4 and elected a President and Committee of 3 men to go and get the necessities etc for the feed. I was one of the Committee and we had to go round and buy peas potatoes meat butter and numerous other things that were wanted. We also went down to the brewery and bought a small cask of ale. From the Comforts 6 bottles of Wine 1 &frac12; Dozen of Stout and 2 bottles Cordials</p>
