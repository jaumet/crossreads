<p>The town is situated on a hilly cape of the sandy deserts to the north, the hills jutting straight up from the water.  Some of the buildings are in the most inaccessible places &amp; the hills are entirely devoid of vegetation.  A couple of warships were in the bay.  Here we found an entirely different kind of natives, the Arabs.  We left Aden that morning &amp; after hugging the coast of Arabia until 4.30 pm. Entered the Red Sea.  Here was seen the grandest sight of the Voyage.  The day had been perfect &amp; now the sun is setting not over the ocean, but over the rugged mountains of that part of Africa.  To the right is the island of Perim, a naval station, &amp; beyond the next stretch of water the coast of Arabia.  It is dusk &amp; the lighthouse is alight &amp; flashing up the Red Sea &amp; as we enter the Strait of Babelmandeb the men &amp; passengers crowd forward to watch a cable steamer pass through the same time.  It is indeed the most unique sight of the voyage, the place where the "China" met her accident.</p>
<p>Nov 2  After a good run up the Red Sea we entered the Gulf of Suez &amp; next <br/>Nov 3 [in margin] morning anchored in Suez harbour where we disembarked &amp; entrained for our Egyptian destination.</p>
<p>In this voyage I consider we had the best time of any troops which had ever left Australia in this way.   The boat was kept scrupulously clean &amp; the food was of the best.  The passengers treated us like little Gods &amp; entertained us many times at concerts &amp; kept us supplied in chocolates, cigarettes fruit etc.  Of the English troops I have nothing but praise for the manner in which they strictly obeyed orders &amp; drilled.  They were always commended on the cleanliness of their deck.  Their money is small &amp; at ports we Australians arranged collections to enable them to have a good time.  Consequently they held us in high esteem &amp; were sorry to leave us at Colombo.  Their strict English officer was a big contrast to our own, demanding a fullest extent of discipline.  The men are certainly small of stature.  Of the passengers, we have much to be thankful to in Mrs B Gwynne Hughes &amp; Miss Churnside who disembarked at Port Said.  Except for the second day out from Sydney the weather has been excellent though naturally very depressing &amp; hot in the tropics.  <br/>I must say that my first impressions of Egypt are not of the best as from the boat we can only see a long stretch of undulating sand. Hells entirely devoid of vegetation.</p>
