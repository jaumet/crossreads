<p>her rolling too. We are right out of the track on any steamers, so that there was not much chance of being sighted and picked up. The 3 Engineers have been working for almost 3 days without a break, except for meals, and look pretty done up today. We are now going very slowly, about 5 knots, and are all half-expecting to hear the sound that says the engines have broken down again. I don't suppose we shall get into Sydney now till about Thursday 24th inst &ndash; that is if all goes well from now on.</p>
<p>Wednesday. 16th September. The engines have kept going alright, though at a reduced speed &ndash; we are doing about 6 knots an hour now. There is nothing of interest to note. Have had fair weather all the time, though several days have been wet and windy. I have finished all my work, and am finding it hard to fill in time. One gets very tired of sleeping all day and night. The 2nd and 3rd Officers, the 3rd Engineer and myself generally have a game of cards every night for an hour or so, though even that is getting monotonous.</p>
<p>Tuesday. 22nd September. Here we are on the New South Wales Coast at last. We sighted Mount Warning on Monday morning las, at the same time running into a stiff southerly gale with high seas. The "MORESBY" is in very light trim, and could not make much headway against the gale. We have been doing about 3 to 4 knots all day yesterday and today, and are hoping the wind and sea will lie down soon, and let us get on to Sydney. At this rate of going it will be some time next week when we get in. We are keeping a long way out from the Coast, in case anything should happen to the engines I suppose, and consequently we cannot signal any of the Coast stations</p>
