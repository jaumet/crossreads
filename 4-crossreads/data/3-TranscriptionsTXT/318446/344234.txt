night - so I am continually imaging I can hear a 'plane.  I long for the time when I shall be no longer always subconsciously on the alert for unaccustomed sounds.  Immediately after the next pay I am going to importune the Colonel for leave to Cairo to get my teeth fixed up, they want it badly.There seems to be no chance of general leave for this bgde. though the 3rd are getting it.They have two wire roads down here now one on the beach & the other on the south side of our Camp.They have this road - composed of four widths of wire netting - right from Bir el Abd & I believe even further.  It makes the sand practicable for Infantry to march on & the estimated cost of it is 250,000!!
