<p>Sunday 23<br/>Move from Rouen at 10 pm after 14 hours stay to Caestre between Hazebrouck Poperinghe via Amiens, Albert Achut Arras St Pol &amp; Hazebrouck. Journey not to comfortable</p>
<p>Monday 24<br/>Back to Steenvoorde where we were this time last year about. We marched from Caestre to here yesterday morning &amp; spent the day &amp; night in 1st Div Reinforcement Camp. Expect to join unit tomorrow.<br/>The 4th Battle of Ypres opened a few days back &amp; the Australians are in the thick of it. The 1st Div advance about a mile with only 2000 odd casualties. 1st Field Amb had 26.</p>
<p>Tuesday 25<br/>Arrive at unit at Steenvoorde to find only nursing section here. The ambulance is much changed &amp; the officers are mostly new.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26<br/>Walk to Cassel but did not see much of the town</p>
<p>Thursday 27<br/>The afternoon at Abeele to have a look for Geo. Peterson, failed to find him</p>
<p>Friday 28<br/>There is certainly a war in progress on the Ypres front &amp; ambulance casualties are usually at about 30&percnt; to 50&percnt; equally as heavy as infantry.<br/>The bombardments are very violent &amp; these moonlit nights favour nightly aerial work on both sides.</p>
<p>Saturday 29<br/>Another walk to Cassel &amp; back by the great moonlight which we are enjoying now. The weather has been glorious while here, fine days &amp; moonlit nights.<br/>We are moving up to A.D.S. tomorrow. The artillery fire has been very intense of late</p>
