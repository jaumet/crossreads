 Teed up at 5.30 &amp; had breakfast at 6. Boot &amp; saddle at 6.30, the boys then trek out 5 miles to a large palm grove where the horses are to be kept during the heat of the day. I went out at lunch time &amp; took their dinners out. The day was frightfully hot &amp; I got burnt some whilst riding. 
 The aviation people have got an aerodrome fixed up about 2 miles N of our camp &amp; machines have been up all day. 
 Have had another attack of fever or rather the after effects &amp; am now not feeling too good, went over to the Doctors but I only got pills &amp; I don't think lead &amp; opium is much good for counter-acting fever. 
 Turned in  at 9.30.

 Had a few trips out to the station, heard that there was a mail expected &amp; Downs is to go to Cairo to relieve Green who has gone to the [indecipherable] the CO is contemplating a trip to Cairo if so I may stand a chance of another trip. Weather still frightfully hot &amp; whips of flies. Metcher (Owens brother) came back today from hospital, he looks none the worse for wear after his stay on Helles. 
 Went up the town for a donkey ride, had supper &amp; then turned in at 9.20.
