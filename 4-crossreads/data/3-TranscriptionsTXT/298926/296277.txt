7 miles of troops and artillery, it being a divisional stunt.                             Some of the band enthusiasts in A Co have shamed the officers and bought us 10 tins of polish for our instruments so we have made them look a bit decent again.
14th  Went for 6 mile march in the afternoon.  We are to have a march every afternoon now until we go.
15th I have sent mine & Wal's clothes to uncle so we can get them any time we should come over on furlough from France
