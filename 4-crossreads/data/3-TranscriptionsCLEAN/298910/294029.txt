Raining off & on - very cold. In charge of the Hospital pantry, can get this job permanently & probably 2 stripes - no good to me as I am prepared to go to the trenches & stay there as long as boys stay there. Went for a walk around Laventie - it is a fine Town, but now mostly ruins - got postcards of the Cathedral & got a little piece of stained glass as a Souvenir.
Bombardment not so heavy today - About 12 wounded came in today. In our tobacco issue today I got a p' c enclosed from Miss E. A. Healy - c/o Telephone Exchange, Brisbane, also Miss W Fihilly  same address. I was quite pleased & hope it is the Eileen Healy, that has given us many a good musical evening. I am returning both p'c's.

Raining & dull - Very busy at the Clearing Station - hardly time to have meals. It is just like murder to see our fine lads coming in so helpless, & knocked about - covered with mud & blood, - for a while it used to upset
