young lady, so I returned to my hotel, read a few papers & went to bed.
Sunday - Had a cup of tea in bed, a bath and breakfast, finishing breakfast at about 10.40. A heavy thunderstorm then came up. After it cleared up I went in a motorbus to Avonmouth, but the docks were closed to visitors. It is a very pleasant trip from Bristol to Avonmouth - about 6 miles for 6d.
I then had a few tramrides & on one I met a gentleman & his wife named Holman of Barry in Wales. He is connected with shiip building. He was just recovering from effects of Drunkeness. I joined them in afternoon tea at the Swan. I had intended spending the night at Bath but this delayed me, so I booked a room at the Swan.
Monday 16th - Left Bristol at 6am & arrived at Wylye at 8 and motored to Camp.
Raining on & off today. Made out Mess Accounts & collected some this evening.
