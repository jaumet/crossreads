15th February, 1917:   Looking across these peaceful snowfields one
finds it hard to realise that but a few months ago they were the
scene of some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting the war has
seen.  Here were villages, factories, woods, cemeteries, roads
and railways;  now all has been levelled and what traces there
still are of former days have been covered by a couple of feet of
glistening snow.  The wet weather has caused most of the old
trenches to fall in, and even where a particularly well made trench
has withstood the weather it is now full of frozen water and being
snowed over is unrecognisable as a trench.
     As one gets closer to the present firing line, however,
this peacefulness gradually merges into activity of a military
nature.  The French population had not been allowed back so that
no attempt has been made to rebuild villages but in their place
are camps, workshops, dumps, railways and the thousand and one
things required behind an army in the field.  Streams of vehicles
of all classes occupy the numerous strategic roads day and night
carrying amuntiion and supplies to the armies in the line.  Baths
have been erected where men fresh from the trenches can have a
bath and obtain clean underclothes for their old ones.  Soup
kitchens are dotted along the roads to the front line where tired
troops returning from the trenches may obtain a mug of soup anytime
during the day or night free of charge.  Everywhere is activity
and everywhere are soldiers all bent on making this the last year of war.
     A visit to the Australians old Battlefields at
Pozieres was of interest even though not many of the old spots
were recognisable.  Occasionally a familiar object would be found
