  
 one Captain.  He is a rotter but the men hoot him & throw rocks on his house & if he goes down to the wharf he is greeted with cat calls & cock-a-doodle-doos.  He wants to drill us before 7 a.m. but our Sergeant takes us all down for a swim & so does him in.  Billy is well & is at present helping in the surgery where he was sliced up.  Two of our tent mates are on the washing party to-day, i.e., washing sheets & pyjamas, towels, etc.  So I got one of them to wash some of my clothes.  Ellis has just brought a bucket of hot water so I will go & wash my handkerchiefs & a couple of other things that I have left. 
 Well I will close now & Hoping to be home some time next week & Hoping also that you are getting along alright in this hot rainless weather. 
 I Remain Yours Lovingly Harry only
