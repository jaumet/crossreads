<p>Been out with the class signalling all day. The weather was very hot &amp; sultry in the morning and up till about mid-day but after that there is always a steady sea breeze sets in and these breezes are lovely &amp; cool Had to make sketches of the different positions we occupied during the recent reconnaissance Compass bearings from one point to another where signalling communications could be established. One of my horses has been sent away sick and another two are being shown to the Brigade Veterinary officer to day at 3.30 p.m. These long treks over loose sand has been the cause of them and hundreds of others breaking down. The 2nd L H Brigade have returned from Hill 70 and they are now taking their Share of some of the patrolling which is very satisfactory as it takes a great deal of weight off us. Leach has gone to the Zaitoun Signalling school at Cairo for a 6 weeks course in advanced Signalling and Butler has also gone on a 3 weeks course of Machine Gun Work. Hope they make a name for themselves. Campbell and Allan &amp; Smith came back with Credit. Brigade Head Quarters which has been situated in a clump of palms close by</p>
