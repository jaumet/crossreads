 W. We are inoculated on the breast & Capt Beale as rough as a [indecipherable]. I go to Dance but am very crook I do not dance very much & come Home early & go straight to bed. I think of Ellis all day as to his whereabouts. I clean up room & generally tidy up. 
 23 February, Sunday 
 F. Dick & I go walk around Bulford. Meet Woody & Dicky but do not linger. I worry R & D in Flat. I take washin! I nearly buy a fight over ill-treating a dog. I go to Y.W.C.A. & we play up generally especially with Dick. I come Home alone go to bed but cannot sleep until a very late hour. Thomas comes over & is awful drunk. He nearly makes me [indecipherable] with the fumes.
