<p>Alex<br/>Daily Telegraph Aug. 23 an English Paper has a good article by Mazzly on the MOSAIC I mentioned we found at Shedal. I shall cut out &amp; post but mention as so many letters are lost these days. The Cotton Crop is ripe again in Egypt &amp; the Mills busy, a regulation is in force limiting the amount grown as the "Fellahin" would grow all cotton &amp; so starve the country of cereals. <strike>Found letters from Dolly &amp; Laura up to Aug. 21 &ndash; former was very sad at my not getting any leave, my cable had not then been received.</strike></p>
