I have often read &amp; have been told about Port said but one would never bleive it until he saw it with his own eiyes. there are hundreds of boats in the Port. There are 3 large "Aeroplanes" stabled along side of the wharf. in large Canvas sheds the <strike>sa</strike> small boats came along selling Cigaretts matches &amp; oranges, about 9 am we made another start it was a very pretty sight to see all the Crusiers lined up on one side &amp; as we passed our band struck up &amp; played us out of Port. Just as we were nearing the enterance a large "Hydroplane" rose up &amp; came flying only a few feet above the masts of our boat  it was great excitement as it was all new to us. it was travelling at great speed. the Piolet <strike>waved way</strike> waved to us. it was making a terrible noise like a big Loquest. As we came out we cheered every boat we passed &amp; they also cheered us.</p>
