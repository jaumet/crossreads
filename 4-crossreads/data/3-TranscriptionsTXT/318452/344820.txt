Father Le Maitre an R C ChaplainEarly on the morning of the 31st we put out into the stream and there we lay for 3 days and this morning at 12 we left.I have met quite a lot of lads I know among them Bob Nelson & T. Roberts, Lt Jon Tarn & Brian Cavanagh The OC is Col FewtrellThe weather was too bad to permit of an official parade at 10 so I went to C Troop deck & had a very nice little service.There are 10 boats in the Convoy & an escort of Destroyers & a Cruiser Maria. So we are rather a formidable convoy. The sea is nice & calm but we are only steaming slowlyI have a service at 6. Rough on the troop deck
