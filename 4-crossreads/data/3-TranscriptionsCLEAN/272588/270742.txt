  
 Tuesday 23 July Wet & miserable all day. Up at Strazeele Station R.A.P. again where the English troops are holding the line.  They are labour men & are not fit to be in the line, little chaps & old men!  They are very funny but are getting quite a number of cases already. Australian officers & N.C.O.s are attached to them to stiffen them & our chaps detest the job. 
 Wednesday 24 July A few carries last night, sick & wounded. Wonderfully fine to-day & to-night & wonderfully quiet. These chaps are very funny here. Living very well indeed.
