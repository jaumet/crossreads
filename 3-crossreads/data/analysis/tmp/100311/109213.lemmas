 7/10/17 Hannebek Wood Front Line of 100 detail from Caestr seem to be our onli hope . At 5 p.m. start to move up and had a nightmar of a journey over the mud . When we reach [indecipher ] the S.O.S went up all along the line and heavi shell start . Shell start burst thick and we rush for the nearest pill box which happen to be De Knoet farm . Crouch in against the back we had a littl refug . I was struck by a piec of stone on the shoulder and at first thought of a wound . Some of the other were wound . Duck into the place and took shelter there for a while . A rough walk up to BattnHQ . Just at the entranc a shell burst and I saw someon be pull out and put on the parapet . Smother in mud from head to foot we stagger insid dread look peopl . This promis to be a second Fler . The relief drag on hour by hour and it was inde a crucifixion of the flesh for the poor tire out fellow . Some were near cri . For those who did not turn up from Ypres there is no contempt too deep .
