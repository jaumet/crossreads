<p>January, 1916<br/>Monday 10<br/>A lot more Machine Gunners expected in some time today &amp; I am told I will have to take a class.<br/>About 5 pm they arrive in hundreds &amp; the work of putting them into tents &amp; getting them some grub took up several hours.<br/>They are in a bad way in regards to clothing &amp; money.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11<br/>I am given a squad of 20 men from the 6th  Bde M.G. Secs.<br/>The first day is very trying  But after getting into the swing of things it comes quite easily.</p>
