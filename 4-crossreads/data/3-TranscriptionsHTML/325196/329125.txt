<p>26-2-16<br/>Sat 26th<br/>Last night several natives went between the men on the special patrol with donkeys &amp; camels loaded with burcene [lucerne]; they did not know that they had gone through till they saw where they had crossed  their tracks during the night; Johns &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had an argument this afternoon but the Col came on the scene during the first round &amp; stopped the fight.</p>
<p>27-2-16<br/>Sun 27th<br/>Was on mounted patrol last night but had a very quiet time, a patrol from B Troop managed to catch a couple of Bedouins a few night ago who came in to buy burcene &amp; they are at present in gaol.  5 Lovetts Scouts are attached to us &amp; are to go out on camels with natives scouting a couple of days at the time  received a parcel from Stan tonight.</p>
