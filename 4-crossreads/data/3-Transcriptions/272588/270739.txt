<p>Wednesday 17 July<br/>Fearfully hot all day and one fully clothed is very uncomfortable.<br/>News confirming the rumour of a German attack which has made little progress.</p>
<p>Thursday 18 July<br/>Nothing of importance at all. Glorious weather after yesterday's heat and rain.<br/>Front continues quiet &amp; in the South the Bosch seems to be held.</p>
