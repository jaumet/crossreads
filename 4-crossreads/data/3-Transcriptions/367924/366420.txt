<p>we will go back to camp again in the night, perhaps we will turn up in two or three nights later ten or fifteen miles in some other direction.</p>
<p>The last stunt we was on the horses never had there saddles off for twenty five hours, there is no doubt that the poor devils have some rought times of it, and I believe it is good now to what they have gone through in some places. I have a very nice poney and he is an original poney, he came over with the regiment.</p>
<p>You would never credit the loads we have to carry when shifting camp, you carry every thing you possess, then you have 24 hours rations for yourself &amp; horse. Of course when you go out on these twenty four hour stunts you only carry twenty 4 hours feed for yourself &amp; horse, no blankets or overcoat. I would give a great deal for the people home to see the regiment moving off for a stunt, it would open there eyes. I am sending you a few photos I will tell you all about them when I get home.</p>
<p>They talk of the long hours they work on a farm but the hours are nothing to what we do here at times, in ordonary times we get up at five oclock and then we have to do horse piquett about four times a week, that is night piquett. Jack Ladyman &amp; Jim is in the same squadron as I am. Jack Norrish is on his way out to us now, so I will see him any day now. The Turks Taubs fly over us just about every day to see what we are doing.</p>
<p>You know that absess I used to have on my gum, that was caused through the prong of my eye tooth being broke off and left there, I had it taken out the other day, so it is alright now. I wrote and told you that I payed Ted Flanagan three pounds for the wire, there is no doubt he must be rotten to say I did not pay him. I was very surprised to hear that Jim Jones had not payed up, he said he would pay about the 15th Feb but I told him it would not matter for a few weeks later if he was short just then.</p>
