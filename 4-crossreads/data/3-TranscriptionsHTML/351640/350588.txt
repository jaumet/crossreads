<p>just looking comfortable.  Jerrom the heaviest of all rode a small donkey. I did not think that the little beast could carry the weight but he did, &amp; came home quite friskily.  The guide &amp; one of the girls, sometimes two of the girls rode the camels.  We went past the great pyramids, posing for a group photograph alongside the Sphynx.
