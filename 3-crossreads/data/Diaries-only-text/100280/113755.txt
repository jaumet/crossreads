they put me snug into one of them, there I stopped until the train reached Rouen, hanged if it was just snowing again when we were taken out driven to the hospital in motors again. I finally landed in No. 6 an English hospital I never wish to get in one again they are absolutely rotten the tucker is worse I nearly starved during my few days there if they hadn't let me out when they did I would have bolted
