<p>afternoon of this day the Internees of ,,Singh Singh" Compound wich wher keept in confinement in the Camp jail, waiting for their transference to a Governement jail, wher escorted under a guard consisting of 7 Military Police 16 private Soldiers &amp; 1 Lieutenant to the Soldiers ,,Lockup" wher those 7 Internees remained until the Governor had departed, when they wher escorted back to Camp - jail again.  The reasones for this transference, I could never ,,comprehente".  I persume that on account of Camp jail being situated on the ,,Parade Ground" &amp; this seven Internees singing in the Cells, warranted their transferrence.  May 27th a Internee called upon the Camp in General for asistance through the following Notice ,,Comrades, this day I have been informed by the Major Allsopp, that in the event of me refusing to be operated upon, I would be goaled".  I interviewed this Internee &amp; found him suffering from ,,Rupture" the reasones for him refusing to be operated upon wher, on account of the two Internees previously operated upon hier hawing died, that the neccessary Instruments for this Operation wher not in evidence at the Camp Hospital, that only in a big Governement Hospital would he sanction an operation.  This wher put before the Camp Commandant &amp; same wher permitted remain in our midst, &amp; he is awaiting his release</p>
