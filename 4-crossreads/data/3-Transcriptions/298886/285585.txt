<p>8.45 pm. I am all alone tonight. All the troops with the exception of a very few have gone out on a reconnaissance and I have just signed a memo from the Regimental Officer Stating that the few Stragglers who are left in Camp must Stand to arms at the usual time absolutely ridiculous and absurd. As <strike>  thought</strike> though it is necessary to stand to arms here when the whole brigade has gone out in front of us. Of course the whole thing is another example of "red tape" which does so much to destroy men's souls in the Army.</p>
<p>A few stragglers most of them attending the doctor (myself included) for various ailments and a few men who are grooms and servants, and a few who are on duty here. Oh! No don't let them get at least <u>one</u> good nights sleep out of 7 weeks. haul them out at 3.45 in the morning too much sleep we know is injurious!</p>
