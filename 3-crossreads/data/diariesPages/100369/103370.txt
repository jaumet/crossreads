fairly wide and clean streets various kinds of green trees growing about, to come suddenly onto this was like coming in sight of the Garden of Eden. The people here were very glad to see us. Many of them spoke English. There are French, Russians, Poles, Spaniards, Greeks here mostly Jews and the Turks, they say, gave them a pretty rough time, as they passed through. I rather marvelled that they came off as well as they did. 
We were able to purchase bread here, and after living on biscuit and bully beef, it was a most welcome change. The bread is brown and rather heavy, being a mixture I am told of whole wheat and lentils. We were paying 1/- per loaf for it. Late at night they started to charge 2/- for it. The spirit of Isaac, Abraham and Jacob was too strong for them, and overcame their love for the "Inglaise". The opportunity temptation to" look at the profits" was too great. The leading spirits of the village to their credit, stopped this, and it was only right too. The price the Deiran people paid for their bread before we came, a young girl who spoke English informed us, was three ha?pence a pound
