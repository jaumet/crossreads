6 - the faces of these thousands of lively young Australians camped round Cairo. They pass in hundreds along the streets all day. Where ever you go they are - teasing the natives laughing & talking and enjoying life to the uttermost. There are little groups of pickets everywhere to make them behave themselves and not steal or drink too much or hurt the natives feelings.They are very overbearing and foolish teasing the natives really beyond endurance. The gippy tries to take it in good part. The drink here is very bad. Mrs Knox told me that there is some sort of alcohol the boys get sold to them that only has affect the next morning when it goes to their heads and makes them quite drunk. She is doing a lot of work amongst the soldiers. Such a nice woman - very like our Rosamond. I wish R was older
