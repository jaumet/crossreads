<p>1<br/>                      How I won the</p>
<p>Yes, thats the red ribbon i'm wearing<br/>Just a small strip of scarlet you see<br/>But there is no one can tell how I prize it <br/>nor the memories it brings back to me<br/>For it speaks of the broad fields of honour<br/>That we rung from the red jaws of Hell<br/>&amp; my eyes grow bedimmed for my cobbers<br/>Who battled fought &amp; fell.<br/>Yes that's the V.C. &ndash; How I won it<br/>Is not for me to relate<br/>we heroes are always so modest<br/>&amp; boastings I thing that I hate<br/>But seeing you write for the papers<br/>I'll make an exception for you<br/>Don't mention my name if you write it<br/>Though every particle is true<br/>It was during a fight for an outpost<br/>It was called "Green Knole" I believe<br/>&amp; the Turks on the top dealt out slaughter<br/>In a way that would cause you to grieve<br/>It was five thousand feet to the summit<br/>&amp; almost as steep as a wall.<br/>&amp; they met every charge as we rushed it<br/>with bayonet shrapnel &amp;Ball<br/>It was defeded by nine lines of trenches.<br/>(That's strong for an outpost you'll guess).<br/>also twelve 42 centimetres<br/>That kicked up a duece of a mess.<br/>The bombs fell amongst us like rain<br/>&amp; machine guns &ndash; why, just to remember<br/>even now brings a feeling of pain.\<br/>We'd been fighting for months without resting<br/>ah! well may the angels weep<br/>for the blood ran in streams down the gullies</p>
