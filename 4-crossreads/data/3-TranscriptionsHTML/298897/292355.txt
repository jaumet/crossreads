<p>Thursday 24th April August '16<br/>Orderly Sgt for the day.  Nothing doing bar an inspection by the D.D.M.S. &amp; usual duties.</p>
<p>Friday 25th<br/>Went into 'Hazebrouck' for drugs &amp; in order to take an officer to the eye hospital.  Had a couple of hours there &amp; drove the car back having dinner in "Merville" arriving back shortly after two, altogether a decent morning as a change.  More rain late in the afternoon.  Had a note from M.D. saying alls well with a P.S. which said &ndash; "The military now assess my services at two thirds higher value than formerly" meaning that he had been made a Corporal.  Will see him with [indecipherable] shortly if the huns leave him on his feet.</p>
<p>Saturday 26th August.<br/>Orderly Sergeant for the day.  General duties throughout the day.  At night went down to the Gas school to gather information.  Learnt among other things that the casualties through a gas attack about a fortnight ago numbered 1000 with 300 deaths.  They managed to catch our fellows charging over &amp; unprepared all packed together.  The officers responsible for such a state of thing were punished.</p>
