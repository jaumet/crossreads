<p>and posted them at the YMCA on shore before I left, I went from one side of Ceylon to the other, saw some very beautiful sights one thing I noticed very much, "the very tall smells".  also the absence of horses, only saw two, and very poor specimens at that, I was greatly taken with the funny carts, with the small hump-backed oxen to pull them, they drive them with a ring through their nose, when shopping the darkies usually ask about four or five times the value of an article. if they ask 4/- you usually get it after a lot of bargaining for about 1/-, bought three singlets for 2/6, would pay that for one in Melbourne, there are some very fine buildings in Colombo and the roadways are all asphalted and very clean.  Saw some very funny looking birds.  I was very much surprised at the number of darkies that could speak english, nearly all the shops have their names up in english.</p>
<p>I went to bed at 9.15 PM very tired but very well satisfied with my afternoon's outing.  Still coaling and discharging cargo (Mutton &amp; Beef).</p>
<p>Wednesday Nov 28th<br/>5.30 got up, raining very heavy coaling finished at &frac12; past 3 AM.  Put on 2,000 tons, putting on</p>
