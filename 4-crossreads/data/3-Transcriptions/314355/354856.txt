<p>War Correspondents' Headquarters<br/>June 16<br/>Of three raids reported yesterday, one, which cut out a post to the north-east of Villers-Bretonneux, was performed by a party from a New South Wales battalion, which, unassisted by artillery, defeated the garrison and brought out two prisoners.  The whole operation was over in six minutes.</p>
<p>Two raids near Ville-sur-Ancre were performed by parties from two Victorian battalions.  The garrison in the southern end of the two posts, attacked at the entrance to the Morlancourt Gully, deserted their machine-gun and fled into our barrage, being fired on also by a Lewis gun.  Six only stayed to fight, and all were killed, as they refused to surrender.  In the northern enterprise against a position consisting of three posts, the raid was divided into three parties, one against each post.  The right and centre parties killed nine Germans and chased the remainder into the artillery curtain fire, which inflicted heavy losses.  The party on the left met with considerable opposition and was forced to kill 13 before the remaining four surrendered.  About 20 other enemy dead were seen on the ground killed by artillery fire.  The Australian casualties were very small.</p>
<p>Last night, again, the German lines were raided in two places between Villers-Bretonneux and the village of Hamel, north-east thereof.  The northern raiding party, from a West Australian battalion, met a large German garrison in a strong pear-shaped trench-redoubt to the west of Hamel village.  The raiders divided into two parties and bombed up their way along the forking trenches, while the artillery shattered the farther end of the defence work.  The raiders killed about 50 of the enemy and brought in five prisoners and three machine-guns.  The southern raid on trenches at the south-end of Vaire Wood was carried out by a party from a Victorian battalion attacking at three points.  The garrison at the centre hurriedly fled, but the enemy flanks stayed to fight and suffered heavily.  The right Victorian party dashed in upon the enemy on the exact second that the artillery fire was lifted off them.  The enemy had no time to man positions, and were unable to offer much opposition.  Twelve were killed and nine prisoners were taken here.  The centre party found that the garrison which had fled was located in a large dug-out, into which they flung down a bomb.  The bomb set the dug-out on fire, and steps had to be taken to dispose of any inhabitants.  The attacking party on the left met with a lively rifle and bomb fire from the advanced position before the enemy wire.  These positions were promptly rushed and the defenders killed except two, who were taken prisoners, and the machine-gun was captured.</p>
<p>The enemy casualties in these two raids were heavy, and 16 prisoners and four machine-guns were taken.  The prisoners include men of all three regiments of the German division.  One German battalion has been unfortunate in its experience.  It came up yesterday afternoon to relieve the line battalion.  Our aircraft spotted it marching up when far behind the lines, and called down the heavy artillery upon it.  As the column, after frequent scattering, got nearer to the ground, observers invoked our field artillery, which also pummelled it.  Finally, it had hardly taken its positions in the line last night when the Australians raided it and cut two companies about severely.</p>

<p>On the 16th, one of our planes was brought down by Strazeele Station, one of our heavies was firing at the time, and word goes, it was a direct hit from one of its shells.</p>
<p>223.<br/>An argument today with Tom.  Some of our propaganda falling on our own lines was sent up by Brigade.  One page of it I happened across, a page of four Baloon photographs of Boche dead &ndash; a great collection of dugouts evidently first hit directly, and then sudden salvoes amongst men collected about, a trench after a barrage falling, and outposts after bombing.  They were photographs of horrible pieces of warr, as familiar to either side as the sun's shining, as propaganda they appear even blatant.  Considering them as Boche photographs of our own dead:  how would they affect us?  Only one way:  they would arouse a dumb animal fury at their seeing, and on the night that followed the nearer and listening posts &ndash; and perhaps the whole immediate opposing trenches would be fiercely attacked.  But propaganda of any kind is hardly worth while &ndash; that is of course leaflet sheets from planes, their only value is a souvenir one.  At Ravelsberg the Boche baloons emptied upon us illustrated journals of collectings of Cambrai booty captured by them in Dec.  They would have fetched high prices if they'd been auctioned.</p>
