Sunday 
Another Sunday. Here away out on the battlefield with guns firing shells exploding.-what a contrast to a peaceful Sunday morning at home among all our dear ones. My thoughts have taken wing are back to the dear home scenes. God grant that we may all see them once more. Have no fear, but one wearies of this awful slaughter longs for the quiet calm peace of the homeland.
Fairly quiet night, nothing special doing shell caught fatigue party. out in front of dressing station. Terrible head wound of one victim, just at sunrise. Receive papers from Macs. last night a letter 2nd from Arch; this morn. His letters are highly amusing so like him. Spent all aft. in shell hole with Tony Jean's cake. Good old yarn. Did us both good. Note from Bob. re Cartwrights Nettletons haversacks.
