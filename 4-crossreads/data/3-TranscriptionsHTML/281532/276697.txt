<p>17/9/18 Cappy</p>
<p>Early this morning a young hurricane accompanied by lightening and thunder caused a great deal of damage in the trees along the Canal Bank. Formed up the whole Battalion for inspection at 9 a.m. and was not at all pleased with the turnout saying nasty things to a lot of people. Indeed today I have been very snaggy and excitable. The General came in just before lunch for a yarn but let drop no hint as to which of the Battalions is being broken up &ndash; this is the burning question at present. Afternoon nearly everyone was playing football and the matches were interesting. Feel dopey and cannot concentrate lately on any work. This tiredness is the tiredness of staleness I think. One can be too long on the job. 1914 men are hurriedly being pulled out first [indecipherable] for a trip home.</p>
