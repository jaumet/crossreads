At Sea
23/3/16
At breakfast we were about 40 miles South of Malta, a fine sunny morning with a calm blue sea and a cold wind. Paraded on the after well deck and took it easy in the sun after a strenuous half hour of physical exercises. Changed our course on coming in sight of Malta at 1045. 
A fair sized island terminating on the Western end in a high bluff. Apparently pretty clear of trees can see a fair sized town inland a little from the coast. On coming closer one sees the countryside is terraced and subdivided by small stone walls which in the distance seem like hedges. It is said that the island is almost solid rock and earth was shipped from other places deposited in these enclosures. The difference in height of adjoining blocks is sometimes much as 10 feet. 
We passed several forts and lighthouses and a tugboat met us off Valetta where we lay to for about an hour. Valetta appears to be a fair-sized town behind the breakwater could see some meno?war flying French colours and some other ships. There is a gradual rise from the sea and the general run of houses seem like Egyptian. A church tower overtops other buildings. An aqueduct was visible on the skyline and a ruined castle perhaps that of the Knights of Malta. The coast appears to be an easy one and some small yachts looked well with their white sails. The western extremity of the island terminates in a steep bluff which drops sheer into the sea. I should say the highest point on the island would not be more than 400 feet. The most singular thing without doubt is the terraced hillside with its hedge like walls.
Received a wireless that General Ivanoff had delivered a crushing blow to the Germans. Passed a torpedo destroyer going into Valetta. Left the island behind and are now steering towards Marseilles but zigzagging a lot. During the night we passed some islands and CAPE BON on the north coast of TUNIS. Dinner here is at 1900 which cuts the evening fairly short.
