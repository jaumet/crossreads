Swopped 100 pts for a sov  Secured good 4 berth cabin. Harry is with me. Grub fair so far. Left at 5.30; weather fine & cool. 
 23 Had a real good nights sleep & turned out about 7.30 Can hardly feel the boat moving  but  she runs so smoothly. Has a slight list to the Sbd side. 4.7 gun & 2 machine guns in the stern, so we are protected fore & aft, & of course there is the look out man, & sentries. Have to take life belts on deck with us. No Canteen yet so my sov is unbroken. Cool & cloudy weather with a fair breeze. Lifebelt & boat parade at 3 pm.
