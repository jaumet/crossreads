 Austra, [Austria] but I think it will be a long time yet before that happens.  It is getting very hot here now up to 110&deg; &amp; it is impossible to work in the middle of the Day.  We have been well treated &amp; have had good times here.  When we first came we were at Meana [Mena] Camp at the Perimid but after a month we came to Helioplis the other side of Ciro &amp; only four miles out of Ciro, the other camp was nine miles out.  At Helioplis we were camped on the race corse in the middle of the town which is a nice place &amp; only new it was built as a second Montie Carlo.  We used to be out every night when we were not on duty, &amp; we had plenty of fun.  Well before I joined the Army I  go  was with my Father at home &amp; was dealing &amp; working at home.  I had a very good time as Alex McCracken was on his father place five miles away, &amp; we as usual enjoyed our selves, plenty of hunting three times a week.  Of corse I am single &amp; have no desire to be any way, as I could never give up my freedom.  Oh, I forgot to say how pleased I was to hear of the arrival of you son, now be carefull and don't spoil him. 
 Over.
