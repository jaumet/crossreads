Saturday 21 December
Rotten weather, cold, windy wet there is not much to do in these parts.
Sunday 22 December
Another visit to Charleroi, about 17 kilos away, partly walking, then on a Belgians cart thence by tram. The City on Sunday is very gay indeed the streets thronged with people. Cafes, Cabarets Picture houses in full swing one, the Trianon caf picture house, is very good typically continental.
Place brilliantly lighted at night.
However, coming home in the dark, wet, windy, night getting very wet, partly a pied, partly  cheval, was not too brilliant.
