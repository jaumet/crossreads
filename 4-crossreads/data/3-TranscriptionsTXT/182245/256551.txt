 1917 FEBRUARY 
 5 MONDAY 
 Fine &amp; Sunny. Cleaning harness 
 all morning &amp; out exercising 
 horses in afternoon. Lieut 
 Rourke took over the 
 waggon lines from Capt 
 Campbell. They are not 
 loking forward to the change 
 either as Capt Campbell 
 had altered a lot since he 
 came to France. He has 
 lost a lot of his queeny 
 ways ect &amp; is more like 
 a man. Things very 
 quiet on the line. We 
 were all called out to draw 
 ammunition after tea. One 
 team had to take a load to 
 the Battery &amp; our team was 
 the unlucky one. Saw 
 Warren &amp; the boys up there 
 &amp; they were all well.
