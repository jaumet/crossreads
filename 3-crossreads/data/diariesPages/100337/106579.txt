Military Policeman was killed in the village of Codford a little while ago, so these Picquets are held in camp to prevent any reoccurance & restore order if any disturbance occurs in future.

On Sunday 24th Dec. I went to the village of Stocton & one or two other places. The village church at Stocton was built in the year 1300. Inside the building is a list of the different Rectors names dating back to the year 1300

Some of the ancient inhabitants of the village are buried in the church, The vaults of some are let into the wall & others are buried under the floor. A church in the village adjoining Stocton is a very old building being built in the year 1624. Some of the Tombstones are very old . some are dated in 17th century & others are in the 18th & 19th centuary.. some are even as recent as 1906 & 10. I walked slowly back to camp arriving in time for tea. At night I wrote a few letters. Monday December the 25th. Christmas-day
