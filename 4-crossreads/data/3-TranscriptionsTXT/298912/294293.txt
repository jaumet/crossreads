sulky with a long thin native pulling in between the shafts. It was peculiar to us & we had to laugh at one another.The first place we went past that was recognizable was the YMCA, a large red building on some spare land. This society has done some marvellous work in Colombo. From there we went on to a restaurant where we had some light refreshments & also where they charged such a high price that we walked out without paying anything - the native chasing Hoppy's rickshaw down the street. Next we visited the Buddhist Temple down one of the back streets, the building being a mass of carved stone & wood. One must take off their boots in order to enter here. We then visited another restaurant for more refreshments - we were genuinely hungry after 3 weeks of sop - & here Hop thought he made a bargain by buying a box of cigars cheap thanks to Bohm's Hindustani & other lingo Hop was saved & his money returned.
