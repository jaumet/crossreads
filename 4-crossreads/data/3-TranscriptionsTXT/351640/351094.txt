 What do I think of war, having lived for a week in its very midst. Concentrated my ideas are:/ 
 I How wonderful are the works of God: How great is the size of the world: How puny the efforts of man in it. 
 II But for the great Crime of the 19th Century, &ndash; The allowing by the British Government of the stream of manhood and womanhood, the best brain blood &amp; muscle that ever flowed from any country as emigrants, to go to foreign lands, instead of being directed into the outposts of the Empire. For sixty years it was a huge river &ndash;, if there be a modern Pyrrhus mongst the generals of the British army, and the people of the Colonies number twenty to thirty millions, offsprings of  a Caucasian   an Anglo-Celtic base, he would have a sufficiency of soldiers upon which to draw to enable him to bid defiance to all enemies of the empire and if he so desired to conquer the world. 
 Note:/ You may remember that Pyrrhus won the last battle he fought in Italy against the Romans. When walking over the field after it he noted that every dead Roman had his wounds in front. He said:- "If these were my soldiers or I their general we should conquer the world."
