At Sea
25/3/16
France was sighted on the starboard bow early this morning and running up the coast we expect to anchor in Marseilles harbour at about 1630.
It is a dull morning and grey seas are running, we can see high mountains in the distance upon which snow is plainly visible and the Chief Engineer pointed out where Monte Carlo is. The snow on these Alps seems very heavy and the air is very cold. We shall need all our heavy clothes in this country. The sight of the shores of France raises many speculations in our minds as to what that fair country has in store for us. 
After lunch Marseilles could be glimpsed nestling behind a curve in the coast, we stood close in to the precipitous cliffs which rise to the heights of the Maritime Alps. Lovely scenery, the rock appears of a light character and the slopes are wooded. Some of the cliffs are dreadfully steep and project sheer into the sea most abruptly. It was very pleasant running along this lovely place. Coming closer we began to take a most devious course tacking backwards and forwards. 
The first thing to catch the eye upon an eminence was a Cathedral on the top of which was a gilded image of Christ very large. Perched upon a high rock this overlooks the city and the brilliance of the statue attracts the eye. The city (about 500,000) is scattered along the shore and the high mountains rising close behind make an impressive background. To the right of the town is a thick forest of fine deep green trees nestling among which are many chateux. [indecipherable] green the roof of some is all that can be seen. A delightful scene. The factories seem to be segregated to one definite quarter. The buildings of the city appear solid and of good architecture. On the left of the harbour entrance are some forts and a palace here is pointed out as that from which the Count of Monte Christo leaps.
