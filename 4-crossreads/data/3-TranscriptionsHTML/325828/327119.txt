<p>No 7 T.S.  A.F.C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R  16.12.18<br/>Leighterton, Glos.<br/>England<br/>14-10-18</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I was very pleased to receive your three most interesting letters (21st July, 4th &amp; 5th of Aug) yesterday.<br/>In yours of 21st July, you say 2 envelopes have arrived home for me from Harry bearing the Papuan postmark &amp; date Dec/07.  Is this right?  11 years ago.  I expect you meant Dec/17.<br/>To explain the term "escargot running," I must make some other explanations.  Aeroplanes are fitted with one of two kinds of engines; either a stationary or a rotary.  In a stationary engine the cylinders are fixed &amp; the crankshaft to which the propellor is fixed (occasionally it is geared down) revolves at a high rate of speed.  This type of engine has a simple float carburettor (as in the motor car engine) which is controlled by a single lever, viz, the throttle.  In the rotary engine, however, the conditions are reversed.  The crankshaft is fixed &amp; the cylinders (to which is attached the propellor) in this case revolve.  The ordinary carburettor on this engine would be useless, so they have to fit a special type, which is operated by <u>two</u> levers, a throttle, &amp; a fine adjustment.  The fine adjustment mixes the proportion of petrol &amp; air, &amp; the throttle</p>
