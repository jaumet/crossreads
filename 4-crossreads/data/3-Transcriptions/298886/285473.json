<p>Two of my Signallers have been brought to prominence by having a fight this morning. A real "go" They had an argument in the tent So the report goes. And got into "belts" Not being much damaged so far They retired to a deep dry canal in the near vicinity and had the second issue there which was decided after a few minutes battle. One of the contestants came back, rather badly knocked about.</p>
