<p>Saturday 17 June 1916<br/>A quiet night at our part but heavy bombardment on left followed by a gas attack as a result of which we had to get up &amp; be ready with our helmets. It turned out to be a gloriously fine day &amp; the aerial activity was great, squadrillas of our machines scouting round &amp; being most heavily peppered by the enemy. One air encounter took place over the German lines opposite to us &amp; was most exciting, the machines being wonderfully handled : it looked as if one Taube was forced to descend. The ground very quickly dried up &amp; then the sunshine &amp; warmth were taken full advantage off, I myself having a bath in my half kerosene tin of water. A little straffing in the afternoon resulting in 5 casualties from their trench mortars.</p>
