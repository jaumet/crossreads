Saturday, All packed ready to leave went into London but had to ring-up at 1. p.m. to find out if I'm free; well did so & was informed could have the day.Met some of my pals, we had lunch together, then went to matinee at "The Coliseum." My, it is a magnificent building and the programme was excellent. We had a great laugh as well as a most charming afternoon. Did not leave there until 6. p.m. so had a dinner in the city, got back at nearly 10. p.m. tired out.Sunday. Slept in & had cup of tea & toast in our room next morning.
