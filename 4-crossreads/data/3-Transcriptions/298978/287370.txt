<p>three shells came sliding through the air and burst quite close to us &ndash; however, we are determined not to be done out of our swim,, so back into the water we go.<br/>The sea is a lovely colour. As I look out at the ships in the Bay it brings back to my memory my many sketching expeditions in that dear country far across the sea where it is happiness and sunshine, where Death is not ever waiting to reap, in so hideous a manner, the harvest that has been allotted him.</p>
<p>May 10<br/>Delirious again last night. "Stand to Arms" &ndash; B. Company will advance. Just before dawn every morning we had to "stand to arms" in readiness for a probable attack &ndash; it was all very eerie, dreary and cold in the thick morning mists &ndash; men would appear and disappear like phantoms.<br/>To-day we are in for a hot time; I am feeling very weak and helpless &ndash; I have been taking morphine, given me by the M.O. &ndash; I can now neither eat nor sleep. I wonder how many of us will be left by sunset.<br/>&ndash; I do hope dear old Margy (Captain Margolin)  won't get killed; he is such a fine fellow and brave beyond compare, though it's hard to say who isn't &ndash; all the lads are splendid!<br/>To-night the Light Horse are to take a trench facing Quinn's Post &ndash; their bombs have been giving us a hot time, causing many casualties &ndash; we hear the Turks are massing, so it's pretty certain there's going to be something doing &ndash; we are to be the supports</p>
