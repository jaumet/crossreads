<p>August 1915<br/>Wednesday 18<br/>Fine. Nothing to record. The same old monotonous "lookouts" up on the parapets the same sniping the same guns banging and knocking our a parapets about <u>"Drat 'em"</u> we get enough to do without always building up parapets.</p>
<p>Thursday 19<br/>Cloudy cool. Big drops of rain fell last night and have been threatening to fall all day. Borrowed a halfcrown off private Duffy to get a few luzuries off the "Canteen ship". The Major went down to try  &amp; get the articles for us but found that it contained nothing. No stores on board.</p>
