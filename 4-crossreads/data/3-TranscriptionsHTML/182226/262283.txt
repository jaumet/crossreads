<p>Saturday 18 September, 1915</p>
<p>Carried water. Four of us built a shelter for one of the gun numbers. I had a pretty rotten job emptying sandbags over the side of a steep hill in full view of the enemies trenches, was sniped at but they were rotten shots &amp; couldn&#39;t get within a foot of me. Anyhow the officer made me get down.</p>
<p>The Turks opened a furious artillery &amp; rifle fire at 5.15 &amp; lasting for 20 minutes. The air seemed alive with bullets &amp; the concussion almost made one sick. They got one of our poor chaps through the head &amp; another was hit by a shell.</p>
<p>I have to go on watch at 6 p.m., one of the men has just gone sick.</p>
<p>The Turks made a big attack on the left but were beaten back with heavy loss, that was the reason of the demonstration against this post.</p>
