<p>On Board Syd-Melb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recd 15.11.15 J.W.<br/>Thursday Mng 11-11-15<br/>My dearest Father,<br/>So far I am having the time of my life.  We pulled away from the wharf on Wednesday morning at 10 to 9- it was very hazy &amp; indistinct &amp; the wharf was soon hidden.  As soon as we went on board we were taken down to our Quarters.  The lowest deck down.  There are 282 men sit down to mess there &amp; it is very close &amp; stuffy.  All the port-holes are bolted on account of it being so close to the water-line.  I am writing this on the top deck about 8.30 A.M.  It is a beautiful sunny morning &amp; I am thoroughly enjoying myself.  We came to a standstill off Garden Island yesterday until &frac14; to 4.  Meanwhile I filled in the time with the hair-clippers.  Was better off to value of 8/6 when I finished- 6d. a time.  They are not a bad set on the whole barring 1 fellow.  He had charge of kit bags (white ones) from the Station Central to boat on a lorry but was a bit full with liquor &amp; let all the bags go down the hold.  After dinner we set to &amp; rumaged them out from below.  About 20 or 30 chaps have been Europeing so far but I have felt tip-top.  Meals on board are very good Breakfast Porridge, Genuine Irish Stew, Bread Butter Jam &amp; Tea.  Dinner Thick brown soup (bosca) roast beef cabbage &amp; spuds, &amp; boiled pudding.  Tea Cold Meat, Bread Butter Jam &amp; Tea.  Supper Biscuits &amp; cheese.  About 80&percnt; of us slept up on top deck last night.  Each man issued with a hammock &amp; two double blankets.  Turned in about 7.30 &amp; didn't wake till &frac12; past 5   We got two of our fellows down on the deck yesterday, the only 2 with moustaches &amp; hacked one half of the mou off with clippers &amp; scissors &amp; let them go.  They came back to me after &amp; got me to shave the rest of it off.  We have passed Green Cape (about 7.30 it was opposite to us)   Land in sight on starboard side, one of the crew told me we were 18 to 20 miles out from coast.  Expect to reach Melbourne Friday noon   Am hoping to get ashore, if not will send mails ashore.  Vessel pitching a good deal &amp; seems to be getting rougher.  Yesterday in harbor at Sydney the Gov Gen Munro Ferguson came on board &amp; inspected the remount unit.  He gave us all an address &amp; wished us God-Speed.  Big white breasted birds with brown wings been following us all the way from Sydney &amp; this morning thousands upon thousands of gulls in every direction, also sharks quite near the side of the vessel .   Will leave it now till there is further news.  Forgot to say I tore some cascara &amp; also some Sea Sick Preventitive crystals.  So far have no duties assigned to us.  None till we leave Melbourne behind.</p>
