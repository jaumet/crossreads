<p>armed merchantman &quot;Seydlitz&quot; &amp; 2 large colliers, after having sunk &quot;Good Hope&quot; &amp; &quot;Monmouth&quot; off Valparaiso on Nov. 4th., steamed round Cape Horn with the avowed intention of destroying the town of Port Stanley &amp; the wireless station there.&nbsp; They then intended to leave for German South West Africa.&nbsp; It was supposed that information was transmitted to the German Admiral Von Spee as to the whereabouts of the wireless station, etc. by a Chilian whaler which had been in Port Stanley for some time, &amp; which had probably been sent by the German authorities.&nbsp; From time to time this whaler went out to try &amp; meet the German Fleet.&nbsp; However, before the arrival of the Germans, the fleet under the command of Admiral Sturdee, sent out to destroy Von Spee&#39;s squadron by the Admiralty, arrived at Port Stanley to coal &amp; clean&nbsp; boilers.&nbsp; Precautions were taken for the defence of the harbour &amp; look-outs were placed on the hills overlooking the approaches to the harbour.&nbsp; These look-outs were supplied from the local inhabitants.&nbsp; The English fleet consisted of the battle cruisers &quot;Inflexible&quot; &amp; &quot;Invincible&quot;, the cruisers &quot;Cornwall&quot;, &quot;Kent&quot;, &quot;Glasgow&quot;, &quot;Carnarvon&quot;, &amp; the battlship &quot;Canopus&quot;.&nbsp; The Chilian whaler was not allowed to leave the harbour.&nbsp; About 9 a.m. on December 8th. whilst the ships were coaling, one of the look-outs ashore reported 5 ships approaching at a great distance.&nbsp; These were identified as the German squadron under Von Spee.</p>
