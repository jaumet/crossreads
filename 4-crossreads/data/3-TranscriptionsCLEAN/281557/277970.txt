  
 2 V. C.  (by a modest Private) & drowned those who fell in their sleep We fought we charged we battled Till the eighth line of trenches we took For every man there was a hero From me to the poor old cook & there was the knoll just before us Some two hundred paces or more With barbed wire entanglements glistening & the parapets slippery with gore & the Howitzers roared like perdition & vomited fire & death Till we saw it was madness to charge them so halted a moment for breath. Then up came our gallant major His face lit with hopes cheering bliss Pass the word for pte juggins He'll find us a way out of this. If there's on thing I hate it is skiting when I hear it I always feel sore So you won't think Im boasting when I tell you He ought to have sent for me before A great cheer arose as I faced him & said Sir I'll see you through. I've a scheme in my head that will beat them & we'll wallop them black & blue. Then I shook hands with all the battalion (There was only 13 of us left) & they cheered me again till the foemen must have thought us of senses bereft So I gathered my arms & my rations & girded myself for the fray. If I live to be ninety or over I'll always remember that day.
