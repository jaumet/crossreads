<p>Don't write any more to me. To-day I saw the doc. man and in a day or SO I will be on my way to the Base and thence to England for discharge. I told the doctor that I had at first thought of trying for the six months leave, but had decided at last to make a shot at discharge. He said "I'm very glad that you've decided as you have; it's much the best &ndash; I'll fix my end of it up right away - you'd better get your things packed - you'll be off in a day or so." There's no doubt I'm too seedy to do any good. When I get over we can discuss the next step to be taken. I don't care a cuss for the commission side of it, all I feel, like now is getting free to get well and be with you and the children. I hope this news will buck you up and that you will not worry about anything else till I come over. Then, I'll do the worrying for you. How I long for the time to fly so that I can be with you again. The weather is magnificent and all goes well here. The King and Sir Douglas were up to-day - but I missed seeing them. At any rate I can say I've been on deck when the tide turned and it won't be too long before it'll be a tidal wave.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN BASE DEPOTS<br/>France, Aug. 18th, 1913.<br/>Since my last letter I have been continuously on the move. H. Q. moved from the camp in the wood to some dug-outs in a quarry. I stayed behind at the chateau in order to deliver my work to my 0. C. who on Friday afternoon turned up with Ben, in a car. On the Friday morning I had tried to find him at his museum dump at Longueval just out of Amiens, but he was away. I had a good look at this Museum in embryo and they undoubtedly have a vast quantity of most interesting, trophies; tank guns (enormous rifles mounted on a bipod), field electricity generators (a tandem, stationary cycle on which a couple of men can pedal away making "juice" for wireless apparatus) surgical outfits, etc., etc., etc. But you don't want an Inventory of them. One thing; their latest booty shows inferior material. They must be getting mighty short of things. They're resorting to poor substitutes. It turned out that there wasn't enough room in the car</p>
