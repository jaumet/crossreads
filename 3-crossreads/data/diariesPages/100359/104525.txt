Thursday 23rd.
Another days loafing to get over our sore arms. We paraded in our helmets to-day for the first time, and they looked very well. Gee whiz! Here I am passing over yesterday's great events. The Prince of Wales inspected the camp to-day. We were busy all the morning making our camp look as smart as possible. Then for about 2 hours we were hanging around with our tunics and belts on, but the Prince didn't have time to come and have a look at us. It was good to see him inspecting the Infantry Battalion. They looked real well formed up out in the desert with their bayonets flashing in the sun. As the Prince reviewed each Battalion they put their helmets on their bayonets and gave 3 roaring cheers. In the afternoon a big mail came in, and I got 3 letters from Lill 1 from Nell and the Photo, Hooray. It was good to gaze on Lill's dear old face again. Although the picture is not too good. I wrote back, straight away, Bad luck my pen has gone bung, so now I've got to fall back on the pencil. There is some talk about our mail being kept back in Egypt for some time. This certainly looks like business.
