No stamp or date]<br/>Dearest Woof,<br/>I was so glad to get your two nice letters yesterday, and it was on your birthday too, and I woke up about 1 o'clock in the morning and wished you many happy returns of the day, and I hope I will be home before many moths to kiss &amp; hug you all. I wish I had been home when you were all warming yourselves in front of that new fireplace at Franurra<br/>Lots of love from Dad</p>
