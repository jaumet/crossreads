bombs on Cairo the other day, but we have had absolute peace since the day after our arrival.  A hostile plane appeared the other day but was winged by our A.A. guns & forced to unload his bombs on nothing & fly ignominiously, which was exceeding good to see.I find the pleasure of solitude - my house contains me & me only - very pleasant.  I have no intimate companion now, they are all gone - Threlfall killed on the Peninsula, Yeats gone to England, Tommy Rutherford, England, etc. etc., and I find that it is better to be in a position to please yourself than have to consult one whose wishes do not always run with yours.
