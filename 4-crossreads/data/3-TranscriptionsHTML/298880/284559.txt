<p>broken very badly at that by shell fire. On <strike>Saturday night Saturday</strike> Sunday night three men &amp; myself started out with about &frac34; mile of DIT cable to find the trouble &amp; mend it. About half way between H.Q. &amp; the front line we found the cable smashed to smithereens. We found one broken end to the line on the drum &amp; started off to run an earth return line to the firing line. We accomplished this &amp; got back safely once more. During our stunts the other line was patrolled nightly by two others of the section &amp; their job was no less risky. "Last night was a beautiful moonlight night too". Now after all our trouble <strike>on</strike> both lines are 'out' again. It would send a man grey headed in no time.</p>
