  
 you visit my home in England in 20 years time you'll see this tin on my mantelpiece.  I invited 8 Privates for Xmas tea from the camps (Adelaide boys)  Among them two Botting boys Frank & Mark & my two nephews.  In the evening we went for a long walk & how pretty the Harbour looked c 3 or 4 hundred battleships. Troopships etc & 10 Hospital ships all lit up. Though we haven't heard officially- everything points to us moving.  All the English patients have gone- The Austs as fast as they can & each day sees less wards & less patients- where to is the ?  Our Xmas mails have been held up somewhere. I must tell you this tit bit.  It happened a few nights ago in the small hours of the morning.  A Sentry with his gun was put on to guard some goods.  A Sister c Tommy Coat pajamas & balaclava cap on had to pass him & he thinking she was a man called out Halt (She) hurrying (he) Halt I say halt you in the pajamas  halt  (She) running now & he after her  Then she turned & indignantly said "What is it to you where I am going?" he absolutely flabbergasted stammered out 'I  be- beg  your par- par- pardon Sister  I thought you was a man.(exit) New Years Eve-  Such a week of surmising & wondering when we are going & where- Such a washing up of things & packing- We are having days off & nights off & we are seeing as much of the Island as we can & everyone appeared to be taking snap shots.  Since Xmas day the enemy Areplanes have been busy but have not heard of them doing any damage.
