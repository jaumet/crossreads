Friday 7 April 1916A rather warmer night & slept comfortably through it. During the morning got my things straightened out & then had a parade for inspection by the camp commandant, but at the last minute he sent word to say that it would not be held until the next day. It turned out a dull grey day & was taken up with getting the men settled in their tents & handing in lists of shortages. In the evening went down to Etaples for dinner.
