 continent. We called at this port for the purpose of coaling the ship, and the coal which was loaded by the natives, was brought out in lighters so that the ship might stop out in the Stream, preventing the soldiers from visiting the Town. The natives at St. Vincent are principally occupied in coaling vessels as there seems to be no vegetation on the Island. The necessary water, and beans (which is their staple food), is brought from adjacent islands. These islands are owned by Portugal, and the natives have adopted the Portuguese language with a little English thrown in, (especially swear words). I must not forget to mention the natives who came to the ship's side in small boats selling port cards, beads and tropical fruit. The sea was running a fast current where we were anchored and the natives very skilfully used their oars to keep their boats alongside the ship. It was very interesting to watch the natives diving into the sea for money which the troops threw in liberally. 
 After being two days at St. Vincent we sailed to our next port which was our port of landing, viz. Plymouth. On entering Plymouth we passed the Eddystone Lighthouse which of course was interesting to us, as most of us had read of it in our school papers when we went to School. We are now in Plymouth Harbour and are disembarked from the ship after 9 weeks' and 2 days' life on it, and embarked on two small vessels which carried us right up to the wharf where a train was in waiting for us to take us to Salisbury Plains; the place in which we would camp and do our training. 
 It was about 1.30 a.m. in the morning and very dark when we got into the train and moved off. On our way we passed through a town called Exeter, the Mayoress of which gave us Coffee and Buns, gratis. on the Station. I might say we appreciated this kind deed very much and I have to this day a card which is a souvenir of the occasion wishing me good luck and a safe return. 
 We, however, reached Salisbury plains (Aynesbury Station) at about 5o'clock the same morning, when we were confronted with the thought of a 5 mile march from the station to the camp. Those marching thoughts became very real in about 30 minutes for we were on the move. After our long idleness on the ship, we boys were very
