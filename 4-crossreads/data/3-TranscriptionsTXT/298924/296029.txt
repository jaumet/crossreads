 Sunday 16 February 1919 Khamsin blowing.  R.C. service in Y.M.C.A.  We have a Priest of sorts attached to the Regt. Busy trying to carry on War History but I have only done one year so far.  Hope to finish on the Boat.  Leave not sanctioned until Brigade returns from Cairo.  He, Gen. C- is no friend of mine like old J.B. Meredith was.
