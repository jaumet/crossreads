<p>Friday Xmas Day 25th Dec. 1914<br/>Still beautiful sea, one of our horses had to be shot to-day &amp; thrown overboard, there is another one will die during the night. Met one of Burrawong Renold's boys to-day, Aubrey Renolds, strange that I never ran across him before considering he is in the same Squadron as myself, C Troop. Our Troop leader Mr Hordern presented each of us with a pipe and tin of tobacco for Xmas present, he also presented the Regiment with a huge Xmas cake.<br/>[Renolds should be Reynolds]<br/>Saturday 26th Dec. 1914<br/>Nothing of interest.</p>
<p>Sunday 27th Dec. 1914<br/>Allocated Life-Belts &amp; Boats to-day also positions in which to form up in case of fire.</p>
<p>Monday. 28th Dec 1914<br/>Another horse overboard to-day, expect to be in Albany early in the morning, have caught a slight cold.</p>
<p>Tuesday 29th Dec. 1914<br/>Arrived in Albany Bay this morning 6 A.M. Anchored in Albany Bay waiting for the rest of the troopships (&amp; our escort) there are 15 anchored here at present, the smallest 12000 tons and the largest 18000 tons, the Ciranic, the largest boat ever sailed into Sydney Harbour. It is a grand sight to see them all alight in the bay tonight. The Coast is very rough here all Mountains, can's see any sign of the town, posting some letters home today</p>
