  
 Dear George, 
 Just a P.S. in answer to your letter of January. We have started our Summer Time Table so it is quite light yet & it is only 8 p.m.  When in London I met Bainty Duscheyne. He is still small but looks older. Ellis is up at the mess somewhere. I've got only 12 letters left to answer so I am going to try a full half-a-dozen more down tonight. I have not been to Salisbury for a long while. It is often after 1 am when a fellow gets home & it is such a horrible slow journey. Hurry up with those photos & try & get some of the Dee Why House.  I am glad to hear that you had such a nice long holiday. I get a fair amount of time off. I see to that. I hope to be going away to see Auntie Annie again on the 13th March. Oh well George I have given Dad & Mum all the news so I'll wish you all Health & Happiness also Lily. Her mother is one of the Mills girls.  Your loving brother Harry.
