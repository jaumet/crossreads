Monday, 18 January, 1915Well, it is settled now we are going to Zeitoun in about 10 days time to join the N. Z. and make one big camp of the 1st L.H. Brigade.  S. & N. Z. div.  We have route marches in the morning now and stretcher drill in the afternoon, everyone abhors it & tries to dodge it.
At night there was a fine lecture in the recreation tent on Mohomadenanism [Muhammadanism] by the American missionary in Cairo - Dr Rowntree.  It was instructing & interesting & showed us what an enormous following this strange religion has.
Tuesday, 19 January, 1915Every thing points to our sports meeting & concert being a big success, we have over 10 subscribed in prize money & refreshment fund.
A hospital ship from Aust. with all the doctors on board arrived in Cairo a few days ago.  Pneumonia is very prevalent one of our tent mates is in the Citadel hospital in a severe condition with it.
Our hospital is doing marvellous work since we have been here there have been 200 admissions to the hospital and over 500 out patients, showing what a heavy percentage the illnesses in this camp, and yet it is called a health resort.
On picquet at night, man brought in with a fractured jaw.
