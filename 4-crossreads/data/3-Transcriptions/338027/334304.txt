<p>To my Mother</p>
<p>So your baby has sailed away to war<br/>He could not resist the call<br/>And your heart is sad, but proud to know<br/>That you have given the nation your all</p>
<p>The three that you nursed in childhood<br/>Who to manhood now have grown<br/>The three your castles were built on<br/>And the dreams we have never known</p>
<p>Sacrifice is a duty of war<br/>That mothers have sadly learnt<br/>And prouder have a soldier son<br/>Than keep a coward spurned</p>
<p>You must feel proud to think now<br/>That your duty has been obeyed<br/>And three of your sons were fighting<br/>In the name Australians made.</p>

<p>To my friends mother</p>
<p>I realize your love, friend<br/>Of which you often speak<br/>A mother's love is sacred,<br/>Tho' her son be strong or weak</p>
<p>And I know the bond is strengthened<br/>When we are far away,<br/>Mother's love is telepathy<br/>And through this bond they pray</p>
<p>For the baby they reared to manhood<br/>For he is their baby still.<br/>Striving in a nation's crisis,<br/>Manhood's duty to fulfill.</p>
<p>We are helping the helpless<br/>In the cruellest of all wars<br/>Whilst mother brushes the tear away<br/>And helps in the needful cause.</p>
<p>I have a mother like you friend<br/>And my feelings are just the same,<br/>It is up to us to reward their love<br/>And make them proud of our name.</p>
