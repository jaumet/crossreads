 1:  After 4 days leave, felt much better, but still on quinine though they diagnosed my case as pyrexia &amp; debility.  Left at 2 a.m. in a nicely appointed hospital train as a walking case arriving at 24th G.H. Kantara 10 a.m.  This place was filthy, the sheets &amp; linen in a disgusting condition &amp; took all linen off my bed, using only my blankets.  Place in charge of a V.A.D. &amp; did not see a doctor all day. 
 2:  Doctor visited the ward at 8 a.m., sending me to the base an hour later &amp; glad to get away from the filthy place.  Reached Cairo after a comfortable trip at noon, going to 3rd Gen. Hosp. where Sister Briggs was in charge of the ward G7.  Still down as pyrexia, another test proving negative.  Taken off quinine by the lady doctor who gave me a good overhauling.  Feeling much better &amp; had a clean comfortable bed. 
 3:  Doctor allowed me to get up on the verandah &amp; am anxious to get out of the Tommy place.  Doctors &amp; Orderlies are English, but the Sisters are Aussies.  Food is disgusting, bread &amp; dripping for breakfast, tea &amp;
