<p>Start 18 October, 1914<br/>Our Reveille went at 4.30 am and we got up &amp; started packing all our kits were already gone we only had to take our marching order uniform, we had to ride our own horse and lead two others.  We left camp about 7.30 on route to Melb, we were cheered enthusiastically all along the route.  My pony was a trifle sore mouthed &amp; several times tried to buck me off.  We arrived about ten and at once commenced shipping our horses.  This was done without a hitch and at noon we were all ready to sail.  We were towed out with only two hours warning amidst cheers from the large crowd on the wharf mostly idle sightseers they cheered enthusiastically &amp; we responded with songs.</p>
<p>Monday, 19 October, 1914<br/>The previous night we slept in ships hammocks &amp; they take a lot of getting used to, I slept like a top.  Going through the Sth Channel of the Vic Heads the old tub rolled a bit and there were a lot sea sick.  I was not sick but very squeamish before breakfast.  We had to do stable duties, muck out &amp; feed &amp; water.  It is a tedious process especially when you feel a bit queer.  The weather all day was wonderfully calm but the boat rolled a good deal.  The food was a surprise to us &amp; much superior to camp the day passed without much excitement.</p>
