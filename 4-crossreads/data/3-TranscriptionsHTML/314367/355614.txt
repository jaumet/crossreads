<p>I didn't feel too strong so I just quietly walked to the old square with the Casuarinas on 3 sides where I saw the flag hoisted &amp; had another look at it &ndash; It was quite quiet &amp; very green &ndash; The Poincianas with their green flat tops flaring with red bloom attract your attention &ndash; Nature is revelling in the warmth &amp; moisture  &amp; Crotons &amp; Mangoes &amp; Euphorbias vie with each other in growth &ndash; At the P. Office skiving in &amp; out in the small garden were a mob of small swifts or martins - <u>So</u> swift &amp; <u>so</u> small &ndash; They looked to me at first like big butterflies &ndash; Tell Rawdon I heard a Cooee bird the other morning &ndash; He's an Indian migrant &ndash; a black cuckoo &ndash; Remember him at Gayndale &ndash;</p>
