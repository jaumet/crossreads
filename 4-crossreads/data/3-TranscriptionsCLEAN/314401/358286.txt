While we are at sea there is nothing doing, except, shoving the ship along. During the day we sail in two lines with the Montcalm abeam of us and we sail merrily on. We are getting nearer the Equator & the weather is getting muggy but thank goodness, my cold is nearly gone. We arrived in Suva, Fiji this morning at 8 o'clock, & here we stay till tomorrow while the smaller ships take in coal. We have had no news of any value, or very little since the war began, & we were anxiously waiting for the first man to board us. He was not able to tell us much. Something about the Germans being at Brussels, Ghent & Ostend, & the English Army at Mons. Japan we hear has declared war & is bombarding Kian Chau, the German port in China. It is Wed. Aug 26 and at 8 a.m., the prearranged time we drop our anchor in the bay opposite the town of Suva. Fiji is one of the places that everybody wd. like to see sooner or later but the conditions are not favourable. It is raining hot water & is generally unpleasantly muggy. The Commander as usual, good fellow as he is, shows again his awful ,lack of tact. There is no danger & there is nothing to do except wait for the smaller ships to coal. He won't let any of the men go ashore & incidentally prevents the officers. We say hard things of him & to him but he says he doesn't care a damn what the officers think of him. We had the mortification of watching the Montcalm's people go to stretch their legs ashore. We had some of their wardroom officers aboard us today. They are most charming & we enjoyed their visit immensely. The town looks exceedingly pretty, & when we come back as we expect to do, next week, there may be just a chance of getting to look at it. We might have had a cinema show had it remained fine. As it is any films are still behind armour. I wish I cd. write a love letter. I believe I will next opportunity. These matter of fact letters are all very well in their way   but they are very tame. It is Sept 12th now, which makes it seventeen days since I wrote last. The most of that time I spent on my back, lungs
