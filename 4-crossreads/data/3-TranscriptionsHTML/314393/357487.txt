<p>As soon as it was known that our "C &amp;  D" company had succeeded in gaining there objective a number of "A" Company self included had to set out with picks &amp;  shovels to consolidate the new position. On reaching the position we were taken out a little advance of the trench that had been captured where each man was given about nine feet of tunnel to dig being told to get down as quick as possible for we would have to stay there when daylight arrived. The digging was very easy for the ground was very soft but after getting well down we received orders to evacuate the position for it was found that the huns had secretly made their way back into their old front line &amp;  were in a communication trench on our left &amp;  also were occupying a ridge in front of us this being caused through the 1st Battalion not coming up on our left. It was nearly daylight when we left this position but luckily it was carried out successfully without any casualties but we were lucky to get out of the position for the Huns would have made things very uncomfortable for us. It was late that morning when I arrived back in the support line being absolutely fagged out but managed to have a well earned rest if it could be termed such in the mud. Whilst in this support line I witnessed one of our aeroplanes being set on fire by two enemy planes which was a great sight although very disastrous for our airman. During the afternoon &amp;  night of the 5th our heavy artillery started to fire short, causing a fair number of casualties to our platoon who was occupying the front line also blowing them out of a new front line which they had recently dug compelling them to reire to the old original Front line. Late that night I had to take my platoon to the front line on fatigue to clear out the trench which our artillery had filled in &amp;   although the boys worked hard to complete the job we received orders to remain in the front line until "Stand to" the next morning. Good news came our way next morning the 6th for orders were issued to pack up all our gear ready to move.<br/>[The image contains a hand drawn sketch map titled "Rough Sketch Flers showing trench systems in the vicinity of Flers]</p>
