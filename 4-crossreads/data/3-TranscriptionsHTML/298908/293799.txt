<p>some sloppy tea.  Needless to say this did not appeal to us so after a wash &amp; a clean up we set off down to the town.  The first thing was for a shave &amp; brush up, then into a restaurant for something to eat, after this a stroll round the town which from what I can see of things appears to be pretty lively but chock full of sailors of all sizes &amp; sorts this is only natural for it is one of England's great naval bases.  Plymouth &amp; Devonport are almost the same town for only a mile or so separates them &amp; the scenery round about is very beautiful especially coming along the coast the line follows the shore for quite a distance &amp; some very good views are to be had.  We strolled round the town till 10 o'clock then back by train to St. Budeaux &amp; so to Camp &amp; sleep.</p>
<p>15th.  800 men marched in late last night from France, they are camped just over the road opposite us so I expect there will be quite a number of old faces among them after things are fixed up I am going over to have a look among them.</p>
