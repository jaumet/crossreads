3the cable you sent me to Lemnos & also for the good wishes it embodied.It is awfully hard work writing subject matter here which is not censorable.Did I tell you I saw Beatrice Russel Glasson?I am writing part of this as I wait outside the Dentist's tent here. His name is Lt. Amphlett. He really seems to take a lot of trouble with our teeth & it is a God sent to be able to get them done.Very sorry to hear you had to go to Moxham & hope he did not give you much pain.Please remember me to Frank & Mrs Dight when you write.Very much love to you allEver your loving brotherFred
