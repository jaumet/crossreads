 Dear Mum, 
 I suppose it is up to me to write you another letter after getting 3 from you a few days ago amongst a bundle of 13.  I was jolly glad to hear how well &amp; fat you had got during your holiday &amp; only hope you keep so, if you dont be sure &amp; take another such holiday.  You must have had a glorious time at Crookwell &amp; Woodville &amp; all the different picnics you were telling me of must have been great.  They make my mouth water but still they wont compare
