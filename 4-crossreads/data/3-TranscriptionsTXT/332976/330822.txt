With a party of infantry I went back to the "pack track" near "Millerson Son" to repair a part of it.   The ground is in a deplorable state, one mass of shell holes & trenches & in places the "track" is almost impassable.  The Gourdicourt Rd is now open & will probably relieve it of a lot of the traffic.
