<p>Monday 12 August<br/>Fine day.</p>
<p>Busy in office in morning then line to 10th Bde out again. Long tramp to big valley, found &frac34; miles cut out. Reeled up line round a big bend, took a short cut and restored the break. Wrong lines jointed &ndash; so swapped over.</p>
<p>Home about 5 p.m. Had dinner after bit of trouble. Fixed up lines, attended to office business until late.</p>
<p>Moving out tomorrow.</p>
