The first duty or rather a rehearsal, which was a parade for Medical Inspection. All troops and passengers were ordered down below and the Officers were posted to positions all over the Ship, and at a signal all hands had to march upstairs on deck and two Officers counted them as they passed up the Stairs, this will be carried out when the Health Officer's at Fremantle board the Ship on Arrival. Tomorrow Morning is Hammocks Blankets and Missing Utensil's Inspection to see if anything is missing from the Troops Deck's, Friday is our Mess Competition Friday the Competition's for the Prize's for the best Mess will be decided on our Deck and this time four Prizes are to be awarded, 1st 2, 2nd 1/10/-, 3rd 1, and 10/- for fourth. I am a competitor again and am giving the other Messes something to do to beat me this time, as I won the first competition, they are trying to prevent me from taking the 1st prize, and I am keeping them all very busy in polishing and cleaning up. The full particulars of the constitution of the Digger's Supreme Court was printed as a Souvenir in Durban and sold to the Boy's at 9d each, which I intend adding to my Diary Shortly as it is worth reading and very interesting. Up to date we have had very little rain but the winds are very cold and Overcoats are required of an Evening up on Deck. The Health of all on board is excellent having no seriouss serious illness and all are cheerfull.
