A road led into the interior cut into the side of one of the mountains  Napoleons house was a few miles inland at a small village called Longwood.  [Inserted photo titled "In the roadstead.   St Helena."]  The SS Britain, which had left Capetown after us, arrived at St Helena before us, being a much faster boat - a Castle Liner. The mate told me a few things about St Helena.  Chief town Jamestown.   Length of island, 9 miles Breadth 5 miles.   3000 inhabitants.   Chief products Indigo, cotton, and fruit.   The inhabitants were not sufficiently interested in us to come off and see us so I dont know what they were like, or whether their color was white black or kiwi. Jan 4   We left the island on 4 January at 11 am.  I took a photo of the whole island when we got far enough away, but it was even worse than the other.    At six am on the 8 Jany
