  
 a snow storm. Saw Birdwood strolling up the road yarning to the chaps. The roads were all frozen hard & very slippery it taking us about an hour to get up one hill. The horses find it difficult to keep their feet even while walking much less pulling a load. Our division is now being relieved by the 2nd but so far have not met Morris. 
 Friday 22nd December. More rain during the last three days & roads becoming soupy again. Fritz bombarded all round us on Wednesday & blew up some huts killing & wounding several. He kept it up all day sweeping the whole area of the valley & cutting the railway at one point. Next day Morris's batt. arrived & I followed him up & had a good long yarn. I brought him back to camp & gave him some socks, comforters & a sheepskin. Our bearers have now gone back & we follow tomorrow having spent a month in this delectable spot.
