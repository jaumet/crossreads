The Vital Drafts
More Queenslanders are yet required&nbsp;as reinforcements most urgently needed in fact,&nbsp;to don the colour of glory - Khaki &amp; a sympathetic encouragement to the promptings of this Patriotism, will create the proper frame of mind in that section of civil eligibles, whom the public consider slid&nbsp;Volunteer to enlistors&nbsp;supply the&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;vital drafts.
Complement of Education
The tute to England
The Queensland Recruiting Committee on many occassions have emphasised, as an enducement&nbsp;to men&nbsp;to enlist, the great advantages of a free&nbsp;trip&nbsp;voyage to Europe.&nbsp;on active service. I can commend that as the best material argument&nbsp;that&nbsp;where&nbsp;when persuasian is necessary to encourage men to volunteer. The education began by the State is extended by the trip,&nbsp;or a trip can be considered as the complement of State Education.
