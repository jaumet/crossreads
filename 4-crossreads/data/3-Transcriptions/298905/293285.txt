<p>pretty green &amp; leafy trees, so as if a German came over he could not see us, the padre preached a very good sermon.<br/>Yesterday was payday here &amp; the boys were very merry, but they behave themselves well here. We also had a full muster parade yesterday, &amp; while the inspection was on a Taube came over &amp; we had to get back in our billets<br/>News is coming through of the advance our chaps &amp; the French are making, I suppose it is just a feeler before the real thing comes off which I expect will be next month or September.<br/>Nearly everyone seems to think the 1st Div. are shortly going to England, to be trained in Street fighting &amp; etc. I hope its true what a time the boys would have in old England</p>
