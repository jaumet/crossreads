<p>15<br/>Orsova is in you look at the height of her stern and you will see you need to be a bit of a monkey to manage the up trip at any rate. And yet it was only necessary to have one chap on board, and that was accomplished by <strike>a rope</strike> placing a rope under his armpits, and with a series of sudden jerks we managed to yank him on board.

We broke off when out of earshot, and could hardly stop from choking.</p>
