<p>and at 6.30 I went out with Tucker, O'Neill and Nagel &amp; marked out some more trench for our nightly amusement.  60 men came and did a 2 yd task each.  <strike>Home</strike> Knocked off at 12 and walked about 5 kilos to Borre.  Fairly comfortable in a room between Edmonds &amp; myself with a good soft bed.  Slept well.</p>
<p>4.5.18<br/>Up at about 9 and after breakfast started looking round.  Before tea had a table, 4 chairs, 2 (armchairs) with wine glasses, decanters, butter and jam dishes, tablecloth, lamp kerosene, a big mirror and other comforts.  Lots of gear left behind and a lot ruined.  Went out with 4 others with Avery No. 3 and spitlocked out some trenches for tomorrow's work.  Back at 1.  Fairly quiet.  Cloudy.  Paid in afternoon.  Very quiet here.  Also boiled some water in aftn. for drinking and made some cocoa.  Sultry.</p>
<p>5.5.18, Sunday<br/>Up for breakfast and in morning cleaned up and wrote diary.  Some rain and sunshine &amp; fresh breeze in aftn.  A battery close by was heavily shelled in morning and afternoon by 10" shells.  Only about 400 yds away some of the shells.  Out at 8 o'clock with Sparkes, Sidman and Toogood and completely finished the spit-locking.   7 Infantry digging in the trench.  Kernot did not come round so stopped at 12.30.  Fairly rough coming</p>
