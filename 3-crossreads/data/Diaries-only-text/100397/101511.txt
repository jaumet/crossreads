My Dear Mother
Had a short note from H. yesterday with Letter from yourself and Betty enclosed, I was very glad to know that you were about again, and getting better, I have not received any Australian mail myself for sometime, but when I rejoin the Battn and have a more settled address I daresay I will receive letters more regularly. Sine I left Wareham I have only received English letters, I just reached this camp the night before H left for the Sig ? School at Grantham. I went up to his lines to see him but found that he had gone. he may be 6 or 8 weeks at the school. and there is no knowing what may happen in that time We leave at 8 P.M. tonight for France. and I suppose we will be in the Depot there by Tomorrow night. I hope so, any way. This camp is not a very nice place, just at present, mud in plenty, and food is not as plentiful as might be. we get stew, thickened up with flour, more flour than anything else. it is growing rather monotonous ? and men are asking to be sent to France everyday.
