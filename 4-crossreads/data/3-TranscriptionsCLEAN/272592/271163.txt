  
 I can hear the heavy firing quite distinctly down on the "Somme" & the vibration in the air is easily felt everything seems quivering 
 Have had quite a busy day what with booking & inspecting all the firing bays & arranging for the supply of bombs & etc. getting the fatigue partes together, making a dump for the "crater snatching" partys tools & cutting the barb wire into proper lengths for tonights wiring party & over seering a lot of the little jobs & inspecting all gas helmets I have had scarce a minute for myself. 
 28th.   D Coy had 1 man killed & 2 wounded last night on their wiring party, Dave Mason & I put ours out, & got in safely.
