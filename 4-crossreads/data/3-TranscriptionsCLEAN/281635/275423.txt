  
 14/10/17 Sunday. On working party to front line but 9 of us only got 1/2 way as all too fatigued to keep up. Were trying to get to front but Fritz started heavily shelling our track so had to turn back. Had lunch there among some old dugouts (w[h]ere there were numbers of dead & horrible stinks) then did 2 hours work on the railway line with the Tommies. Got back at 4.30pm just in time for tea feeling terribly tired & worn out. Track was very heavy with mud all way out. Went bed 6pm & slept well.
