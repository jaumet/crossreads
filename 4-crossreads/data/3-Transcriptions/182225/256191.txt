<p>1916 &nbsp; SATURDAY 5 &nbsp; FEB.</p>
<p>Raining in morning but it cleared up in afternoon &nbsp;We got off guard about 4.30 pm &amp; I got the 5.40 train to Sydney, had a bath&nbsp;at the Metropole &amp; had a hot bath &amp; then met Linda on the wharf. Got a taxi up to Tissots &amp; had dinner &amp; went to &quot;So Long Letty&quot; at Her Majesty&#39;s. It was the prettiest piece I have seen for a long time &amp; not so board as I was led to believe. I think Linda liked it also, but she was very tired when we got home</p>
