 away . The villag I am now in is call Dickiebusch is a rural kind of place with veri rural peopl for it inhabit . It is onli about half a mile from Reninghelst 3 mile from Poperingh . This latter place alway contain a larg amount of pleasur for the troop in the shape of Cinema show etc , but be so awkward to go to is not patronis veri much by soldier from our end . The CO came back from England today have been away on leav . They are call for applic for Cadetship in the Royal Fli Corp . I never heard of it until too late otherwis I might have had a go for it . I receiv a veri nice parcel from Nina today was pleas it came at a good time content will be appreci . Now that we are so far North we can all feel the chang in the Air , It is just like when we use to have sever frost in Fairfield onli that there seem to be more sting in it . I intend to have a ride round tomorrow to have a look at the countri although one cannot go too far , on account of it be such a big salient , shape someth like this [Simpl diagram drawn ] 23.9.16 Saturday It turn out a bitter cold morn I can tell you there was some sting in the water when have a wash . A German Taub paid us a visit this morn to our surpris there was an Anti Aircraft Gun right alongsid our Camp the way the shell scream through the air was a treat . They got all round him we were cheer them everi time they got closer but I fanci we would have cheer the other side of our face if he had given us a bomb drop exhibit . Howev 2 of our Battl Plane came up he ran for it we final lost sight of them bank round one anoth in the distanc . It is thrill to watch an Aeroplan duel , everyon get so excit when our chap score a hit they go mad . Take them all through we hold supremaci of the air as they alway run when they sight our plane . I was watch them descend and ascend at the Aerodrom the other day they came down go up by dozen . How it is they do not collid with one anoth is a mysteri to me . We are all amaz by rat in this place on speak to some Canadian who vacat this Camp they told us that all the way from here to Loo is overrun with them They are of an immens size fair give me the creep . They seem to wait until you put the light out then they start veri soon the whole floor is smother with them , kick squeal seem everywher . They alway follow the battl line up live on the dead bodi . So you can imagin how feroci they are . I took a stroll round the surround countri last night but feel fair tire return to camp earli tri to go to sleep but what with rat cold weather scarc slept a wink . Poperingh was heavili shell last night yesterday even on account of same , all approach to the Citi were guard no one was allow to enter . I saw Shayn for the first time for some consider period the two of us are go to tri to get to London togeth . 24.9.16 Sunday Today has again been fine everyth that one might desir . The front has been a littl more activ all night long the chit chat of machin gun the familiar hiss of travel shell penetr the air made sleep veri hard for a long time . Situat on a hill , as our camp is , the ground . gradual slope downward to the Battl Line end in a maze of marsh dyke which dot the whole countri hereabout . A batteri of heavi gun is consist fire away on our right so far the German have not answer for fear of disclos their posit . I will tri give a descript of the new British Engine which at the present time is the talk of the world . Imagin a machin almost as larg as a railway engin , on one gigant caterpillar wheel on either side , heavili armour with small big gun insid to say noth of number of machin gun . They can cross a 12ft trench easili demolish an ordinari hous by run against it or smash tree down . They can do a fright lot of damag general work in liason with the infantri . They go ahead destroy the German machin gun emplac so enabl our troop to advanc without serious loss . In my opinion they have destroy hundr of German machin gun sinc they have been use . The German are terrifi of them well they might be , as noth but a direct hit of a high explos shell can hurt them . They are like a big tortois , they way they crawl in out of the various place . Altogeth I fanci they are a great asset to the Armi save a great lot of life . 25.9.16 Monday The weather still remain fine everyth is nice dri underfoot . Misfortun has at last overtak me in that I have becom " chatti " [( Lice ) ] Howev I am work hard to rid myself of them hope to succeed ere long . I have been veri lucki to escap them for so long but this fact doe not make them ani the easier to bear . I went for a stroll last night end up at a big farm hous near Boshep , The peopl were veri hospit insist on us call on them again . I have caught a cold in the throat the first in mani a long day , but hope to shake it off in due cours . There is a nice breez blow today from where I am sit I can see the huge arm of the Wind mill all move round round grind the wheat whilst do so . The front is gradual becom more activ the artilleri fire is daili grow in intens . The result of the late Zepplin raid over England is veri gratifi the news of the destruct of 2 Zepplin caus much satisfact among the soldier . Unfortun there was more sever loss of life than former , but a lesson of this kind will take the dare out of other . 26.9.16 Tuesday The fine weather still continu , although it is spring up windi . This mean that we will have to watch the Gas , but on account of the wind be so high no attack is like to come . Big rumour are fli round of a Great British victori on the Somm front but noth offici has as yet come through . We did know howev that the greatest bombard of the war has been in progress for the last 72 hour . We can distinct hear the rumbl of the artilleri here in Belgium we are about 80 to 90 mile north of the Somm . The English paper state that it can be heard over there . We are all anticip the fall of Thiepval Combl I rather fanci that these 2 town are the object of the next big attack . Last night I went to a Farm Hous made a studi of their way . All the farm hand roll into the one room for their tea I`ll bet it doe n't take them 10 minut to finish . The Boss cut the bread by jingoe` s you ought to see the knife he use . Their meal consist of a kind of soup with brown bread . No such thing as tea , I fanci they are decid wors than our own countri yokel in their way . There was some excit this morn owe to a coupl of German machin pay their compliment to us . We were all disturb by unusu heavi " Airgun " fire on go to have a look , saw sever Fokker observ our posit . A shell got veri close to one in retali he immedi drop a bomb . This came hiss through the air seem to be on top of us for the time , It final land in the villag about 150 yard from us . I do not know the damag , just after this we began to hear bullet hiss downward , one strike the ground about 16 yard from me . These were the spent bullet from our shrapnel shell decid me to take cover which I did . About half an hour later we sight one of them come back for dear life surround by 5 of our could hear them fire their machin gun at him . They final got him over Poperingh where he fell . The other one was suppos to have been caught by shell fire at Armentier . 27.9.16 28.9.16 It is again rain off on . These two day have been the most excit I have yet had , as I had to visit the Front Line trench all communic trench to inspect various food dug out their content . Start away from Reninghelst at 9.00 I went to La Clayt to Brigad Head Qus to obtain a pass runner to guid me . My first call within rang was the villag of Pierstraat . This is alway under shell fire consequ is raze to the ground . After half an hour search I found the dugout I was after finish up hop out of it pretti quick as the Enemi was pour shrapnel in . My next object was Fort Toronto This I had to approach without cover , but find a drain I crouch down ran for it just escap some indirect machin gun fire , which was be play on it from a German posit on the Hill . I then went to the head of the Commun trench to start for the front line support trench . After walk , run crouch for about 3 mile I got into the Front trench . After travers the whole sector I came back again was just in an attack posit although I could not say that I felt comfort . I did not feel ill at eas until they start throw minnenwarf over . 3 of these came in quick success threw everyon off their feet utter demolish one sector of the trench . Howev , by dint of machin gun rifl fire , as well as bomb our own artilleri barrag fire the attack was utter repuls . They never got near the parapet of our trench . I had the honour of use a rifl here take a share of the fight . After this was over I move back to the support trench gun redoubt . This is more danger than the front line , on account of the Artilleri fire which is direct against it , It is an inferno of fli dirt steel I was sincer pleas to be abl to get out of it aliv as all the time I was there , they kept a hot fire up on it . Our own artilleri fire is veri unpleas , as the German trench onli be about 40 to 70 yard away , the shrapnel just graze our own trench burst on the top of the German . I then went through Chicori Lane C.T.to Ridg Wood , where the various reserv battalion are situat where our gun posit are . There was Battteri fire in progress the vibrat made one feel pretti sick . After go round the Brasseri which is anoth hot shop I work round through Yves , Voomesell , thenc round to Major Cops , Captain Post back to Battl Head where after a rest I return home . It is sorrow to see the men who get hit . Those that are onli wound take it cheer whilst those that are kill are taken away buri in quick lime . Whilst I was there one man was shot through the brain while anoth had his both leg blown off . Another his hand smash sever other of minor consequ . The German were lie pretti thick all over the place , their casualti be pretti sever or as one express himself , " These damn Australian can shoot some" . The 2 line have been practic in the same posit for the last 18 month consequ there are plenti of graveyard in the vicin . The major are buri in disus trench cover with quick lime . It sometim happen that after they have been buri the enemi bomb the place the bodi are hurl in piec all over the place . This is a most revolt sight , the smell is also terribl . Mani thing one see there could not possibl be believ unless actual seen . For instanc at one stage of the attack the German dead were pile up about 5 ft high they still attack the live one tri to crawl over the human parapet of dead onli to fall themselv when they reach the top under the pitiless hail of machin gun fire , This is a murder fire noth can pass it aliv when they establish " cross fire " . The Aeroplan are veri activ dive within 500 yard of the trench open on the trench with machin gun fire . While I was there they cut an observ balloon loos kill the observ , send the balloon down in flame from bomb . It was an awe inspir sight to see the balloon fall to earth in flame . It may not be believ but it is true I have seen it viz , a whole battalion of Australian pour in a murder fire on the attack mass of German cri all the fright loss of life they were occas . I was well satisfi with my sojourn in the trench return sadder wiser than befor . 29.9.16 Friday The rain commenc again today but did not set in , although it is still rather dull with a cold wind blow . Great success has been attain on the Somm the British have now thrown the German back from the Ridg which the whole world thought impregn . There is a big artilleri battl be wage here on the Ypres Sector right through to the Coast . I do not know what it mean , as general opinion has it that there will be no infantri attack here , but judg by the fierc artilleri fire there is someth do . I heard howev that that it is to prevent the German withdraw men for the Somm front . My cold has loosen I hope to shake it off complet by tomorrow , Everyth is bustl in this region now to make prepar for the oncom winter . I have had un-offici order that my Suppli Section will have to move up in closer proxim to the trench , which is no bar for me . Everyon is look forward to further develop in the Somm area befor long the whole front may be ablaz from end to end . 30.9.16 Saturday Thing are fair quiet here this afternoon although a pretti strenuous bombard was wage this morn by both side . Good news is still filter through . I have heard that a larg Australian mail has arriv so am look forward to it with interest as it seem to be rather a long time sinc I receiv a mail . The weather is onc more fine , but it is the die flutter as we now onli have one more brief month of good weather then the winter start , but I` m hang if I know where it will finish . There is a wretch machin gun just outsid my dugout . Spit away like furri it fair get on one nerv . Crack crack everi minut of the day . I was up at a machin gun posit yesterday it was train on two cross road about 3000 yard away , along which the German have to bring their suppli etc to the trench further back the Ridg . You talk about cun . The gunner would give a burst then shut off for a half hour this period of quiet would give the German heart they thought that the gun had move to anoth posit , when just as they would be cross with vehicl column of men , away she would spit again of cours caus a lot of destruct confus this goe on day night the German are search all over the place with shell fire to tri find the posit but be fair well conceal they have not yet [indecipher ] They also have some of our road under observ do likewis . I was near caught the other day on one of these road have lost my way , veri near blunder right onto a direct line of fire from them . Hear bullet come too close to be pleasant I glanc round found that I was under observ from them . Quick as a flash I drop into an old drain sure enough a second after along came a shower of bullet from them , I think they fanci they got me as it sudden stop . I then crawl in behind cover got for my natur . It was no bon believ me 1.10.16 Sunday There was an unusu heavi bombard this even which seem to be come from the left of the Ypres Salient . The German were report to be veri busi erect gas applianc in their trench , but evid our artilleri fire was effect as no gas came over . I took a stroll this Evene call in at a farm hous had a cup of cocoa by jove it was delici . They know how to make cocoa in this countri . All Unit are veri busi now erect stabl for winter quarter wherev we look one can see stabl in the cours of construct . More promot have come to light , but as usual they all belong to the famili that run them . then they ask one to vote for compulsori enlist , I know what my vote will be like . 2.19.16 Monday Eight hour day in Sydney a holliday . But it is no leisur day here . It has again start to rain look like set in windi the mud is fair deep . I went to Boschip this morn it was a veri cold side as well as be on the miser side . The gun are fair activ just now but I think it is onli a reciproc bombard . I was think of home today the long to be back is great , especi as the Head of our Unit is make himself felt in everi way possibl . 3.10.16 Tuesday Another raini day with noth to do plenti of time to do it in . The German are send over a few High Explosiv but they are fall in open field , do no damag , As long as they keep their rang at that , their onli result will be wast ammunit . Great satisfact is again express over anoth Zeppelin have been brought down This make the 5th within 21 day , consid the trivial damag done in comparison to the cost of their machin the loss of high tri mechan they will be goff strafe England again . Our machin brought down anoth observ balloon have kill the observ cut it loos by machin gun fire it drift over our line , when one of our machin dive from a great height drip a bomb on it set it alight , when it hurlt down at a great speed in flame . Our 13th Brigad Battalion have move up to the trench today , but it is a compar quiet front , so no startl event will mark their re-appear in the front line . 4.10.16 Wednesday Still rain noth do . Last night there was a raid on the enemi trench near Ypres which was success . At the present moment the German are treat us to some " Jack Johnson " which make one want to keep out of their road They plonk right down sent up a fountain of earth iron , but as long as they do not spoil the tea it is ok . I receiv a letter from Mother Father also one from Nina . I was surpris to learn that J Rolf is now in Franc must keep my eye open for him , although I do not know which Divis he is in . The 49th Batt . Fife drum band is again treat us to a Serenad I do not know which is the worst have to listen to them or Allemand shell . We have all been issu with the new Box Gas Helmet they are some class The dash thing near choke one when you put them on although they are twice as effect as the old style . Each one has a small tank of oxygen attach which is convey to the mouth by a rubber pipe run up through the mask . This is the place where the Canadian caught it so hot when gas was first use ever sinc then they are veri care . There is an entir Gas staff distribut throughout the front have at certain interv " Gas Centr " . In the trench there are electr contriv which are set on the same wire as those run back throughout the countri . When there is a gas alarm these are set buzz everyon has to have his helmet in the readi posit for ani immerg , both civilian otherwis . There are also board put up with small wind gaug these alway notifi you the direct in which it is blow . If the wind is blow to us from the enemi the board mark " Wind danger " or " Gas alert " when by sign the German are fix Gas cylind in their trench it is mark " Gas alarm" , when the gas is seen to be approach all the buzzar hooter , church bell , tram whistl etc , start to buzz keep it up all the time . The artilleri also commenc to send salvo of shell into it to dispers the volum also ani premedit attack . Altogeth this Gas busi is a pretti ghast affair . Again they never take risk , even when we are emit gas from our trench the alarm is sound everyon don their mask until the conclus , in case it blow back . 5.10.16 Thursday The polit situat in Germani has becom veri tens with England , caus through Mr Lloyd George` s outspoken clever speech to an American journalist from the vindicit storm of abus the Central Power have direct against us , it certain appear as though it has struck home with full forc . The speech in question was to the effect that England was determin to fight on until a decis victori was obtain , general opinion express here are to the effect that Germani was put out peac feeler through America now Lloyd Georg has definit dispel them . If ever England was hate befor it is decid wors now Germani has state that she will fight to the last man now , in an effort to squash the British . This as may be imagin is go to give us plenti to do , as everi avail man in their armi will be hurl against our front . This is appar what is want besid be readi for anyth that may come , it will hasten the end of the ultim issu there can be no doubt . " The Lion is rous who ? Can quell him , certain not Germani This is the chief topic of convers prevail among us at the present period . It is still veri windi rain show no sign of abat at all . Our front is veri quiet there is scarc a shot be fire . We can hear a dull rumbl on our right which seem to be come from Loo .

It was decid a veri annoy dishearten order as we were veri comfort situat for all wet weather have a nice big room , but now we have to go live under a tarpaulin again . Howev after a fair strenuous time we manag to rig one on a frame work of wood . It was a solid job as it was rain windi each time we manag to get it in place the wind would get it away it would go . The 50th Batt came back today the whole Brigad are go up to the trench again . Three of us had rather a merri time last night to commer the finish of our hard job in erect our bivouac , We start off and walk toward Ballieul keep this side of the frontier as it mean arrest for us to cross to the other side . We eventu came to a place call " Canada Corner " after the Canadian who befor they reliev us on the Somm , have been camp there for 14 month , The place is now full of middl age Englishmen who reliev the Canadian pend our arriv have sinc stay there ( RE Engineer ) An Australian was a curios to them they would drag us into an Estaminet treat us . After get away from there we went further along the road then decid to take a short cut home . We were all jolli veri often found ourselv in privat Yard .

While I kept them engag my 2 mate raid the cloth line then ran . I caught them up after a while saw that they each had a bundl of wash on arriv in camp we got a light to see the stolen good judg our disgust when we found that we had carri home a bundl of babi napkin , Such is a soldier life . We now use them as wipe up towel . This is the first time we have ever had a convivi even with " Tommi " but they were all middl age men which account for it . The younger men be unbear . 9.10.16 Monday The rain has given over dri weather onc again reign suprem , although one alway know that it is not for long . In fact the season are known here as be 3 month winter 9 month wet weather . I went into Balleiul in Franc today on a bicycl . The distanc was about 24 kilometr am feel fair stiff on it . This is a fair size citi at one time has been a pretti live place . Its busi side is now all militari on account of it be a railway centr . It is where we entrain when go down to the Somm from Armentier . Its chief point de advantag are now main "high price fever " . Some maladi has broken out here with the result that all Estammet public place are close out of bound to troop whilst the onli avail shop have seiz the opportun to rais their price . I bought some fruit at the follow price . Pear 1 fr each = 10d , Apples half franc 5d , Haircut 2 fr , 1/8 half franc for assist ? These are some of the price exist all food stuff are practic the same , , Made to suit the pocket of Australian soldier or as the French peopl say " Australia plenti money " . I receiv 2 regist letter from Nina see that I was look forward to some mail they were veri pleas to me . Two "tank " are report to be up on this front now . So there will be consider activ short . The entir front is at the present time veri quiet . Due no doubt to the rough weather we have been have late . They are take advantag of the fine weather again down on the Somm this morn news contain a fresh advanc a good few prison . 10.10.16 Tuesday The day has pass without anyth of ani note occur save that I have had two of my corpor place under arrest , but hope to get them out of it . Someth is about to happen on this front short as a French Armi Corp has move up to the Belgian Sector of the Front . Also a coupl of English divis . Some of the famous " Tank " have also put in an appear . The front where the next push will take place is a dread piec of countri , has a larg canal run between the oppos forc . This of cours has to be cross will natur present mani difficulti to our men . The land is veri low cut up into various waterway . We are all natur anxious as to the result of same but see that the German have had to deplet their strength in this region to reinforc the Somm most of us are anticip favour result when it get into it stride . The weather is onc more wet the next thing to look forward to is a few hour dri spell . It is veri annoy to think that the rain is interf with oper so much when there is such a dread lot at stake . 11.10.16 Wednesday The rain has drop but an ici cold wind is blow I can assur you that it goe right through one . I went for a walk to have a cup of coffe late in the even when I return found a good number of the compani had been over pay respect to the 13th Battalion who were under order to move . They all return under the influenc start sing play the accordion . About an hour later some of our bright .O. made a raid on them . With the result that sever arrest were made . This kind of thing is have a veri mark effect on the Soldier there will be serious troubl if it doe not soon ceas . The charg against my two corpor I former wrote of was dismiss , which give me everi satisfact . The whole truth of the matter is that the .O. have noth to do are constant prepar treacher trap for the NCOs to fall into it take one whole energi wit to keep out of it , such is the contempt natur of a few men on whom posit has sudden fallen it leav them as conceit as possibl . I myself am heartili sick of the whole affair wish it was all over . Again in refer to leav . It was suppos to be onli grant to men who had from 10 upward in their pay book . Yet the first to go away are batmen , some of whom are in debt , but they are care to explain that it is special leav , but it interfer with ordinari leav just the same , and as the leav is for 10 day 2 cannot be away at the same time you can judg how long it take for a turn to come round 12.10.16 Thursday The wind is still blow cold it is veri hard to keep warm , it is an absolut moral that it will blow up rain again . Sever of the old 20th Compani call in to see me today they have all got on except well , on account of them have gone to a newli form train . The 5th Divis are go to the Somm to take their share of the " Big Push " there are also rumour to the effect that the 3rd Divis have now declar war will be come from England to go there also . Sever shell took place on this front today last all night long . Which mean that there has been anoth raid on the German trench . These raid are kept up prove to be veri demor , as they keep the German casualti up also bring back use inform of the disposit strength of enemi forc . The 1st Divis move out from here today have entrain at Boschep for an unknown destin . The move block all road made our column late . Gener Plumer review the 4th Brigad today they look veri well march along the road with fix bayonet , although their rank are sad deplet , sinc come from the Somm . 13.10.16 Friday A high success raid was carri out on the German trench last night as a result 420 unwound prison were pass back this morn . It was a dare raid carri out with great dash dare by Australian troop . After a veri fierc artilleri bombard which was direct on the enemi front line trench . The fire lift play on the 2nd line . Our Brigad then leapt the parapet occupi the front line , dig the prison out of their dugout pass them back , this procedur was carri back to the 4th line , when the German receiv larg reinforc , our men fell back to their own line , a fierc barrag fire cover their retir . They destroy the trench did great damag it is regard as a great dare episod in the live of the Anzac . These raid are caus great havoc in the German rank keep their nerv strung veri high , it is the kind of thing that is wear them down . This episod show that the trench were our for the take of them , yet order were , that we had to fall back to our origin line , onc again prove that the longer the German line is , the more he is becom exhaust . The wind has now drop but the sky is still overcast rain is threaten . I shave my upper lip today as order came out that it is now option whether you grow moustach or not . We all went down to be "gass " today to tri our new Box Respir helmet . After care instruct as to how to use them , we were all care fit march into a chamber , close in . Lackurmatori Gas was then releas we had to stand for 3 minut in it . My helmet fit me nice . apart from a sting sensat in the eye which turn them blood shot , I felt no ill result . Some howev , whose helmet did not fit them too well , caught it hot , they would throw themselv at the door tumbl out , with water run from their eye in stream . This is caus through a bad fit helmet same is condemn . The ill effect pass off in a few hour . The new helmet are made on the German system onli be veri much better on account of differ chemic be use to absorb the various gase . It is a face mask which fit tight round the face . A tube to go in the mouth , same be connect with , a tank contain chemic which turn bad air into oxygen . The onli inconveni is a littl suffoc . 14.10.16 Saturday Weather still dull windi veri cold noth of ani note occur . We have heard unoffici that we move from here in 2 week time , leav a man in charg of the camp so evid we will not be away veri long .

Whilst there the English Divis that took Le Sai march in they brought load of trophi back with them . There are persist rumour about that we are go to Salonika , but whether it is true or not I cannot say . The weather is bitter cold I simpli cannot get warm . Everi littl shower of rain contain it share of hail when one touch you it is like a knife go through you .

It near freez me to death stand out on the Dump issu I was veri pleas when it was over . All the rest of the day was spent in tri to keep warm all effort were fruitless . We make a stove out of an oil drum put charcoal on it until it was red hot . If this weather continu there will be a lot go out to it , yet the O. have not got enough human about them to cut out [indecipher ] parad which are unnecessari . The worst featur of this weather is the way it affect the feet . I had 2 pair of sock on then could not keep them warm . There are mani rumour about our next move , the 1st Divis have alreadi gone , but no one know where we are go to . I went out to obtain some coffe this even but the cold drove me in again eventu l turn in onli to lie awak all night with the cold . 17.10.16 Tuesday I went to Oudderdom today buy green forag for Brigad Hors on the way back pass about 200 German prison near the Division Bath where they had been treat to a bath clean cloth .

The place is an absolut swamp I can honest say that my feet have not been warm onc . There is evid a raid in progress on the Ypres Salient at the present time , which can be judg by the fierc fire of the Artilleri . Up to the present it has been fair quiet , but at the moment the Brigad have commenc Batteri Fire Rapid which mean that a curtain or barrag fire is be direct against a given place . So far the German have not repli . A thing which struck me as be peculiar came to my notic today in connect with conceal a big gun , the art way it is done . In a small villag call Veastidot , where most of the hous have been raze to the ground there stand one two stori place which has had the roof insid blown out . Down in the foundat of this place a big pit has been dug an immens gun put in on a platform which can be elev . When the gun is to be fire the platform is rais the muzzl of the gun just peep out over the top . A few [indecipher ] round are fire the gun lower . If the gun were not fire whilst you were in the immedi vicin , you would never know it was there All along the road which run through here big screen have to be put up to stop the view of the enemi who occupi a posit on a ridg of hill opposit , when ever in this particular place it doe not do to linger , as one never know when they will rake the road with machin gun fire .

They then start the poll let me state that through the usual offic red tape , we were kept on parad in torrent of rain a bitter cold wind for 5 hour to record our vote , what is onli natur for the result of same to be .

The German gun thunder all along the sector our gun answer them with everi ounc of effort they had . They also play a high old game with their Aeroplan , it be a full moonlight night it was a sight to behold . There were dozen of machin dart all over the place , the Anti Aircraft gun were thunder away at a furious rate . They succeed in drop a few bomb on Amien other villag . one drop about 500 yard away from our dump . Two Taub were brought down of our own side I could obtain no inform . I have just been notifi by S.O. to be readi to move up to Montauban on Monday . This place has alreadi figur in the Press as have been the scene of furious fight is about 3 mile from the front line . This point to us , as go to be a rough time will be glad when it is over . Some QMs who are camp in Fricourt Mammetz Wood tell us that they are up to their knee in mud , as we are go further on it look decid unhealthi .

The first Divis appear to have caught it fair strong again as it is now come on time for the 4th to take their turn , our mind are becom sober we will onc more resum a serious life until well away from the Somm again . 11.11.16 Saturday Last night was a beauti there is no doubt . To begin with a furious bombard commenc all round at 9 pm kept go all night . It was just one scream of burst shell all the sky was quiver a dull red glow on the horizon mark the flash of the artilleri . There was evid a big stunt on , the news of which has not yet come through . It is still proceed the fire is grow in intens . There was a serious raid by Aeroplan we were kept on the hop . They drop bomb all over the place a few fell on a Field Hospit about 700 yard from us kill 8 AMC men wound 45 other includ a lot of patient . Gun were screech all round us , while the rattl of machin gun on the Aeroplan could be distinct heard as they engag one anoth . One Taub was seen to fall in flame explod when it hit the ground . On the whole it has been a terribl night , I would be glad to see the cloud over the moon put an end to midnight raid . One can stand them in daylight , but they are uncanni at night . Meanwhil the fight still proceed befor the next 14 day are over , Baupaum should be our , . My cold is still veri troublesom doe not seem to mend , but it is the constant trudg about in the wet which doe . It . 12.11.16 Sunday We move off for the front at 9am catch a Motor Lorri got a lift as far as Albert where we were all dump told to find our way to Fricourt where we would issu . After plough through mud knee deep we halt for a rest were lucki to get anoth lift on a Motor Lorri . The road were veri congest mile of traffic were all held up on account of the hard pull , we eventu reach Fricourt , which is the old line of trench which was the first villag taken in the British offens . Of the villag itself noth remain save a few scatter brick bare tree trunk all twist distort . The ground is all broken is heap up just as through a Volcano had taken place misplac the whole surfac of the countri . The more pathet sight are clear evinc one either side of the road , where grave yard contain the bodi of British French German will alway bear testimoni of the furious fight which took place . Two trench about 40 yard apart wind over hill dale show the relat posit of both forc befor the attack , the German have the better part on account of them hold the ridg which encircl the villag . I was inform that I would be in Fricourt , with appar noth to do until nightfal , so decid to make a close inspect of the trench both British French to prove the correct of the tale one heard of the strength of the German trench . I will now record my opinion on same will state plain that everyth is the plain unvarnish truth . I went on my explor with the view in mind that a reign of stalem exist in this region for 2 year consequ much time was avail for perfect the defenc of which I am write . Of the German trench themselv , they present a veri sorri appear , have been batter torn about by the terrif artilleri fire which they were subject to . To a depth of 10 feet the fire was most effect but beyond this depth not much damag was done . The trench wind in zig zag all over the place alway present an angl to the line of fire in each bay of the trench , marvel execut work in the shape of dugout underground chamber are built . These dugout or underground passag run down to a great depth , one in particular be 100 feet below the level of the ground . The entranc are well finish board in , proper built step lead down , some of which have sever flight of stair fulli 20 bedroom chamber lead off from each flight . Air machin on top pump the air down through tube in one case there was a light railway track construct which work by a windlass . The valu of such construct is at onc appar , dure a bombard the defend can leav the trench remain in perfect safeti , until the fire ceas then re-appear they were alway abl to repuls all attack . Howev this avail them littl against the avalanch of shell of all calibr which were hurl against them in the 1/7/16 , as the world alreadi know I will endeavour to give my opinion as to how they were beaten . Dure the bombard all the side of the trench were blown in leav just the piec which contain the dugout . Our troop were abl to storm the breach act quick with bomb were abl to either kill or take prison the men underground . Two out of 3 of them are now fill in contain the bodi of the dead defend . One passag I must make refer to was situat on the brow of the hill . This one I went down fulli 150 feet and did not reach the bottom . My candl go out be unabl to keep it alight warn me of the presenc of foul air so I return to the top . What was down there is open to conjectur . I final return to the camp place impress with all I had seen . At 5 pm we move off for Montaulban which is close to the line also a place which took mani live to captur . The traffic was terribl it took us 6 hour to travel 3 mile or more . The countri is aw to look at be batter torn about whilst the mud water is up to your thigh . The transport hors were done up when we reach the villag onli 3 wagon out of 14 that start reach their destin . The first thing that greet us on arriv was a salvo of shell from the German from what I can see of the place the direct the shell came from , we are go to be veri lucki men if we get out of this place safe . After get some water on to boil we look about for shelter . I eventu found a tent which is not much protect from shell but it was a cover for my head that suit . Just about this time Fritz put some more over they were danger close . One threw mud all over the tent . The other fell in the vicin . We are unfortun in a veri danger posit be camp just in front of the Rail Head . This as is onli natur is a vital straget point , the German know same are tri veri hard to get it . This make it most unpleas I will be sincer pleas when we get right out of it . My cold is still troublesom veri irrit at night . I went to bed but not to sleep. The shell still continu to come over pass over our head with the old familiar but sinist hiss made sleep imposs . At about 4am the gun open up a heavi bombard , see that there are some naval gun alongsid us , sleep was an imposs . The fire ceas at dawn and I slept until 9am . 13.11.16 Monday Most of the day has been spent on the dump on account of the utter confus of the traffic . the holdup in all traffic is unavoid on account of the terribl natur of the road the way the shell torn countri is batter about . It is marvel to think that this devast countri was onc of a smile agricultur natur , now it is aw to look at . Gaunt isol tree trunk are all that is left of forest a few scatter brick mark where onc prosper villag were situat . Old Fritz with habitu regular is tri to make us shift our camp unfortun he is begin to get closer . This afternoon he land one over which everyon thought was right here . It land howev just over the railway truck right in among a camp of guardsmen , who fortun had just move out , otherwis there would have been serious casual . Sinc I have been here there have been about 6 kill a lot wound . I do not anticip much sleep tonight as the gun have open much earlier than usual . I do not profess to be a hero I can honest say that the sight of these explod shell caus mani anxious moment after they strike it is alright , but hear the hiss come toward you not know where they are go to hit is absolut unnerv . 14.11.16 Tuesday We pass anoth terror of a night it is still continu dure the day . Shell are fall fast furious to speak the truth , they have us fair bluf . Under cover of a fog Fritz has sneak a coupl of long rang gun up is pepper us proper . At 6.30 pm last night our gun open up a terrif bombard kept it go the greater part of the night . Regular sleep was imposs one could onli catch altern interv between the tremend roar of the big gun . Unoffici news came to hand that we had captur Letransley but is not yet confirm . The earli part of the morn was not quit so bad but it open up at dinner time again . A veri bitter pill for us to swallow is the fact that Fritz has a coupl of observ balloon up which can observ our posit , we are sure to feel the effect of his observ tonight . Alreadi he has commenc by put over a few haphazard shot , but they are too close to be comfort . The plane are out in hundr wherev you look , you can see littl puff of smoke which denot burst shell . One plane was brought down in flame but I do not know whose it was . It fell in the German Line . Traffic is still congest I do not think it will be right again until warm weather set in dri the road 15.11.16 Wednesday Another hard night with scarc ani sleep . If we are kept here veri long one will be utter worn out for want of rest . A coupl of big naval 15 inch gun have been fire from near our camp the vibrat near bring down our hut each shot . A terrif bombard was maintain all night onli quieten down toward dawn . A veri sudden thing happen this morn , we were all stand talk on the dump when all of a sudden a terribl explos occur We saw the earth shoot up to a height of 40 feet or more . As none of us had heard ani shell scream over we look for the onli other natur caus , viz in the air , sure enough after a few minut search we espi a Taub fli among the cloud . How he miss us good onli know , probabl an error of judgement anyway he got quit close enough . After go some littl way he turn came back again you bet we all scatter . He drop some smoke bomb no doubt to give his gunner our direct then start into us with a machin gun , as far as we know there was one kill . This has been the coldest day I have had on an abund of cloth my sheepskin vest over all , but my feet be like block of ice made me feel fair miser all day . They have approach me to take up Depot Sgt Major whilst at Montauban , over three Brigad Coy , on the understand that it is temporari I have agre to act in that capac . A batch of 3000 prison has been pass back through our cage , have been taken by the Guard Divis . Troop still continu to pour in everyth point to a big battl be fought for Bapaum . At the present time Fritz is again shell . Whilst our gun are heavili engag in shell him . Everyth point to a heavi fight tonight . 16.11.16 Thursday Last night prove to be in keep with all the other we all veri near gass ourselv . The weather be so utter cold we made a fire of coal coke in our hut did not notic that all ventil was block . As a result we all inhal the poisen fume have been vomit off on ever sinc . It is extrem hard to keep away from the spirit this weather but after a certain littl indulg I had I am not go to have ani more . We have had the worst day experienc good know what the night will bring . This morn broke without a cloud in the sky bitter cold the whole ground be frozen over at 9am when the parad was in a flight of 5 German Plane came sail over immedi start bomb us the various camp round . We all scatter wait for them to go . They drop a few bomb close to the road then start with their machin gun . This was wors than the bomb we spent mani anxious moment . Our gun now got busi turn them , when our plane appear drove them back . All day long we have had to watch the sky , but our plane have manag to keep them back except in isol case . At dinner time Fritz open on us with his long rang gun , evid on inform provid by the plane got all round us . One shell hit about 10yard from a full parad of mule transport men , but did no damag . Another fell among hors caus some littl confus . Altogeth it had been a veri discomfort day onc more I must say that we will be lucki to come out of it unscath . Mani big gun are take up posit close by us , which doe not tend to make one easi in mind as they are sure to search for them when they open 17.11.16 Friday Anniversari day of my Au revoir to relat friend needless to say my thought have been of them mani incid have come to my memori of the last day in Australia I am wonder if I will be home for the next one . I have been day dream most of the day onli come out of my reveri when the hiss of a shell pass over would send one heart into one mouth . The intens cold is play up with us all I can assur you that the hardship are both great numer . I have given up wash shave as one suffer for too mani hour after each time . The ice this morn averag 9 to 12 inch thick it is still lay on the ground . Needless to say my chilblain are veri sore . There was the finest display of Aeroplan to-day that I have ever seen . I count as mani as 40 plane in one place . There were mani duel we saw one fall from a great height . Another one fell on the top of a hill which the German could see not one of us was game to go have a look at it , as Fritz was put in shell after shell in an endeavour to smash it up befor night fell . It is a prize worth go for as the pilot observ alway have beauti coat on , made of long fur . Sever of our boy have alreadi book some . Fritz has been put over a few occasion shot . He pester the veri life out of us this morn with his plane but they were quick driven back .
