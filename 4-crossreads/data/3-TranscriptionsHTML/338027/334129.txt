<p>Wednesday, 3 February, 1915<br/>More fighting on the Canal.  Ismallia [Ismailia] has been attacked by the enemy who have a much stronger position than was supposed.  The 7th &amp; 8th Batt of Infantry (Vic) &amp; the 2nd Field Ambulance have gone down there.  In all probability we may go there shortly.  There has been no serious damage done yet, each side has lost a few men.</p>
<p>Battalions of Infantry keep arriving day &amp; night of the 2nd contingent.  On picquet at night and saw them coming in as late as 4 a.m.  had a disastrous night.  The heel rope to which the horses are attached, broke &amp; there was nearly a stampede.  I had to call the guard out.</p>
<p>Thursday, 4 February, 1915<br/>We are doing practical work now such as picking up wounded &amp; galloping back with him on the back of the saddle.  The artillery of the [indecipherable] are doing fine work and we are getting quite used to the shriek of live shells. Over 300 Turkish prisoners have been brought to Cairo and they are disheartened and sick of the German Officers.  In all there were 16 killed and 40 wounded in the fight the other day but the British only had 3 wounded.  Four Turks succeeded in swimming across the Canal and are [at] large here.  The Gov has offered a big reward for their capture, any one caught harbouring them will get the full penalty.</p>
