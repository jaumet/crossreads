<p>Friday September 28th<br/>Very cloudy &amp; misty this morning, left the dock at 9 am &amp; pulled into the stream. There are a good few war vessels of all kinds in harbour here, the only thing I haven't seen here yet is a submarine. Everything is being prepared for us to sail. Plymouth is a lovely Harbour, very spacious &amp; pretty. Weighed anchor at 3 pm &amp; went just outside the harbour, sailed at 5 pm.</p>
<p>We have a cruiser in front of us, a transport with British troops for Mesopotamia, &amp; Transport A.30 "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   " behind us. Either side we have five destroyers, so we seem well protected. The sea is fairly calm, but the first day out you know, I feel a bit squirmish. Last saw England about 6.30 pm. Everything is very convenient on board. There are half a dozen different hospital on board. There are a few Nurses, &amp; a fairly large staff. There is a Y.M.C.A, &amp; canteen, but the latter does not open until tomorrow. We have to be out a certain radius before anything can be sold. Permanent mess orderlies were appointed today. It was decided to pay them a shilling a week each man for the voyage.</p>
