 Thursday 16 December, 1915 
 Got a letter from Bill How from All Saints. He was a New Zealander who was in the same room as myself &amp; we got rather chummy. 
 I was speaking at a debate this evening &amp; I won the decision. We had a very enjoyable evening. 
 Still no boat, had to have bully beef for dinner &amp; it was pretty hard to tackle.
