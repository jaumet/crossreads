 22nd.  Have been doing a proper loaf the whole day long with the exception of an hour this morning when I was a witness on four A.W.L. cases. Went down to Devonport again this evening &amp; had another bath, I filled the bath pretty well to the top &amp; soaked myself for nearly &frac12; an hour &amp; then being suspicious of a few pimples on my arms &amp; legs I rubbed some sulphur ointment well in, in case they happen to be scabies for if you are unlucky enough to have these cursed things in a very mild form even they won't let you go on the ship. 
 23rd.  This morning another boat list was read out &amp; mine was on at last nearly all the 1st Battn. chaps are on this draft, our boat number is the D.34, some say it is the old horse boat "Port Hacking" &amp; a pretty old thing she is from all accounts but anything will do provided we get away from this hole.
