<p>extract (Professional Beauty)</p>
<p>Beauty is but a vain &amp; doubtful good<br/>A Shining gloss that fadeth suddenly<br/>A flower that dieth when first gives to bud<br/>A brittle glass that's broken presently<br/>A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,<br/>Lost, faded, broken, dead within an hour</p>
<p>Since thou cans't with more than one<br/>Thou'rt worthy to be loved by none</p>
<p>The first sound in the song of love<br/>Scarce more than silence is and yet a sound<br/>Hands of invisible spirits touch the strings<br/>Of that mysterious instrument the soul<br/>And play the prelude of our fate</p>
<p>Two separate worlds &ndash; the one that small<br/>Beloved &amp; consecrated spot<br/>Where Quita was; the other all<br/>The dull wide waste where she was not</p>
