 The Old Platoon We ll drink a health to the Old Platoon And the men who strode along In the frosti light of a winter moon To the swing of a march song ? The men who march to the old front line , To the land of frozen dead , To the shrapnel 's burst and the bullet 's whine And the shell-fir overhead . We ll drink a health to the men of old , To the friend that onc we knew , To the vanish voic , to the heart of gold , To the comrad tri and true . To the cheer swing of a march tune , To the tramp of march men ! Oh , drink a health to the old platoon , For we ll never march again ! Charl Gilmour .
