"Parramatta"At Rabaul13.9.14Dear Guy,I got a letter from you at Port Moresby &amp; was very glad to get it. At the same time, thank God you are not here with us; I was wishing awhile back that you were but I don&acute;t want any more of my friends in it; our doings I have found somewhat comic in the past when there were only ourselves up here &amp; no one else for whom anyone of us cares a dam.But somehow the comedy is sadly missing just now; I heard yesterday of poor old Brian&acute;s death. You may like to know something of how it happened.I saw him last Sunday in Moresby (6th Sept.) &amp; we all came up to take this place (New Britain on which destroyers made a night attack just a month before) on th, Friday. He was in Berrima of course &amp; Destroyers pushed on and made a search before daylight but found nothing. "Parramatta went on to Rabaul &#151; ten miles up &#151; &amp; others stayed at Herbertschoe &amp; landed a party to attack wireless station 4 miles inland; road through rough and scrubby country. Brian landed with first 50 &amp; they went out scouting. Found road mined &amp; concealed pits full of native police with German officers. Natives up trees too shooting down on them. Brian had attended to a couple of wounded &amp; sent them back on stretchers, giving his own red cross to the stoker bearers, saying tfhefd take his chance &amp; must get up to the firing line again." He had not gone far when he was shot down through the breast and spine from a tree. He lived some time &amp; was trying to give orders to his stewards to look after the other wounded as he knew he was done. It was a damned fine finish, I hope the rest of us may only do as well! I wish I could have been with him. I did not think he had landed, as it was with the Naval Brigade that he went. Mail just off.Goodbye old man, thank God you* are not with us .YoursA.B.D."Parramatta" at Rabaul New Britain 17/9/1914
