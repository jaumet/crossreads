At the back is the promenad a veri brilliant sight and near the whole audienc repair there between the act to stroll and listen to an orchestra there . Throng of girl ? some veri beauti infest the place and persist keep pester you cling on to belt and have to be beaten off almost . The perform on the stage would not have been toler in Australia first on account of it dirt ( which had not even the redeem grace of smart ) and second on account of it absolut weak . Most of the song and gag were in French . The onli bright spot was at the last when all light were turn out and a girl appear in the air sit in a chariot on the end of a long pole . This was thrust right over the audienc and her feet brought just abov the head of the audienc . There was great competit to get her shoe and eventu she lost them both . When the show termin we set off for home and had to run the gauntlet of guid girl which took not a littl negoti . Then to the hotel and well after the hour of midnight turn in .
