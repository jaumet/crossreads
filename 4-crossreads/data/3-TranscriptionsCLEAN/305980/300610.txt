  
 13:  Rained heavily, four men of the 3rd regt. struck by lightening two seriously injured & tent torn to ribbons.  Bivvy blew down during the night & got wet to the skin whilst putting it up again during the storm. 
 14:  Still raining & had to wash our saddles & gear today.  Memorial erected in honour of N.Z. troops who fell in action at Ayimkara twelve months ago.  People from the town came over in military wagons to do honour to the dead. 
 16:  Veterinary officers culling out horses over 12 years of age.  So that they will not fall into unkind hands after faithfully doing their bit, orders were received to shoot them.   847 were shot this morning near the sea, all from Second Bde. & N.Z. Bde.  It is better for them to be shot than sold to the Jews who work animals to the death ploughing etc. in Palestine. 
 18:  Rugby comp. started today. 
 20:  Musical evening at Richon, had good lively night. 
 23:  Mail arrived today, first we have had during the past month, got 18 letters.
