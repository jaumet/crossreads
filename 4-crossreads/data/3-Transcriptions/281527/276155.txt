<p>26/2/18  Selles</p>
<p>Up early and saw A.Co off to the Lottinghen rifle range, Then met the Coy Commanders at my billet at 9 a.m. and discussed the Battalion tactical scheme with them. We rode out to the ground above Quesques &ndash; a pleasant ride and a lovely morning. Went over the ground and allotted the frontages &amp;c. We then met the Battalion in column of route with the Band and marched through ESCOUEVILLES out on to the main road to Corlettes. This is a splendid National Road and straight as a die. We went right through the wood before Corletttes and pulled up for lunch on a green field</p>
