<p>17.12.16<br/>Dear Mr. Ferguson,</p>
<p>I was so pleased to receive your kind letter some days ago and can now make some return for it.  I had a most delightful surprise today.  They called me over to the Q. office and whom should I find but Keith who had brought some men across.  It is a strange thing to meet again thus after almost two years in a little French village.  You will be pleased to hear that he is looking awfully well and said he was feeling very fit.</p>
<p>I know how much this news that he has come across here will affect you, and wished you to know that I should keep a brotherly eye on him and watch over him as far as possible.  I have impressed on him</p>
