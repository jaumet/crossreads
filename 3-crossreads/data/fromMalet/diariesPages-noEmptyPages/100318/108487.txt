9/8/18
Villers-Bretonneux
Was awakened at 4.20 am by my batman with breakfast and found that through mistaken orders the whole Battalion was breakfasting at that time. No orders to move came until about 8.20 when we received word to proceed to a certain map square near Marcelcave. Moved over there across country and got into artillery formations behind the 23rd who, thanks to their transport officer at Bde, were in possession of near all their transport here. Had a conference with the General and we marked up our maps ? tonight we bivouac God knows how far away from here. Returned to the field where the men were resting only to find that Stewart was fast asleep on the grass and our cookers and everything else absent. A few big shells. Moved at 1.15 to a place near Guillacourt crossing by artillery formations ? the whole Brigade. The 3rd Bde
