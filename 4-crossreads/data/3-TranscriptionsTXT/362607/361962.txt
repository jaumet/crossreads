This is just to tell you I will not be out tomorrow after till six o'clock if fine. I am invited to a party to help entertain wounded boys, it was to have been today but it is so wet & they want to have it in the garden. I'm afraid you must have for awfully wet on Saturday night only hope you are none the worse. Kindness & regards from us all .Yrs sincerelyC.M.F.
