Saturday 20th
Big Mail came in I got 4 letters from Lill and one from Mother, so now I'll be able to finish off my letters. Lill also sent me a snapshot taken in the Gardens with Mrs. B. and the dog. It is a beauty. To-day we were issued with Brushes to clean the buttons on our tunics and our boots and leggings.

Sunday 21st 
Church Parade off, as we had no officers to take us. Gen. McCay inspected us, we had a full dress rehearsal in the morning. All our boots and leggings were shewed up the first time for a long while. The "dinkum" inspection came off at 5 p.m we were all lined up in review order, even our camel corps were in full marching order, with their humps dressed by the right. The General dashed up just after 5. and made a thorough inspection of everything. What he thought of us, we'll hear later. 
I finished off my letters to L. and M. and set 20 snapshots to L. in letter No.2. Also wrote to France and sent a couple of snaps. Gen. McCay inspected us. We all turned out in our best clothes, buckles polished and got up to kill. He was delighted with our turnout, and said he didn't think he had such a fine body of men in his division. Old Shepherd was very pleased about it. The final event was Capt. Wooster's horse bolting back to the stables with him. Good Lord, I've written this before.
Monday 22nd
Today we gave in our leggings, belts, and water bottles and were issued with infantry packs, then we spent the rest of the day in packing up our belongings in readiness to move off at a minutes notice. "Bluey Riley" got a parcel today, so now we have some decent tobacco to smoke.
