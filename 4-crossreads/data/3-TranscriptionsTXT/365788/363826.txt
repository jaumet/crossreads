It has a wonderful view & is well worth the Manual Labour which the climbing of it entailed.I had my lunch on the very highest point  consisting of     [indecipherable] (very nicely cooked by Michael)     1 tin preserved plums (given me by Dr Harris)      1 orange (given me by an English Officer who was up on the peak)      1 small brown loaf (purchased in village)      6 [indecipherable] (also purchased)      Some Dutch Cheese (also purchased)      Some Margarine (also purchased0Not too bad! EhVery much love from your loving brotherFred
