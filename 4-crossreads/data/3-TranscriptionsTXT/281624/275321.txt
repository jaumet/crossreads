 was a lovely day and we went to Roubeh, Cairo, Shaubra, Bulac, and returned home through Abbassia late at night after an enjoyable ride. 
 Monday 17th April  Rumoured we are to move off in a few days to Salhia, the air is thick with rumours and one cannot write anything without Foundation.  Drew Fiver back pay.  Concert at night by party from Dermatological Hospital  It was very good. 
 Tuesday 18th  Rumours of movements still in the air but they are all contradictory.  The 9th LH have been in action and done good work the other side of Serapeum. 
 Wednesday 19th March [April]    Letters are being rec from our pals from [indecipherable] but they are not yet in action.  Am anxious about my brother as I have not heard from him.  Went to town [indecipherable]. 
 Thursday   Chasing about getting final drug supplies, inoculating all day. 
 Good Friday 21st Mar  Anniversary of Battle of Wazza  went to O'Rs in p.m. met Gwennie and for the second time in Egypt went to the impressive Stations of the Cross and after tea to the beautiful Benediction at the Reparatrice 
 Saturday 22nd   About one pm I was sent for to see a man in C Squadron and as soon as I saw him I at once rang for an urgent car, I took him to No 3 Hosp and just got him there and that was all for he died of Euremia shortly after.  My Dr was out of camp.  My brother arrived during the day from Serapeum looking well, his transfer has gone astray.  We went into town together to concert at Anzac Hostel where he stayed for the night.  I had a feeling something was wrong so returned to camp just in time to answer telephone to prepare report for post mortem.
