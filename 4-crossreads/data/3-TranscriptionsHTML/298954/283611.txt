<p>Marburg, just past Colne, is situated on the slopes of a hill on the crest of which is a fine old castle.</p>
<p>The tiled houses are also much in evidence here.</p>
<p>A striking contrast to Marburg is Bad Nauheim, an extremely modern little spa some distance further on.   Here the "Villa Rose, pension mod." flourishes (or rather flourished) in all it's glory, together with the Grand Hotel of a higher scale and tariff.   The county surrounding the Spa is very pretty, mostly undulating rye country dotted with fruit trees (at present just beginning to blossom.)</p>
<p>We pulled into Frankfurt-am-Main at about midday;  had quite a feed in the depot of the Deutsche Rote Kreuz. (Red Cross).</p>
<p>An egg, some beetroot, soup, and potatoes made quite a heavy meal (for Germany.)</p>
