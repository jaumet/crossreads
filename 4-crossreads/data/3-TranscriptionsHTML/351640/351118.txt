<p>star is  not yet above the horizon, a vale of cloud keeps him out of sight, yet do I hope that he will ere long step forth and be to us a guide &amp; strength. No matter how man prate in times of peace &amp; plenty about the wisdom of many councillors, in times of great danger all must depend upon the one brain that sees most clearly the true way, and knows how best to act in combating the grave events without waste and delay.<br/>So far in this great contest there has been, on our side, too much waste in men &amp; material, too little seriousness given to the whole affair by the great bulk of the people, too much underestimating of the strength of the enemy, too much blowing about what we have already done, &amp; a general want of tone which is an attribute of greatness now as ever. Let us pray that all may change for the better soon and that we may be given a glimpse of the light. The struggle cannot go on for ever and the solution may be nearer that is thinkable at this moment.</p>
<p>At the post office this afternoon they told me that Australian letters should be delivered to us tomorrow morning. Good, if the promise be but fulfilled. All Australian letters come from Suez pass on to Alexandria &amp; from there are returned to Cairo. This is a way with the Military people. Cannot be helped at present.</p>
<p>This afternoon I partook of afternoon tea with Mrs Bacon. I asked if her daughter was married or single. Reply was to the effect that she is Mrs Pirie, that her husband is alive, presently a soldier in an English regiment, that she has one son living in Sydney. Why does the lady not wear a wedding ring? On the third finger of her left hand she wears a gold circle with three diamonds. About it I spoke to her one day and laughing suggested that it was an engagement ring, she led me to believe that it was not, &amp; it held its place just for amusement sake. A deceiver!</p>
