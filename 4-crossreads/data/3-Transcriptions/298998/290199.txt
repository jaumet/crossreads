<p>but I have not seen anything to compare with this &ndash; although it is Hunland. We stopped at several large stations, en route to Stettin, <strike>these</strike> including Hanover and Berlin. At every station crowds of people flocked to the train to see us; fortunately we were not subjected to any unpleasantness or criticism; the posterns promptly dispersed the crowds. We crossed the River Spree and circled round Berlin, finally stopping in a suberb for a few minutes. Within the environs of the city every available foot of soil is under cultivation; the earth is sandy but no doubt properly manured.
