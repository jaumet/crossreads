<p>Troops kept coming on board up till about midnight.  Shortly afterward the steamer took her departure for Egypt.  I believe some of the boys are still ashore but they'll have to stay there now.  When she left I was in the Hospital.  Had a fearfull time was absolutely poisoned, nearly everyone who went ashore was more or less sick.    On top of that some of the late arrivals brought fines ranging from 5-0-0 to &pound;15-0-0.</p>
<p>28th-3-16 Tuesday<br/>Discharged from hospital this morning.  Am alright but the inside of my stomach is absolutely raw.  The ship &amp; everything on board are simply filthy.</p>
<p>29-3-16<br/>I believe the months loss of pay has been lifted from the fines mentioned above, that brings the penalty down to 5-0-0.</p>
