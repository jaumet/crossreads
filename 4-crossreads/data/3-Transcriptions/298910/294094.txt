<p>threw in 7 Francs &amp; tried hard to have a social evening &ndash; some 26 of us gathered &amp; got the use of a marquee down at the 5th F. Amb. A Committee selected had been working hard all day, having got permission to go to Albert where they purchased &ndash; Champagne &ndash; Wine &ndash; Beer &ndash; Cake &ndash; Dates &ndash; Preserved Fruit &ndash; Chocolate etc. We also had issued to us on Xmas day from Comforts Fund &ndash; 1 Pudding to three men, a few nuts &amp; lollies &ndash; this constituted our eatables. We made Tables out of Ammunition boxs &amp; laid blankets for a cloth. We had 6 Candles on the tables on empty jam tins also had a nice coal fire in a braizier. We had many toasts, most of which were wet ones. The speech of the evening really was that of H. Page &ndash; ex Clergyman &amp; one of our S.Br. His Toast was "Those we have left behind". My Toast, not being too good &amp; having no voice &ndash; I was allowed a little liberty, so I picked the Toast (To our Comrades &amp; Bearers who had fallen &ndash; their deeds &amp; valour) &ndash; which of course needed no speech, we stood with bowed heads for a few seconds &amp; drank the toast in silence. We tried hard to make merry in spite of our gloomy</p>
