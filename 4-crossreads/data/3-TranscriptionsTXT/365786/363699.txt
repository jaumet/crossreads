  The Arabs  mostly dwell in towns &amp; form the shopkeepers, officials, servants, donkey attendants etc. &ndash; they are tinged with the fatalism of orientals &amp; are indolent &ndash; bigoted Mohammedans they regard all other religions with contempt.  The Nubians  inhabit the Nile Valley between Assuan [also spelt Aswan] &amp; the 4th Cataract.  They despise the Egyptians to such an extent that a Nubian living in Egypt seldom has an Egyptian wife.  They make good servants (we had two) being clean, honest &amp; intelligent.  They are much blacker than the Arabs in colour.
