 Tuesday April 24th Left the hospital at 7 am. Motor cars conveyed us to the railway station from the main building. We had to change at Norwich. Had quite an enjoyable journey to Liverpool St station (London). Motor cars conveyed us to Paddington Railway station, caught train &amp; came on to Southall. Had to walk from the station to the Hospital. About half a mile. Southall is about 10 miles from London. The patients here are all Australians. There are a terrible lot with legs, or arms off &amp; eyes out, they are waiting for transport back to Australia. General leave is granted to within a three mile radius of the hospital from 2 pm till 6 pm. The Hospital is a very large place which used to be an asylum once. There are a good few munition girls about here, &amp; my word they are rough too. A fine day. 
 Wednesday April 25th They get good food here. The patients have to tidy up, make their own beds etc here, but it helps to pass away the time. A lovely afternoon. Went to a place called Ealing (about three miles away) this afternoon, &amp; went to the moving pictures there. There is an Electric tram service here. 
 Thursday April 26th Drew my uniform out of the pack store this morning, but owing to our orders to proceed to Weymouth being cancelled, we had to hand it back. The weather is getting much warmer now, today was beautiful all day, went to Ealing for the afternoon. Everything very quiet.
