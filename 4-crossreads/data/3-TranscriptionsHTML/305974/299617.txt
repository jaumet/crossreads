<p>1 June Thursday<br/>A very dreary journey, days seems like weeks.  Felt a bit sick in morning , owing to the bad food we are getting.  Done deck swabbing 1 am till 2.30 am.  Rained <strike> very </strike> during the early morning hrs.  Felt OK in afternoon.  Slept on upper deck.</p>
<p>2 Friday<br/>A very strong westerly wind blowing all day.  Very cold during the afternoon.  Sea very choppy.  Owing to a warship reporting a submarine in the vicinity of our vessel, we had to stand by our life boats from 2.30 pm until 8 pm.  Everyone be rather of an excitable nature owing to the report.</p>
<p>3 Saturday<br/>A very fine day.  Land in sight all day.  Playing cards nearly all day to pass the time away.  The journey getting very monotonous.  Saw some wreckage. Supposed to be the fruits of the submarine the previous day, when it was rumored the troop ship "Briton" was sunk.</p>
<p>4 Sunday<br/>Sea very calm.  Rather a cold day.  The fellow who was supposed to have started the rumor about the "Briton" being sunk was sent in quod, as headquarters says it is false.</p>
