<p>Darling Mum<br/>This is instead of a letter as there is nothing to say worth starting a letter for. I am feeling real well, and my foot is getting better every day, but the funny old Dr still keeps me in bed. There is not much writing on this, Sweetheart, but there is just as much love as if it were pages &amp; pages, Hope to have something to write about next week. Hope that card of the ward I sent last week has arrived alright. Lots of love &amp; kisses from your husband</p>
