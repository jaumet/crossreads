 Copy 
 May  25  5th 1918 
 Lt. Col. D. Fulton, Commandant H.Q., A.I.F., Cairo 
 I attach hereto inventory of contents of case deposited at Australian Depot Stores, Ghezireh. 
 I am sending a similar copy to Lieut. Smart, Administration, Australian Commonwealth Offices, London. 
 The catalogue of Works totalling 117 is evidence that my time has been thoroughly occupied.  My trip to the Front Line which I am now about to undertake should produce another dozen numbers.  I am taking it for granted that my commission will be extended until such time as I arrive in London, and I beg that you will take such necessary steps as will confirm this.  I take it that transportation for myself and my work is now being arranged and that I shall be informed at the earliest opportunity of the date of sailing. 
 Sgd.  G.W. Lambert Lieut. Official Artist, A.I.F.
