  
 I was glad to hear of Ol's convalescence, & hope she continues to gain in health & strength.  I wrote to her on Sunday but addressed it to Dowling St. There is little news up here.  We have had beautiful spring-like weather here until yesterday when the wind swung round to S.W. & both yesterday & to-day have been bitterly cold days. I will drop you a line on Saturday which you should receive on Monday as to the Dr's decision. Please give my love to all at home. Your loving son, Leo.
