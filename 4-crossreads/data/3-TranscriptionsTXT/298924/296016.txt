 Monday 3 February 1919 Rafa Field Officer on arrival.  Just read a letter from a Colonel's  wife re experience on the transport to Colonels.  Saloon had a fancy dress dinner &amp; in the middle of it a bucket of slops was dropped down the skylight &amp; a hose was put through one of the port holes &amp; half drowned some of the passengers, nice!!! Letter from Mother &amp; Day Dec. 8th &ndash; you had just received my first cable saying I was coming end of January.  Papers also arrived, many thanks. The foregoing rather strengthens the Padre's opinion, eh?
