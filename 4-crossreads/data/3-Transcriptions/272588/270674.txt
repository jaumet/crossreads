<p>Wednesday 13 March<br/>Very quiet on the front, and what few casualties there are are from gas.<br/>We are living well, &amp; doing nothing. Our meals are far better than we get at camp &amp; I am No. 4 &amp; chef.</p>
<p>Thursday 14 March<br/>Wet to-day. In a raid last night by 10th &amp; 12th Battns. on our left, fifty prisoners were brought in.  Fritz dropped a few showers of whiz-bangs about our dugout to-day some close.  They appear to have been a H.E. shell &amp; a sneezing gas the object being to render one unable to wear the respirator. We opened a bombardment on Fritz to-night at 9.30 but so far no retaliation.</p>
