 That was on 1st May. 
 The following day we were off again &amp; came back to a place called Behancourt. 
 On the 5th we moved to Allonville. Stayed there for four days &amp; then moved forward to La-Houssoye; we had only been there for an hour when we were shelled out of it and had to move out to a trench just in front. We stayed there for the night &amp; then moved up to close-reserve. That was on the 10th. On the morning of the 14th a party of Huns, 150 strong, raided us. We had only just finished digging the front line the night before &amp; there was a lot of it un-occupied. Well he got into the un-occupied part between "B" &amp; "C" Coys. At 10 a.m "B" Coy started to bomb from their end, "D" Coy started to bomb from their end, &amp; "C" Coy, who were in supports, advanced in two waves. They went at it that determined that the "Hunk fellers" refused to fight &amp; they surrendered. A bosker little stunt &amp; wonderfully successful.
