Tues June 6th - 16Alex and myself sent to O.P all day and put in a very miserable day with a strong cold wind and rain and also a little "ironmongery" from "Fritz".
Wed June 8th - 16Alex and myself arrived OP 6AM.  All quite till 4 PM when the enemy began shelling O.P. After waiting till the third shell hit the building, we vanished for awhile, but they must have kept a close watch on the place for as soon as we returned he started again and did not stop till the whole building was down.
