Its impossible to realise that men are just murdering each other around you, & that you are in the heart of a great battle. The frightful roar of artillery & scream of shell though brings one to reality, but even it passes off as soon as you leave the scene of battle, & when I am back again in my cosy room at Steenvorde, I quickly forget the horrible doings of the day & after a good dinner, develop my plates & then turn in with no more thoughts for the day, than if I had been at business all the while, & had just returned from a late evening working overtime!
