 Dear Mick 
 Yesterday I despatched three portions of camuflaged diary to you & trust the same will find you quicker than it left me. 
 Today the Mission visited Gaba Tepe from whence Jacko used to pound Anzac beach.  I managed to get a small painting of the stuff one sees of Anzac & environs from Gaba Tepe.  The expeditions are nearing the end of their course and I think from now on I shall be able to concentrate on the necessary data for my picture or pictures. 
 Spruce is up and about but a bit Malarious. 
 Today I rode a one eyed cob or Welsh pony which has been tried & found wanting by every other member of the outfit and I had a most enjoyable ride.  The little chap is a gentleman but fastidious and it is not boasting to say he performed like a show ring hack or saddle horse under my fatherly hand.
