are so far tying the N.Z.'s for first in the Division, and our team plays the 6th Regt tomorrow. I dont know whether this letter reads since Fred, just before dinner I was reading writing it and they kicked the football into the bivey of course I had to go and kick it then, and then we had our dinner  - made another start after dinner, then had to go and be enoculated and then the interpreter came and wanted me to take his photo, and I had to go and do it because he had gone and twirled up his moustache and brushed his hair and made himself look just like a turk. We are expecting a mail in any day so I'll write again when it comes. Love to Father and Mother and Hal. i am Your loving brother Robert C Wilson
P.S. The last part of this is a day older than the first and the very, last, two days
