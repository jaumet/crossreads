<p>6 February 1915<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Stables at 6.30<br/>Bert and I got our horses &amp; decided to go for a ride we started first at the Nile &amp; then road through mile upon mile of palms these palms are beautiful &amp; the natives treat them with respect the country or farming is magnificent, the best of anything I've seen as yet we arrived back at lunchtime.  I then had to go in for the motor to the Motor bay one was partly finished so I took it on the way out I hit the [indecipherable] &amp; had the misfortune to get off before I expected to, when I came back eventually I printed more photos to send home in the night I made several light flag poles for the kids after looking me over a viper I killed yesterday  Bed at 10 after a decent feed</p>
<p>7 February 1915 (page annotated 27)<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>Stables always stables<br/>I slept in this morning it being my turn I had to overhaul &amp; fix up machine for tomorrow Reports have been coming to hand concerning the fighting on the canal &amp; many wounded on both sides are arriving daily here. The Turkish prisoners are escorted here under strong escort by Australians. I went through the Cairo museum &amp; had the pleasure of seeing old Rameses &amp; the [indecipherable] only for him looking a little darker he hasn't changed much since I saw him last. News came in later that the B company are off to the canal tomorrow &amp; also the fifth infantry good luck to em I wish it was our turn which will probably be the next to [indecipherable] Bed at 9.</p>
