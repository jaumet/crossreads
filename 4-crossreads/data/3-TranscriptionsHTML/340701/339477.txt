<p>Easter Monday 9-4<br/>We are all desperately hungry after living on Tommy rations for a week.  The Drain pipe artillery are practicing every evening close alongside.  The last lot of Tommies got us for a tin of Biscuits &frac12; a box of Bully &amp; 25 Francs.  There was a big stunt last night 56 Tanks participating.  It was a great success.  Two army corps took part in it.  There has been a very heavy bombardment every night since we have been here.<br/>[First Battle of Bullecourt]<br/>Tuesday 10-4<br/>Heavy snowstorm today.  Slush everywhere.  Gen. Birdwood takes huts over [?] tomorrow.  Great news of successful air fighting yesterday.</p>
<p>Thursday 12-4<br/>I am not sure that today is Thursday but will have to chance it.  Fritz sent only 2 shells over yesterday.</p>
