<p>You must understand this was an attack after the primary surrender of Herbertshoe &ndash; a threatened recapture of the town by German &amp; Native police  -  They surrendered in time because they'd have got little quarter  -  Now I've heard more about the fight at Kabakaul &ndash; the fight for the wireless station &amp; why we lost men &amp; officers  -  There was no preliminary shelling of the Bush &amp; too few men were used on the job  -  Resistance was not anticipated  -  There was a road up to the Station &amp; dense bush on either side &ndash; very dense jungle with high leafy trees  -  I send a diagram  -</p>
<p>[diagram]<br/><u>Later</u> NB They don't seem to have gone up the side  -  Elwell stepped into the road &amp; was shot &ndash; anyone on the road was shot</p>
<p>You see the Beach &amp; the road up to the station from the beach  -  The N  Brigade &amp; our Tommies deployed &amp; went up the road at the double  -  Presently they came to wire entanglements &amp; a trench &amp; then they were met by a hail of lead from behind &amp; above &amp; if the niggers had been white men, few out of our crowd wd have come out alive  -  Niggers cant shoot like the GI rifle club chaps can &ndash; shot high but all the same our men fell thickly &amp; fast  -</p>
