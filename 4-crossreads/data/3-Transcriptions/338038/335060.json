<p>4<br/>crops of barley, lucerne, &amp; all kinds of vegetables. The Fella-heen (farmers) are a fine type of people, and very different to the miserable specimens to be seen in the cities. All this is modern Egypt.<br/>Then there are the wonders of old Egypt. First the Pyramids of Giza, at the foot of which our camp lies. To stand here and look at them one could scarcely credit that human beings would have the ingenuity and determination to erect such monuments. The largest of them, "Cheops", covers an area of 12 acres and is 451 feet high. Great blocks of stone weighing hundreds of tons have been collected from Heaven knows where and used to construct these tombs for the Ancient Kings of 3500 B.C. The Sphinx is also very wonderful but fades into insignificance when compared with the Pyramids as a work of the Human hand.<br/>Yesterday being Sunday, Colonel Tunbridge made up a party and took us out to Memphis, where the statue of Rameses II is to be seen. On the way we visited a number of tombs which have been restored and the carvings &amp; colourings still remain unimpaired in many of them. The finest I think was that of the Sacred Bulls. This tomb contains 65 coffins of black granite, measuring 14' x 8' x 7' and has beautiful carvings and hyroglyphics on its walls.</p>
