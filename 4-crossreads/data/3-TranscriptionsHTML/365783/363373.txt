<p>our camp is pitched is under water when the Nile inundates and if you scratch a few inches you come on to dampness.   I think this is largely responsible for the prevalence of pneumonia amongst the men.   I had to go out and inspect an Arab village this afternoon &ndash; I rode out on a donkey &ndash; wonderful little animals they are &ndash; it is surprising to see the huge loads they carry &ndash; so also the camels;  they are generally loaded up with a bundle of stuff about the size of a haystack.   I often wonder how you all are and indeed where you are &ndash; I have not yet had a letter &amp; it is now 3 weeks since we arrived here.  I send herewith a photo of myself taken a few days ago &ndash; also two photos taken on the Kyarra.   My tent is very comfortable &ndash; I borrowed a small chest of drawers from Mena House &amp; keep a lot of my clothes in it.   I have a large table at which I am now writing &ndash; in front of me pinned to the fly of the tent is the portfolio of all the dear ones.   I have found the mosquito net of great service &ndash; in spite of the cold the mosquitoes are very bad &ndash; none of the other fellows have nets &ndash; some of them have a sort of canopy made of butter muslin.<br/>I must now end up with the best love to the dearest of women &amp; hoping to see you all before very long,<br/>Yr. loving husband<br/>Will</p>
