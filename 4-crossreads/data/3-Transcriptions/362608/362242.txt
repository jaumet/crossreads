<p>At Sea<br/>21/5/19</p>
<p>My dear Brother<br/> We arrived at Colombo on 9th of May and to my surprise the Kanowman was in Port. She is now a troop ship and was on her way to England. We went ashore at 12 noon, and bought some curios and have to be on board at 6pm.<br/>We did not sail the next day so were allowed ashore again at 9am for the day, so another Sgt and myself hired a motor car at the Y.M.C.A. for 20shillings for 2 &frac12; hours and went for a glorious drive to Mount Lavinia a distance of about 12 miles out. Harry old boy it was just beautiful and don't miss this trip if you call at Colombo. We left Port at 6pm on 9/5/19 an so far have only</p>
