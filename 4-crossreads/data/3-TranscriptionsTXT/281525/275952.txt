 4/11/17 Florence The Church of Santa Croce is the Westminster Abbey of Florence and is an old barnlike building. Here are the tombs of Michael Angelo, Machiavelli (whose residence also is still intact) Rossini. The Palazzo Pitti is an enormous place and contains the Pitti Gallery. Went in here and saw more great masterpieces in painting and in statuary. Being Sunday there were crowds in through here today. Afterwards took a stroll in the sun through the fine Boboli Gardens which are very extensive and go round this Pitti Palace. At 4 pm went to "Faust" at the Pergola theatre &ndash; a long performance not finishing until 8 pm. The music was good and the acting fair. These Italians are given to spitting rather disgustingly at all times and places even at the dining table.
