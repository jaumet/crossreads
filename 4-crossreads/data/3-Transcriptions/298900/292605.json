<p>repairs over the holidays &amp; there were also a lot of visitors in the City.   At night we went to a Music Hall but it was second rate after the London shows.   Enjoying my stay very much.</p>
<p>Saturday 5th Jan<br/>   Decided to catch the 9.50 P.M. to Birmingham so sent a telegram to Elliston.   Had a good walk with Mr Harper in the morning but stayed in during the afternoon to yarn with the girls as I was leaving that night.   Four of them saw me off Elsie &amp; Sophie coming on to the Station.   The train was crowded but managed to get a seat O.K.   Had a look at the Municipal buildings before leaving Glasgow the Staircase being one of the wonders of the place.</p>
<p>Sunday 6th Jan<br/>   Arrived at Birmingham about 6 A.M. after having changed trains at Crewe, put in an hour or so in the waiting room &amp; then strolled round the place in order to fill in time until 10 A.M. when I judged that Elliston would be about.</p>
