  
 1919 May 13 to Westham Camp, where we were put into tents, as the huts were all full.  Our division was very lucky in getting this camp for a base, as the other divisions had to go to the Salisbury Plains camps.  After tea I went down onto the promenade.  A Sergeant from the 56 Battn said to me "Is your name Rose".  I said "Yes". He said "Mine is Haviland".  I couldn't have picked him out after 12 years, having last seen him at All Saints College, but I had evidently not changed much.  A lot of our men were still here.  Quota No 26 had not left, so we began to look forward to a rather protracted stay in Blighty. 
 May 14 The next day I was issued with a few equipment shortages, & was medically examined, & also inoculated against the flu. 
 May 17 On May 17 we were reviewed by General Rosenthal.  The review, which was held on the parade ground, behind the huts, went off very well.  After tea went out in a rowing boat.  During the first few days we were at Weymouth, we spent most of our time getting shortages etc.  In the afternoon we were free to go within  a five mile radius of the town.
