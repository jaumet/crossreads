<p>long name where we got something else to eat &amp; where we were able to get out &amp; stretch our legs a bit. About midday we pulled into Alexandria &amp; were run right on to the wharf where the boat, which was to take us to England, was moored. This was the NZ "H.M.T. Franconia" a Cunard Liner of 43000 tons and as it afterwards turned out this was her last trip as she was torpedoed on her return journey to Egypt.</p>
<p>About 3 pm we were all on board, 4500 troops, &amp; at 5.30 pm we pulled out into the Mediteranean with a Destroyer as escort. There were 5 troop decks on the Franconia &amp; I was down on the bottom one below water level &amp; had we been torpedoed, we never stood a dogs chance of getting out, as there was only 1 single flight of stairs to let 400 men get</p>
