<p>Instead of having to apply to a Theatre box office an English lady set apart portion of her own home as the Ticket office &amp; herself &amp; equally situated assistants performed the work.</p>
<p>When the sentry applied he was ushered into this ladys sitting room where the "Staff", all titled people, were at work.</p>
<p>The sentry applied for a dress circle ticket for a seat unobtrusively placed at the side, he was not ambitious to appear right in the centre of the Theatre. He would be satisfied if he could be placed on one of the end seats from which the Stage could be seen and a fair view of the Audience, &amp; also so that he could go for a smoke or refreshment during the interval without in the least disturbing any one. The lady seemed to think it strange that the very best available seat was not only asked for but demanded. However after a minutes thought the lady, looking at the plan, said she could give the Sentry, to her mind a seat suitable in every way.</p>
<p>Thanking her  the Sentry paid the price &amp; received the ticket. Asking to be shown where the seat was situated in order that he would know how to reach it &amp; what was more important how to leave it for the lounge during the intermissions he was shown a seat right in the front row of the dress circle exactly in the centre.</p>

The Sentry pointed out that they had evidently mistaken him for an officer but he was only a private &amp; did not wish to be "displayed" of "featured" in such an ostentatious manner. The lady replied &amp; was backed up by her companions You're an Australian! You have been to the War! You have done your bit! Is not that as much as you can do! You have paid your money! therefore you are as much entitled to that seat as any one &amp; in fact I would just as soon accept your money as General Haig's for he would only</p>
