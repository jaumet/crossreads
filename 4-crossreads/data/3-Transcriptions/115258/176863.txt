<p>the one I wrote out and posted to you about a month ago, however when the new one comes I suppose I might as well sign it and send it along too to make doubly sure. What is the 60 acres you are putting in wheat this year. Is it all out in the back paddock? As you are putting in purple straw and everybody is predicting a drought in 19 I suppose you will cut it for hay and if necessary mix it with the straw stack which I noticed in one of the photos taken by Capt Pearce, is still standing OK. The seed wheat delivered at 4/3 a bushel is pretty cheap is it not? I have just been reading the P.F.A. magazine, and it is one of the most interresting I have seen. They dont say much for farming, but they seem to think there is a bright future after the war for sheep men and especially for the sort of sheep men we are - with fine long wools and mutton! The Pastoral review, with the photos of home in it has not come along yet. it gave me quite a surprise to hear you had 1300 ewes to lamb this year. Why it is only a year or two ago that you were hoping to have 500 next year. How are the rabbits on the Lease now? I suppose they are still there as it is a hard paddock to get them out of all at once - also how is my kurrajong near the lambs yard getting on? What horse do you use about the place in the cart now? Is it old Nugget? If Fred is not too busy, make him write me a letter with all the small news of the place in; no body has mentioned any of the horses or cows to me for ages and I wont know Nora from Jersey when I get back, if I dont look out. There is no news to tell you Father so I&#39;ll stop. Love to Mother and Fred. Good bye and many happy returns of to day. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson</p>
