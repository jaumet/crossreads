in the home sense Friday being the Mohammedan Sabbath. I am surprised to find how much French I have picked up my accent is regarded as good. I find it most useful, all the commercial folk speak French here it is an entre to the better class acquaintainceship. 
We have now 4 Cinema shows going here a good thing for the boys keep them out of Cairo where so many of our men have been ruined by diseases of a very dangerous character. 
Many will be sent home for this reason. I should like better than all to be home in your quiet house today with you around me in some peace quiet this is a noisy raucous atmosphere at best. Tomorrow we go to the rifle ranges again for special shooting then a drill practise again. 
I hope you will write often all of you tell me all the news everything about home interests us. 
Give my love to every one.
I am in good health and reason
Yours most affectionately 
Jack
