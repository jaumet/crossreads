 Friday 3 September, 1915 
 Have been crook today. 
 Expected an attack at night. We have no supports at all &amp; only 4 men to each post in the firing line, we would have had a bad time if they had given it a fly. As it was they opened up an exceptionally heavy rifle &amp; machine gun fire which had no effect except making us a bit more watchful.
