<p>on for us in the evening.<br/>The health of the boys is, on the whole, very good; although those who were unfortunate enough to catch malaria in the Jordon Valley, are constantly feeling its effects. Poor chaps go down at a moments notice &amp; they never really know one minute if they are going to be bad the next. Needless to say everyone is anxiously awaiting orders to move further south &amp; thus nearer the boat but from present indications we will be here a long time yet.<br/>Well Miss Wyndeyer as you probably have lots of friends on this front I will not weary you with what would probably be stale news, so shall close. Thanking you &amp; all connected with the 6th &amp; 7th L.H Comforts Fund for your grand work on our behalf.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Geo J Watson<br/>"C" Squadron<br/>6th Regt.</p>
