<p>My dear Mother<br/>Here we are at an out of the way place, &amp; I post this on chance only. The trip from the Cape has been smooth the whole way &amp; I'm feeling awfully well. I had an absys on my tooth that troubled me with neuralgia but that's all right now. We expect to arrive in England Oct 11th<br/>Best love to all, &amp; tell Hazel I will probably try to see Olly in the old dart but am not sure. Dene</p>
