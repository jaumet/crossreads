<p>To Brigadier. With reference to signal of 6.45 from Comdr. Beresford I suppose you are dealing with the matter as I am not doing so. I do not understand why party at W.T. Station have been delayed so long or the reference to motor lorry. Do you. A guard has been posted at the pier head please relieve it as soon as convenient 1730&nbsp;</p>
