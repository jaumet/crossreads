<p>25.3.15<br/>Thurs. 25th.  The bugle called us up at 6 oclock this morning, &amp; most of the boys were surprised that they were not called during the night, as the officers told them before going to bed, to sleep with all their clothes on, as there would probably be a night alarm.  We had the lines up by 9 oclock &amp; were soon on the same road back to Maadi.  It is a fine trip with the Nile on one side, &amp; lovely crops of lucerne &amp; barley on the other;  we arrived at Maadi about 4 o'clock &amp; were finished tea by 6 oclock.  The Maadi boys held a concert in our honor, &amp; it was very good;  some of the boys raided the canteen &amp; captured 3 barrels of beer, one was retaken by the guard.</p>
