 If you and your Mother agree to this you had better call upon my Brother Joseph Hall at Mr. Lowther's commercial Stores, Sussex St. Sydney and if he agrees with you about the scheme you may consider it done. instructions respecting this will be forwarded to my Brother this mail &ndash; 
 Love dear Arthur to you and your Mother &amp; sisters 
 I remain your eff. Uncle John Hall
