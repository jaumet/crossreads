<p>glad to have him back again for he apparently has had a particularly bad time with his wounds. He spoke of being marked P.U. but considered that after a good rest in Australia he could be fit for some duty again. Maybe he will be kept out there and given a home job (which he has certainly earned).<br/>I have been back up the line for some time but the knee still makes itself felt at times and if it does not get quite o.k. I shall have to give it a rest as nowadays with us is pretty strenuous.<br/>I suppose by now you are all experts in the art of driving a car and can have some enjoyable week-ends with it. That is an amusement still in store for me.<br/>I hope this will catch an early mail out, but of course we are all in the dark as to shipping between Australia and this side of the world.<br/>My affectionate regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy and yourself<br/>From yours Sincerely<br/>Whitfeld</p>
