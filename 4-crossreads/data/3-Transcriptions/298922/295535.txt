<p>Monday 13 August 1917</p>
<p>My room mate is a Royal Scot, by name Capt. WEIR but no relation. Yesterday we went for a sail &amp; had Tea at the Yatch Club. All the Clubs in Alex. have made us Hon. Members.</p>
<p>Examined by M.O. today, remaining for a few days yet &ndash; expect a good mail is following me up somewhere.</p>
<p>Posted Diary &amp; photos yesterday. I wonder how many of my letters are lost these days. <strike>Big mail has followed me &ndash; Mother (23/6/17, 27/6/17, 17/6/17) Day 17/6/17, Laura 16/7/17, 17/7/17. Wife one a week &amp; more. Also for [indecipherable] &amp; Photos very good &amp; many thanks. Also Australasians.</strike></p>
