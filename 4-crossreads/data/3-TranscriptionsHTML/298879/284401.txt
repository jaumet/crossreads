<p>July 1915<br/>Monday 5<br/><u>Fine</u>   Got some fresh clothing today from the Hospital stores. I with about 20 others came over here to the Provost Marshall's camp for <u>" light duty"</u></p>
<p>Tuesday 6<br/>Fine Placed on duty on the Aust. Pier No1 to help with the Lighters when they came in full of water. There are six of us altogether and we get on well. So far no lighters have turned up as there is one in the way which is aground and cannot be pulled off by hand.</p>
