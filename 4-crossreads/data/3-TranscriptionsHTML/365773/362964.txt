<p>your address to both Tom Mann &amp; Colonel Stevens &amp; you will get an eye full "excuse the slang" of the finest Battalion commander the A.I.F. turned out &amp; Tom Mann the best chap we ever had, looked upon as an ideal Company commander, he was an original member of my Section at Kensington - there is only 2 of us here now Lieut Purdon being at present with my company.
