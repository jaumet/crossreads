  
 Cairo 15/3/16          R 19.4.16 C/o Ol's Boudoir 
 My dearest Father, You will see by address that I am writing this in at Ol's.  After a bit of trouble I got up on duty Leave yesterday.  Landed in Cairo about 2 P.M. & went round to Ol just to let her know I was in.  Was on duty till 6 & then Ol & I had tea together after which we went out to Heliopolis & see Walter.  The 3 of us came back into Cairo, & had a feed of ice-cream & stuff & then I went back to Camp with Wal & slept there.  I think Ol is looking better than when I saw her last but Walter is a bit thinner in the face. I have all day to-day off & have to report for duty at 8 in the morning.  I am very sorry that I won't be able to see Rid who is at Tel-el-Keber but it is out of the Question. Ol & I are going out to the Zoological Gardens after dinner.  She is very bright & needless to say we have tons to yap about. The weather here has been & is beautiful & fine & is getting hotter especially about noon. The mail closes today for Australia & it is the last mail for 6 weeks that we are able to send on account of a big move that is taking place here. Must close now   With love to all at home Your loving son Leo.
