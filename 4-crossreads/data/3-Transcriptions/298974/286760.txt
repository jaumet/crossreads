<p>Pvt D.B. Fry 4992<br/>D Coy 3rd Batt<br/>Inf. Depot Liverpool</p>
<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>Just a line to let you know my address. It is as above. Here I will stay till the preliminary Depot Officers Training school commenses about the 18th prox. I have a fair chance of getting into this. Alec is in E Coy of the 3rd Batt near by<strike>e</strike>. I reckon have had a record try to get to Liverpool and you cant imagine how I appreciate being allowed the favour of serving my country again! But today the Lieut was quite decent. The place fairly reeks with Uni students at present, and the crowd I'm with aren't had at all. A boy named Bolton from Killara and Carruthers &amp; Hawkins from Lindfield. Well, best love, will try to get down before you go to Tuggerah. Your loving son</p>
<p>Dene.</p>
