10th September Monday Morning Went to Arques to the 5th Brigade but unfortunately they had received orders to move quickly towards a concentration centre. So I proceeded to Fauquembergues to the 3rd Divisional Headquarters. These are situated in a glorious old chateau, surrounded by fine avenues glades with grass lawns. Most in fact of the large chateaux are taken over by the Military. I met Capt Bean, our Official Correspondent thence to Ralenscourt, where we interviewed the Photographic Censor. His duty is to examine all photographs likely to convey any information to the enemy - seemingly in most cases a most absurd proceeding
