<p>rained over fiercely for 20 minutes, but luckily didn't get us, though they were too close to be ignored. <br/>Thursday 2nd May  At 2.30a.m. he poured over a good many shells again, same time as yesterday, &amp; before we had got out of the trench to go for rations luckily. When they stopped, we went over to Coy. Hdqrs. I was carrying to C Coy. in supports, &amp; was glad it wasn't to A &amp; B in the front line, much further out. I had 2 tins of tea &amp; they got mighty heavy, as Cpl. Begg led us at a brisk walk in single file across the heavy ground. I'd have given anything for a rest, but you drop behind if you stop, &amp; I stuck with it, besides the sooner these jobs are finished the better, the way he shells at intervals. I trudged along with the tins till the perspiration rolled under my tin hat into my eyes, &amp; I was quite wet with it, as we at last reached C Coy's trench &amp; a sergeant took the tucker. Then there was the long walk back to the Crucifix (where the limber comes), with the empties from the tea &amp; stew at 8 p.m. I struck a big thermos, &amp; it was heavy enough empty. I reckon the chap who carts these right up to the front line filled with stew deserves the D.C.M. Machine gun bullets whizzed uncomfortably near in the grass at times, but we got back with them, &amp; then another long walk back to our trench by 4.30 a.m. without</p>
