believe tears came to her eyes, but said nothing, but promised to write send parcels to me said she would always be interested in my future would look forward to my next visit (of course I won't). I told her I was leaving by the 9.15 train she said she would come down see me off in the morning, true enough she was there, just as the train was moving off I plucked up my courage kissed her, she blushed so prettily, the last I saw of Peggy was standing on the platform waving to me, I did not like leaving I can tell you but I knew if I did not soon get out I would have tied myself down that would not be fair to the girl even supposing she would have me, but if ever I go to Scotland again, there will be something doing for I will put my luck to the test.
