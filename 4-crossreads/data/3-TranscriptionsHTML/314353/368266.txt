<p>November 23, 24<br/>142.<br/>Today the sun's out, a cold shining, but a splendid break from the mist that's been over the hills&hellip;</p>
<p>Yesterday the rumours were all about Boulogne, and in Merridens an excitement.  The rumour was of Cambrai's fall to us, and prisoners numbering 8000:  of guns captured, and 130 aeroplanes.  For the advance there was no artillery preparation.  Midday today no confirming word has reached us.</p>
<p>Turning in:  a windy, hurrying thin clouded sky, a half moon and a few faint stars for the instant seen, between a running  tide of clouds.  No mail.</p>
<p>143.  November 24<br/>Mists blown to fine rain:  over the hills fold follows fold of blown haze. .. Mail.  Chas. Dawson Art  corres. course.. written for from Ecuire.  Posting today for J. Hassall's book:  possibly I'll take his course:  the winter will make any sketching hard, but it will be worth while keeping my hand in.</p>
<p>Should like to make some Portrait sketches, Les or Blue or Frank D.. one of the new chaps, Marks &ndash; a fine Jewish face, delicate and aristocratic:  would make fine study.  Of all the new reinforcements he the only promising man &ndash; with a 5th Divy L/Cpl., wearing 3 service stripes.. the rest cheap raw numbers.</p>
<p>"Stray Birds" &ndash; all loveliness, full of fine epitaphs&hellip;<br/>"Life is given to us, we earn it by giving it."<br/>"The storm of the last night, has crowned this morning with glorious peace."<br/>The Burning log bursts into flame and cries &ndash; "This is my flower, my Death".</p>
<p>144.<br/>Evening.  This afternoon to Desvres for a bath &ndash; a bath in a great cemented basin, twice the size of the Bondi baths &ndash; and the water warm, hot at the sides &ndash; half a Battalion in with us, men of splendid build, browned still from the summer.  Part of the works of a great cement manufacturing&hellip;  Will to Desvres the first fine afternoon.</p>
<p>Outside a howling wind, and cold scurrying clouds.  Candles in the Billet blown all ways &ndash; all churlessness.  Early for a while the musick of "Chu Chin Chou" was in the long high barn, but the singing died as the wind grew.</p>
