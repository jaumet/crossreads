<p>writing up my diary in a well sandbagged, camouflaged dugout which three of us constructed this evening.  Our chaps hopped over this morning &amp; stiff fighting is still going on judging from the rumble of the guns.  The weather is beautifully mild to-night.  It has been hot &amp; dry for some time past &ndash; quite a record for this part of France &amp; a great help to Foch &amp; the numerous attacks he is making.<br/>For the last three days I have made periodical trips down to the river (twice to-day).  It is great in the water and the majority of the chaps are taking advantage of the proximity of the Somme.  We are all getting round in thin shirts &amp; shorts and are as brown as berries.<br/>Had a visit from a taube last night &amp; he dropped a couple of bombs pretty close &ndash; I saw the sheet of flame go up from our dugout.  We lead quite an underground life now.  So far I am proud to be able to say I have escaped being "chatty".</p>
