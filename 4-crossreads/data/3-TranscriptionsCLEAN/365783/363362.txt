We arrived at Suez at 9 P.M. & anchored in the streamTuesday 12th January.At Suez we encountered the usual collection of [indecipherable]boat men with their motley wares.Left Suez 11 AM & had a clear run through the Canal - we hadn't to tie up once - but plenty of vessels proceeding in the opposite direction had to stand aside for us - apparently we took precedence over them though being a transport.    Soon after entering the Canal we passed camps of Indian soldiers who were guarding the canal.   Warlike preparations were in great evidence in the entrenchments earth works, barbed wire entanglements & sandbag redoubts.    These works were situated about a mile apart on both sides of the Canal.   From some of the officers we learnt that the Turks were only two days march from the Canal & an attack was expected at any time.   As we passed each camp the sentries turned out & presented arms.  On numerous occasions we had enquiries from the shore - Who are you? where are you going? are we downhearted?It was a very different trip to the last one I had had through the Canal - no donkeys, & no boys running along the banks & turning somersaults, no mendicants - nothing but tall swarthy & exceedingly business like looking Indian soldiers.
