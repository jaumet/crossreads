<p>My dear Colonel</p>
<p>I am returning herewith Senator Pearce's letter, as I am unfortunately not able to help in this matter. Let me explain. The 3rd Divisional Cyclist Company never joined up with the Division; they have done away with the Cyclists as a Divisional unit. I am not at all sure whether this Company has been retained as Cyclists at all, &amp; am under the impression that the whole of the personnel has been converted into infantry, &amp; it is quite possible that some, if not many, of the Company have proceeded to France as drafts. However, I do not know this for certain, nor do I know the present or former whereabouts of the Cyclist Company. Possibly the authorities at Tidworth could tell you.</p>
<p>I am sending the Minister's letter back to you instead of direct to Tidworth, so that you might know what the situation was.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Judge Ferguson wrote to me, not about his own son, but about another very well qualified man who belonged to the same unit, &amp; who has come to me some weeks ago &amp; is employed in a legal capacity, he being a prominent barrister in New South Wales.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>John Monash</p>
<p>To B. General Sir Newton Moore<br/>Can you suggest anything in this matter?<br/>R. McC. A. 11. X. 16.</p>
