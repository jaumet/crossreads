Stay! consult first Lynwood Palmer if not by word of mouth by letter, ask him if he'll let his place for September &amp; last week in August.  If he says no ask him if there is anything likely to do for me, an old barn to work in and a horse available as model.  Then try Talmage in re a possible place in Cornwall.  Write also Syb Hodgson or Mrs. Somebody as to cheap place for one month near her &amp; horses.  In the meantime I write Australia House urging their providing studio accomodation but this is bound to drawn blank, I fear.  Fred Liest is another source of information if approached without fear or prejudice.  Now out of this you get a request to try &amp; find house &amp; some kind of barn if possible within an hour of London for six weeks at least beginning second week in August.
