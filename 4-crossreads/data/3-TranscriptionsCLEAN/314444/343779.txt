folk are having a holiday, but I haven't heard of anything in our camp.
Well, dear mother, there is but little news, so I'll finish, hoping to write a longer scribble next time. Don't get down in the dumps. I am all right and well and always lucky.
God bless you. Tons of love and a big kiss fromYour loving sonKen.X X X X X
