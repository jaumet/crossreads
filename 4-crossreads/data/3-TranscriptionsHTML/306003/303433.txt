<p>Middleweight Championship so I have won my first tournament;<br/>Shand 2nd &amp; Whitney 3rd then met for the heavyweight &amp; Shand knocked Whitney out in one round, neither men could box &amp; Whitney looked very small;  as soon as I cooled down after the contest my arm went very stiff &amp; I could not raise it level with my shoulder &amp; came back to the medical tent &amp; had it dressed before going to bed.</p>
<p>18-7-16<br/>Tue 18th<br/>Woke up the morning with a touch of influenza,<br/>A Taube flew over us again this morning but made off as soon as she saw our plane coming on the scene &amp; dropped no bombs;  Saw James this morning &amp; his leg is pretty bad &amp; goes into the Field Hospital today, &amp; will probably be sent away altogether for a time.</p>
