<p>whole of last night.  Church service held by Corp Cosier in mess shed, too busy to attend.</p>
<p>Monday 7.8.16<br/>Went on duty in motor to Estaires &amp; Bac St Maur, returning to Estaires where I spent a couple of hours before returning.  Walked back, arriving at D.R.S. about 6 pm.</p>
<p>Tuesday 8.8.16<br/>In evening walked a mile or so along a country lane in Doulieu to look over an old windmill; very interesting.</p>
<p>Wednesday 9.8.16<br/>No variation in daily routine.  Taking advantage of opportunities &amp; living very high; good news coming from all fronts; on the whole, in good spirits.</p>
