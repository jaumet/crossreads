hand dangling uselessly with a bullet through it. "Taking prisoners indeed. I?d cut the throats of some if I hadn't been onwell!". Groves goes on leave today to England. During the morning our regimental band is hard at work practising and fast getting into shape. N.C.O's class commenced this afternoon under Penna Alderson R.S.M McIntyre. All new aspirants for stripes ready. Mess this evening was elaborate in honor of Dr. Craig's majority ? our embyro band amalgamated with 23rd for the evening and rendered a programme of music. The Colonel 2/Lt Col Davis myself and C.M. Robinson made speeches and the old doctor responded very feelingly. Having wined the band masters and turned them free, Evans and others sang. The former gave us the Irish National Anthem in Gaelic and in English. A few of the more convivial souls proceeded to get well pissed in accordance with custom. Whatever our opinions about liquor in private life, there is no doubt it is a curse in the Army, the absolutely "dry" army will win the war.
