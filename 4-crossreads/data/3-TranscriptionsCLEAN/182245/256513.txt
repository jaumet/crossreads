 Friday 29 th  Dec. 
 Misty rain in morning, & a cold [gale?] 
 in evening. We had reviellie at 3 AM 
 & moved out of camp at 7.15 AM & all 
 were very glad to get a move on at 
 last. We entrained at Amesbury 
 & reached Southhampton Docks 
 about midday. Got all our battery 
 gear on board & with the 25 th  Bat 
 & 33 rd  (Qld) we sailed at 8 pm in 
 an old German boat the "Huntscraft" 
 (nee S&uuml;dmark). It was bitterly 
 cold but not two rough. 
 Saw Spes Wharton marching
