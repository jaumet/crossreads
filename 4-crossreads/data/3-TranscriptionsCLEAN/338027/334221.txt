  
 Friday, 6 August, 1915 From daybreak the enemy started to shell our gully, evidently the guns are located, everything is bustle for the attack on Hill 971 commences to-night, we are all wearing large calico patches on our back, so that the artillery will be able to distinguish their own men.  I walked over to the rest gully where the 4th Bde are and met C.B. on returning a shell burst only five yds from me, bits flying in all directions, how I escaped I know not.  About 4 p.m. the bombardment started all our beach battery guns were firing they were howitzers, the enemy had our range beautifully, their enfiladed fire was splendid only being a few yds from the batteries and about 50 yds from us, we all had to take cover, when I read this in later years it may seem like exaggeration but over a 1000 shells passed over our heads inside two hrs.  one shell lit some gorse near a battery and three men were nearly roasted their clothes, hair & skin being entirely burnt off.  They were brought to the N.Z. hospital & Picric Acid soon soothed their agony.  To-day was our baptism of Hell, let loose.  To-morrow we will see the greatest [indecipherable] in history. 
 Saturday, 7 August, 1915 Yesterday the L.H. & others captured at [indecipherable] 1000 yds of trenches on the right flank.  Soon after tea last night we were told to prepare for action and we followed the Gurkhas & 4th Brigade & N.Z. up we all carried stretchers and very little equipment we journeyed through the main sap until we came to the first sights of the battle, the N.Z. dressing station hundreds of wounded were here but the lads had a runaway victory after daybreak we started to work our duty was to evacuate the Gully of Chailak Dere, we scattered and brought in a lot of wounded, mostly Turks bayonetted then we formed three stations the collecting from the aid post near the firing line then the evacuating to the beach our first mishap was when one of our barges loaded with stretchers was sunk by the Turks, then they started to shell the beach and they could not evacuate them on to the ships owing to the heavy fire, and the poor devils were lying about in agony watching the shells bursting amongst them, three wounded were killed, and one of our men was wounded, our aid post was just the same, we were under heavy fire all day & night & had to dress wounds with bullets whistling about our ears it was only a bit of a dugout.
