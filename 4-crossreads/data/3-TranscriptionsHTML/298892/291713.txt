<p>Fritz's ineffectual attempts to hasten their departure with his anti-aircraft guns. Numbers of the shells appeared to burst on top of them but they continued on their course apparently unheeding and unharmed. Occasionally they would alter their course slightly to throw his guns out of range and the next few bursts would go wide until they picked up the target again.<br/>Soon their course was speckled with small black puffs from Fritz's bursting shell. Soon the guns desisted and scanning the sky for the cause we distinguished seven little dots at a great height. They were some of the enemies planes giving chase. It soon became apparent that they were gaining on our planes and were bound to finally catch them. Their airmen evidently realised the fact for while one of them sped onwards the other turned to meet the oncoming planes.<br/>Ours was a heavy battle plane carrying two men - the pilot and an observer. Three of the German planes were in advance and we heard the spiteful pop-pop-pop of their machine guns as they engaged our plane. Our craft manoeuvred splendidly. The three boshes being at a greater height had the advantage of him and again and again as one or other would dive down at him spitting bullets he would do a graceful curve and leave them careering ahead past him whilst he spat fire at them in  return. The other four now came up and began shooting down on him from a distance whilst three circled round and engaged him at close quarters. Up and down they went describing curves and twists in the air but soon it became apparent that escape was practically impossible for our plane. Turn whichever way he would he was faced by a foe. The manoeuvring was simply wonderful to behold. Times out of number he threw his pursuers off the track but having the slower machine he was at a terrible disadvantage.</p>
