 [Page headed Personal and crossed out.] Busy shopping &amp; going to teeth attended to, these notes please are not interesting- Hear our men are doing well in France- a Mail is in but all my letters will be with the Brigade  Will have time to write you decently &amp; also Mrs Forth.  Nowell has quite "Le Grande manner" &amp; has the slow (plenty of time) manner of those who live in the East for long-   We bridged a few years in yarning from old Carrakoorte days- Saw Cuth Fetherstonhough &amp; his wife both well.
