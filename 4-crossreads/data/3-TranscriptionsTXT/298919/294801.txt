evening I paid another visit to the Presbytery.  The Rev was very pleased to see me & arranged a trip down the West End for Monday.Saturday 10th July 1915.  Went ashore soon after breakfast  to tailors etc returned about lunch time.  Went ashore with 4th who was going down to country for few days.  Saw him to St Pancreas and then took the Bakerloo tube to Baker St.  Alighted here & went to Madam Tussards wax works.  Figures all very natural, some so much so that one feels inclined to talk to them.  Good crowd of German relics from France, and an incendiary bomb dropped from a Zeppelin on one of its raids over the East End somewhere near where
