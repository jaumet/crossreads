 [explanatory diagram] 
 It will be seen that the transmitting station is actually an open circuit radiator. So it is, and the circuit is completed through the distant ariel, instruments &amp; earth return thus: 
 [explanatory diagram] 
 Supposed complete circuit is shown by arrows. 
 The wave length of a station is explained thus
