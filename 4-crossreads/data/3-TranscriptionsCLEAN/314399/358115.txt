  
 Monday 28 April 1919 Went everywhere looking for rooms or a flat. Did Earls Court, Edgeware  Road,  Southamptom Road & all over the city. Had lunch with Harry. Met all the theatrical heads. Harry Weldon & a host of others. Got fancy costume from Rayaio. Mine a cowboy & Bills a Dutch boy. Looked well. Went to the dance & thoroughly enjoyed it. Gee I had a bonny time. Mostly with Janet tho. The floor was good (had been an old ward) & the supper magnificent. Do me. Started at 8.30 pm & finished at 3.30 am. The sisters made beds for us on the floor in the dance ward so we were set. Went to bed about 4.30 am. 
 Tuesday 29 April 1919 Up at 7 am. Got brekker at the hospital & then Bill & I kicked off. Bill to his class & me to take the gear back. Had a shave, another brekker & then got all our gear to the flat at Earls Court. Decided we'd go there. Met Bill for dinner & then came here to the flat after seeing Marie & Janet.
