The Sgt didn't like the look of him - so he took two of us up to gain also get our impression - he was close cropped, sallow complexion & his clothing was a very scratch affair get up - just what might have been got together on a battlefield - We had a good look at him & then went back to the waggons 50 yds away We had no sooner turned back than he set off walking at a good pace in the opposite direction
We all agreed that it didnt look too right So the Sgt jumped on his horse & trotted after him We got out our rifles in case there was any trouble & he made any resistance
