  
 Friday 25 July 1919 Claires' Birthday 
 Many happy returns Kiddie. Had to wait at Swindon 3 hrs but got into the train & slept. Arrived at Warminister at 7.30. Got a car to camp. At morning tea I met quite a crowd I knew. Was given a platoon this morning. Drew 12  for voyage 
 Saturday 26 July 1919 Parade as usual this morning. Nothing else of note happened all day 'cept in the evening some of the crowd got drunk & kicked up a noise. Sent a cable home. Played bridge & won 1/6.
