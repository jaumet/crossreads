<p>to the front, stay here, transport duty or Ambulance remains to be seen. Special Reinforcements are we, dumped into a General Hospital. The military rules of this place are very strict &amp; I start work at 2 pm on General Duties. Sort of wharf labourer's job, but no Union. We work twelve hours a day here &amp; I resolve to get out of it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>8th Nov:-<br/>Quartered in tents in the Palace Garden. Reveille 6-am   Parade 6-45 am. Work as usual. Wash up. Scrub floor. Carry meals &amp; all sorts of hard work about Hospital. Very interesting? Nearly 1000 rooms in the place   Tremendous size. Was to be a second Monte Carlo. The food is good, Patients well looked after &amp; the only ones worked hard are general duty orderlies.</p>
