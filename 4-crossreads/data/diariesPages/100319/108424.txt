Crowther we again got in the car and soon covered the ground back to Bde. Called at D.H.Q and saw the General who was playing bridge. Evidently the people here are something of hunters as antlers brushes and hunting horns adorned the hall entrance. Had another wad here ? it was just as well that there were not many more places to call at. A fine frosty night but pretty dark as the car dumped us down at the Chateau again. Today Selleck went into Abbeville and I was annoyed.

Another perfect day. The air was full of falling leaves as there was a slight breeze. The ground covered with a rustling carpet. Put in the morning going round the Brigade Signal School and the French Mortar Battery. Afternoon a good football match with Bde.
