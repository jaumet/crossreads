<p>on for weeks telling you about that trip, but we have not much time for letter writing now &ndash; not like Egypt &ndash; so I will have to get on.

By the time the last day was done we were all just about played out &amp; were beginning to wonder where we were bound for. Many suggested Berlin direct &ndash; but we're not there yet. Fairly comfortable quarters we are in, billetted of course, on a pretty little old farm, right in the country.
