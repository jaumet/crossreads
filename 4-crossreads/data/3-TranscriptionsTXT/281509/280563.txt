 Up at 9 a.m. Our squad take on cooking for day. I fry the bacon in a dixie top cleaned out with a muddy sand bag.  No water for tea. for dinner we make a dry hash very good. Water arrives &amp; tea also. Fritz shells persistently all day &amp; night but does little damage. No cases. Tea we have fried mutton chops very tasty. Receive 11 more letters. Rev. Inglis, MaLachlans, Emmie Gulliford etc. Our latrine blown sky high last night.
