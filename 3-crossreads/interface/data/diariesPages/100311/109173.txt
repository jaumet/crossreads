20/9/17 Canal Area
10.40. Had just given the order to advance when Burrage our liaiason with Division came with an order to stand fast. A few seconds later a runner brought us news that the third objective had been taken. The morning is now a bright sunny one and the guns aircraft still active. Our bivouacs here are situated in a belt of trees among a lot of transport. Occasional trainloads of wounded pass here from them the fellows get occasional chunks of dinkum long before it reaches us officially through regular channels. Among the men we have a few cowardly curs and now have 3 in the guard room who we will try force up at the point of the bayonet. One man paraded to Stewart saying he was frightened. Young Scanlon after good work for 3 months cleared out at the first shell burst. 11.30 am. The sky has clouded over. We are still sitting down here waiting for orders and the guns are fairly active. No Taubes. I got the band over and it is playing some selections while we wait. Wounded going through state, that things are going well up
