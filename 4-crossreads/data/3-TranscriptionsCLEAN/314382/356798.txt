 November 2nd: - Hot to-day & absolutely no breeze. 
 A party of doctors & nurses from a large Indian Hospital ship visited our boat in the Morning and a party from shore also. 
 Slept on deck, night being very close. 
 November 3rd: - Exceedingly hot all day. 
 Moved from mid-stream to a wharf at 10 am, and, shortly after 1 pm the first trainload of patients arrived. At 4 pm the 2nd batch came aboard, practically all these being walking cases, the men in many instances having contracted fever in Egypt and therefore they had never been to the front. 
 Ward D1, was filled with the most serious cases, most of the amputation cases being here admitted. In E1 & 2 some severe dysentery cases were taken along with a few isolated enteric patients and 2 others who had been operated upon for an appendicitis whilst in Egypt. 
 Remained alongside wharf all night which was very close and muggy. 
 November 4th: - Left Suez at 9 am sharp & lost sight of the land at 10-30 am. On duty in E3 all day there
