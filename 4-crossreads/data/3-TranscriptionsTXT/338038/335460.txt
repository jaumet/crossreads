[Letter to Garling's father]enclosed - leaf from sprig I placed on the graveanswered 20/6/18France14.4.18
Dear Uncle WillieI have deferred writing about Terence till I had thoroughly satisfied myself that the report of his death in action was correct.  Yesterday I went to his grave & added to its simple yet fitting embellishment my own offering, a token of my silent but deep sympathy for a grand young life, sadly cut off in its prime.  But he did grand work, Uncle, & all, both his seniors & juniors, speak in just as high terms of him as an officer & a man as our his confreres speak of him.  His ability was amply attested by his rank while yet a youth & so his life we cannot say was wasted.
