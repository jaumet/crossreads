<p>present) man. I have met dozens of boys here who know you  &amp; wish you the best of luck. There are several in our unit who come from Auburn. I met a chap named Percy Hall who knows you very well. Also Shirt &amp; Mat Batey. The last two are in our unit. There are dozens of others but too numerous to mention. They all say they wont be duped this time so I think it will be a bit different to last election. We are having very decent weather again now, still cold &amp; <br/>frosty every morning though. We, in the army still get plenty to eat but things are none too good in England. Well Vol there is not much I can do for you individually but there is plenty I can &amp; will do for your party especially with those arguments &amp; statements in the paper. Am afraid Sis will think this a dry letter but never mind. Must close now so wishing you Sis &amp; Noni the best of health Happiness &amp;  (luck) I am your loving brother Hal</p>
