<p>pretty hot work. I had to go up the road with a message; on the way back apparently I took to the wrong side &ndash; Captain Margolin called out to me, "Keep to the right; Don't you know which is the right side? Run for it, you  ---  fool!" Then all the men called out to me to run for it &ndash; " The snipers will get you" &ndash; however, I don't think I cared much whether they did or not &ndash; if I am to get hit nothing can stop it; I am tired of never being able to move about with freedom, I'd much rather take my chance &ndash; running does not appeal to me; too much like hard work.</p>
<p>I have just seen a very plucky incident. Some ammunition mules came down this exposed bend; the snipers immediately got on to them, one poor brute was severely wounded; the sight of the blood gushing from the tortured brute quite unnerved me &ndash; the rest of the train commenced to , break away &ndash; despite the great danger, two men rushed forward and caught hold of the startled animals, thus preventing a stampede which , in the confined space of a narrow road &ndash; if such it could be called &ndash; might have caused an impasse, and this, under the existing conditions, would have been highly dangerous.</p>
<p>The shrapnel is now ever in the sky, it is as much a part of the landscape as the cloudsl  At 6 p.m. we march off. Half way to the Hill which we are to take we had a rest for</p>
