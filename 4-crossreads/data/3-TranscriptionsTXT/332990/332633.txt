Today is hot but dry. There was no dew on the grass this morning, and our job was to clean out the canteen. After dinner I was put on stoking the hot water boiler for the Company's baths, and will remain on until 10' O'Clock tonight.
We were paid tonight. &#163 2-13-0 being 1/- per day since June 3.Tonight we gave in our names and places we wished to go to for a 4 days holiday. As no more than 4 days were allowed I could not go to Ireland so decided to go to London (Waterloo Station)
