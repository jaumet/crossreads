  
 enjoyable days of my life in her company we all went bathing for a start & had a rattling good time teaching the girls to swim & shoot the breakers which on this beach are pretty good, it was a lovely sunny day so after we came out & got dressed we all laid about in the sand & the girls all let their hair down so as it could dry, this was how I came to notice my girls lovely hair I should certainly have thought it was false otherwise, her name was May Devereaux, after we had our dinner we all went for a stroll & during this I took a few snaps with my camera to help keep alive & fresh a happy & clean day, we strolled about till 9.30 which time found Miss Devereaux & I down on the "Pebbly Beach" this is a most remarkable place all the pebbles are sorted out & laid in nice rows
