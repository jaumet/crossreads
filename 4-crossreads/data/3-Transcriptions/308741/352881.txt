<p>him up soon as possible.</p>
<p>Glad Mrs. Hine hasn't forgotten you, we were to have had a good time in England but passport troubles cut the trip right out;  anyway it could have cost about &pound;300 which is too much to spend on spec, or am I getting mean?</p>
<p>I sent your kiddy's photo home as I couldn't carry it too well.  A platoon Sgt. has generally quite sufficient papers &amp; books to carry.</p>
<p>Best wishes<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>A. Hine, Sgt.</p>
