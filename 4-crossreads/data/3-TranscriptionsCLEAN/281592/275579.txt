  
 with T.  After having tea we walked up to the Kings Park.  The Park is situated very high up.  We got a splendid view of the city of Perth and also of the Swan River.  It was one of the finest sights I have ever seen.  The Park covers a few miles of ground.  There are beautiful drives in the park and a thing that enchances this appearance is the Red stones which is sprinkled over the surface of the road.  There were a few beautiful monuments there also.  One was in memory of a Governor of W.A., a statue to Queen Victoria, a momument to W.A. men who had been killed in the South African War, bronze tablets on the sides of it depicted scenes that happened during the war.  We passed by the Observatory on our way back to town.  We also passed a statue to one of the early explorers name Forest.  The commemoration tablet was so obliterated that we could not learn the exact nature of the deeds done by him.  Strolling along the streets again we made for the station arriving there not a moment too soon in order to catch the 9.30 train. 
 We had to wait on the wharf till the N.C.O. in charge of our party came back.  Rain came down while we were waiting and we got thoroughly drenched before he arrived on board.
