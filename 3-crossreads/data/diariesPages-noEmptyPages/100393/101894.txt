charge from the other side. We rushed their position and up went their hands. In about two minutes there were Australians coming up from all directions. This post had evidently been holding up a bit and we being able to get behind it fixed the Germans up quickly. They had a splendid position with a very good out look. They could fire without being observed and numbered 25 with 3 machine guns. These men had evidently been left behind to try and hold up us up while the main body on that sector got away.The Germans were immediately taken prisoners and "souvenired," some being rather severely dealt with, and were then marched off the our back area with someone in charge of them. They were also used in carrying wounded out.That little job done we started off again to our objective, and went through the rest of the village without further trouble.We halted at the far edge of the village and started to dig in behind a thin row of small trees. The barrage was about 200 yards in front of us. It was playing on the same area of ground for about 1 hours when it lifted and the 3rd Battn. advanced through us and continued on for about another 1 miles.While we were here waiting at this point five of our little party were wounded by shells which landed immediately behind us. Fortunately not none of the party were killed. We dressed the wounds of these men and sent them back to the aid post which was a couple of miles back.
