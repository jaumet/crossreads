that I thought I would put it in here 
"Imbros"
Oh misty isle of Imbros
Encircled by blue seas
Arched over by an azure sky
On thee a weary man might lie
O Gentle Isle of Imbros
A man might take his ease.

Oh misty Isle of Imbros
We look across the blue 
Sick men who have not ease not rest
Turn wearily towards the west
Oh sunset isle of Imbros
We turn and look to you.

Oh misty isle of Imbros
We know that we must stay
For us, for us is no release
Save only death or wounds or peace
Oh phantom isle of Imbros
A thousand miles away.
