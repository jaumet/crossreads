Saturday 15th  In the evening too the Doctor to the 'Arragon' a fine troop ship.  Whilst he was engaged we spent  good hour talking to some Jack Tars hearing all the news & getting a good idea of operations in general.  We were given a graphic description of the 'Goliath' disaster, also how two British Destroyers were sunk in the North Sea by the Vengeance & Goliath in mistake.  They did not answer the challenge in time.  When we arrived back on our ship we were shouted to a 'Bass' each for our exertions.
Sunday 16th.  Orders to pack up to move to the 'Galeka' which we did at midday.  Here were gathered all the remnants & details of A.M.C.  Infantry etc.  She proved to be a much more comfortable ship for traveling.  I met several pals here & swapped experiences.
Monday 17th  Sailed for Dardanelles  5 A.M.  Towards evening we landed about 250 Infantry who had recovered from wounds & they were very glad to get ashore once more  During the day the battleship did some shelling of Turkish positions & one village to which Turks had taken guns received an awful doing & burst into flames.  We could see each shell land & then a fountain of earth & debris would be hurled into the air. Only one thing was left, a spire or minaret to a mosque which stood out white & distinct.  How they managed not to hit it was remarkable.  During the night the Turks made an attack on our trenches & the roll of volleys & machine guns lasted till dawn.
