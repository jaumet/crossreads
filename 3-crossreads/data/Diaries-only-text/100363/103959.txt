threatening much of late came down in heavy downpour during the night, and has continued without cessation all day. Heavy winds also accompany it, and my thoughts of escaping the winter in France for Sunny (?) Palestine have had a set back. The big flat where I had the unpleasant experience of being flooded out on Xmas Eve is again awash, and flooded, the roads impassable. The Waddies have been running bankers and transport is more or less disorganised. Spent the day at the mess chatting on home and Australia and letter writing. Thank heavens it is dry within my tent, for I look across a dismal expanse of mud where the Horse transport and Camels are having a miserable time..
