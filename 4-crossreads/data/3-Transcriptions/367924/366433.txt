<p>Still on the Move<br/>23rd Nov 1917</p>
<p>Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines to let you know that I am still well &amp; trust that you are all the same. Well I received a tin of Cocoa &amp; one tin of Health Salts from you yesterday but no socks or the parcel from Rodgers yet.</p>
<p>Well I have only time to scribble a few words as, we are likely to move at any moment, we have been on the move <strike>no</strike> for just on a month now, I will be able to write you a very interesting letter when we get in a settled Camp again, I have seen a great deal since writing you last.</p>
<p>Just fancy Alie looking on your neck for my Photo she must have a great memory alright. My word the boss payed a good price for those sheep he bought at the sale, they must be good ones. I hope that Nell has been over with you before now.</p>
<p>Well I must close now with wishing you all A Merry Xmas &amp; A Happy New Year, Take every Care of yourself</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your Ever Loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>Kind Regards to Birt &amp; His Wife</p>
