are very entertaining. Major Clayton is returning to P.A.H. - Col Teblutt is engaged to a nice girl here - Major Man is in the A.O.O. at Telel-Kebir with the Australian troops. Captain Davidson & Tyler are still guarding the Dardanelles and the exit of the Goben. I often feel I'd be glad to have some one I really knew and cared for to talk to - one gets very interned living so much with aquaintances. Laurence was here. I had a message from him - that he wanted to know as soon as I arrived - only verbal. I sent a verbal one back. It may be hard hearted, for he may be killed, but I have not heard from him - poor boy. But he could write if he liked. Of course he may have left before I got here. I don't know.Your loving BethaLove to Mrs Hungerford
3rd A.G.H.28.3.16My own beloved Mother & Father,Again a mail and I have not a letter ready. Jim - Colonel Jamieson came into my ward this afternoon. He is working in the unit till he returns in April at the end of his year's service. I think most of our other Majors & Col's return too. A year is enough for them out here. It is too strenuous. I am working at high pressure now - and am very tired - but quite well. I like working for Major Lochardt Gibson and he is very  kind to me. I have 112 beds and the income & out go of the ward daily is on an average 15. We have been boarding patients rapidly. This entails a lot of work. Clerical - we really could do with a lot of clerks to relieve the sisters & M.O.'s of a lot of mechanical work. This is only for you my opinion. I know however that you don't tell people what I say. I have a lot to write you about what I've seen here in my patients etc with regards our troops as seen
