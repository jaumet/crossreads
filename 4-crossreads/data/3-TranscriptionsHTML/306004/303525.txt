<p>there are Bedouins who are more anxious to fight then the Turks are;<br/>This morning Sig Law &amp; I had to attend a board of enquiry &amp; give evidence concerning Sig Richardson &amp; Tpr Roberts who have been missing since August 4th;  We expected to go out on a stunt tonight but it has been postponed till tomorrow night. Went over to Bde Head Qrs this evening to see about a 'phone to take out with us. It is asserted there are 3,000 Turks at Bir-El-Mazar which is 25 miles West of El Arish &amp; 20 miles East pf Bir-El-Salmana   The Camel Corps are to attack the Turks who are entrenched &amp; we are in reserves &amp; only go 9 miles East of Salmana; I hardly think this attack will be successful</p>
