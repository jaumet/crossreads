Went for a tour of the sight Westminist Abbey is the most wonder piec of work . Then I present myself at Manchest Street . Spent the night in town . Oh ! This is a love citi . 19/8 /17 yesterday I went to Kensington in the morn , to see Holman Hunt collect of pictur . I catch on fine with these peopl even if I never heard of them befor . They seem to like to have a tame Australian ; and so intellig too ! It appear to me that this comfort class of English peopl ; thought the Australian were a savag tribe ; were veri fierc amd cantanker ; and wore bone in their nose . There is no need to tell them yarn drawn from my imagin .
