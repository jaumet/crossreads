<p>V.<br/>Roses are beauty, but I never see<br/>Those blood drops from the burning heart of June<br/>Glowing like thought upon the living tree<br/>With a pity that they die so soon,<br/>Die into petals, like those roses old,<br/>Those women, who were summer in men's hearts<br/>Before the smile upon the Sphinx was cold<br/>Or sand had hid the Syrian &amp; his arts.<br/>Oh myriad dust of beauty that lies thick<br/>Under our feet that not a single grain<br/>But stirred and moved in beauty &amp; was quick<br/>For one brief moon and died nor lived again.<br/>But when the moon rose lay upon the grass<br/>Pasture to living beauty, life that was.<br/>J.

<p>Opened December 2, 1917, in Billets, Quehen Isques, D.R.S., 8 kilos from Boulogne</p>
<p>1.<br/>A sunny windy day, to the high hill nearby, for a walk.  A clear blue sky, white clouds like great galleons sailing across, their shadows richly chequering the small hill, meadows and low valleys.</p>
<p>Evening:  the afternoon with Frank S. to Courcelette, then to the third estaminet for Caf&eacute; et Curacao, a continuing of the walk, then back to second estaminet and tea, savoury omelette, chips, Bread, Butter and Apple Jelly.  Met there Roy F., Arthur T. and Charlie.  A long yarning, with Arthur, of models generally, or Greek and Aegyptian legend, of the beauty of the Venus de Milo and de Medici &ndash; opposed to the David of Michael Angelo, the old argumenting of the two beauties, of the woman, of the man.  So to the third est. &ndash; all five of us with two men of the Transport, caf&eacute; et curacao, again to the second, Red wine and sugar.</p>
<p>Then in the clear cold night a quick steady walking to Billets, so to bed, reading "The Shadow Line".</p>
<p>Mail &ndash; T.L.S. &ndash; the first receiving of it on a Sunday.</p>
