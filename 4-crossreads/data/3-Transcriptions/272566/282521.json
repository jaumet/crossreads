<p>Monday 19 March</p>
<p>The greatest day in our Military life to date.  I was one of 4 volunteers to proceed into Bapaume at 7 a.m.  Travelled there by Motor Amb. through Longueval, Contalmaison, Pozieres &amp; Le Sars.  Round Pozieres 8 "Tanks" are lying damaged.  Le Sars is one long street of Ruins.  Before leaving Bapaume Fritz lit fires in nearly every third house.  The destruction there is astounding.  Our guns played havoc.  Fires are still burning &ndash; 2 mines were exploded by Fritz in the main street.  Heaps of debris block up every street.  There isn't one sound building in the town.  In the centre of the town there was once a statue in memory of French fallen heroes in 1870.  Well Fritz has removed the bronze figure &amp; has put up an iron piping instead making it resemble an antiaircraft gun.  German shells are dropping in the town.  We are forming a dressing station in ruined premises.</p>
