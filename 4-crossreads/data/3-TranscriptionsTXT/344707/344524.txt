 No 1 ALH Heliopolis (Aug 11) 1915 Dear Mother  It is a long  story the past 10 days. I wrote up to time of leaving LEMNOS &amp; getting into a [indecipherable] steamer from the Knights Templar &ndash; We then in the night crowded into barges &amp; were towed ashore prior at dawn. I left a sentry on the beach to watch the groceries I brought over &amp; the [indecipherable] of whiskey &amp; then commenced to climb the hill to Pope's Hill where our men are entrenched 50 yards from the Turks. I reported to Brigade Head Quarters &amp; first reached the trenches as dawn broke at 3.30 A.M. Then the Artillery commenced &amp; as I thought at the time a terrible amount of rifle fire &amp; shrapnel but really nothing to what was to follow the next morning.
