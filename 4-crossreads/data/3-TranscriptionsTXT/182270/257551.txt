WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27, 1919.
Cold with SW gale blowing.
Cut out the wethers after breakfast
& took them down to Middle. They
wont start on ewes till Friday
morning so I turned them out
in Point. Tickle lopped in
4D for cattle & later we shifted
cattle into Middle & lopped
for them there.
Linda, Myee & Hilda were
down burning off.
