<p>21<br/>steaming in the wake of the "Sydney" &amp; "Encounter" we at length came to anchor opposite the township and quickly swung round to the strong trade wind. On our port beam are the lights of the Government House; on our starboard bow lies the "Aorangi"; in the distance rise the hills surrounding the harbor, and we go to our bunks determined to rise early in the morning and see what is to be seen.<br/>Saty 5th : The QM's pipe "bare out, 'eave out! Show a leg, show a leg!" was unnecessary this morning. Everyone was up early &amp; hanging over the rail. We got under way at 6.30 and stood up the channel to Fairfax Harbor where the Destroyer "Yarra" came alongside for stores. The ground rises rapidly from the shore and all around are brown looking mountains thinly timbered. In some of the bays mangrove swamps are in evidence, their rich green contrasting with the dry &amp; burnt appearance of the grass covered hills. No sooner were we at anchor than we were visited by several catamarans manned by Papuans, the younger ones clothed in thin air, the elder ones clad similarly with the addition of a waist cloth. The females (in some instances) wore a kind of kilt made of grass &amp; one was covered with a calico garment loose to the knee &amp; embroidered with red. They had brought cocoanuts &amp; paw paws for sale &amp; were soon doing a brisk business, the children meanwhile keeping up a constant chatter. They know the value of English money evidently. A bucket was lowered &amp; in it was sixpence for a paw-paw. "Sixpence no good", said a muscular native, "No good paw-paw, me want one bob", and the bucket was tossed aside contemptuously. When the "bob" was eventually lowered he grinned and sent up the required article. The natives are without head covering of any kind and they squat on their unweilding looking craft in the broiling sun</p>
