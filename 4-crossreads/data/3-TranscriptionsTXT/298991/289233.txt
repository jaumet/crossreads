 Monday Oct 29th A very heavy swell on today, I am feeling fairly well. There are a good few sea-sick. The wind is very strong &amp; cold. It is very funny when the boat rolls, especially below deck, everything is rolling from one side to the other, fellows are trying to walk along, &amp; only manage by short runs. 
 Tuesday Oct 30th A sweep is got up every day on the distance the boat travels every day, the winner gets about 30/-. I haven't go in for any yet. Feeling very crook today. 
 Wednesday Oct 31st Still very windy with a heavy swell on. There are a good number sea-sick on board. I am feeling fairly well today. Kit inspection held today, we hadn't to empty out our kits though. Concert held on No 3 hatch. The party is now known as the "Pierrots". 
 Thursday Nov 1st We have two sweeps being got up on the Melbourne Cup. First prize is &pound;20   2nd &pound;5   3rd &pound;2.10.0. The tickets costs 2/6 each. I am not in for one.
