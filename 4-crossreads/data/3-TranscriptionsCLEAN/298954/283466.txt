19172nd June (cont.)I found the Capt. standing at the door of the Chart-house with the Chf. Engr.  He repeated his instructions to do nothing, so I asked for, and obtained, permission to destroy the wireless station.  Then followed a busy half-hour smashing up the work of the last fortnight.  I first put the codes, logbook etc overboard.  The complete receiver was wrenched from the table and followed the papers.  In fact, when I finally closed the Wireless Cabin door and slipped out to see the Hun boarding party coming towards us there was very little of the gear left.
By this time we had, under instructions from the 'plane, steamed in towards the raider, which steamed slowly round us.  A launch was coming towards the "Wairuna": it came alongside at the after well-deck & a party of armed sailors, led by an officer, swarmed over the side.
