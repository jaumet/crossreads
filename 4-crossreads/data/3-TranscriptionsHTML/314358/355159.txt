<p>6<br/>Now thick gorse hedges in our road.</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile further our on the moorlands we come to a wood of pines.</p>
<p>This wood is fringed with a heavy growth of rhododendron not yet in bloom, but quite beautiful, with its bold ever green leaf in walk like masses.</p>
<p>Its growth is so prolific here that it presses in from both sides of the road and compells our Corporal to order us to march in single file.</p>
<p>A halt is called and each man casts off his equipment, leans hi rifle against a tree and throws himself upon the mossy bank in a little opening found beyond the rhododendron.</p>
<p>Cards are brought to light by some that time may not hang heavily upon them.</p>
<p>Near by there are several kinds of splendid pines, thick almost as thatch.</p>
