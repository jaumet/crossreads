 1918 Thu. 23 May Spent the night hunting fleas, scratching, accustoming myself to Attar of Russki and listening to tales of horror from the returning workers. 
 (Poor devils! they slave in mines, farms, everywhere, for 30 phennigs (3d) a day till they can work no more and then return to this choice convalescent home to recuperate!)    Mosquitoes lent a pleasing variety to the night's programme. 
 And the stinks! 
 The lager consists of two portions;  the old brickworks themselves, now used as the offices and dwelling of the lager staff, &amp; the prisoners quarters, long barracks surrounding the slime covered clay pit. 
 Wire everywhere enables each barrack to be divided off into a compound.   This morning was questioned at the Bureau, inspected for lice, bathed a la sleep-dip in the company of my Russian friends of last night, &amp; was then free to go to Barrack 10.
