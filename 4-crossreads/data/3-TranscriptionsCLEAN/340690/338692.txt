  
 Whizz bang shells going near dump all evening and a lot too close for comfort.  One burst right under their Sergeant who got across paddock very quickly afterwards although he said he was used to shell fire.  I smiled.  I was glad to get rid of them.  We weren't allowed to go home and had to work on till 1.30 when we finished.  Bed very tired.  Cloudy. 
 28.4.18 Stayed in bed all day and at 6 reported to Avery with Anderson, Burnop, Burns, Toogood, Robertson and Boot for making dugouts for No. 3 by our cookhouse who were shelled out of the farm.  Extremely heavy barrage on left.  Raining a good deal but I didn't work and knocked off at 11 and went to bed tired.  Wirers not home till 3 at which time Fritz started an area bombardment by howitzers and continued on. 
 29.4.18 Barrage on left going heavy all the time till 3  next  to-day and heavy shells falling thickly all round us and very close.  Storr and Carter's dugout blown in but they weren't hurt although had a rough time twice afterwards as well.  All a good bit shaken and couldn't sleep much.  Enemy aeroplanes over many times during morning and things pretty rough.  Hardly any damage done although the place churned up everywhere.
