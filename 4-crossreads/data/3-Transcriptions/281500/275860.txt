<p>Had charge of 60 men on a big fatigue party carrying timber, iron, &amp; etc. up to where they are building a lot of new huts on a little rise.</p>
<p>Saw a fine smash this morning down on the railway line, 4 trucks loaded with rails come tearing down the line completely out of hand she never struck nothing till she arrived at the dump just close to where I had a party working, &amp; here there was a big string of trucks being unloaded you should have seen the boys leaping when they heard the shouting they fairly flew through the air, &amp; just in time for the runaways hit them with a terrific crash, &amp; you could see nothing for the next few minutes but flying metal logs &amp;amp splinters, when the stink settled down there was a pretty sight, trucks all over the place piled on top of one another in a most bewildering way, the line</p>
