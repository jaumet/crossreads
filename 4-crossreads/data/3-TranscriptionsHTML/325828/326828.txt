<p>Tichborne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. 8.5.15. J.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 9.5.15.<br/>6th May 1915<br/>My last letter was written on Thursday, &amp; you should have received it on Saturday, but it was delayed this end through one of the school kiddies forgetting to post it.  Send some of your rain up.  Leo.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Thank you very much for yours of 2nd to hand on Tuesday, &amp; of 4th to hand this evening.</p>
<p>Rid's appointment as chaplain came as a great surprise to me   Its hard lines on Ol, but I suppose its all for the best.<br/>We had a nice steady rain here on Monday but only 42 points fell.  It will help the crops a bit but we want more to back it up, &amp; especially to make water for the dams which are almost dry.</p>
<p>My leg is a bit sore still.  The stitches broke away on Tuesday, &amp; the thing is a gaping wound now, too tender to <strike>so</strike> sew up again even if the stitches would hold.  I am taking salts nearly every day &amp; in addition a blood-tonic, so as to give the place a chance to heal.  There is a good bit of proud flesh, which I am bluestoning.  I had bad luck with the other leg last week too; it broke out on the old sore as the result of the cultivator running over it.  I am bathing them both in lysol &amp; H2O every night &amp; keeping them bandaged.  It is a very busy time just now, &amp; if I could get anyone to take my place, I certainly would, &amp; would lie up for a while.<br/>If I find them getting worse, &amp; beyond my control</p>
