<p>box for the Prince of Monaco. Then walked to Monaco and visited an anthropological museum with Roman antiquities, prehistoric relics, mostly from the principality, next the Cathedral rather fine, built in 1874 &amp; then on to the Oceanographic Museum which the Prince built to house his wonderful collection of marine animals &amp; apparatus for collecting same. Underground are several aquariums with curious fish living under natural conditions, which can be seen easily all very beautiful. Returned for lunch 6.F. then returned &amp; went over the Palace of the Prince, rather good but nothing special after which we strolled round the place and returned by motor at 4 P. M. The day was warm &amp; it was a splendid outing. After dinner collected a friend at The Queen's Hotel &amp; did the town. Soon we saw evidences of some Jubilations. This time dinkum word had come through of the Kaiser's abdication &amp; soldiers stationed in the place, mostly african Chasseurs</p>
