 motor tour to Urrizenberg 18 miles from the Docks. The car held 25 and it was a very pleasant trip. The first few miles of the journey was through the city then the suburbs and along shady roads skirting the foot of the mountains until we came to Urrizenberg where we stayed about &frac34; of an hour on the beach. There are many fine hotels and even facility for surf bathing. Urrizenberg is situated on the shores of False Bay. On the return journey part of the way we came by a different route and passed through long stretches of sturdy forest. We were back by 2. O clock. The fare cost 1/- which needless to say shows no profit &ndash; if not a loss and included fruit &amp; cigarettes. 
 In the afternoon I went for another long trip but in the opposite direction to Houts Bay. The people of Cape Town consider this to be one of the world's beauty drives. It is certainly very exciting and one of the most dangerous. The route is by way of sea point to Camps Bay. From Sea Point the danger commences.
