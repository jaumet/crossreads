<p>Wednesday 20-12-16<br/>Wood fatigue today.  Watery blink of Sunshine.  Snow &amp; freezing hard.  We have made arrangements for a case of whiskey.  I am wondering how it will work.  Fritz took advantage of the fine day to Shell the camp with heavy stuff.  I seen him send 3 Huts up in the air.  There must have been a number of casualties.</p>
<p>Thursday 21-12-16<br/>We got a case of Whiskey this night &amp; for the first time (I hope) in my life I got Drunk <u>very Drunk</u>.  I went down as quickly as if I was pole axed &amp; made a very sorry exhibition of myself.</p>
