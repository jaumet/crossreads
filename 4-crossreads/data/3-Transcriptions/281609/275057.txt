<p>impede their progress. Tomorrow there is to be a march through Cairo by Australian and New Zealand troops.<br/>23rd Clear and cold. Nothing much in the way of preparations for Xmas. Went to pyramids and Sphinx and had my photo graph taken.<br/>24th Xmas Eve!! And Gee! What a contrast to last year. Everything was "dead slow" Xmas is not recognised here except by then English residents, each day is the same to the natives Sunday included. The British "Tommy" is very diminutive in comparison and the fresh look upon their faces makes them look very young.<br/>25th Xmas Day. Fresh &amp; clear. On duty all day. Bands were playing carols long before 5 am. Holiday for all troops. All mounted units must, however leave sufficient men in camp to tend the horses.<br/>I wonder where I shall be twelve</p>
