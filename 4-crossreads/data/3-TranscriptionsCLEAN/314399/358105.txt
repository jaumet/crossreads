  
 Friday 18 April 1919 No sun at all today. Am on Harfleur picquet but am not going there as I have a meet on in town. Very trying day. Wrote a few letters & went into town. Met the girl & went for a walk to St Addresse [Adresse] Saturday 19 April 1919 Very muggy again. A very trying day. Went to Montivilliers for a walk. Hotel de Ville again tonight. A few fights by the Canadians in the street. Otherwise everything very quiet.
