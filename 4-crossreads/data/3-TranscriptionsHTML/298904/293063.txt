<p>&amp; anything they could lay their hands on were shied at the police &amp; they knocked one or two off their horses, it's a wonder to me that no one was killed. It was here that I first heard a band play the now popular tune " Boy's of the Dardanelles"   A couple of days later we had a course of shooting on the ranges from 100 to 300, &amp;amp to pass you had to get your 5 shots at the 100 yards range <strike>on</strike> in a 8 in circle, &amp; the 300 you had to score 15. it was no easy matter I can assure you for the dust storms were that bad that at times you could hardly see the target let alone the bullseye, I qualified easily</p>
