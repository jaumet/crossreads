Irving obliged with a song, and the "one and only "Hustler" gave a good recitation. After supper we had cocoa and biscuits and the singing of the National Anthem brought a very pleasant day to a close.
Wednesday 26th
Out to Hog's Back Hill again for more sandbagging. I was on Cook's fatigue so luckily was left in camp. Capt. Lind went down to Rail Head, Capt. Nance took his place with B. Section.
Thursday 27th
On swimming parade to Ferry Post. We took about 40 minutes to walk to rail Head, then we got the train and went into Ferry Post, and to the Cabal and didn't we just enjoy a good swim. Some of the crowd went into Ismalia,, but as my cheque was somewhat weak, I stayed behind and had lunch at the Canteen, which consisted of Tinned Sausages, and Tinned Fruits. We got back to camp about 4.30, tired but happy.
Friday 28th 
On light duty around the camp. Yesterday we got news that the Turks were going to attack, but they haven't done so yet. The weather is hot, and the flies are just about driving us mad.

An Easy day, looking through the Medical Haversacks to see they were in order. Mail came in Got 2 from Lill and two from France. Played cards in the evening and won all the cigarettes.
Sunday 30th 
Church Parade at 7. but missed it. Rather too early. Had my hair shaved off, and wrote a long letter to Lill and one to Nell.The doctors had a look at our feet this morning to see if they were alright for marching.
