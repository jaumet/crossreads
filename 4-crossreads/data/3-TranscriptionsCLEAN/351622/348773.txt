  
 29 January 1916 Sat Visited 1st Field Ambulance & met Sid Woollams having my photo taken with him. Ken & Robbo came with me. Had tea with Davey Evans. Kens' cousin saw Jimmy & Frank who looks the same as ever. Met Ruby who kept the paper shop [indecipherable] 
 30 January 1916 Sun A very quiet day & very hot stuff again struck picquet. Saw Jimmy & Taplin staying & yarning to them for fully an hour. Spent most of my spare time in writing occasionaly visiting the canteen to work off the terrible thirst one gathers in his throat about mid-day.
