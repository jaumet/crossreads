 4/5/19 Marcinelle Gorman left with me in a YMCA Ford car before lunch and we went to Gourdienne. The country exquisite dark emerald green. Received a warm welcome in the little place and was much kissed by aged Madames. Had lunch with the Crochelets and drank just the correct quantity of their good wine. Raoul and Marthe were both there. Gorman and the Brasserie folk came over later and joined us at coffee. Made adieux and left laden with a parcel of gallottes. Walked to Nallines along winding roads and took tram back to Marcinelle. Through some very pretty country this tram passes &ndash; a good playground for the Carolegiens. Had a bite to eat at the mess and fixed up some one or two routine matters. Met Gen. Martin and Davis up the street &amp; "did" Charleroi with them.
