<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Friday 1</p>
<p>Detailed for fatigue work in Artillery lane.</p>
<p>An old dressing station to be turned in to a new one. Plenty of digging.</p>
<p>This station is further north &amp; higher up than Shell Green which is visible away to the left.</p>
<p>I think this place is more dangerous than "Shell Green" for shells were bursting around for a good part of the day.</p>
<p>On the way home stopped at a gun on the way looking south &amp;  therefore overlooking "Gaba Tepe". Looked through glasses &amp; saw trenches on the olive groves flat.</p>
