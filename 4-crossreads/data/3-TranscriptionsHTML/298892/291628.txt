<p>Camp No. 21 Larkhill.<br/>Wednesday 15th. November 1916</p>
<p>My dear Parents/.<br/>I received two more letters from home this week dated the 16th. and 23rd. September packed with interesting home news.<br/>The Cpl. Fred Clark and I have promising ourselves a bike ride together since we landed in England and  last Saturday our wish was fulfilled. We succeeded in procuring two bicycles from the Signallers on the pretence of attending a lecture at the 9th. Field Ambulance and we took a spin to Salisbury.<br/> The roads are ideal for biking and we had a most enjoyable afternoon. It was about five O'clock when we reached there and consequently nearly dark so we decided to spend the night. We left our bikes in an old shop on the outskirts of town and then fossicked out a "Soldiers Rest" at which to stay. It was an old church converted into a soldier's restaurant and boarding establishment. The beds consisted of a mattress placed on chairs facing one another and a couple of very old blankets which felt as if they hadn't been aired for a year and slept in every night. It suited us alright anyhow and was just as comfortable as our camp quarters.<br/>Salisbury is a very old town all the buildings being exceedingly</p>
