to any of the 12th Battn there to give their opinion, from what I could gather some one passed a remark about his getting a S.I.W (self inflicted wound) about the lowest most cowardly thing a man can do in our eyes, he is regarded as even 10% lower than an M.P. such a remark naturally maddened him, but whats the use of going crook without catching the snoozer, for it matters little who or what the man is some low down scoundrel is bound to pass remarks whether true or not about him look how they slandered our Lord himself if he went through it theres no reason why we should be exempt from the same, however no one accepted his challenge 
Sunday again nearly all our Coy have been on fatigue shift
