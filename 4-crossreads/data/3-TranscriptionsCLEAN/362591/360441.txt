 Dear Judge 
 Very many thanks for your letter of 5th March just arrived.  It has been over to France & then back here. 
 You will, I know, be sorry to hear that I have after all to come back to Australia.  I have been in Hospital for nearly 10 weeks now,  but  and though I have done my best to beat them, the Medical Board are adamant, and have ordered me to go to Australia for a couple of months trip.  l suppose it is a good thing, though very disappointing.  I feel pretty fit & have got very fat & practically do not limp at all.  I hate the idea of coming back with all my men in the Fire Trenches - and I know what a terribly difficult thing it is to get away again once one gets to
