Tuesday 17 December
Move again to-day to our destination, Chateau Toussaint Gougnies which is on a high hill, commanding good views of surrounding country. The building is horribly cold and bleak to-morrow we are to open an hospital just down the road. Weather rotten, cold, windy wet.
Wednesday 18 December
At Hospital, where we have established a decent rest station but we are miles from Charleroi or any place of any size. The people here are wonderfully generous will give us anything. I have a small room bed with sheets, etc. Weather still keeps cold, wet very windy is miserable. We are now in the area of the atrocities of 1914. In Dinant 1000 civilians were shot, 500 in another small town nearby even in this small village 8 were killed. This was a big battle area in September 1914.
