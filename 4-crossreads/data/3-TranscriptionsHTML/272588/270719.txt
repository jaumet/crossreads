<p>Saturday 8 June<br/>The "Tock Emma" fired to-day, a projectile 150 pounds in weight. From Strazeele heights a great view is to be had of the surrounding country almost back to Estaires.  Quiet to-day with glorious weather. Several fires have been caused by shelling of farm houses.<br/>Cook to-day.</p>
<p>Sunday 9 June<br/>Glorious weather still continues, &amp; we are living very well indeed. The Bosch hit one of our outhouses early this morning.</p>
