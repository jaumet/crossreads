<p>15th July 1918.<br/>At last the authorities have realised, that this life is very monotonous for the soldier, &amp; an Education Scheme has been started in the Unit. The idea is a good one, &amp; if properly carried out, will prove beneficial to all concerned.</p>
<p>Teachers have been chosen from the Unit for the following subjects, - English (English speaking reading &amp; letter-writing etc, Mathematics, Shorthand, Book-keeping &amp; French.</p>
<p>This is only just a feeler to see how the idea will carry on, as shortly this education scheme is to be carried out on a much larger scale in the A.I.F. The idea of this scheme is to help soldiers for the return to civil life. When one thinks of the future, it is indeed a serious matter, to go back to our old occupations, the majority of the soldiers would be backward, so if we give this scheme a little attention we will surely have a little more confidence in ourselves when that great day arrives the return to the "Homeland."<br/>For instance, take the Trade I was connected with before the War, I guess that I know next to nothing about the Woollen Trade now. On turning to civil life again, I will find chaps who did not enlist, probably Heads of departments in the firm in which I was employed, whilst I would have to start at the bottom of the tree again.  The more I think of the future, the more complex the question becomes to me.  I believe that the Woollen Trade is to be one of the subjects in this education scheme later on.  I have often tried to study some subject over here, but it has often happened</p>
