<p>Had a row with the Commandant this morning it happened this way, one of the nurses came up to my ward &amp; said Sgt. The Commandant wants to see you in her office, I wondered what could be the matter, so down I went &amp; knocked at her door, there was a surly "come in" &amp; in I hopped &amp; walks up to her prepared for anything, she starts off "Sgt I want you to take charge of the route marching party from now on &amp; see that they do their work properly especially the men for exercise you will have to put them through physical training &amp; see that they do it, this had the effect of course of making me obstinate for I am not going to be ordered about by a woman</p>
