  
 I think you had better address my letters to:- C/o H. Hammond Esq. No 5, Matham Grove, East Dulwich, London  S.E. 22 as I have made arrangements with Mr. Hammond to forward me letters on to me. I must close now hoping you all at "Cairnleith" are in good health. I expect to leave Hospital tomorrow to rejoin my Squadron at Shawbury, as the swelling on the jaw has gone down & I am keen to get back. With love to you all, Your loving son, Leo.
