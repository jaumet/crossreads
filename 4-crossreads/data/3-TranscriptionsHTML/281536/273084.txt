<p>29/6/19 London<br/>Breakfasted late and then went to Hyde Park and watched the riders on Rotten Row. A very gay crowd. Dined at Jermyn Court. Caught the 2.40 back to Camp and spent the evening at the hospital.</p>
<p>30/6/19<br/>Spent a rather busy morning at the office dealing with a lot of matters and received orders to go to Hull tomorrow evening. Went down and saw the General, wrote an Order of the Day for the troops and then commenced packing up. Afternoon tea at Greenhills and then caught the 5.30 train to London arriving there 8.15. Put up at the Great Western at Paddington and dined there. Went into Piccadilly and afterwards had a trip out of Warwick [indecipherable] beyond Paddington. Met a friend from Whitechapel. Bed 1.30 am.</p>
