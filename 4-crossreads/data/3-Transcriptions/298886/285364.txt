<p>We came into this Camp a typical example of an Egyptian desert Camping ground. BENI SALAAM it is called not even marked on the map the nearest place on the line which runs close by is WADAN. We came into Camp about an hour before sundown but as is generally the case where some people don't know their work, the Camp was not measured out. That had to be done first before we could get into the lines. we were glad to get in and get unburdened. one generally is when one is burdened with the following impedimenta. Bandolier containing 90 rounds of ball ammunition one waist belt with 4 pouches which contain 45 rounds of ball and a bayonet attached one pair of field glasses one prismatic Compass one water bottle (full) one haversack containing a days rations. add to that the contents of pockets and clothing, and a fair idea is given as to the weight and awkwardness of such a load.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing cold across the LIBYAN DESERT Very cold the first night and I rigged up a sort of breakwind for protection but during the night I had to dismantle the. blanket and put it over me I was fearfully cold I was glad when morning came and with it the warm rays of the sun. So much for the first night in the desert.</p>
