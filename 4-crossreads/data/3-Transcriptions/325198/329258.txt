<p>29 February, 1916<br/>Serapeum<br/>Capt Ryrie took the Sqd out to day &amp; we had a real easy time, we did practically no drill this morning &amp; this after noon we simply took our horses out &amp; let them roll in the sand &ndash; Crouch took a couple of photos of me &amp; my mare. I hope they come out alright</p>
