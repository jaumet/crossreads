<p>I came down here yesterday evening &amp; was put in H Section.<br/>Tomorrow morning I parade in front of the C.O. Col. Marks &amp; present my credentials.</p>
<p>Tuesday 24th April 1917<br/>Yesterday morning I paraded to C.O. and he told me what I already knew, i.e. that the ambulance had three dispensers, but one was an infantry man. If his transfer went through he would get the place; if not I would be called up.<br/>For the present my services were urgently required for fatigues.<br/>So kind of him.</p>
