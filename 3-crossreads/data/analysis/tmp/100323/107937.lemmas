 14/7/19 Chemnitz Fine and warm . Still unwel . Hard on the starboard bow ? the Cap Verd island . There was some haze which spoilt the view but they seem hilli and white villag are plant on the steep hillsid . After run along the coast for some time we pass a veri high peak ? which seem to be the termin of a chain . I take this to be Teneriff . It went up high like a larg cloud and remain in sight until we were mani mile away from it . On this deck the men play game and sing ? some of the tune they sing over and over again . One is " How can you keep them down on the farm after they ve seen Paree" . Rather pertin . Our consumpt of fresh water is still much too high .
