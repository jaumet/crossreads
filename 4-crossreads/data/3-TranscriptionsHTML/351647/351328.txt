<p>how long we will be here but not very long I hope, I never saw such mud or imagined it.</p>
<p>And I hope we'll go to some warmer place before long.  I haven't had a letter for ages, just as well perhaps as they would have been the finishing touch.  But I love to hear from you &amp; to know how you are.</p>
<p>I am very well which surprises me very much considering the circumstances but you don't know how I wish the damned thing was over.  I can't write decently so will close.  Everything, earth, air &amp; me insides are all a quiver with the guns, I feel like a jelly.  My love to Mac, the Boss, Graham &amp; all at dear old Tog.</p>
<p>A merry Christmas, I'll be thinking of you good &amp; hard.  Will write soon.</p>
<p>Yours<br/>Wilkie</p>
