<p>Received news of our movement on to Heboran at 8 but the time was put off for an hour for wireless was giving trouble we got there at two oclock after killing a large brown snake, we worked all the way with our three rigs &amp; I pushed a bike worse luck when we got there first of all we had tucker to get then after that full on till 6 then phones till late into the night the boss gets up to his tricks what with cutting lines &amp; taking men captured he quite enjoys himself, but as he was trying this he couldn't help but get [indecipherable] very interesting ideas of himself especially from [indecipherable] after this we had tea then turned in with Bobby Sayers all the horses this time were tethered to a breast line about these the dear little kid, he has yet to gather a few more lessons then he may be fit to command a unit.

<p>Stables as usual at [  ]<br/>We turned out at 7 to water then had break and fatigues till 10 after that we went into Heboran for a couple of hours some of the streets were [indecipherable] by gumtrees and wattles some of which I sent home when we got back the camp was overrun by French kids and [indecipherable] had a woman as usual this is the latest addition to his list and we expect him to be a frequent visitor to Heboran now we set out at two o'clock for home the first thing of importance was a visit to a [indecipherable] flour mill these mills are entirely run by women only the [indecipherable] is in charge of men. They put the corn into the mills then whip down to fill the bags &amp; this is all done with young kiddy's in arms after the ride against a head wind we eventually got back at 8.  Bed at 9.</p>
