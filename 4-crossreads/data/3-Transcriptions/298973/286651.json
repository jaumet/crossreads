<p>On the afternoon of the 12th a large barge came alongside with 350 wounded English Tommies. They were all in different stages of convalescence. There we took on board and prepared to leave the port. But more about the Tommies anon. At about 6 p.m. on the 12th we left Said bound for Devonport, England, via Gibraltar. We did not expect to touch Alexandria. As I promised to post this on, this will be a suitable place to make a break. I will continue as the chance offers.</p>
<p>I consider my health has improved in every possible way. The food is rough but good. It is not a complexion producer though.</p>
<p>I hope the matter here won't be dry in too many places. It's hard to write amid these busy surroundings where one daren't miss any of the numerous sights which go past like a cinematograph film, from dawn to sunset. If Father types this I would be glad if he would allow Mr McCulloch to read one.</p>
