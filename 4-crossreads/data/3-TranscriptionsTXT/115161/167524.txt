  INTRODUCTION.  
  On telling some of my personal experiences to one of my few friends, he asked me to write an account of same, in the same style as told to him. He said that if I&nbsp;could produce the story with the (he did me the honor of calling it) humour, I had infused into the telling of it, that it would make&nbsp;interesting reading.  
  Being a bit of an egoist, I have decided to comply with my friend&#39;s wishes, and I sincerely hope that those who take the trouble to read the story, will find it interesting, and (if I may say) in parts humourous.  
  I beg of you to overlook any defect you may notice in &quot;journalism&quot; (I think that&#39;s the correct word), and to remember that this is my first attempt at anything of the&nbsp;kind.  
  I intend giving you unadulterated facts of my personal experiences of the Australian Imperial Forces during the four and a half years I had the honor of being connected with them.  
  The humour (if you will honor me by calling it such) is perhaps of a very poor class, I am not a humourist, but I generally find plenty to laugh at in this sordid and somewhat gloomy world. If I can make any of my readers only smile, I am content.&nbsp;  
  One of the greatest gifts God has vouchsafed to man is (in my opinion) the gift to brighten the lives of others. This estimable gift is unfortunately not always in evidence.  
  Only in very rare cases shall I mention individual names.  
  My thanks go to my friend if my story finds favour with the readers of same.  
  If a little &quot;slang&quot; should creep in, please forgive me. The Australian language, you know, contains more adjectives than any other. I did not realize this until I joined the A.I.F.
