 The S S Kurin-Gai took us along to Wooloomooloo Bay. A Band was in attendance to play us off. Motor Cars then took us off along to the Buffet where we were allowed to meet our relatives Just outside I came in contact with Mr. Kelly my old schoolmaster. We were soon put into another car and after a weeks leave was granted proceeded home 
 Was greatly surprised to see a string of flags flying as a "welcome home". A nice meal was ready. The Pastor came in and had tea too. Later there was a Social Gathering Was not admitted to the hospital at once but became for sometime an outpatient. There was nothing much to be done for me
