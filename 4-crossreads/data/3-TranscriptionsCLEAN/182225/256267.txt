 Not much sun yet, very windy, but it was a following wind and a following sea. We ought to have made a record run. Had first of a course of lectures with the Battery headquarters staff under Lieut Neylan. Think it is going to be very interesting work but there is going to be plenty of it. 
 Measles broke out on board the ship. Everybody is rousing a treat as it blocks our chance of getting ashore at Durban.
