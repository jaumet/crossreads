<p>These we handed over to two Syrians who were to follow on behind.  The rest of us rode out to pick up the 100 men.  6 miles, no men, asked Chief why, he said they were camped on the left near the river a little ahead.  Got there, no men.  People streaming in in thousands.  The women rush us kissing hands &amp; feet&amp;amp; calling down the blessing of God.  Midday, no men, no food, but hear Dr. Shed is ahead fighting the Turks &amp; Kurds.  The villages en route all destroyed by Christians &amp; in flames, many murdered Persians both male &amp; female in all these places.  At 4pm we reach Mrs. Shed who is looking after a bunch of wounded women.  She said her husband was a little further back with a handful of men putting up a rearguard.  Still no sign of our 100 men.  Apparantly all the men</p>
