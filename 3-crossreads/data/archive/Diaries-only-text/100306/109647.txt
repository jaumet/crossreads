4/1/17 Thistle Tr
Went on to the firing line with a guide and just at rear of our present line had been a charge. Bodies lay thick in patches ? huddled masses sinking into the mud. Head wounds seemed to have stopped a few but shells had cut some up. One chap's head and shoulders were lying on the ground. Another's legs were at right angles to his body ? severed. Passing here the enemy must have seen us for two 77 shells landed within a few yards and covered us with smoke. A very narrow escape from becoming one of these brown little heaps on the ground. In the firing line things were considerably better than yesterday but still no bunch of violets. Went along the line getting up to the waist in places in the creamy mud. Returned in heavy rain to H.Q. and put in a busy afternoon on routine stuff. Dr. Morrison turned up to relieve Fraser who is still far from well. Papers came in the rations and Pedler myself found we had both been awarded Military Cross. Good for the Y.Bs
