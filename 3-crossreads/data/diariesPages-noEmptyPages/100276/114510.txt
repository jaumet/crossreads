were told to go back to our respective Coy's on the way back I had to pass the Capt dugout he called me in asked me how things were going I told him, he said he was going down to Bn. Hqrs shortly he would have a word with the Colonel, what kind of a man do you think he is, at one time he Len I were bitter ememies but what a change, now he is taking a great interest in us. What a fine thing it would be if both of us could get our commission I dont care so much for myself but I know how all at home would like it to come about wouldn't they feel proud it would be a very good record
