<p>Cairo 15/3/16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 19.4.16<br/>C/o Ol's Boudoir</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>You will see by address that I am writing this in at Ol's.  After a bit of trouble I got up on duty Leave yesterday.  Landed in Cairo about 2 P.M. &amp; went round to Ol just to let her know I was in.  Was on duty till 6 &amp; then Ol &amp; I had tea together after which we went out to Heliopolis &amp; see Walter.  The 3 of us came back into Cairo, &amp; had a feed of ice-cream &amp; stuff &amp; then I went back to Camp with Wal &amp; slept there.  I think Ol is looking better than when I saw her last but Walter is a bit thinner in the face.<br/>I have all day to-day off &amp; have to report for duty at 8 in the morning.  I am very sorry that I won't be able to see Rid who is at Tel-el-Keber but it is out of the Question.<br/>Ol &amp; I are going out to the Zoological Gardens after dinner.  She is very bright &amp; needless to say we have tons to yap about.<br/>The weather here has been &amp; is beautiful &amp; fine &amp; is getting hotter especially about noon.<br/>The mail closes today for Australia &amp; it is the last mail for 6 weeks that we are able to send on account of a big move that is taking place here.<br/>Must close now   With love to all at home<br/>Your loving son<br/>Leo.</p>
