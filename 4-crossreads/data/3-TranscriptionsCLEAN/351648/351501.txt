  
 We have just come back from Bapaume, I established an Ambulance post there soon after it had been taken, they were exciting times, we all expected to be blown up by mines left by the Germans any day.  The town was nothing but a mass of ruins, Churches, houses, wells, nothing was left standing or intact, roads were blown up & the whole place burnt, it was the same in the whole area over which the Germans retired, we were in a very battered old house the upper 2 stories absolutely wrecked & the remainder prepared with a pile of wood covered with tar for burning but in the hustle was overlooked.  We seized it but expected it to be mined, but our luck stood & here we are.  Our Division has done awfully fine work, we are like puppy dogs with tails up, very cocky I assure you
