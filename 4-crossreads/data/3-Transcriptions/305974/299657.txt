<p>19 Thursday<br/>The rumors we have been hearing this last couple of days about us being relieved, came true today.  The 4th London Field Ambulance took over from us during the afternoon, &amp; we went to Ouderdom by the Ambulance cars about 7 pm.  It rained very heavy nearly all day &amp; the water is running through the roof of our dug out &amp; is about 8 inches deep in places.</p>
<p>20 Friday<br/>It was bitterly cold this morning &amp; has been cold all day.  There was a bit<br/>of a frost this morning, the first I have seen for a very long time.  I received 9 letters today including three from home.  This makes 24 letters I have received this last week.  Went into Reninghelst during the evening &amp; had a good time.  Sent some Xmas cards away to Australia.</p>
<p>21 Saturday<br/>issued with gloves, inner soles for boots, &amp; undervest (winter clothing)  This evening I went to a send off tendered to Major Welsh of C section of this Fld Amb.  It was a very good turn out &amp; had quite an enjoyable time.  There was plenty to eat drink &amp; smoke.  The evening was concluded with speeches, recitations &amp; songs which were very good</p>
<p>22 Sunday<br/>still keeping very cold.  Done up parcel for home &amp; got it censored by Cpl Furber.  I think we will be shifting from here in a couple of days.</p>
