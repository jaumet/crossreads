Saw also the Tempis Ercole an old Roman temple long supposed to be of the Vestal Virgins but now not so. A modern tiled roof. The gharries here have umbrellas fixed to the front seat and these cover the driver. The places seen today were S. Pietro in Vincoli, Colesses S. Paolo fure le mure Inglese Cimitero, Tempio Ercole

In the morning saw Pantheon Piazza Novona, Castel. S. Angelo. S. Pietro Pinacoteco Vaticiana. The column of Marcus Aurelius and the Forum of Trajan and its column. On both of the latter the Christians have taken down the old Imperial statues and put up their miserable Peter and Paul. The column of Marcus Aurelius is decorated all round with bands of carving in the marble. Awoke at 7.30 and had a very tiny breakfast and no bath owing to the heater
