<p>Monday 5th<br/>A beautiful day. But then I prefer the air on this coast to any where else I have been The sea is like a harbour  little white capped ripples a shade darker blue than the sky. The coast is in sight most of the time  does not look inviteing &ndash; a hard careless sort of coast &ndash; like its inhabitants Victorians &amp; Tasmanians paid today. Band took up a colection in aid of its self  Gambling in full swing</p>
<p>Tuesday 6th<br/>Close to land</p>
