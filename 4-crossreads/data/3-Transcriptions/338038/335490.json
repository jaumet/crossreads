<p>Mr &amp; Mrs Garling<br/>Just a few lines to convey to you my sincere sympathy for the loss of you son, Major Garling.  As a gunner in the 37th Battery I saw a great deal of Major Garling, under very trying conditions, and his personal courage and consideration for the men under his command, gained him the affection of everyone with whom he came in contact.<br/>Trusting that there will be a speedy and satisfactory termination to the present struggle.<br/>I remain<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>Thomas Salmond</p>
