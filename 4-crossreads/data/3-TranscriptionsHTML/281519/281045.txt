<p>Ribemont <br/>24/1/17 A sunny feeble day and one of the coldest ever experienced, the mercury was below freezing point all day and the snow is still white all over the fields. On morning parade kept the men moving briskly as much as was possible but the chill bit right into the joints. In the afternoon there was no parade  all men being at the baths. With Maberly Smith &amp; Ped. walked over to Heilly which is a pretty little place and then walked out past the Casualty Clearing Stations along the Corbie road. There is a belt of leafless forest running right along the Ancre and a church steeple peeps out of it. All the dwellings are clustered in the villages and the farm lands in neat patches have no one living on them. Returning to Heilly I met the others and we adjourned to a little buffet place for afternoon tea. There were 3 m'selles there, exquisitely dressed and all pretty. There were a good many officers there. Tonight for the first time in our billet we have a fire. The shortage of coal is serious and causes great discomfort and inconvenience. It is a saying that the men with sugar and coal can buy anything from the inhabitants</p>
