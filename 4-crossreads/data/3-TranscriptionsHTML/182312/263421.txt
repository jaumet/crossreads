<p><u>5th July 1916.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Billets I last wrote from now consist of one</p>
<p>chimney and&nbsp; <sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup> heap of charred bricks.&nbsp; It was a big homestead and</p>
<p>accom<sub>^</sub><sup>m</sup>odated the whole Company.&nbsp; The Hun apparently thought it</p>
<p>concealed a gun for he poured shells in there in salvos until he</p>
<p>was sure there was nothing left standing.&nbsp; Fortunately everybody</p>
<p>was able to get out in time.&nbsp; Since then I have done another turn</p>
<p>in the front line where things have livened up considerably.</p>
<p>&quot;The great push&quot; which we have heard about for twenty months past</p>
<p>has at last started and this little strip of country from the</p>
<p>Belgian Coast down through that country and France to Switzerland</p>
<p>has become an inferno of bursting high explosive.&nbsp; The constant</p>
<p>row of the guns firing and the shells exploding is now so loud</p>
<p>and continuous that it robs us of the warning shriek of an</p>
<p>approaching shell and the first thing you know now is the explosion</p>
<p>and that quantities of earth clods are falling on you.&nbsp; If they</p>
<p>land much closer to you than that - well, you don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p>about it and that&#39;s the end of it.&nbsp; That warning shriek of the</p>
<p>shell is always looked upon as a comfort;&nbsp; it only gives you</p>
<p>about two seconds, but it is just time to duck, not that ducking</p>
<p>is any use for it is quite an understood thing in the army that if</p>
<p>a shell is meant for you (some say your number is engraved on the</p>
<p>nosecap) it will find you no matter where you be.&nbsp; You will often</p>
<p>hear a chap say as a shell xxxxx sails harmlessly over head, &quot;I</p>
<p>hope that was &quot;my&quot; shell&quot;.&nbsp; Shell shock is a very real complaint</p>
<p>and quite a frequent one possibly growing more frequent as the</p>
<p>size and effect of the shells increase.&nbsp; I had always imagined</p>
<p>that shell shock was a sort of climax to a gradual wearing of the</p>
<p>nerves through constnt exposure to shell fire.&nbsp; Such is not the</p>
