<p>pulled off my uniform by a damn Tommy 'to send to England'.  I met Heiller here, shot in the thigh, and we walked about a quarter of a mile to a road.  Here we got a lift in a limber.  It took us so far &amp; another one took us to the beach.  It jolted us about but we did not mind that.  We slept in the ward room all night &amp; went aboard 'Braemar Castle' on <u>Monday 10th May 1915</u>.  843 of us aboard.  Very kind.  Set sail at night.  (Sgts. Grey, Brack &amp; McVee w.f.).</p>
