letter came from Ted this afternoon.  Mrs Parsons is good to call for you in the motor, she should be well off when the old man has passed in his cheques.   I hope so.  Please thank her for being so good to you.
I should like to see the red tipped leaves from the gum tree as they are arranged in the bowl on the landing.   A letter from Pat Watt came this afternoon, please thank her for writing it, she is a clever little woman.   Good.   Glad that Tabby had a day up the harbour with the Bridges.  Yes I shall be very sorry if you leave Macquarie Street, it is a desireable place to live in, and all my books and other material are fitted in there, but more about this and 211 on a separate page as they are purely business matters.
