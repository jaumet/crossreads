 May 1917 27th   Yesterday &amp; to-day we have been doing "barbed wire entanglements" in the morning &amp; have had the afternoon off. We were playing football &amp; cricket  in the  yesterday afternoon &amp; this afternoon the 20th Division who are relieving us on this sector, gave a concert in the paddock behind the old Chatteau ruins.   It was a most brilliant success &amp; we enjoyed it thoroughly.   The artists were in "periot" costume, &amp; all are members of  the  various units of the Division.   The orchestra band of the Div. was in attendance as well as the piano, &amp; they antisipate holding the show every evening free to all comers.
