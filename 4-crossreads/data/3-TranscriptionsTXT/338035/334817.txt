 Bristol 
 At Bristol I had to wait 2 hours for a train connection so had a walk round the town &amp; concluded it was a very busy place.  The myriads of girls when the factories stopped work was a spectacle. As I was there a hospital train was emptying the wounded into Ambulances thence to Hospital. Met a wounded Anzac who rece'd wounds at Pozeiers [Pozieres] (from 18th Batt.). Newport was next stop.  The town boasts of a Suspension Bridge after the Marseilles design which carries people across in a basket.  Thence on to Cardiff which is largest town in Wales.  Only saw about 20 minutes of Cardiff. 
 Neath, South Wales 
 Arrived Neath at 6.40.  Had the good fortune to obtain a motor bus to Penrhiewtyn where the Hospital was.  On arrival at Hospital I interviewed the Charge Nurse and ascertained the injuries which consisted of a compound fracture of tibia &amp; as I subsequently found out, nervousness bordering on shell shock. Eventually obtained lodgings at Thomas Llewellyn Caf&eacute;  in  near Station where I met a New Zealander named Barrington.  Soon fell asleep. 
 Friday 8th After bath, shave &amp; breakfast I made tracks for Hospital laden with reading matter &amp; biscuits &amp; he was real pleased &amp; no doubt surprised to see me.
