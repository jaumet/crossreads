Was paid 20 Franc's yesterday. I am enjoying the spell in this pleasant area. We exercise vigorously in the grounds of this chateau; and carry out some brisk route marches. Received some letters and parcels.

The Vote on the Conscription Referendum was taken yesterday. I don't think the troops are keen on it. Did not get a vote. A battalion Parade; the colonel warns us that we will see more fighting before we are much older. Have orders to move off at midnight. I am sorry to leave my White Chateau, I doubt if we will ever get another home like it. Had a white frost this morning the first I've seen this winter.
