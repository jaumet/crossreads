<p>later as soon as I am able and can get in touch with Keith.</p>
<p>At present I am still confined to bed and no energy. I am afraid in my anxiety to keep up with the others on the march with all my kit etc, that I used up all my reserves and got down to bed-rock. I have no doubt everything will come all right  in time, but it will be many weeks or more before I am up to standard again. Nervous energy absent for the time being, and just temporarily no good and no strength &ndash; otherwise no bad symptoms, and so it looks just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Isn't it strange I should have met Capt. (Dr) Hutchinson of Wee Waa of the 20th at Brighton, who attended Arthur Ferguson when he was hit, and now to flop into an English Hospital myself right up against the next bed to an officer who was with Keith when he was hit.</p>
<p>Poor Gibson has a horrible gash across the scapula and deep into the muscles of back: I saw it dressed one morning: he has to lie flat on his belly or else hunched up on the opposite shoulder to get relief. After he is dressed he lies flat on his face and hardly moves a hairsbreadth for 2 hours, but he tells me he is ever so much easier now than he was a few weeks ago. In the afternoons he perks up and gets quite cheerful.</p>
<p>I was glad to get the news of your exam. I wouldn't like to face those exams myself. Be sure and take a holiday first chance you get. About work, study your pathology above all things and follow up your patients in the wards.</p>
<p>With love,<br/>your affectionate brother, Malcolm.</p>
