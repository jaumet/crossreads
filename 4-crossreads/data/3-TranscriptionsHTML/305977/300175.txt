<p>with a Frenchman employed at Chandres Freres &amp; he says he will show me around Cairo some Sunday.  The streets of Cairo are crowded at night &amp; there is no doubt the Austn is very popular <strike>no doubt</strike> probably because he spends freely.  Spent a fairly cold night on guard.</p>
<p>Saturday 13th [Feb]<br/>Came off guard at 11 oclock &amp; knocked about the town till 3 oclock.  There was a great crowd of soldiers in town in the afternoon.  Races were on.  Had dinner &amp; afternoon tea in town.  Got back to camp about 4 in the afternoon.  Wrote a few postcards &amp; posted them after tea.  Felt pretty tired &amp; went to bed early.</p>
<p>Sunday 14th<br/>Cool, cloudy day.  Was mess orderly so did not attend any parades.  The whole Bgde was inspected after church &amp; the general said we made a good impression.  Ted Rabbitts</p>
