down hill all the way for nearly a mile and a half and seems to end abruptly in a tiny cluster of old fashioned dwellings.  "Tyneham"   There is a nice little church there just as old fashioned as the rest of the Place but there was no "Inn" so we had to Press on to Lulworth for tea it is two miles away, and we had to climb over the hill again we arrived at Lulworth between 5 & 6 P.M. and had tea, at a little wayside Place.   Rested there awhile then Proceeded on our way.   we had a nice walk home in the moonlight.   next  Sunday if we have a chance and the weather is fine we are going down to Lulworth West, it is right on the coast and is a rather Pretty little village I believe.   I am now waiting to hear whether my application for Xmas leave is going to be granted.  I would not be a bit surprised if they try to send as many of us as possible off to France before Xmas.   They are quite capable of doing it
