Lieutenant-Colonel James was one such officer who did his duty well. But he was solely an artillery officer. He was not destined to command field formations in peace and in war. Nevertheless, he discharged his duties satisfactorily in the humbler commands he held in peace and in war despite poor inducemnts at times during hs peace timee service to do one's best with enthusiasm.in the Australian Army in which he served, with pride and distinction, the conditions of service for all ranks were not good in his time. These conditions were characterised by severe retrenchments, sometimes for immedate and so short term gains, low pay, and negligible prospects of promotion. Moreover prospects for professional development were demoralisingly limited, not only in commnad arid staff appointments, but also in the wider and more profound field of military education.
