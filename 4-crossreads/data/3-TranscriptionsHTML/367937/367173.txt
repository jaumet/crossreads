<p>My dear Hal &amp; Fred<br/>I posted a short note to Mother and sent a cable on Friday night which I hope you have received; I am a bit nervous about the cable as I am not certain  whether I put the right address on it; however if the notice does not come soon saying it has gone I will try and send another one at the week end.<br/>Isolation camp is not a very exciting place to be stuck in for three weeks, especially as there is no leave at all and as so far no canteen to buy anything at:  but I wish you boys were here to come for walks with me over the old battle field as it is awfully interresting out there.<br/>You can find all sorts of old relics out there, such as cartridge cases and bullets etc, and the trenches and gun mounds are still there; they must have been a terrible size when they were made as although the sand has drifted into them a lot they are still pretty deep.<br/>This is funny country around here; not quite what I expected it to be, it is desert all right but it is all long rolling sand hills, only the sand has a certain amount of clay with it and has set down pretty hard and is covered with round water worn stones just like the hills at the back of Barham.</p>
