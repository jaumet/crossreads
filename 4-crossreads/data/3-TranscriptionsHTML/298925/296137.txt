We tried our hardest to get a fly but only three succeeded, who won on the drawing of matches.  These were taken up for about 10 minutes in Farman biplanes, and Armstrong-Whitworths.  They were supplied with helmets and goggles and Triangular blocks with ropes attached were placed under the wheels.  The machine was then started by twisting the propellor a few times when the blocks were pulled away and the machine ran down</p>
