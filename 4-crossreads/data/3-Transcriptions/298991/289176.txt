<p>Sunday June 3rd<br/>A lovely day. There is a big draught of men going to Perham Camp tomorrow, I think so far I am among them. I am not too anxious to be going. On mess orderly all day. Did not go out all day, as I had to be medically examined, I could not go on church parade.</p>
<p>Monday June 4th<br/>Two drafts went away this morning, one at 7 am for Herdcot &amp; the other at 10 am for Perham Downs, I was lucky enough to get out of both. It was very funny, on both occasions each lot hooted &amp; counted out the adjutant, (Lieutenant Donald Grant) He brought <strike>each</strike> the first lot back twice &amp; the last lot once. He is an absolute rotter of the first waters, &amp; deserves all he got. I have heard since there is to be trouble about it. Got a late pass &amp; went to an entertainment in the Jubilee Hall in Weymouth, it wasn't too bad.</p>
<p>Tuesday June 5th<br/>We are having lovely weather this last few days. Digging ground for potatoes this morning. Went for a route march to the beach &amp; whilst there had a dip in the sea, it was O.K too, only you had to walk a long way out before you got to any depth of water at all. There are no breakers, therefore only swimming, no surfing. Went for a row in a boat with another fellow this eveing, I proved an utter failure at rowing, &amp; nearly upset the boat a couple of times. Sent parcel home to Australia.</p>
