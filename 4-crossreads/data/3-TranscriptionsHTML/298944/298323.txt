<p>Hazebrouck. What divisions there were behind I don't know. I do know, however, that our Div. General, Gen. Walker was put in charge of the defence of Hazebrouck with power to collect the stragglers &amp; assimilate them into the Division. I heard he collected 3,000. At any rate I know that quite a number were attached to the Division at the time that the Guards were out</p>
