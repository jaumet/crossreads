<p>Aug 15 a big shark just astern, &amp; hundreds of flying fish dart away from the ships side. Running before a fair sea, &amp; av'g'ng 300 a day. Detailed for fatigue tomorrow. Washed a shirt &amp; towel. Heavily laden cargo boat passed on port side &ndash; dipping her nose well into the briny. Our boat nearly stopped during the night to effect repairs in the engine room.<br/>As the full round face of the moon shows through the dark cloud mass, so do the waves subside, &amp; the wind drops to the merest puff.</p>
<p>16 Head wind &amp; a fair swell, but sultry withal. Helped to clean Troop deck</p>
