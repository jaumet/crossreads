<p>The mails have been mad lately &amp; I have had very little news whatever.  The season seems to be good for which I am very very glad, but the coal strike is bad &amp; things political seem to be very very mixed.</p>
<p>Well my dear I wonder where you'll be when this reaches you.  I suppose it will be too hot at Tog but I hope you are well &amp; happy &amp; Graham &amp; the Boss aussi.  My love to you all &amp; dear old Mac &amp; believe me,</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Jim Wilkie</p>
