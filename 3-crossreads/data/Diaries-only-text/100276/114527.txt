content to tell the truth I rather enjoy wading through the water it puts me in mind of when we were kids used to splash play about in the water thoroughly enjoy ourselves, but it is only Autumn as yet the weather with the exception of the nights now again is fairly warm mild
I have been on the go all day long tonight I am fairly tired for walking about makes one leg weary, for today I have been doing practically the Sergt Majors work my own besides I have not had a minute scarcely to myself except at tea time tonight 16 hours solid going, but tonight I am stopping in.
