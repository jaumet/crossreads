25/2/12 Boulogne Selles
The Battalion was to have gone up to Carlettes to carry out a gas attack practice but dawn showed heavy rain falling. So the scheme was postponed and a programme of indoor work was carried out. Rode out to Quesques and saw the dentist. From here across to the 4th Army range through Lottinghen and looked up Gorman Greene who are billeted here with our demonstration platoon. The farm people seem miserably poor and sullen. An old man crouching over a fire and a tired looking woman. Stayed here for a while and had lunch with the officers. Then rode across to Bde.H.Q and fixed up a number of details regarding competitions. From
