July 1 are fairly numerous, & I have spotted at least 2 women who drive their own cars. Of messenger boys one, walking, carried a fat brown paper parcel; & the other sported a bike, & a basket in which reposed a well-plucked fowl, - its head dangling absurdly over the side. (The rest we will reserve for some other fine day).
2 Officers going crook about Mess Orderlies & state of hut, so we told them straight that all the permanent Orderlies were put on guard.Leaving for[in margin] Sunday
