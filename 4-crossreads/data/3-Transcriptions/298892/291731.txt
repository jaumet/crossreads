<p>We were withdrawn from the line after six <strike>months</strike> days strenuous work and are now quartered in a most peaceful neighbourhood well out of the range of the guns.<br/>At present I am writing seated in a green sward surrounded by fruit trees of all kinds, particularly cherry. Unfortunately although covered with fruit they are not quiet ripe yet, but, if we remain here for another fortnight, I am looking forward to a good feed. I don't know what the french proprietor will have to say on the matter but it will hardly affect us much.<br/>We live under the trees spending most of our time reclining on the grass recuperating from our strenuous work, and all of us sleep out in the open at nights.<br/>I had an opportunity, a couple of days ago, of looking over our latest and most deadly weapon of offense, a tank, and you may be sure I took it.  They are truly wonderful and most deadly monsters, quite impervious to rifle and machine gun fire and proof against against (anything) but a direct hit from the largest shells. Numbers of them were in the present advance but not on our immediate front.<br/>I secured a Fritz helmet, knapsack, rifle-bolt, water-bottle, belt almanack and Field Letter card, as souvenirs. I am afraid I will have no hope of sending the helmet but will post the others as they may prove interesting to you.<br/>I received two letters from home dated 2nd. &amp; 15th. April and also a book "Silas Marner", and am pleased to hear that all at home are well.<br/>The garden must indeed be beautifully decorated with the new Sunflower. I hope Kit's snaps of it and yourselves prove a success.<br/>I must conclude now as the mail closes to-day and will write again at the first opportunity. I have endeavoured to write each week but have missed some I'm afraid. When in the trenches one loses sense of time and the day we come out on a Monday, it is hard to tell whether one or two weeks have elapsed since going in.<br/>With the best of love to all at home &amp; next door<br/>Your loving son,  Eugene.</p>
