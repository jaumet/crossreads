from which a passage leads off to a room with a vaulted roof, the resting place of a Queen of one of the Pharoah's. there is nothing to look at in the room. its walls roof are of limestone I noticed down an air passage two or three beer bottles which does not speak well of the good woman, although I believe she was dead, when put inside. from the landing the upward passage continues, getting more slippery every yard you go, till at last if you don't fall and slide to the bottom you get to the tomb of the King. it is a large room composed of granite slabs of immense size one of them 16 ft long by about 10 or 12 deep. 7 slabs form the roof in one corner is the coffin chizeled out of a solid block of granite about 4 feet deep by 3 wide about 8 long. these are only guess measurements but will give you some idea, the granite was brought from Aswan, or Assouan a long way up the nile 5 or 6 hundred miles
