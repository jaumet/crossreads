<p><u>Monday night</u>:&nbsp; Such a day the 11th of November has been, at 11-45 a.m. we were undergoing a lecture when a messenger came in and spoke to the instructor who turned round, remarked that the Armistice had been signed, and then resumed the lecture, typically British isn&#39;t it?&nbsp; the thrilling news, left us almost calm though to most of us it meant almost a certain-ty of life, of home, and all the best things of life, we are indeed a curious race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The afternoon brought us a half-holiday with passes and a char-a-bancs to the nearest sizeable town, <sub>^</sub><sup>Le Treport.</sup> which we found &quot;en Fete;&quot;&nbsp; French, Belgian and British soldiers, officers and civilians, merry with wine and excitement, gay with ribbons and flags, forming into processions, promenading the streets, dancing and flirting everywhere, the French sang a great deal and &quot;Australia will be There&quot; was also heard at times.&nbsp; But it was very tiring and after a few hours became a bore, so I took the 6-15 bus home and had dinner at the mess, where we carried on until 10-30 p.m. finds me telling you the story here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Company (&quot;C&quot; Coy <sub>^</sub><sup>of 38th Bn A.I.F.</sup> has scored very well, four Military Medals, 1 D.C.M., and 1 Bar to M.C. in the 31st August battle.&nbsp; I put an officer and a Sergt. up for V.C&#39;s, but the Sergt. got a D.C.M. and the officer a Bar to his M.C., both are valuable awards, the D.C.M. is much prized amongst the N.C.O&#39;s while a bar to an M.C. is really most creditable and rather rare, Baxter should be very proud of his bar which is represented by a small silver rose displayed on the purple</p>
