3/5/18 Querrieu
Went to Bde HQ at 9.30 am to attend a conference. The Chateau is situated in delightful grounds and is a fine place. The trees and the green open spaces make it very lovely indeed. Inside the Chateau has been partly denuded of furniture and one room was labelled "Private" and there evidently most of the best things were stored. The General and Bde Major ran over details and we then got our horses and rode down to the Somme. Crossed the river in a pleasant and pretty spot where pontoon bridges had been put across and made for Blagny-Tronville where we picked up guides. Another short ride soon took us to some ground from which the town of Villers Bretonneux could be plainly seen. Corbie was situated very prettily in a bower of green trees. The great importance of the Villers Bretonneux ridge was apparent at once as all our movement was quite concealed from the Hun except that he had one balloon up. Looking behind us in the blue we could see the outline of Amiens and the spire of its Cathedral standing up. If the Hun gets this ridge he gains direct observation right onto the city. This morning our people and the French tried a local operation which was not successful. Here at this point is the junction of the French and the British Armies. We rode right up in and through the 18 pounder line and right up to firing line Bn HQ
