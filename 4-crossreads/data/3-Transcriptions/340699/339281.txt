<p>I think this may have been the cause of my being sent for to-day by one of the real heads here; an officer only just back from leave in England. This was an entirely different matter from seeing those other ones. This is a man of brains and ability, as was unavoidably evident, in about one minute, to me. In appearance he is like that film villain who rings the changes on Pearl White (is that her name?) in "The fatal Ring"; The Mexican-Japanese looking chap, who is such a good actor; only this Colonel is clean-shaven. Everything he said was to the point and he was very kind in his attitude toward me. I don't say that because he was kind for I am not so shallow; but, I was impressed by his rapid-moving mind. It was reminiscent of<br/>H. R. B. the way in which, as soon as I had had my say, he had ready his solution and reply, having followed up my remarks in the same way as does a stenographer. I am to be given better chances of seeing things than hitherto and if there is to be found any room suitable as a studio I can have it. The camouflage is to be cut down to a perfunctory sufficiency to comply with orders, but mainly I am to have my own time to myself and am to apply to him whenever I want anything. All the same I feel used up and the life here is taking it out of me. I realise I'm different from these very much tougher men who can stand what saps my life.</p>
<p>St. Gratien, France<br/>2/7/18.<br/>Last night I had a long talk with Leist and it proved to be as I had guessed that he had talked with the Colonel with whom I had the interview. If L. gets his way things will be much better for us, and I think he will, for he is a great persuader.<br/>After I left him to go to bed he went for a further pursuit of the matter and if I can see him to-night I'll learn all about it.<br/>To-day he has been up the line and I was rather sorry, for Billy Hughes was here with enough scarlet and gold braid accompanying him to outfit an army of beefeaters. Bean was of the party and if L. had been here he would have had a great chance to get in some of his fine work. Keith Murdoch who in England represents the Associated</p>
