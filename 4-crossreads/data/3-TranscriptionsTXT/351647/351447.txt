Dear Mrs. John,
Just a few lines tonight, I'm very off colour with a bad cold & we are busy but they've warned us that we'll be on the move tomorrow & won't have any more chance of writing for a while so I'm just sending you a few lines.  I don't know where we are going, I have an idea but can't say.  However I hope to be able to write again soon & have at least a little news.
Give my love to the boss & Mac & Graham & lots to yourself.  I can never repay all your kindness & goodness to me but I never will forget it, I often think of my time at Tog, wish I were there tonight.  This is a rotten letter but you'll understand won't you.
Yours as alwaysJim Wilkie
Keep on writing as usual.
