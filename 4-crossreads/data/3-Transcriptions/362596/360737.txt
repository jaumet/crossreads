<p>France<br/>7/6/16<br/>Dear Alice and Tom<br/>Just a few lines to let you know I am still going strong over here.<br/>I have been in the trenches a fair amount and I find it a lot better than Gallipoli as we are only in for a few day and then we come back to our billets and have a rest. The country is very pretty over here now, all the hedges are out in flower and the trees have all got their leaves on and the weather is coming out nice and warm and I am not sorry either. I heard that Vic failed to pass at Coota on account of his leg, I thought it would go against him and the training would bring it on him again. I seen George McMahon yesterday he is doing well he is not in this Battalion but his billet is close to me and he brought me down a couple of Riverina Graziers yesterday so I got some of the local news but the war news from Australia are very stale over here as we get all the latest papers from England only a few hours old so we are well</p>
