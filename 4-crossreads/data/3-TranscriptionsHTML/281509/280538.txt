<p>1916 November 11<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Had an easy night. only one carry about 11.30 p.m. the bright moon is a great help to guide us among the shell holes. Fritz put several over but none fell very near us. Good weather continues fortunately. Ridg Bob &amp; self make an excursion into Flers village after wood. such a scene of wreckage &amp; desolation. Household furniture &amp; bedding mixed in one great broken  - confusion. &ndash; the awful ravages of war. When will it all end? Bombardment continues with  greater or less intensity all day &amp; night.</p>
