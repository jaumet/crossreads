<p>I arrived <strike>at Pt. Said</strike> in Egypt on May 10th <strike>this year</strike> 1915 &ndash; as we drew near to the African coast the blue waters of the Mediterranean changed first to a greeny colour &amp; then to a muddy yellow &ndash; the influence of the deposits brought down by the Nile being visible for <strike>many</strike> several miles out at the sea &amp; soon we saw the huge light house, 174 feet high, &amp; the big breakwaters with the statue of De Lesseps on the western one.  It seems fitting that the statue of the man to whose energy &amp; skill we owe the Suez Canal should thus watch over the northern entrance to this valuable waterway.  At Pt. Said <strike>In a fine hotel facing the sea</strike> we stayed the night in a fine hotel facing the sea, leaving by train for Cairo the following day.  It was a most interesting run.  The line runs parallel to the Canal as far</p>
