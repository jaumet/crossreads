 19th October to 27th Got back to the same old routine  stables exercising horses every day.  An easy time but very slow.  It took me 2 days to get over my trip, during those 2 days I had long lapses of forgetfulness wasn't living on the desert at all!  Another party went to Alex on the 19th followed by others on the 21st &amp; the 23rd.  I believe no more are to go after the 23rd lot.

 Jack Cheater the SQM went on leave &amp; I took over his duties.  There is only about 2 hrs work to do each day &amp; you are practically your own boss.  It is the softest job I have had &amp; I only wish it would last.  An Austln mail came in on the 23rd &amp; I got 2 letters one from home &amp; the other from Doug.  Having plenty of time I got the bulk of my correspondence
