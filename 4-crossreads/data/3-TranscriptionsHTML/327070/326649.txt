<p>Friday 15 February 1916</p>
<p>Not feeling to good but went out on early morning parade. After breakfast decided to rake the day off &amp; turned into bed. Sore throat &amp; general aches &amp; pains.</p>
<p>Saturday 26 February 1916</p>
<p>Did not get up, the doctor, who was a contemporary of mine at the Uni, coming from time to time to swab the throat &amp; have a yarn.</p>
<p>Sunday 27 February 1916</p>
<p>A nasty blowy day &amp; stayed in bed again.</p>
<p>Two church parades, the C of E at 9.15 &amp; Other denominations (taken by Rev Finigan, Meth.) at 10.15 were held on the parade ground just outside the tent, &amp; it was nice to hear the hymns played by the band.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Ol &amp; Rid came up &amp; stayed for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Monday 28 February 1916</p>
<p>A fairly fine day, &amp; got up about 10.30, taking things quietly during the day.</p>
<p>Just after tea my first Egyptian letter &ndash; from Lawry &ndash; was handed in, &amp; later 2 more from C. South came along. Mail id wonderfully welcome.</p>
<p>Tuesday 29 February 1916</p>
<p>A bright sunny day, &amp; after breakfast I got up for the day, spending the time waiting (when not yarning to the doctor) &amp; strolling round quietly.</p>
<p>After dinner at night Major Haircombe (our C.O.) lectured about the Anzac landing, tonight being the anniversary of the departure of the Australians from Mena for the famous campaign.</p>
