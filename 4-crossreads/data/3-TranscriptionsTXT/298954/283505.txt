 The "Matunga" gave us a loud coo-ee as she swung round to follow again after the gun-practise. 
 This morning we came up the Straits outside the island of Waigiou.   Some small native croft visible in the distance and many islands in vicinity (both volcanic and coral.) 
 The 'plane rose in the Straits, flew over the island and returned with an "alles klar" report. 
 The "Wolf" headed straight for the shore at about noon.   We were sent underdeck as she approached the shore but saw most of the business from the poop-doors.   The raider entered a magnificent harbour through an intricate &amp; narrow channel which took her at times within a few yards of the beach.   She finally dropped anchor in a land-locked sound which is a perfect harbour of wonderful beauty.
