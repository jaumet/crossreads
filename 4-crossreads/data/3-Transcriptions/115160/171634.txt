<p>The weather is getting fresher now. I don&#39;t know that there is much more to mention so will close at present. &nbsp;My letter to Mum tomorrow may not be a very long&nbsp;one if at all, for the mail has not come along yet.</p>
<p>I hope you are in the pink of condition, going strong at all points</p>
<p>Fondest regards from</p>
<p>Your affectionate cousin</p>
<p>Jim</p>
