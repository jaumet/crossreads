<p>weekend &amp; amongst other things we saw a revival of "Catch of the Season" quite old of course but we enjoyed it.  Well done &amp; quite jolly &amp; bright, lots of pretty girls.</p>
<p>We went to the Row &amp; saw some very funny sights on Sunday.  Also went to a big tea place where they played some good music divinely.  We stayed at Regents Palace Hotel which reminded me somewhat of the Australia but much bigger &amp; very hot.  Wow-wow.</p>
<p>I went down to Tunbridge Wells &amp; had a great time.  Mrs. Johnson looks ever so much better I think, she looks sweet.  I met Miss Annie who is a dear.  We had a great yarn &amp; I simply hated having to leave.  Miss Annie's hair is awfully pretty, it is quaint to think she has grown white so early.</p>
<p><strike>All</strike> Jimmy has grown a lot &amp; is still a great lad &amp; so amusing, Oliver is talking hard now, he calls me "soger".  Miss Annie wanted to know all about Grahame &amp; fortunately I had taken over a lot of snaps of him &amp; the garden.</p>
<p>Miss Partridge is still there &amp; just as nice as ever.</p>
