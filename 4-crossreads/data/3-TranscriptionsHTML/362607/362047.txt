<p>Bulford<br/>16 June 1918</p>
<p>Dear Mum,<br/>This is a Photo of the ruins of 'Old Sarum'. The Cathedral stood here at one time but was broken down &amp; parts rebuilt on the present site at Salisbury or New Sarum. I have passed the place dozens of times but have not seen it myself. I will run over &amp; have a look some day. I see Dad is on the old Stunt of making you take yourself to the Dandies.  You mention Clay's. Have they taken the show over. I wrote to Dad all about my Grimsby trip.  Cheer up Mum, We are safe &amp; sound &amp; well. We'll all be home one of these days &amp; not so very much longer I hope. In about 3 months time the Yankees will be driving the Germans to Hell. Lots of Love &amp; cheer up  From Harry</p>
