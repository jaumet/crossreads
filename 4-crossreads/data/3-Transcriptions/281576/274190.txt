<p>Sat. 24.  The sun actually shone for a while this morning.  The roads are very muddy again &amp; it makes things very rough for Traffic.  Our Concert went off very well again.  Hargrave, our "Props" is always surprising us with something new.  His latest is to telephone over to Stan Wilson, when to raise the Curtain.  Col Shepherd is away on leave, so he missed both our Concerts.  Lucky beggar, this is his 2nd trip over to Blighty.</p>
<p>Sun. 25.  Glorious sunshiny day.  Makes me wish I was at Manly with M.S.  Must write to her today, or I'll be getting into trouble.</p>
<p>Mon. Feb. 26  Busy preparing for our Concert.</p>
<p>Tues. 27 [no entry]</p>
