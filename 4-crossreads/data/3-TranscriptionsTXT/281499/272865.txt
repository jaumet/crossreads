 About 200 yards from us there are great watering troughs, &amp; of an evening it is the sight of a lifetime to see the never ending strings of horses &amp; mules going to &amp; from the water they reckon there are 12,000 horses or mules in this valley &amp; I believe it.  I pity the poor horses for they are bogged nearly half their time &amp; they are covered with mud from head to foot, in this rotten rainy weather they look very miserable &amp; they have to work very hard, toiling &amp; struggling all the day long dragging shells, water, tucker &amp; etc for the needs of the thousands of men who are engaged in this gigantic battle the guns never stop firing, &amp; just at the rear of us there are some enormous guns &amp; when they fire they fairly shake the hills.  Trains are running everywhere up here they are building the line as they advance.
