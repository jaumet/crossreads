106his sister. I introduce myself & we yarn for a long time. Mde comes in but seems to doubt if I am not a friend of her daughter's. Brisson is due in Paris in a month or so which will be bon for me
I pass along Rue des Ecole past the College de France into Boul St Michel & passing downwards to the city pass the Thermal baths once belonging to the ancient palaces of the Roman Emperor Constantius Chlorus who resided in Gaul from 292 - 306. The size of these bath gives us an idea of the great size of the palace but even the Baths are now in ruins. The musee de Cluny occupies the exact site of the Palace but I did not have time to enter it
Further down the street I met the Fontaine St Michel 84 ft high but being placed against a house it loses much of its grandeur. Near by is Rue de la Huchette & Zacharie "penetrating one of the dirtiest & most intricate & yet at the same time the most interesting & best preserved quarters of old Paris."
Passing now to the de la Cite one encounters another mass of monumental grandeur. Facing is Hotel [Driew] the oldest hospital in Europe on left right is Notre Dame & on left the Prefecture of Police. All facing on to Parvis of Notre Dame Center the Cathedral whose external air is squat solid & dominating so unlike other Cathedrals
