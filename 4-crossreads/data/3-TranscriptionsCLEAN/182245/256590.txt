MARCH 1917
16 FRIDAY
Fine & fairly warm. Cleaning
up round stables in morning
& we took our guns out to a
new position in Ploegstreeet
in evening, the centre
section coming with us.
The "posie" is not nearly as
good as the old one, but
it might be a lot worse.
There's a great shell hole
through the wall, & in the
ground all round, so its
been pretty lively there at
one time. Got back about
9 pm & had tea & then had
to turn out again & draw
ammunition at the dump.
