  
 Friday 26 May 1916 A bright clear day. Slept in & had breakfast in bed. Censoring letters & similar work during the day, the company being off parades on a/c of the night work. Was innoculated for paratyphoid in the afternoon. In the evening was out with a fatigue party on the same work as last night, really completing the job : a clear star-light night for the work & good progress made enabling us to get home by abt. 11 o'c.
