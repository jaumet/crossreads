<p>another one overlooking the ruins of Gaba Tepe fort, some of our men are buried in all these cemeteries.<br/>One night early in December I was emptying some bags out on the dump  &amp; I had a wonderful escape, I had just finished &amp; was coming back when I heard a hissing noise coming through the air, I knew what it was a stick bomb, but I did not know what to do whether to run, lay down, or stand still, before I could decide what to do, down she came &amp; bobbed in the heap of dirt not 6 feet from me, luckily she failed to explode or I should not be alive to-day, they were a big bomb weighing about 12 lbs &amp; very destructive</p>
