<p>Whether you be war records [indecipherable]<br/>Or in the ice-cold ocean swimming,<br/>Or killing Turks, or kissing women<br/>In sultry climes<br/>We'll often fill the bumper brimming<br/>&amp; drink Old Times.</p>
<p>Old chaps like us are never fit,<br/>But you can shew you've got some grit,<br/>And if by shell or bullet hit<br/>You chance to lose a limb<br/>You can come back &amp; buck a bit<br/>About Jerusalem.</p>
<p>You will come back of course &ndash; but still &ndash;<br/>You probably have made your will &ndash;<br/>Unless your balance stands at nil &ndash;<br/>It seems a rum thing<br/>To ask but in a codicil<br/>Leave the Club something!</p>
