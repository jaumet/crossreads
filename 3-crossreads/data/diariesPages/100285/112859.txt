seals, monkeys birds etc, then back to town again for dinner at the "Louis" from here we had to go to the Railway station for they were returning that night I saw them off, then I went down to see my friend of yesterday arranged to take her home after she finished her work this was not until 10.15 so I went to the theatre to kill the time, as soon as it was out I slipped round met Miss Devereaux then we walked home I suppose anyone who reads these lines will think me silly when I say that I am almost gone on her, I cannot understand myself of late, I have met now some hundreds of different girls but of them all this one attracts me most she is such a refined nice spoken girl as handsome as they make them in fact she has almost turned my head, its just as well
