<p>started to snow and everything outside was covered in a white mantle about 6 to 12 inches deep, while the air itself seemed frozen, it was so cold.</p>
<p>Wrapped up with only our eyes showing, &amp; wearing overcoats we marched down to where the Lorries awaited us about 1 mile from our billets, and after a lot of trouble we were safely stowed inside and off we went. Talk about cold, my feet were just like 2 blocks of Ice owing to having no movement, &amp; there we had to sit for about 4 hours till we reached<br/>Ribemont again.</p>
<p>Once more we handed in our packs Etc and next morning moved up once more to Montauban. By now the Tommy engineers were erecting "Bow Huts" and just had enough finished to hold our Battalion uncomfortably, that is about 60 in a hut that was built for 30, so once more we had to do the "Sardine act" to get a sleep.</p>
