<p>7th. Septr. 1916<br/>Camp No. 2.<br/>Larkhill.</p>
<p>My dear Parents/.<br/>I received two very interesting letters from mother during the week, one enclosing a letter from Douglas, and a snap of Kit taken by Nell Franceschi. What I could see of her was very nice, but, owing to the print being insufficiently fixed in Hypo it had gone rather dark and the face was quite indistinguishable. I am glad to hear Kevin has tackled work of some kind, and no doubt he will stick at it as long as he is pushed for funds. Douglas's letter as usual is full of common sense. No parcels from home have reached me up to the present but I am living in hopes as some of the boys have received parcels weeks after being advised of them by letter.<br/>Last week we went on a route march to Chitterne, about 13 miles distant, and were billetted there for two nights. I am sending you a few photos I took while there. The A.M.C. and band were quartered together in an old two storied dwelling - all stone and brick and dating from some hundreds of years back like most of the English homes in the villages round about. Of course it was vacant and our meals &amp;c were supplied by our own cooks.<br/>As it was only the day after pay-day everybody had money and we were the making of the village. There was a small shop next door to our house and it was bought out within the first</p>
