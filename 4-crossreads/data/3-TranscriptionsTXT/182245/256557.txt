1917 FEBRUARY
11 SUNDAY
Fine & sunny & the warmest day we
have had since we came to
France. Cleaning up in the
stables in morning, & Bill
Hunter & I went up to Point
du Neippe in afternoon to
get some stores. Looking over
old snaps in evening & they
bring back old memories all
right. Good Lord what wouldnt
I give to get back home
again. There was a hell of
a strafe on from 7.45 pm to
11.45 pm, the heaviest we have
had yet.
