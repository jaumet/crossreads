in a dugout then rushing out snapping. We eluded shells until just about 150 yards, away when a terrific angry rocket like shriek warned us to duck. This we did by throwing ourselves flat in a shell hole, half filled with mud. A fortunate precaution for immediately a terrific roar made us squeeze ourselves into as little bulk as possible, up went timber, stones, shells, everything else in the vicinity. 
A dump of 4.5 Shells had received a direct hit, the splinters rained on our helmets, the debris mud came down in a cloud. The frightful concussion absolutely winded us but we escaped injury made off through mud water as fast as we possibly could. Egad, I've never heard such a row in my life.
(26th) 	 What a relief to be home again, I am grimed with dust mud to get into this little hut is like a touch of heaven.
