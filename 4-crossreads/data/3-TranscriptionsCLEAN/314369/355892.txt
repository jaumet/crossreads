 Go for a bit of a stroll round the building in the sunshine   &  find out I am very weak still But it feels good to be able to walk about again 
 1915 September 21 Tuesday 
 A crowd of sisters  &  patients leave for England to day on No 1 Hosp Ship Feel a bit stronger on my pins today  &  wont be long now before I am right again
