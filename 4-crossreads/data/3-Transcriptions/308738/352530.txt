<p>Oct. 12 Tuesday 1915<br/>After work went for a long walk around Ras el-Tin,&amp; saw the police drilling. They take their business very seriously &amp; both officers &amp; men look very well, as they drill in a public square. This part is noted for the boat building trade that is carried out, &amp; one can watch the small &amp; large boats being constructed in a very workmanlike manner.</p>
<p>Oct. 13. Wednesday 1915<br/>The march past of the Egyptian Lancers &amp; Infantry was splendid. They were headed by a Mounted Band all riding Grey Horses. They certainly were brought up to a high state of discipline &amp; effiecency. The horses belonging to the Mounted Yroops are well kept, &amp; too much praise cannot be given to these fine fellows.<br/>Pay day today 7/- received<br/>Lieu Cunningham gone to Pt Said on business</p>
<p>Oct. 14,Thursday 1915<br/>Everything working at high pressure owing to the number of wounded letters &amp; lists coming in.<br/>went for a walk with Dick Playdell this evening to see the place where our poor fellows are buried. Large trenches are dug &amp; the bodies laid side by side whilst some beautiful stones  are being erected now over some of the favourite ones. Officers are kept apart &amp; have separate graves.</p>
<p>Oct. 15,Friday 1915<br/>still working hard with a new lot of books, but cannot catch up with the lists as they arrive.</p>
