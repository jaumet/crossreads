  
 Pen is not working well so what I'll go back to pencil. I'm glad Father saw Jim Leask; I was very amused at Aunt Katie's account of his home coming. Poor old Jim. I'll bet he wished he could sneak in the back way and miss all that side show buisness. I dont suppose they will do all that when the mob comes home, though. It would take too much energy - I hope.  Cant  say I'm glad you met Randall. No doubt he can give you and interesting account of things. Most of his sort can. I should have told you when I first heard he was going home, but it it seemed a rotten thing to do. However he was only in the troop long enough to make every body aware when they hear his name mentioned now, so dont make friends with him. He owes Jim Ayre, among others, 75Pts! I forgot to tell you about that tin of pears of Mr Sim's you sent over. They were scrumptious. So nice and sweet and soft! Some time ago we used to get nothing but Californian fruit here. It was well advitised but such rotten stuff that the troops, Tommies, Scotties and all refused to buy it, and now we get only Australian. IXL Bartlett pears are supposed to be the best but Mr Sim can beat them all to nothing I reckon, and so said the other chaps who shaired them with me!
