Easter Monday 9 April 1917
Bombed again. "Australian" arrived & letter from the wife.  We are still waiting for the big fight, Egyptian word BUCKRAH meaning tomorrow applies, but I think it will be tomorrow. Enemy planes over every day now. Will not post this for sometime as Censors are very strict out here. Good thing my writing so bad, can't read it.  Had a letter from Nowell Forth he is O.C. Camel Corps at ABBASSIA a suburb of Cairo .
Cut all my hair off & had a bath ready now for Constantinople if caught.
See Bible AMOS, Chap. 17 verses 6 & 7.
