At least this is what we have posted up as Official so I suppose it is fairly accurate.  So that after you receive this mail you may or may not receive one for about 4 weeks.  I will continue to write regularly every week, though, as I have an idea that mails will get through somehow or other.<br/>I am keeping well, &amp; I do hope you are the same, Father dear.<br/>One of my mates who hails from Dungog by the way (Ory Clague) went on leave to England last week, &amp; I made up all my negatives (54 in all) into a parcel &amp; addressed them to you, giving him instructions to post them in London per registered post.  I hope you receive them alright as I wouldn't like to lose them for there are a lot of valuable negatives among them valuable in the sense that I would never be able to replace them.</p>
