(20) Drizzling rain set in early this morning makeing everything more uncomfortable in the line. "Fritz" fired a great many fish tail Bomb,s near our line this morning. "Fritz" Artillery very busy this afternoon shells pretty thick. More noises proposed raid to come off in the morning. Stand to arms at 11P.M. but only false alarm.
(21) At 3 o,clock this morning our raiding party consisting of 2 Officers and 100 other Ranks moved out from our "Block" on the left towards the enemy block about 80 yards distant, and after 3 minutes bombardment from our Stokes guns we went for his trench and took about 250 yards also 31 Prisoners, there were about 20 Germans killed and several wounded, there was plenty of work for his Stretcher Bearers. Our losses in the attack were 1 killed 1 Officer 5 men wounded. In one dug-out we netted 17 Germans, and of course other dug-outs held more, including several who were killed.
At daybreak several of the enemy crept towards our newly won position, but our boys "nailed" quite a few. There was some lively scraping near the "blocks" with bombs and so on. Some of the boys hard at work with pick shovel connecting up with our old trench. Enemy Snipers very busy, several of our boys killed wounded. One shell burst near our post killed 2 men wounded another. Our Stretcher bearers hard at work getting the wounded away, which was very difficult owing to the muddy state of the trench. On one occasion an enemy machine gun opened on them and wounded 2, our bearers had the white flag held up but "Fritz" never eased up. None of our boys fired on their bearers when they came out with the Red Cross flag.. We found an abundance of food in their dug-outs and made ourselves right at home. The Prisoners we took belonged to the Hamburg-Grenadiers they were big men, and apparently well fed, their clothing also was of the best, they appeared to be full up of the slaughter.
