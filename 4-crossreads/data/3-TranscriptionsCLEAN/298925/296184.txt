 Sometime when you think of the days that have gone In prosperity, even in failure, Though our friendship was short Still spare just a thought For the comrades from sunny Australia. 
 We're glad to know our English friends Extend the welcome hand And hope as time goes on they'll not forget Australia's band.

 Words may be false tears but unrecorded untruths but eyes are the windows of the soul
