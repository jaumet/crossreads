<p>26<br/>a beautiful poplar walk 6 yds wide with tall graceful trees about every 3 yds is truly wonderful while the valleys that cross the wood have been accentuated &amp; the numerous [indecipherable] which bubble along add rustic picturesqueness to a woodland scene of unrivalled beauty. Every where bridges have been constructed the handrails are made of concrete in imitation of tree limbs &amp; thus do no jar on ones asthetic perceptions.</p>
<p>From the Bois I return to Colonne du Congres a monument guarded by two ?4 lions &amp; surmounted by a stature of Leopold 1 raised to commemorate the formation of the kingdom. It has a balcony round the top which is reached by climbing 185 steps through inky blackness but is worth the trouble as the view from the top is worth the effort. Leaving here I find my way to the Grand Place perhaps the finest in Europe ie surrounded by the finest &amp; most historical buildings (see pic)</p>
<p>The Hotel de Ville takes ones breath away &amp; before one can appreciate its graceful beauty the Maison du Roi completes the mystification of the intellect. Thence I visit the Church of St Cadulle where a funeral is in progress. The interior of church is as magnificent as the exterior &amp; that is sufficient to say.</p>
<p>Then I visit a lace manufacturing place but disappoint the proprietor as I do not buy any having no cash. Thence I go to Place Royale</p>
