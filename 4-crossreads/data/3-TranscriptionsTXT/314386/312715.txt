 27 Sun.  Church Parade &amp; Gambling   Food getting Very Unsatisfactory  Lovely Legs of mutton spoiled  Boiled in Salt Water  A Royal Commission to be held to-morrow. 
 28 Mon.  No Parades in Tropic's Thank God no human being could Stand it.  The men were like a Fowl yard show Head down &amp; mouth's open  Even Amusements were cut out.  It was hard to even get a man to wind the Phonograph.  Arrived at Dakar at noon  Anchored out, no leave 
 29 &amp; 30 Tuesday.  No leave. Boat Races arranged.  The 58th won.  The 57th 2nd W.A. Third  Spent the day Fishing  some good sport but the Fish was Foreign to me different to our species.  At night We sneaked a Boat and rowed to "Dakar" It is a very nice Place and the French People gave us a great time of it  There are Some Beautiful Building's also. 
 We paid a "Niggar" to take the Boat Back and say he found it Drifting if he was caught tying it up.  So we stayed the night and the next day about every-where Went all over the Fort along the Marine Drive's and out in the Country a Bit.  It was Glorious.  About midnight we hired Boat's &amp; Coon's to Bring us Back  We had Fruit and Luxury's untold.  Champagne 3/- a Bottle  Whiskey Flashe's 9d.  Bottle's of Martel's Three Star only 1/9. 
 We got all aboard safe  It was too hot for a watch and the Harbour had a  Submarine net across its mouth so it was easy after all
