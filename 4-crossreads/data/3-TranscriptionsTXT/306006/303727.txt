4-2-17Sun 4thA good many lads were down at the beach this morning taking photos of the mine, attempts were made last night to explode it with with machine gun bullets but without success & at dinner time today a charge of amanol exploded it. it was the biggest mine we have seen here; This mornng I was fixing a telephone line when an enemy plane flew over. & we soon had a shower of shrapnel pellets, caps & empty cases. the fire from our own guns are as bad as the bombs to contend with the nights are now very bright from the moon. & we are expecting a night air raid at anytime.
