<p>Nice cosy bedroom with a fire   &amp;  as much coal as we like for 9d extra a week. Two in a room, good lights   &amp;  very snug beds, also hot water   &amp;  plenty of bathrooms. the food is excellent. Fresh milk, meat   &amp;  vegetables &ndash; it is great after the awful food we had mostly in France.</p>
<p>This is the hospital for amputations. Oh, it is terrible to see some of the poor boys   &amp;  they are all Australians. Some have both legs   &amp;  an arm off &ndash; it is   <u>too awful</u> . Also have one eyed boys. So see plenty of glass ones. But you would be surprised to see how happy they are here. The sisters   &amp;  in fact everyone connected with the hospital try to give them all a happy time. They are Bonzar boys, whistle, sing   &amp;  laugh all day.</p>
