<p>I took her home &amp; finished for the night.</p>
<p>25th.  Took Miss Nissen to the theatre last night &amp; we both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.<br/>The boat that loaded up the other day has gone &amp; we are left on our own &amp; heavens only knows how long they are going to keep us.  We were to have gone some days ago but for the outbreak of flu, they then decided to put fewer men on each boat so that's how we came to be stranded.  Everyone is fed right up to the neck, if they would only tell us how long we are here for &amp; let us make our plans accordingly it would not be so bad but as it is now we don't know what to do, some say we are likely to be here till the 19th of next month, that's a nice piece of news to be sure.<br/>A few days ago a submarine got a big transport just outside the harbour.  A good many lives were lost, but yesterday they got even with them &amp; bagged the submarine.  There were only 3 survivors &amp; one of them said that they were 380 feet down when the depth charge got them.</p>
