<p>Anzac<br/>20/12/15<br/>In the clear moonlight the hills on either side rose steeply. Our one idea was to push on as fast as possible and the men struggled along panting and nearly exhausted. We then went through Rest Gully (I had sent guides over the route during daylight) and found the climb over the Hole in the Wall very severe. The Beach was crowded, other parties were converging and from here on things got mixed and some of my chaps went one way and one another. Got aboard a lighter on which were all the last to leave, the OC Rearguard, the M.L.O, B.M. &amp;c.</p>
<p>We then put off and made for a transport the bullets flicking alround some very close. Abdul was still firing hard at empty trenches. Standing on the deck of the steamer we were out of range of the bullets. Before we left the beach though and when still on the lighter we heard a big explosion and a pillar of flame shot up into the sky. It was a mine of ours exploding on Russels Top. This at once provoked a very heavy burst of machine gun or rifle fire at the deserted trenches and it seemed strange hearing no reply in the duller thud of our musketry.</p>
<p>The big mines we laid containing tons &amp; tons of ammonal were never fired owing the direct orders to the contrary. The Turks would get a good haul of valuable explosive. Why these were not fired I don't know, certainly there was no lack of volunteers to touch them off. I think it was a big mistake to leave them as they would have blown hundreds of Turks to hell. I don't think the heads looked for the evacuation being such a success, and consequently the question of firing these was overlooked. It would have been a great spectacle &ndash; the fame of these mines had spread abroad and on the cliffs at Imbros the members of our 1A party were straining their eyes expectantly to see a great explosion that never occurred.</p>
