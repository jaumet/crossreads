We have an orchestra here needless to say I am in it, that is how it is I have not been up the line again but as we were only given a month it is over a month since I joined I suppose I will be sent up at any time, but then you know that doesn't worry me.Had my photos taken last week so am enclosing one for you although they are none too good. I have not got any fatter over here as I have lost nine kilogrammes (18 pounds) but I think the scales were out of order for although I have lost weight I'm sure I have not lost all that. I reckon I have lost about half a stone. Well dear Sis I think that is about all. We had three weeks of glorious weather but it has broken with a vengeance today as it is raining a treat. Have you taught Noni to say Uncle Hal yet? I suppose yo she will soon be old enough to know all about me or will be by the time I get home. Well dear Sis Bill that is about all so will conclude with fond love a big kiss for Noni from your loving brother Hal.
