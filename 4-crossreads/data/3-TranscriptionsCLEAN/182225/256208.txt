FEB.   TUESDAY 22   1916
Fine & very hot. Foot slogging in Park all morning. Got the last of my issue in afternoon & got the early train to Sydney. Haardy Bros did not have any colours finished, so they are posting them. Linda & Mrs Lloyd in town all afternoon so are pretty done up.
Got an early boat back & got the 9.45 train back to camp.
