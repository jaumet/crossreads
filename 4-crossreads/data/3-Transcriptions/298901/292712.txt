<p>I got on.  Very few patients coming through, so rearranged our system to allow of better working should anything develop; this meant taking over two more rooms.  Turned in early feeling very dopy.</p>
<p>Samedi 4th Mai<br/>Feeling anyhow but pain has disappeared from side.  A few more cases in than usual the line becoming active.  Did a lot of issuing of drugs &amp; arranged a special place for officers as per A.D.M.S. order.  Had the good luck today to purchase some oranges at the Y.M.C.A. 5 a franc; it seems years since I had one &amp; they were a real treat.</p>
<p>Dimanche 5th Mai<br/>A quite day all round and no news or incidents of any kind to narrate.  Still feeling off colour.  Wrote a couple of letters before turning in.  Mail in yesterday.</p>
