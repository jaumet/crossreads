particularly we enjoyed the final biv. in a pine wood - from 8 pm to 2 am. These pine woods are some places wherein to sleep during the fine weather. Your oil sheet keeps the damp down - the thick branches keep it up - and, if  you're lucky enough to have the sort of blanket that will overlap N, E, S & W, you may keep out the bulk of the earwigs, spiders etc that flock to the attack. It is wonderful how so many insects can live in such a small island. The earwigs are common as flies in Egypt, spiders are more like an element - a sort of secondary atmosphere - and midgets at times would hide the sun if it weren't for the clouds.
The summer having been most unusually fine & warm there is a great show of flowers everywhere - mostly wild varieties
