"D" Coy. 19th Batt.Liverpool (N.S.W.)Tuesday.
My dear Mother,
Received your letter this afternoon, but sorry to say that I never got Ruby's till Monday afternoon and of course too late to let me know where you would be so I could look out for you.  The Ward must have been a fine sight, but of course, being in it, I did not see too much of it, but the crowd was wonderful.  What struck me most about it was the way the soldiers as a whole behaved, and I think it showed the crowd what a fine mob they are.  Was not a bit tired after it.  Three or four miles was nothing after going twenty a couple of days before, besides there was too much excitement along the route to notice how far I was walking.  I never knew I knew so many people.  As I was on the outside of a four in front of 5th Platoon "D" Coy, I was in a good position to see people.
The rain was rather a pity, but luckily we just escaped it.  We struck a shower or two, but light ones and we were under cover at the Railway when the heaviest came down and reached home dry.
With regard to Kit, we have been issued with the following:-  2 Flannel shirts, 2 singlets, 2 prs underpants, 2 prs socks, 2 towels, 1 comforter, and have other things to come such as a Cardigan Jacket, cholera belt, brush and comb, shaving outfit etc., so you see we are pretty well provided for and don't think I will want you to get me anything else, except more socks, but I can get them when I come down on final leave, which will probably be next week.
Am feeling very fit and well, in fact never better.  The nights are getting very cool now and the morning's at about half past five are nice and chilly.
Might mention that those last socks you made are too big to March in, as they crinkle under the feet.
No more news this time.
Love fromRoy.
