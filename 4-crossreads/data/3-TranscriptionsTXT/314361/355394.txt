 Buire 22nd  16 Lu Billet Shifted to this village this morning, it is three kilometers (1 7/8 miles) from Dernancourt we have bunks made from wire netting. I had to go with advanced party, to locate the billets for H.Q. details &amp; officers. As usual when we arrive in billets we have our fire going, it make everything more cheerful. This afternoon two others &amp; myself went along the railway picking up coal for our brazier. With what we found pinched &amp; had given us we filled three sandbags.
