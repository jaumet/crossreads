<p>This morning Col. Martin handed me an order which details me for duty, in charge, at Mena House, after No 2 G.H. has departed.  Hope that it will be all for the best.  However it will give me a chance to act for myself, &amp; if my work be well done something better may follow as our campaign progresses.  J'espere! [I hope].</p>
<p>Keeping in good order &amp; feel fit for anything that may come my way.  I often think what a silly ass I was to think my Father (R.I.P.) to be an old man at the date of his death the 20th Novbr 1885.  Why, he was but 52 yrs., and at the time as active a man as lived in New South Wales, having capacity for work beyond that of any of his competitors.  He could always perform the physical and mental work of three men.  Had he been spared no doubt he &amp; I might have done much good work in combination in the Newcastle district.  Who knows?  In this world one has to put up with the decrees of the Almighty and to make the best of them.<br/>"O Lord, that lends me life<br/>Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness"<br/>A quotation written on a previous page</p>
<p>In my earliest years &amp; the first half of my teens St. Patrick's Day was a great holiday.  My Mother &amp; Father were both Irish of the Irish, and the people who lived around us were in great proportion from the Green Island.  Sports, entertainments, dances, &amp; the like, helped to make the 17th day of March in each year high holiday.  In the Newcastle district, but few families were in any way Irish, hence the day was not one of mark amongst the Coal mining community.</p>
