 W. Garling Esq Burns Bay Rd Longueville Sydney, NSW 
 Dear Sir, I am writing both in my own name & in that of his other comrades - officers NCOs & men alike - to express to you our very deep sympathy at the loss of your son - Major T.W. Garling.  He was badly wounded in the upper part of the right thigh - received all possible medical care and when he died at the Casualty Clearing Station his body received religious burial at the Warloy Cemetery - a small town some 5 miles from Albert. Your sons batman was with him a great deal towards the end.  A cross will be erected over your son's grave.  Your son died doing his duty and will I cannot put on to paper what we all feel; but this much I say, your son was undoubtedly one of the most respected and popular men in our Artillery Division.  The Doctor authorises me to say that your son did not suffer much pain. Again in very deep sympathy Yours sincerely G.E. [Shaw ?] C.F. (C of E)
