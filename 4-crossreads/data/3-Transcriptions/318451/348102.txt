<p>Friday<br/>Went to Houplines to Cocoa stall.  Visited Billets.  Weather fine, keen wind, rain slight towards evening.  Good Friday.</p>
<p>Saturday<br/>Went to Houplines this morning perhaps for the last time as we expect to move in a day or two to St. Omer for training.  Arranged for Church Services for Sunday.  This afternoon I witnessed a thrilling fight in the air.  A Squadron of 7 or 8 of our planes had been over the German lines and on returning were attacked by a squadron of theirs.  One large very fast Bosh plane engaged one of ours at about 3,000 feet.  Suddenly I saw a streamer of smoke from our plane &amp; then it burst into flame and fell burning to the ground.  It was terrible to witness &amp; to know that two of our splendid fellows were in it.  It seems impossible that they could escape certain death.  I heard a rumour they brought their machine down alright but I think it impossible.</p>
