&you have a feeling of surprise that you are still alive, for you can feel the trenches & sandbags rocking & swaying & the air is all of a tremble. Heaven's only knows what Verdun must be like for it must be 10 times worse than last nights affair. After our chaps had been at it Hell for leather" for about 10 minutes the German batteries opened up on our trenches, & soon we were in a hail of steel & high explosive but our batteries never slackened but shot it back the faster if anythingThis was the first proper bombardment that I have seen in France & I can honestly say that I was surprised at the poor shooting of the German artillery especially when we have all read & heard so much about their wonderful markmanship
