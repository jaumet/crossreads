<p>Monday 24th September</p>
<p>Went for a long walk to MEX where Napolean landed when he took Alexandria. I had for company an A.I.F. Priest, who talked a lot of the coming Revolution in England!!!!  I wonder is he right. [The remainder of the page crossed through.]  He also decided that the masses of labourites would insist on peace before another Winter War.</p>
<p>I sleep for 2 hours after lunch &amp; so the day is put thro' waiting waiting &ndash; a great waste of time &amp; money but a good change &amp; but for my Bronchitis I would be A.1.</p>
