Turn into bed at 11pm after going to a terrible picture show. What a glorious feeling. One has a cold shower & then into a good, bed electric light & every comfort. Awake 7am
22/3/16& Gippy brings tea & biscuits. Boot black cleans leggings & boots & actually wants to backsheesh but gets nix. Gippy reminds us that it is 7.30 tell him to get out. 8.00 he returns & again we refuse to take any notice 900 returns & still we stay in bed. 9.30 we get out & go to breakfast.
Go for row to the French  cruiser JAURIEGUIBERRY. A sailor show us all over & explains in French of course. I am able to understand some of it so three other soldiers accompany us  so as to make out what was what. Little they knew that what I did not understand, I put my own construction to & they thought me a good French scholar. Luckily I had no need to speak in French. This cruiser is bristling with guns & like all this nation's boats is high up & very powerfully built. Guns are beautifully balanced & are easily moved by turning a small wheel. See the wireless room down below, also the torpedoes lying on the floor like polished porpoises. Awful clammy heat.
Catch  the 6.30 back to Kantara & misery. Arrive there 7 pm so have to wait four hours for the puffing billy to leave
23/6/16Leave Hill40 for El Fedant which is said to be a good place. Have to camp outside Kantara for the night, so go for swim in the canal & then to sleep.
24/6/16Up 4am  & breakfast & leave at 5am. Arrive at El  Fedan 5pm & camp. This place (Rail head) is six miles out & is a dismal place.
