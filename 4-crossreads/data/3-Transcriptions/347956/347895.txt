<p>22.2.15</p>
<p>Mon 22nd<br/>Had to report to A Squadron again this morning &amp; heard that Jimmy Leask is to be made Corporal of A Sqd. &amp; I reckon he should be sent to A Sq &amp; learn the work straight away, as to keep me there taking his place for a week or two before he starts;  I got into a argument this morning for galloping my horse while on parade &amp; have been in a bad humor all day in consequence.  went nowhere after tea &amp; had nothing to do but tell tales</p>
