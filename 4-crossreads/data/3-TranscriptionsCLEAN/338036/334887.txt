 SOME SHRAPNEL 
 Very good incitement [?] this morning which however ended in one of our boys being a casualty.  As is customary every morn our Section does physical culture to keep fit & this morning we were on this routine in the courtyard when a Fritz plane came across & sighted us.  Consequently in about 1/2 hr (we were still at culture) whizzing over came a shell & we were soon on our stomach.  Never worried much - thought it was a stray & went on again why again - this time she burst in air not far away but we had taken every precaution & no one was hurt.  We then received orders to get inside the billets & the Hun kept us his shrapnel all the morning.
