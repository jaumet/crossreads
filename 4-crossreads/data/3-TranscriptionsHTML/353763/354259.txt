<p>The scene on the pier at 6 pm is most animated &ndash; officers rejoining their ships &ndash; liberty men going off &ndash; Native Fijians &amp; Samoans leaving the ships after their day's work  -  Women &amp; children galore  -  Everyone jolly &amp; chirpy &amp; in the highest of spirits laughing &amp; talking &amp; jesting  -  Never has Suva had so many boats in its small harbor  -  There are 20 big ships in &amp; this means a good deal of trade for little Suva  -  I played bridge in the eveg &amp; to my bunk in the Companion way about 11 pm  -</p>
<p>I don't fancy any move will be made about our boat at present &ndash; bad as she is &ndash; we are here &ndash; alive &amp; fit &amp; the Admiral wont shift us &amp; all our stores while we can manage  -  After all we got to Rabaul &amp; to Suva &ndash; a bit leg weary &ndash; but we got there  -  The engineers are cleaning up boiler &amp; fittings  -  A lot of our chaps would like to go back to Sydney &amp; get out of the job &amp;</p>
