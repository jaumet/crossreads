Revielle at 6.30 as usual
Exercising in the morning as usual, I cleaned the old bus then went for a ride out into the desert with Chas we went for miles flat out it was great, the sand made not the slightest difference, its just like a huge carpet, we went in all about 8 miles out, lost our way but eventually got back, plugging through the sand was a bit of a "beastly bore" but got through in 5 minutes, after lunch the CO informed me that he met Alec in town yesterday expected him out today, at 5 pm we received a telegram stating that he would be here at 3 pm, I went up with a horse but he put in no appearance, expect him tomorrow. Lamp work at night.
Bed 9.30
