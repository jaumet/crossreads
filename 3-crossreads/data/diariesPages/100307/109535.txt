Had dinner with Mrs Eckelstein ? 3 courses in accordance with law. Afterwards adjourned to the lounge and chatted all evening meeting the sweetest little Roumanian girl of 16 ? Ella Coumsha the essence of daintiness. Her people fled via Russia Sweden England to here where she had previously been at school.

Offered to take any English letters direct there as a courier was just on the point of leaving. This girl speaks fluently French, German, Italian, Russian and some Spanish besides English and her own native tongue. Nations surrounded with others who speak a different language to themselves must become linguists. This girl from her babyhood had a French nurse as well as an English one and consequently commenced learning two extra tongues by the time she could toddle.
