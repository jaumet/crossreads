<p>All sorts of hearsay float about as to what&nbsp;is going to be done with us, but there is little that is definite at all. &nbsp;The Education Scheme seems to be taking a bit of shape, but being scattered like Pa&#39;s Cows, I don&#39;t know what our Unit is doing at all.</p>

<p>I hope you are all in the very best of health. &nbsp;I&#39;m O.K. with a bit of a cold, but plenty of Emulsion and a wee drop o&#39; rum to keep it in check. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fondest love to Dad Bess &amp; Lock,</p>
<p>Your loving Son James xxxxxx</p>
