6/2/18 Vilinghem
Turned out at 6.30 and at 7.30 rode down to Bde.H.Q.. A chilly morning with some drizzly rain. The country here is remarkably well wooded and closely timbered. Every little farm has its fields bordered by trees and its small copse and all the winding roads are hedge bordered. On arrival at BdeH.Q. I breakfasted with the General Paton who handed over the command and motored off to catch the 10 am boat at Boulogne. The headquarters are in a chateau or large two storied house. The owner is a Judge of the French Court who has a few other houses and does not reside here. It is remarkable how careless people on small units like this become. The personnel of Bde.H.Q. appear to be dirtier and more slovenly than any of the men in a Battn, Stewart acting as Staff Captain goes this morning to visit the 21st Battallion.
