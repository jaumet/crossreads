[Sunday 19 March 1916]
Today I went to a Coptic Church Service, really R.C.   The Priest wore a Silver Brocade!!! gown with Gold Tinsel (Poppy Pattern) & a Cowl or hood of same-Choir of boys, Incense was burnt & many candles  Music consisted of Cymbals & Triangles.  The boys mostly X eyed wore Red Plush Caps & had good voices- all Arabic.  All the (Bints) girls & women were in a Gallery with screen to hide them  Most gaudily painted with Doves etc & glass Candleabra on which the sparrows perched.Sing Song service, they never punctuate like in conversation only stop to take breath, & stare at us.  Towards the end, an interpreter butted in with enclosed translation in bad English & I had to thank them   Communion was held & I brought 1 cake home.After Service the priest fed us on Quail Pigeon, Whisky Soda etc so we go next Sunday.
