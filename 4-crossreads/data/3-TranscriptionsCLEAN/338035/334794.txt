military duty.Received full particulars of an offensive by French and British which commenced on 1st July.Went to bed about 9 and knew no more until about 9 next morning.
Tuesday 11thWhen I awoke it was to see A Section boxes from the Argyllshire who had come into camp last night.  They seem to have fared better than us on ship.Was detailed to unload some of our medical stores with seven others and that occupied the best part of day.  During the time however we chatted to some of the "Tommies" and got on very well.  Met some [indecipherable] and changed my cap cover with one.To night Rupert Dick Gates, Scotty Maxwell & others of the "Hororata" which we had missed for some time came up to see us.  They had come via the Suez Canal and got here a couple of weeks ago.  They had just been to London and told us of the good things in store there.
Wednesday 12thCommenced work again in earnest.  The place calls to mind happenings of the front when we here hear the tremendous reports when the Artillery are practising and the aeroplanes flitting overhead.It is also very noticeable that a good deal of transport in Camp is done
