6 p.m. (?) & have been slogging along all day without any drink for the horses - in the 12 hours today we have covered about 22 miles - many horses absolutely 'pulled right out" & an occasional gallon of water had to be given them out of our emergency ration to keep them going.
But Thank God after 36 hours without watering & covering 32 miles on a bad desert track very heavy going - we have reached a good waterhole & I though they would never stop dinking all had a good feed of corn barley & bran & little chaff & they are very quiet now
While we halted at midday 2 armoured cars of the RNAS Cars [Transcriber's note: cars of the Royal Navy Armoured Car Division]
