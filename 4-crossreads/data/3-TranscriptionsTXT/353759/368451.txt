 127   April 25 One entry only - Yesterday received in letters from home one from Geoff in answer to one I sent him from Longueval &hellip; and he doesn"t agree with what I wrote.  Well I didn"t expect him to and may in this week write to the dad to advise him to let him come away. 
 128   April 26 Yesterday morning parade at 9 a.m. and the morning filled in at Y.M.C.A. and about the camp &ndash; then building in at end of Marquee stage for the night"s concert.  The afternoon at 1 p.m. fell in, and marched to Albert &ndash; 4 miles for a bath.  Dinner in three "Swiss Cottage" tents &ndash; soup, Rabbit and sauce &ndash; Mutton and Beans &ndash; Dumpling and Custard &ndash; jelly and custard.  Mess arranged in two long lines of tables &ndash; candlelight by candles every 3 feet.  The concert good &ndash; in parts.  George Ballard singing far and away above remainder of programme.  Two sisters from 5th Army Operating Centre, between Capts. Lee and Hunt made several anxious moments for a lot of us when "Humouresque" was the item.  If they hadn"t been there, I think it would have gone far better &hellip; that Antiphonean wit &ndash; loud and inconsequent so typical of the Army, and but absolutely impersonal would have without doubt filled half the programme. 
 Monday we were relieved from Hermies.  The last happening there was the terrible wreckage of the bodies of an anti-aircraft crew.  The shell must have landed directly alongside and the whole of the gun crew, in [indecipherable] at the time were blown to pieces.  We moved their bodies in blankets to a nearby quarry.  Even for some time after he"d got the gun the Boche was still fielding for it &hellip; and at artillery he shines, there his courage and heroism is real and mighty.  The way he counterattacked early after Hermies, the way he fought in the taking of Hermies shewed his real courage.  It"s dead everywhere &ndash; half of whom had tried the "Merry [indecipherable]" stunt. 
 The 33rd R.A.M.C. relieved us &ndash; they"ve been out of the line the last six months. 
 Marched from Lebonquire to Bapaume &ndash; the night in that city of horror and terror and off the next morning &ndash; marching to Pozieres straight along the Albert-Bapaume Road.  A cold night but a good sleep. 
 130 At Bapaume a mail &ndash; one from Gerald and papers Bulletins from the Dad.  Thomas Burke"s "Limehouse Nights" reviewed in Bulletin I must get.  At Pozieres three "Poetry Reviews" and "The Outpost" (Poems) and Tagore"s "Hungry Stones".  Read on the night of 24th "The Girl and the Farm" in bed and yesterday morning sent it home. 
 131   April 27 Wrote tonight to Violet Lancry, Phyllis &amp; Jack:  yesterday to Mother and in it advised her that as things stood it seemed the best thing for Geoff to be given his way.  Sorry after I"d posted letter I"d not put it as I did. 
 Cold and windy.  Fatigues filling shell holes.  Kit inspection and the usual Military advice on differences &ndash; if you can"t make them up honourably then make them up dishonestly.
