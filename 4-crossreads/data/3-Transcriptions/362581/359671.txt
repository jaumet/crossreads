<p>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>Received Mother's letter with yours of Sept 1st-3rd   &amp;  was very sorry to hear you had been ill again. Hope you are quite well again, now the warm weather will be there is may be better for you.<br/>It is horribly cold   &amp;  the frost to-day is fearful. My poor feet  &amp;  hands are awful. Hope you are quite well now. Fondest love  &amp;  kisses . From Auntie Eadle</p>
