9 Very quiet night, took advantage and had a splendid snore. 13th Battn inlying Picquet to day. Turned out very hot and dusty. 2nd Division under General Godley makeing preparations out on the left for new offensive movement. Turks appear to have got noises in their heads tonight as they kept up a pretty heavy machine gun fire. Of course our guns reply occasionally to keep them company.
Stand to arms at 3.10 this morning. Fireing became very brisk along the whole front expecting an attack from the enemy but after waiting to accomadate him it never came off. Our 15th Reinfts arrived this morning with the exception of 8 men who were wounded coming ashore. Fierce fighting between our Warships and Forts at Kilid- Bahr this afternoon. H.M.S Lord Nelson done some splendid shooting. Turks anti-aircraft guns try hard to bring one of our aeroplanes down this evening but failed. There are great numbers of dead Turks lying in front of our lines, stench from them very bad. Things much quieter to night. Both sides must have wasted an enormous amount of ammunition today.
