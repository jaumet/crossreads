<p>to supply any reinforcements whatever, the 120 per month, before mentioned, being the sum total required from Australia.  We have the 5th May casualties now complete.  There are many 20th's  I can shew you the list (which is a departmental one) any time you care to see it.<br/>Yesterday, amongst other, we had news of<br/>Lieutenant PORTEUS J.R. of 20th K/i/a. on 23/5/16.  Address, Hamilton, N/castle.  Next of kin, - Mrs I. PORTEOUS.<br/>There is no doubt that the 5th Brigade is in some particularly difficult position, for their casualties are out of proportion to other Anzac Units in France.  It may be coincidence, but I think it is a case of "good Brigade &ndash; important post"</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>Wm. J. Sherbon<br/>We had news this am. that 7 N.C.O's &amp; men of 20th who had been reported 'missing', are now <u>"unofficially"</u> (?) known to be Prisoners of War.</p>
