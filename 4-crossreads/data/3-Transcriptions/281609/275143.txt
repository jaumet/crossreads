<p>the line until 15th Jan 1917.<br/>8 pm Our artillery has opened out again.<br/>3rd Misty. The ground has again become soft owing to the absence of frost last night, however it is not so bad as before. Preparations are being made to temporarily disband this unit. First batch of 12th Brigade left at 6 pm to rejoin their battalions. Our artillery is very active now shells are screaming through the air from both sides. I shall be glad when we get out of this, tho' it will make no difference if I have to return to the Pioneers. I am doing my best to remain with Capt Walsh until we reform &ndash; Then I intend making application for a transfer to the 4th Div Train. Capt Walsh wants to promote me but cannot do so unless it comes through my battalion. He spoke to Lieut Merrifield about it, who said he would do his best to push it through. I don't believe him for I know he has no love for me.<br/>This is a replica of General Cox's message in his Special order of the day dated 2.12.16</p>
