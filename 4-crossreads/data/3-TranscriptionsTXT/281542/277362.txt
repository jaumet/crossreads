 Am not feeling my real self.  A lackadaisical feeling percolates me from head to foot, my head is very hot &amp; has a dull pain.  Towards evening I felt better but had a restless night.  I have received no mail except first 3 letters from Mum Dad &amp; Mabel (1 each).  It is very disheartening  despite  all the more so when I have been so attentive to my mail to home. 
 I have a very great repulsion to going sick as I have great hopes with regard to my present position.
