 For a long time now , the men at Wareham have been veri discont , and there have been grow sign of an open mutini , the head , did not seem to care whether there was troubl or not , until it came , then from what we can hear , thing were live and a consider amount of damag was done . " I believ that the Militari polic raid a " Two up " school . and one of the player was knock down and Injure by one of the hors . the mob then went mad , and raid the Polic headquart went everywher look for M.P.s raid one of the Canteen , then a lot of them board a train and went to Pool to smash the polic forc there , for sometim to come an M.P. will not be safe unless arm . Officer and men were sent from this camp to help quiet the mob . but how thing are now we have not heard yet . I would not be surpris if troubl break out in this Depot ere long the ration shortag is like to caus troubl as well as the fact that no leav is grant from this camp .
