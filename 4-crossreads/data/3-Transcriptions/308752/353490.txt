<p>Just about time too,  three days under such conditions was rather long. You should have seen the way we moved when we knew we were going back.  It amuses me these pictures in the Sydney mail etc. &ndash; note the eager look in the faces of the men as they go towards the Line to deal with the enemy, but you should have seen us when we knew were were relieved.
