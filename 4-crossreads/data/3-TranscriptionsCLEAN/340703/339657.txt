  
 October 1916 Sunday 29 Went out per camel towards Temple of Hibis in Kharga Oasis. 91/2 miles. Did not get to Temple but saw the remains of an ancient cottage. Started to get dark, so the officers wanted to get back. Quite dark before arriving in camp. Journey 21/2 hours each way on rotten camel.
