<p>Weather fine.  Hun planes over in dozens.  One of our baloons down in flames, Major Olding, down in wagon line, stirring things up.  A big stunt coming off on the 25 inst. Anzac day.</p>
<p>23-4-1917<br/>Another fine day.  A village in front of our lines heavily shelled 5.9 high explosive.  18 teams going to Bty. with ammunition.  The stunt for the 25 inst. is now postponed till 29.  Generals Coxon and Walker in lines.  Everything wrong.  Three horses sent to mobile Hospital.  Terrific bombardment all night.  The enemy attacked using gas.  We drove them back.  One of our guns knocked out.  Crew evacuated before this happened, Hun still shelling about 150 over.</p>
