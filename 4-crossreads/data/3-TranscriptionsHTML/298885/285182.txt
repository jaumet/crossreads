<p>Dec 26th &ndash; 17<br/>Well re this Xmas dinner which I mention a few days ago.</p>
<p>It was a splendid success and one not to be forgotten by all who were partakers.  The fact which added 75% to our success was our great luck to be situated in such a position which is not only quiet but afforded every convenience such as to help the committee to leave no stone unturned in their arrangements</p>
<p>Well on Xmas Day our mess hut soon showed signs of festivity as by the aid of willing hands</p>
