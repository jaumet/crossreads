<p>Parody.<br/>Boys of Carmichaels Band</p>
<p>At your request I'll do my best<br/>To slander all the boys<br/>Tis partly true and yet forsooth<br/>To tell it often annoys<br/>Les Bowra might resort to fight<br/>You know how quick he flares<br/>And only Bill can keep him still<br/>There's nobody else that dares</p>
<p>Boys of Carmichael's Band<br/>While one of us can stand<br/>Harmer, Mendel, Snow &amp; Dave<br/>Will fight as one on the land or on the wave<br/>And even Dope will have to leave his clue<br/>And Scott to Longueville say goodbye<br/>Sail away to France to make the Germans dance<br/>To the tune of the Rifle Band</p>
<p>Charlie make a hasty break<br/>To overlook the shop<br/>Harry play his trichord</p>
