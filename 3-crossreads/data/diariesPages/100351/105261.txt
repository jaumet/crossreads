Struck water Camp. From "Gordon Dump" to Trenches in Petrol tins. All along we passed evidences of last night’s fray. Dead & dying every where. Stretcher bearers hurrying past with bloody stretchers & wnd. figures. Sickening horrors in the trenches Germans & our own dead uncovered. One man of ours blew himself & mate up with Mills bomb in pocket. Phosforus & stink fare use to a horrible headache & I lost all interest in the war. A’fternoon we dug shelves & with Equip on & W’proof sheets over us spent the night in fear & trembling. Shelling fierce.
