<p>313<br/>Added to collection of 'minor" Cartoons of the war, Signaller Ellis Silas"s "Crusading at Anzac, 1915", not a bad little collection &ndash; interesting to us.  One question it inspires:  who <u>did</u> invent the word Anzac.  General Sir Birdwood says he did, and General Sir I. Hamilton said Silas did, by brazenly putting the five full stops.  Who is right, Birdwood or Hamilton.</p>
<p>314  Nov. 7<br/>Moved today to new quarters, self found.  Alf got in the key of the old small shack, and the old Col."s room, Jake and self commandeered:  it"s like Heaven (in our old sloth at home, as a matter of fact).  How long we"ll manage to keep good our claim depends on how long we keep quiet, and how long it takes for authority to find a use for them.  It was a case of "If yer know of a better 'ole, get to it":  we did &ndash; and found quite a representative collection of La Vie Parisian and the Spectator &ndash; the two papers mixed and the Spectator looking quite small with the experience.</p>
<p>315  Nov. 9<br/>Letters from home last night and two from Commonwealth bank, London &ndash; one that &pound;10 had been received by cable to my account &ndash; simply means another cable and irritation here and at home, if they"d only done as I asked in June by letter, there"d have been no trouble.  Leave in Blighty with &pound;10 &ndash; ye Gods:  suppose they think I"m going to spend it in Bristol quietly browsing architecturally, with the Hadleys.  Maleish:  tomorrow goes forth another cable &ndash; repeat Tenner.</p>
<p>316<br/>Saw V. again tonight:  talks of something particularly choice in Rosetti &ndash; in one of his translations from the Italian Poets &ndash; Swinburne she referred to somewhat back as "very choice" and I"ll swear "Dolores" was on her mind.</p>
<p>317  Nov. 11<br/>Home mail &ndash; next one sunk in Mediterranean &ndash; letters from home and amongst others Mr. Curtin and Hazel.  Mr. Curtin"s very short and very sad &ndash; "My Harry"s real pal", is his postscript.</p>
<p>315<br/>Comes back from Blighty Syd &ndash; with J."s photographs &amp; guide books galore.</p>
<p>Will Dyson has been attached to the A.I.F. as war Artist.</p>
<p>319<br/>Finished on last night of C. lines existence, Balzac"s "Eugenie Grandet".  The one other of his I"ve read is "Honorine"  &ndash; a comparatively short tale.  Grandet is a finely written character, but prefer Nanon to her, even though a minor character.  Eugenie is fine, tragic in her wonderful sacrifice of nationality, and theatrical nowhere.  Lent the book to Harry.</p>
<p>320<br/>About the middle of Sept. gave to J. "Jude the Obscure" and he"s still sticking it.</p>
<p>321<br/>There was something supremely inimical in yesterday afternoon"s happenings.  Place Jeff in my place, self in Jake"s, and the same thing happened at both Marseille repeatedly and here in Boulogne.  Almost identically the positions were the same, and the result? &ndash; well different:  insomuch as I know J. too well to carry the likeness to the end.</p>
<p>322<br/>Jonas &ndash; yarning the other morning with him, promised if he could to get me a special permit for the Tate gallery "closed owing to the war".  His brother, an artist, and according to him, greater than Branguin, a follower of the Classic schools with a slight shading of Symbolism and Impressionism, and a caring man.</p>
<p>If possible must see while in Blighty the Tate, parts of the National, the Elgin Marbles, and the Assyrian Court and the furniture in the Victoria and Albert.</p>
<p>323  Nov. 14<br/>Nov. 12 &ndash; specialling with E &ndash; transferred in morning to No. 14, stationary with mumps.  If I"d known he had mumps I"d have slept with him &ndash; and got a transfer to England and been cut off the strength.</p>
<p>Jake and self had now as we"ve never had</p>
