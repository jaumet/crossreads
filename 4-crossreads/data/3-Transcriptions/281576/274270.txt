<p>Wed. Sept. 5.  The weather is glorious this last few days.  Nice blue sky &amp; plenty of sunshine.  We spent a quiet day, just cleaned up our billet &amp; finished for the day.  After Tea a combined A &amp; C section Team played B sec. at Baseball.  B sec. came second.  Stan Wright &amp; I walked into Roqueloire after Tea.  This afternoon the Engineers were experimenting with some new explosive for cutting wire.  If noise counts anything towards success, then it was certainly a great success, as it nearly deafened us.  Things are awfully slow, one hardly knows how to put in time.</p>
<p>Thurs. Sept. 6.  Did some washing this morning.  I  job I detest.  The weather is great.  Quite a treat to be alive.  Received  Letter from Mrs. S [indecipherable]  Bacup.  Heard today that Bill Lancaster was marked P.B. &amp; sent over to Blighty.  Lucky Beggar.</p>
<p>Fri. Sept. 7.  This morning the Div. Gas Officer gave a very interesting Lecture on the new Gas that Fritz is sending over.  We formed a square round the manure heap in the yard at H. Qtrs.  After the Lecture he gave us a Tin to smell at containing some chemical, so that we would recognise Fritz's Gas, if he sends any over our way.  It is very similar to the aroma of mustard.<br/>Received Letter &amp; very welcome Parcel from Mrs Sam, containing Cakes &amp;  Cigarettes. Quite a treat, &amp; we enjoyed Cake &amp; Tongue for Tea.  Wrote to Bacup.  Our Rugby Team played 5 Mac. Gunners &amp; won, 17 - 7</p>
