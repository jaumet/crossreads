22nd JanuaryNear Richon-Le-ZionWe had not been more than five days in that camp at Deiran when we got news that the camp had been condemned & we had to move.  Accordingly we came about 4 miles further on to the outskirts of Richon.
I had just got my home put up & drains dug around it when I got orders to take six time expired natives down to Rafa & bring their relief up, So I rode to the station with six natives on donkeys streaming
