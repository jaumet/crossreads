Whether they were always held in readiness or were prepared to go up at night I do not know but probably the latter.  Altogether I saw a huge number of lorries.  Another interesting sight is to see the barges on the canals for the conveyance of wounded They average about 36 patients each & go right down to Calais.  Steam barges do the towing also horses on the tow path & tis wonderful what progress they can make, they are of course an ideal carrier being so quite & steady. 
 Friday 7th July 1916 Had a very steady day.   a heavy shower or two greeted us during the day a thing we are getting accustomed to once more.  Had practice in wearing gas helmets during the afternoon & found them not half bad.  My chief trouble is the production of saliva which forms owing to having a mouth piece & I have to continually remove it from my mouth in order to swallow.
