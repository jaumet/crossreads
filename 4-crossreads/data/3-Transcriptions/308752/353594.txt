<p>coming back to this.   Another long miserable trip in the train, all day till 9.p.m., detrain at ------ and marched away to a camp. A most comfortable bed - one blanket on the ground, but why growl, "its a great life".  I was in lucks way the following morning as I was allowed to join a small party of men, who were returning to their Units.  Once a fellows leave is finished the sooner he gets back to his Unit the better - theres no place like home, (your own Unit I mean).   After walking about a mile we managed to obtain a lift in a lorry for about 7 miles to -----. All the country we passed through was in Fritz's hands before I started on Leave, so a wonderful Advance has taken place. German war material of every description could be seen in all directions. At 10 a.m. we arrived at another camp, &amp; receive instructions as to the where-abouts of our Units. Luckily for me, our Ambulance was only about 3 miles further on, &amp; I arrived there in time for dinner. On the road I called at our Div. Hd. Qrtrs. and called on Eric, he was looking as robust as ever. Every one remarked how well I was looking, evidently the holiday did me a lot of good.   A big mail welcomed me on my return, all my May Mail (which I had been waiting for so long) came to hand.</p>
<p>Cheers &amp; Good Luck.    Heaps of Love from Langford</p>
