  
 July 19th to July 22nd 10 a.m.   Four men were wanted to proceed immediately to one of our Advanced Dressing Stations about 2 miles away, towards the Trenches. I volunteered & was accepted. At mid-day arrived at our new quarters. I can safely say without contradiction that I have been under shell fire. At 4 p.m. a number of shells burst not far from us, a distance from two to three hundred yards, too close to be pleasant. There are number of guns concealed around us & the Germans are evidently trying to hit them, it is hard to catch them napping, the guns were only placed here a few days ago & almost immediately the enemy knew of it. A chap has just been brought in is sitting by my side, poor devil, his whole body is shaking, one would think he was shivering with the cold.  His nerves must be shattered. 
 10 p.m. News just came through that the Australians have taken two lines of trenches & captured a number of prisoners. A small batch of German prisoners just been marched by. About a dozen were brought in to our dressing station to have their wounds dressed. Their clothes I noticed were in good conditions. Number of Australian wounded keep coming in. 2 a.m. Orders to move off to the trenches to do our bit, all very anxious to be in the "Straffe" (If we only knew)    The Sergeant in charge of the party took the wrong road, & we did not arrive at the other dressing station till about 3:30 a.m. Was very tired, no sleep. The sky looked beautiful, one mass of light & star-shells etc. & the booming of guns etc. was deafening. We had to start stretcher bearing immediately.   I was working all that day, 36 hours altogether. The sight at the Dressing Station was terrible, hundreds of wounded men were lying about, some of them not recognisable, they were so shattered & covered in blood. The bearers carried these men after being looked at by the doctor, to the Motor Ambulances, about 3/4 mile away. The noise of the guns
