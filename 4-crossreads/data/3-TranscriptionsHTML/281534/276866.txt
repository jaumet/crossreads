<p>8/3/19 Marcinelle<br/>Went to the 22nd. And 24th. but there was nothing unusual so returned to Bde. at 11 a.m. to find the General returned from his Rhineland excursion and we discussed affairs of State until a late hour. Took a tram after lunch to Marchienne au Pont and went to 7th. Bde H.Q. where I saw the Baroness. The mess is nothing less than a baronial hall, deep oak panels armour coats of arms and an enormous open fire place carved. Souvenirs from China where a member of the family once was Belgian ambassador. To a doctor's house nearby with Colonel Davis. With his charming daughter  &amp; wife we drank coffee &amp; champagne the latter in honour of Davis' birthday. Mais ils sont salle &ndash; les Belges! After mess teased little Les &amp; Simone chez eux.</p>
