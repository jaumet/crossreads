8/11/17 Paris
of the Sacre Coeur. It was not the best of days for a birdseye view but better than last visit here. The whole city lies spread below and strange to say it is from this distant place that one receives the best idea of the grandeur of the Eiffel Tower. This enormous church itself, with its Oriental looks, does not appeal to me much. Inside a service started, a priest leading recitation of the Rosary. Now passed down the long stairs that lead from this high hill. Near the bottom sits a dirty long grey haired old man with a cockatoo ? he was there last time and apparently does not move all day. What an existence! Took tube at Les Abbesses back to the Opera and went down to Brentanos for a book. Where is there a street to match Avenue de l?Opera? From Tuileries came by tube back to the hotel. The Paris tube is wonderful and today and yesterday has carted me many miles from one end of Paris to the other.
