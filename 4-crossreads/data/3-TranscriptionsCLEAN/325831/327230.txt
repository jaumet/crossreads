Dear mother,
Thousands of letters! Battalions panting rumours are falling over each other in their endeavours to convey sheafs of correspondence, to their rightful owners. Order is gradually developing from chaos, & 'All's well with the world'.
The photographs were scented with the breath of HOME, wattle, petrol launches & other things that make life worth the living. They sorted themselves out before my eyes till I could see, very dimly I'll admit, a moving picture show of the whole picture. You were just a little nervous of the launch weren't you? & what a lazy little devil Geo is when firewood is the order of the day.
By dint of careful thought I have managed to sort them out in their proper order.
