<p>about my illness  &amp; about Laurel going to Queensland.  &amp; that was the first I've heard about her going there. I have not even heard from her mother &amp; I'm sure she would have written as soon as she heard of my illness, so you see dear how letters must go astray.<br/>I was indeed very sorry to hear about poor Billy going west. While I was in France I saw thousands  &amp; thousands of dead  &amp; dying  &amp; got so used to it that I never used to worry at all but how different one feels when you learn of one of your own pals going under. Why dear it very nearly made me cry. I do feel so sorry for his mother too.<br/>Of course dear it is very nice to hear you have sent me a parcel &amp; much nicer if I <u>do</u> get it. It's just one big game of chance. I have received three so far, two from Lol &amp; one from Doris but if I don't receive it, it is absolutely no use making enquiries. But anyway Sis I heartily thank you for sending it not only for what it may contain but for such kind &amp; thoughtful</p>
