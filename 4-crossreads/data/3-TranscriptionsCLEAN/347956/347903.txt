Sun 28thA record attendance at Church this morning & Col Plaine preached a rattling good sermon;  Stan has had a sore throat & was not on parade yesterday or Friday but is OK again thanks to my Lungkura it cured both him & I
Stan received a pass this afternoon & has gone to Cairo & I am putting the afternoon in scribbling;  I lost the top of my pen a few weeks ago & the nib has been twisted about every way & is not much good now   Went to Luna park after tea with Butter & Cameron
