In spite of their potatoless day in England we seem to manag to have them near everi day here . Our mess cook is an expert and out of respect for his culinari skill we are keep him out of the stunt and not send him over the bag . The even was quiet balmi and the men had a concert under Alderson 's direct . The doctor and I walk up and down talk about thing in general and the War and it way in particular . A smell of gas was notic in the air probabl due to a few gas shell be thrown about . The gun flash were vivid more than usual tonight . The 21st 23rd move up and took over the fire line ? we follow the day after tomorrow and it seem onli too possibl that they are go to march us right from here to [indecipherable] .
