 The Templ of the Sphinx . I went to the templ of the Sphinx : it was with emot that I survey the marvel collonad of granit pillar , the alabast pavement , with it nich where onc the statu of the great one stood ? and around me walk and chatter the khaki-clad Australian accept with characterist flippanc the whole scene . What a strang contrast in peopl ! Could Pharoah walk in this land today , what would he think of us . The men that rear these templ and pyramid were not a flippant race ? they were a race of giant , and their monument will endur when our race is as the dust of their moulder templ : The Sphinx will smile inscrut over Egypt as ever when we are forgotten . The Sphinx is wonder . Its bodi and limb crumbl into dust . Its face with it queer half smile and wide open eye stare over the love land of fertil Egypt to where gold in the set sun set like a jewel in the green the minaret town of Cairo drows in the haze . The great Kaliph are long dead and dust in their state tomb ? but the glamour of Egypt is the same to-day as when Cleopatra 's barg swept with silken sail over the bluegreen water of the Nile . Below on the shadi road rove the endless khaki process of the son of a new and older world . ( Jack Sommer . )
