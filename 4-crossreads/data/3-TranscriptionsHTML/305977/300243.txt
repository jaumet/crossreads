<p>at Brigade HQrs, but weren't wanted till 10 pm.  There was a lot more shrapnel &ndash; several men of the 4th LH were killed &amp; wounded.  The guard which consists of 24 men &amp; an officer of the  2nd LH Brigade &amp; the same number of NZealanders embarked on a trawler at 1 pm &amp; got away from Anzac at <u>8 am Saturday 31st</u>.  We reached Imbros Is about noon &amp; found a fine harbour with several supply ships cruisers, battleships monitors (3 of the latest pattern with 14 in guns) &amp; a couple of destroyers.  There is a lot of activity here &ndash; thousands of Tommies.  We marched round to Genl HQrs &amp; got donkies to carry our packs.  We were issued with new clothes, burnt our old ones &amp; had a good swim.  There is plenty of fresh water here, so after a good wash &amp; new clothes we all felt new men again.  Turned in early for a good sleep</p>
