5-7-1918Last evening at 9-15 the Germans opened a barage on our front line, and come over in squads of a hundred.  They were cut to pieces.  Our casualties were light, 15 killed.  This morning at day-break Fritz counter-attacked, most of his men would not come over.  He again failed.  Some heavy shells fell 50 yards in front of our guns, and a lot of smaller ones fell about the Bty.  No casualties.  Our planes are about in large numbers.
