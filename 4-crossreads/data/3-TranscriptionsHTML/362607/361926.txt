<p>Dear Dad,<br/>This is the old  Village Church. I was asked to play the organ for a service but I could not manage the honts &amp; a'mens &amp; all the little sponses of the C of England without practise, so I had to decline with thanks. I had a strum on the organ but it is only an American one. I was looking at the  Decorations for Harvest Testimonial &amp;  gained some idea  of the fruit that is growing in this district. T<br/>This is one of the poorest parts of England. All the land is chalky here abouts &amp; only patches are in cultivation. Of course Wiltshire Bacon is noted everywhere. This Kirk is in the main village street, High St. there is a Holy Berry Tree growing in the yard.  Harry</p>
