<p>My dear Mr Garling</p>
<p>You will see by the above we are still in Alexandria this delay and waiting about is getting on every bodies nerves we get very little news of any kind but they seem to have forgotten there is such a thing as an Ammunition Column to draw both men and horses from in our Brigade they are taking them from reinforcements first from Australia left us out altogether both officers and men but still they are keeping us up to full strength and equipment if any goes wrong with our men or horses the man is sent to hospital and immediatly replaced with the horses they are replaced by mules. Our men didn't like having to take mules in fact we had some trouble of it we got over them somehow and they are taking quite kindly to</p>
