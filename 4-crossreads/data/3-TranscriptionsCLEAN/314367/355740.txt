patients - I sent 3 to Hospital at once - The men want better food - meat - potatoes & onions - D. commandeered 4 bullocks the other day & had them served out to the Fleet & we got some - Cold beef & beer - One didnt talk - You just ate & drank - D. will kill every bullock in the island if he can get hold of it & quite right too - I would in his place - However the Eastern has meat on her & we'll do for a bit anyway -I've been rereading your letters & thinking - my life with all these devil may care men & their joy at fighting & drinking & their lovely language & views on life - It's about as rollicking, jolly a life as a man could have under discipline - Cheeriness is the one thing demanded of a man - Blood will flow like water this year but none of the men mind it - Our crew wd cheerfully shoot-bayonet or be bayonetted & enjoy getting the chance to kill or be killed - The officers must be with them & all go in together - That's all they want - If they could get a good feed & beer after it none wd be happier -
