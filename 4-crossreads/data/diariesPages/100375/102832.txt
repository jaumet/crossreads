Versailles is twelve miles from Paris. After returning from Versailles we went to the "Follies Bergeres" as we had often heard of this music hall from others who had visited Paris previous to us. It turned out to be a low down show where loose women congregate. As you enter the hall there you find small tables with chairs just as in any ordinary caf. There the men and girls sit drinking liquor. Passing through to the end one comes to the show proper There, there is a promenade circling the hall and you can walk about and view the play at the same time. The play was in French so that we did not understand much of what was going on but I found great interest in studying the crowded hall. We went into the promenade, and frequently we were accosted by nice looking young women, but with a warning ringing in our ears we were proof against their blandishments. Another side of human life was being shown to us in all its hideousness
