<p>the period of 18 months &amp; same structure only got whitewashed ones, if this is what the Comandant calls " ,,disinfection".  I give credit the man in charge of Urinals &amp; Closets (Internees) whitewashed same allmost weekly.  The Military had also the posts of the Barb Wire fence whitewashed at least ones per month.  Re the Canteen proffits being used for the benefitt of Internees in providing Recreation &amp; the health generally, I also call a false Statement, as all recreation inside the German Consentration Camp has been payd for out of a  ,, fund" the Capital has been gathered by collectiones right throughout the Camp.  So not a penny of the Canteen proffits has aidet us in any of our Recreationes up till November 1916.  The manual labor for recreation purposses wher all voluntary.  Ones a Cinematograph Machine hawing presented to the Camp, from a Charitable American Socity all Manual labor in erecting Screen &amp; Operating House &amp; seating acomodationes.  All wher voluntary labor the Material mostly all rough Bushtimbers.  The Operator wher payd at first 1 shilling per day out of Camp funds, however later on account of several Camp buisnesses (Private Concerns) advertised on the screen twice weekly for wich they payd 2/6 per <strike>week</strike> month, enabled the Operator to do without the Wages payd out of Camp funds.  Re the buying of  ,, comforts".  The only comfort to our knowledge has been a Mosquito Net of the size of 7 feet by 3 feet to every internee in Camp during the month</p>
