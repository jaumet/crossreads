  
 In the Field 10/5/18 
 W. Garling Esq 
 Sir I have been Chaplain with the 10th A.F.A. Bde for the past two years but for the last three months I have been in England.  On my return here I am taking the liberty of sending you a word of sympathy on the loss of your son who was my friend.  During the last year we had seen a great deal of one another and like everyone else I had learnt to appreciate his splendid character.  I do not suppose there was a more justly popular officer in this Divisional Artillery & it is heart breaking to think that his upright manly character is lost to the world. May you be sustained in your great sorrow.  His life may have been short but during it he has enriched many other lives.  Personally I shall carry a very grateful memory of him all my days. 
 Yours v. Sincerely 
 A.H. Stevenson, Chaplain (attached) 10th A.F.A. Bde.
