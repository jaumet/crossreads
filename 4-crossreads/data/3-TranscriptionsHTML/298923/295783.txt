<p>27 April 1918 Saturday<br/>Our 60 lbs Howitzers V Krupp all the morning.<br/>Madeba Troop got in with 3 Horses killed 3 men wounded.<br/>Rumours that we are really to be relieved soon but no leave yet for me- "<strike>Many pity women who knew it all before you" &amp; is rough on the wife.</strike><br/>We got a 28 bore Shotgun but cartridges are loaded with shrapnel bullets so not much use on Partridge-   The men use shrapnel to play marbles with after a scrap has scattered some about, splendid ammunition for Shanghais</p>
