last Thursday but spent most of my time washing & feeding & did not have time to go out to Zietoun where I believe they are.
I saw Mrs. Lethbridge & had a yarn, she looks so well.  Dr. is going OK I hear.
They don't allow any but officers in Shepherds or the Oriental now, the snobs.
My love to Graham & the Boss & Mac & all at Culzean & specially yourself.
Yours as everJim Wilkie
