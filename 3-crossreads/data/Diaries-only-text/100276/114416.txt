down quite plainly if the timing of the fuse is a little slow you can hear them hit the soft ground with a thud dig right in they are fairly harmless then for you have time to get away from them but I dont like those that burst in the air or percussion, for they are very dangerous, would you believe it these bombs weigh no less than 180 lbs so you can imagine what kind of a row was on especially when you add "Aerial torpedoes" (a very dangerous weapon) hand bombs rifle grenades on top of this a few howitzer's, its wonderful how men escape from being exterminated
