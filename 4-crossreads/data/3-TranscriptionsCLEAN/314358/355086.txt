4There will be much for all of us to do even if it is in the peaceful latter years instead of the impulsive firey days of youth.
Australians all make the discovery that their own dear land is best of all and they seem to have great love for their homes.
Measured against other troops I have seen the Australians are splendid men in rugged strength and vigor.
The free life they live has given them such a bold reckless spirit that I really doubt if there is anything else in the [man?] line which will make so fine a fighter
