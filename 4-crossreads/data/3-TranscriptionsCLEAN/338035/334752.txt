 Tuesday 9th A fresh wind sprang up in early hours of day & by sunrise a choppy sea tossed the boat very considerably.  This continued all day & night and it was extremely difficult not only to keep erect on occasions but at meal times the cutlery, plates, etc. used to run all over the ship.  We also shipped a considerable amount of water.  During the day two lectures were given by Capt. Vicars and the contents of Field Pannier No. 2 exhibited.  Just here it might be as well to state that contents of Field Pannier No. 1 consisted of drugs including phenacetin, castor oil, Pot Bromide, digitilone mag. sulph. boric acid, vaseline, lysol, iodiform, chloroform, cocaine, chloridine, morphia, strictynine, Pot permang., sodi bicarb sticks of silver nitrate and surgical instruments including 6 artery forceps, 2 large scissors, scapulas, directors, needles, cat-gut, silk, bonesaw & dental outfit. Tablets including quinine and most of above drugs, notebook & specification tallies [?] copying pencils, lamp and candles, catheters etc., thermometers, bowl and pestle for mixing, sterilizer & lamp, carbolic acid
