<p>30.3.15<br/>Tue. 30th.  This morning we went out with our dinners on the desert;  &amp; the troops were put on trench digging.  I was holding horses &amp; had a good spell lying in the shade of the horses.  The day was very warm, &amp; we had our share of dust as usual.  We arrived back in camp soon after 3.30, &amp; enjoyed a good tea;  went nowhere after tea &amp; wrote to Jennie Sanson.  Heard tonight that we are to teach our horses to swim next Friday, Sat. &amp; Sunday.</p>
