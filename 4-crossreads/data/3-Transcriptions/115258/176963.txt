<p>was going in the week or so&nbsp;I was up there before the drawing man came, and I reported it to the <s>Adgt</s> Adjutant at the time and a guard was put on it afterwards. I am also posting one each to Aunt Katie and Mardie. In a letter to Father a week or so ago I mentioned posting him a Kai Ora Coo-ee news which gives us the war news - very warm here now. Unfortunately the copy I had was pinched, but there was not much in it that you would not see at home. I&#39;ll try and post another one along later. There was an article on the Dust of Jericho in the first issue I was sending you which was very good - but you may have seen it as I think it was published also in the Sydney papers. Best love Mother dear</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
