<p>brains of the "heads" of our affairs. St Roch station being heavily shelled &amp; I spotted 8 men of the Bde. lying out killed.<br/>Most of our air bomb casualties we caused when the men were coming along the streets with their packs. A bomb also came through the roof of the hospital. No wonder we get this bombing &amp; shelling when they march the whole brigade in column of fours into Amiens in broad daylight with bands playing right in view of the enemy airmen.</p>
<p>Fri Apr 12th:-<br/>Moved by train from St Roch Stn this morning &amp; moved</p>
<p>Through Doullens &amp; St Pol to Hazebrouck.<br/>After a wait on the roadside we received orders to move forward towards Fritz wherever he might be &amp; no one seemed to know. The road is a continuous stream of transports moving back with all the stores they can hold &amp; detached parties of "Tommies" who have become lost, stolen or strayed.<br/>Can't get anything intelligent out of them though they swear that every Jerry possesses a machine-gun. Seems to me that the whole damn lot are more intent on getting back than getting up. They'll make a good advance guard &ndash; for the civilian's retreat.</p>
