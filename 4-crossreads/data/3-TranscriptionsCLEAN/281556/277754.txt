I was sleeping on hand grenades some of ours & some of Fritz's in the dark I thought them only stones & the place was literally strewn with shrapnel shell cases & dud shells & such a plowed up mess. These were some of Fritz's trenches where he had been excellently been dug in with 50ft funk holes, passages, beds, electric lighting, cupboards, stores, & chairs; besides other homely conveniences too numerous to detail.
Had parade later, 9am. & practiced puting up wire entanglements
