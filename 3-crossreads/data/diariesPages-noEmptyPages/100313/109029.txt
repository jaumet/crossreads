5/1/18 London ? Penzance
The country is looking far greener than France. Had a quick run to Taunton and enjoyed pretty scenery through Somerset and Devon. The train tore along at a good speed and though very smooth running, it gave me the usual nausea. About 6 p.m. pulled into Penzance and took a chariot to the Queens Hotel which is on the esplanade. A cold dark night with the tide dashing in. The Hotel seems a good and comfortable one and not too many other people staying here. Dined well and noticed no lack of food, washed the meal down with some excellent claret. A few other diners all in dress clothes and mostly elderly people. Did some writing after dinner and then turned in early lulled to sleep by the waves dashing up against the esplanade. Everything is spotless and clean at this Queens Hotel.
