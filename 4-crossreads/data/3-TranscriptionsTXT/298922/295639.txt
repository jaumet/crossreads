 Thursday 6 December 1917 
  Spent today on Malta. Dolly bought 2/10/- worth of Handmade Lace.   We visited the Cathedral of St. John a beautiful place &amp; after went to the Palace where the Knights of St. John lived. I took tickets for the Opera TOSCA &amp; returned tired out.  It is no use trying to save any pennies so Boomly Busted &amp; Co.   A Torpedoe is on view here that did not explode rather interesting under the circumstances to us.
