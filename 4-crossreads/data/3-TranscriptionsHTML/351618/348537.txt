<p>simply delightful. There was a bit of shooting at our gun pit early in the evening. To-day I am in charge of guard over Prisoners. Not a pleasant piece of work. The guard has the worst part of it having to stand out in the sun etc and see they do their work.<br/>I have never seen such persistent flies as these Turkish breed. They settle in your bread and jam on your tea dixie mess tin &amp; stick like lice.</p>
<p>It is wonderful how callous one is now to the flying bullets &amp; the splashing shrapnel.</p>
<p>The strapping of our prisoners to the wheel was not a very enviable piece of work.<br/>Two female mules [?] belonging to some Turkish farmer wandered round behind our firing line &amp; seemed perfectly at home. The part round our Battery cook house seemed a very attractive [Indecipherable] to them.</p>
