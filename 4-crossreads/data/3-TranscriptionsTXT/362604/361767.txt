I had to fly out to Palmers Green to keep an appointment with Cyril Whitehead's Friends.  They were pleased to see me & extended every Hospitality which is typical of the British People now, if it was not so marked before the war.  I stayed over-night & had morning tea in bed, an unusual luxury.  I said Good-bye at 11 a.m. next morning
