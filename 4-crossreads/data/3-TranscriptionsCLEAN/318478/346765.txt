 Dear Mick 
 I've 'done me job' here and tomorrow I push out with four other ranks & Colonel Bruxner,  whom  portrayed in pencil last year, for Kantara, which is near Ismailia & Cairo that is home, & the base.  Amman & Salt must be left to some future date as I find that I am not the only weary man in the outfit. 
 I have a job to do at Kantara of the Field Ambulance work, very interesting and this and a week or so of camp life may do me good & leave me fit for the only two places still unrecorded by the Official Artist, after which Home! with four aitches. 
 Yours Again G.W. Lambert
