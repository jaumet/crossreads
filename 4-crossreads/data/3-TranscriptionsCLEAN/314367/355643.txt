  
 My SBA got a days pay stopped & 21 days leave - Serve him right - He's a degenorate - He lied right thro his explanation to the Commander - He'll go on to the Beach when we get back to Sydney - Another bluejacket was charged with a most serious offence - He entered the house of a German - Pulled down a flag & collared a pistol - He was drunk of course - He's remanded -Fitz had the whole ship's company aft & lectured the men severely - It's a few always who play the fool & cant behave themselves - They'll get scrubbed I can tell you in war time - 
 Sunday 27-14 - At 6 am F -  self & Gordon got a skiff & went to the beach & bathed - G & I had previously jumped from the gangway of the ship - I got some ferns & Chinese lantern (Hernandia) fruit - A very fine tree - Barringtonia with its square fruit grows here & some fine Screw pines but the Sea fringe is the true home of the Coco nut palm - Everything in the floral world yields pride of place to this glorious, beneficent palm. Humans, pigs, rats, crabs, beetles, flying foxes & other organisms look to it for sustenance & don't look in vain -
