 1918 Mon. 8th Apl. The routine here is as follows. No breakfast is supplied, but coffee ersatz is obtainable from the canteen at 15 phennigs a small cup. 
 Appel at 10 am.   All line up in the amusement hut and respond to the names when called by passing out and saluting the Hun camp-adjutant standing at his saluting-base in the porch. 
 Included in Karlsruhe's lager "visitors" at present are Brig. General Dawson &amp; staff (S. African forces.), some half-doz. colonels;  lesser lights to burn. 
 No naval men, &amp; I am the only Mercantile Marine man present.   (My dilapidated but well-cut "drag" &amp; it's once-gold braid are quite noticeable in this glittering but khakied assemblage.   Besides, it is smart to be dilapidated here;  one  must  show traces of service.   But of course the dilapidation  must  have a Well-Cut past.)
