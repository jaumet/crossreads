I told you we were cleared for action & in instant readiness - still - I got ashore both am & pm - I learnt how my SBA had been behaving ashore - pretty disgracefully - My estimate of his character was more than correct - Mr Bumpus calls him 'au ullage'. you can look up ullage in Webster - Mr B generally knows what he is saying -"This isn't Harry Lauder's navy - my son" - is another of his sage remarks -About 5 pm a gun recalled the crew - Smoke had been seen on the horizon - The Blue Peter was up at the fore & a single blast from a 4 pounder soon had every officer & man tumbling inboard from whaler & cutter & skiff -For a bit all was excitement & then it washed out - Two rounds of revolver cartridges have been served out to each officer in case of boat attacks - I have mine nice & handy - I wonder what it wd feel like to shoot a man - perhaps several men -
