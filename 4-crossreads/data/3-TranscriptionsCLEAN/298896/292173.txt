Thursday 26th Sept  Usual W.O. duties, taking parade, making up rolls etc. Excellent news of Palestine, over 40,000 prisoners, said to be a fourth of the total Turkish forces, a great stroke for Allenby. The 54th.Battalion matter has been settled, the heads giving away & now I have to send their medical gear  back after I had distributed it. Some nuisance. The RMO & other officers return to the Battalion in the morning & I hope this giving way will not have a bad affect on our discipline. We may move now at any moment. Friday 27th Sept.  Had a busy day fixing up the move. At 10 A.M. sent 40 men to the battalions & then arranged  remaining bearers into Squads etc. At 2P.M. sent of remaining bearers & completed loading of transport, filling watercarts etc. Troops moving up all day.
