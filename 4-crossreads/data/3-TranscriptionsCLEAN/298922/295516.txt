Am looking out for Parcel of Sweets etc. & will acknowledge. All ranks are like school boys & enjoy primitive pleasures, eating being one. Throat lozenges are what I particularly like & for use in the Squadron. HAIR CLIPPERS are appreciated. Usual Taubes over & usual Anti Aircraft fire, usual result "nill". New Zealanders suffered very badly from bombs a few days ago.  Stand to hours 0300 daily now, a fog then by noon the thermometer reaches 112 or more in the shade.
Posted notes yesterday as mails are most erratic these days. Got a rotten septic leg.
