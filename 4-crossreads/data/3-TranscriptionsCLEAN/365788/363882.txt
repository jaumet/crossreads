 My dearest Irene, It was lovely to receive a letter from you the other day dated 10 Jany. containing a snap of you & Margaret. It was a nice little one of Margaret, but not a very good one of you old girl. Thank you very much all the same. Received a week or so ago a nice parcel from you containing a nice silk muffler, some nice hanks, a lovely box of sweets from Farmers & two novels. It was very welcome old girl & I am very grateful. We have left Tel el Kabir & are now at a place [some words deleted by censor] where there is a Signal Station but which I think is not used now. We are camped about [some words deleted by censor]
