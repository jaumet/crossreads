After very severe and continuous fighting which lasted throughout the day our line on the evening of 1st September included the greater part of Peronne passed east of Mont St. Quentin, just west of Allaines and joined with III Corps midway between Moislains and Bouchavesnes.
The hard fighting on this front finally forced the enemy to give up the whole Somme line and to undertake a retirement to the Hindenburg line apparently much earlier than he was prepared to do.

At zero the attack commenced and was immediately met by hurricane machine gun fire from the ramparts on the east of Peronne, from St. Denis and from the windmill.
After heavy hand to hand fighting a footing was gained in
