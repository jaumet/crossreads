 Its just the most perfect day, we couldn't get a better in Australia &amp; the fields &amp; woods are a picture.  Bright green grass studded with buttercups &amp; daisies &amp; our horses looking so well feeding about and the trees, every shade of green, some of them like chestnuts just gorgeous with their blooms like candles on a Christmas tree. 
 Lilac mauve &amp; white &amp; fruit trees &amp; hawthorn, oh its a lovely country in the spring.  I'd like to be a faun &amp; skip about in a forest glade clad in a goatskins to the music of a gramophone (discreetly hidden in an old oak).  Of course a Pan's pipe sounds &amp; looks more suitable but the music is very thin &amp; unsatisfying. 
 I have been tearing round all the morning on a bike, very pleasant but rather warm in the military costume &amp; especially as I have to festoon myself with a gas box respirator &amp; bandolier &amp; a leather haversack. 
 I got full (no,  not  py eyed) fed up, so to speak &amp; came home.  Will finish my wandering this evening.  Oh the evenings are glorious, I generally wander round my various pals, I have quite a lot hereabouts.
