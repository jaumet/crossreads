 My dear Friends Yes, we are still here.  It does seem very dreadful &ndash; 92 Sisters in idleness for a whole month but we can only wait in patience.  We believe the shipping is the great difficulty.  You will know how dangerous the seas are at present &ndash; when even Hospital Ships are being torpedoed.  I wish we could wait in the country &ndash; and to stay away a night is not permitted.  London is very fascinating &amp; there is always plenty to do &amp; see &ndash; but the weather is cold and disagreeable &amp; snows every day.  Every one says what an exceptionally severe winter it has been.  I go out very little, but always take advantage of the sunshine when it does appear and then usually go for walks in Hyde Park &amp; Kensington Gardens.  I know them rather well now &amp; its interesting watching the riding in Rotten Row.  I don't think the majority ride well and the horses are poor.  I love best to watch the lovely children one always sees in the parks with their nurses &amp; by the river where the children go to play is the sweetest statue in bronze of Peter Pan.  The dog's Cemetery is near there too, with the little Tombstones &ndash; and when I read the inscriptions on them &amp; look at the fresh flowers that are on the little graves of these bygone pets.
