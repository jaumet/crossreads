 Tuesday 20 February 
 Too tired to get up in time for breakfast.  I went into Southampton for a few hours this morning.  Passed the remainder of the day in writing at the Salvation Army Hut opposite on in the Y.M.C.A. Hut. In the evening, though no leave was granted we all found a way of getting into Southampton. No boats to France yet.
