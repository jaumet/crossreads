<p>Notes to 12th Novr<br/>Joined <strike>2</strike> 2nd Expedy Force Septr 10th &amp; went into camp at Roseberry Park on the 11th.  Found things pretty rough there, arrangements not completed.  Caught a bad cold &amp; it rained for several days.  Shifted camp to Rosehill on the 23rd Sept &amp; had a fairly rough week there.  Our regt was moved to Liverpool on the 30th &amp; conditions got much better.  A big recreation tent was erected &amp; we had a fair amount of room to drill.  We had a lot of rain at Liverpool during the first 2 weeks &amp; the parade ground got very sloppy.  However we had a fairly easy time &amp; got a good amount of leave.  We had all foot drill up till the end of October.  We got some excitement when our horses were given us.  Spills were very common.</p>
