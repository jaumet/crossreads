<p>Thursday Sep 5<br/>There has been nothing much of interest to write, Both sides have been doing more shelling. Our old enemy Jericho Jane has opened up several times but fortunately they have missed us. It is remarkable how well the horses stand the heat. It is no uncommon occurrence to see them sweating on the line. Most of us have Septic Sores. My hands at present are very bad. There is no chance of sore hands getting better while one has to look after Horses. We are changing with the New Zealanders tomorrow night. The camp is situated some 5 miles back in a good possy, near water.</p>
