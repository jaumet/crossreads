Behind our trench the big ridge slopes away for 1500 yards to Wulverghem, and on our right rear, is a gully down which runs the Light Railway, and also tons of water, from crater to crater. It is this gully &amp; railway that our pal the Hun shells at all times:  but especially at night.  More and more guns are being put in quietly.  Our home is only 30 yards from this gully &ndash; not far enough for comfort. Other features of this landscape are, 
 Some very dead mules Some equally dead Huns Numerous wooden crosses (4 on our parados) Much stagnant water and twisted wire A very batterred and broken Tank.
