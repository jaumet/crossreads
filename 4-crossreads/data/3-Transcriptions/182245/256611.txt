<p>6 FRIDAY</p>
<p>A beautiful sunny day, except</p>
<p>for a little shower during afternoon.</p>
<p>Cleaned &amp; polished my saddle</p>
<p>in morning &amp; reading in feed</p>
<p>room all afternoon. I got a</p>
<p>letter (5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;April) from Mother &amp; a</p>
<p>letter of mine to Alan returned.</p>
<p>Well what a difference to last</p>
<p>Good Friday; when I had to go</p>
<p>back to the Warren to look</p>
<p>after horses for the day.</p>
