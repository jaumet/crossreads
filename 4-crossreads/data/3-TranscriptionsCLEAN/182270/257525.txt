 FRIDAY, AUGUST 1, 1919. 
 Fine. Peter met us in big car, but 
 had to get another for the luggage. 
 Got home for breakfast. I was 
 down bottom end after. Darby 
 down 110 ft in the blue rock, he 
 had a soakage at 80 ft of 30 gal an 
 hour. Ewes in Mountain have  
 started to die worse luck, & 
 ewes in Cow paddock to lamb.
