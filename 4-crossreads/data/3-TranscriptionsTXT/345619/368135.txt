 30/3/18 We have been at the School a week now, and it is nearly all lectures, which means lots of writing, but we manage better than I thought. Tidworth is only about 10 mins walk from here, this church is less. I have written to Annie more fully &amp; she will tell you. I hope none of my letters go astray while here by being readdressed I hope you are having better health now &amp; better luck, much love from Arthur
