<p>It was an interesting trip and very pretty. The old King had a very fine O.P. during the battle, but an extremely unhealthy spot in the light of modern experience of artillery fire. Crecy itself is one of the prettiest French villages I have seen and is almost clear.</p>
<p>Today being Sunday, we must go to Le Crotoy for tea. Being a filthy day we shall probably go in the car (30 cwt Lorry chassis)</p>
<p>There is nothing to write about we should cross to England about the 15th May &amp; then the sooner we leave for home the better.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
