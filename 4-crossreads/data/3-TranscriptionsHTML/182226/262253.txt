<p>Thursday 19 August, 1915</p>
<p>Arrived at Lemnos at 5 a.m. French torpedo boat guard the entrances. The harbour is closed from sundown to sunrise.</p>
<p>All final instructions have been given we are held ready to move at an hours notice. We have had 200 rounds of ammunition issued, the pack I have to carry weighs over 100 pounds, just think of it. We have to land with this on a beach that is swept by shells from the Turkish. Have given up thinking of the future am&nbsp;living entirely in the present as no one knows what the next morning will bring forth.</p>
<p>Sailing has been postponed till tomorrow.</p>
