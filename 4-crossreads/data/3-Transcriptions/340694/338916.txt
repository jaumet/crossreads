<p>31<br/>last night with the Doctor another officer &amp; Corporal postman by jove it was a treat. Our object was to witness the bombardment a few miles distant &amp; it was well worth while walking a few miles to see. The star shells lit up the sky &amp; it looked like an immense fire-works display. The roar of the guns must have been deafening closer up it was just one continual roll jove they must have poured the metal in.</p>
<p>The view from the top of the hill was beautiful, the surrounding country looked great &amp; we could see this little village right down in the valley. We passed through glorious wheat fields &amp; the pure country air was very invigorating.</p>
