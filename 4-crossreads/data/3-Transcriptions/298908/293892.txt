<p>better friends than ever &amp; I feel a thundering sight easier in mind today than I did all through the week.  I told some of the lads about it this morning &amp; they reckoned it was a splendid joke &amp; one well against myself &amp; they nearly burst their sides laughing.</p>
<p>2nd.  Ethel &amp; I went over to Saltash which is in Cornwall, a big old ferry boat took us across &amp; we passed dozens of destroyers all laying in line just close to Saltash bridge.  We went for a stroll round the pretty little lanes &amp; then back by train to Plymouth.  We then went to Genom's for dinner &amp; seated at the same table was a French commercial traveller &amp; he told us that he had been stranded in England for a fortnight &amp; it would be a good 30 days before he could get across so crowded are the Channel boats, he was a bit of a mixture according to what he told us said his mother was Maltese his father Italian, &amp; he had lived in Paris all his life.</p>
