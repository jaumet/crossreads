  
 could wish to see, I was riding in front with the driver & we were going down a hill, I noticed a chap carrying a load just in front of us & he looked round when he did I beckoned him to rush the car & I would give him a hand on, just before we got opposite he makes a dash across the road but never noticed a motor byke that was tearing up the hill, he stepped fair into the bike, & there was a loud crash & both sides were sent spinning to the road & the mans rifle clattered like tin on the stones, it happened right under my eyes & I made sure the man was killed, I jumped out quick & lively & run over & picked him up he was dazed & weak but wonderful to say
