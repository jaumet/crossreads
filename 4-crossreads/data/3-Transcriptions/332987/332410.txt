<p>10-6-1918<br/>Terrific Hail storm at midday.  This evening fine. Great aerial activity.  Hundreds of our aeroplanes about.  Artillery active every night.  General's Pony shod today.

<p>11-6-1918<br/>Fine day.  The sickness in camp almost stamped out.  Two horses stolen off lines last night.  So far only one has been recovered.  It was at Vet Mobile Section lame.  Got a clue to the other.  Our planes busy.  Seldom see any of Fritzs planes over our lines.  I believe he is reserving his air force for some special occasion.  The Bty. very quiet, only periodical shoots.</p>
