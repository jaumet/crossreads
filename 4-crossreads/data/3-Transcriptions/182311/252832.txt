<p>Investiture with ribbons in the Field.</p>
<p>My Dear People,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&#39;s a pleasant little story of a sunny afternoon in France, where in a green field not four miles from the front line <sub>^</sub><sup>near Baillieul</sup> was held a little ceremonial parade of a thousand men representing the Division. (3rd)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The occasion was the presentations of the decorations won in this division, by the General Officer commanding the Army, Sir Reginald Plummer.&nbsp; The recipients, both officers and men travelled to the field in a motor waggon with forms for seats, but everyone else up to the rank of Major had to march the five miles&nbsp; of roads over French cobbles, so it was well to be a recipient.&nbsp; Four officers and ten N.C.O&#39;s and privates were to be decorated but Lieut.Fleighter had that morning left for &quot;Blighty&quot; and two lads were in hospital wounded in the raid of two nights before.&nbsp; The ribbons on their carriers were arranged on a Union Jack cushion and presented by our dear old General Plumer - grey-headed - who, with great ease and no apparent effort held a monocle in his right eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The deed for which the award was made was read loudly and clearly and the recipient stood proud and self-conscious, then the General pinned on the ribbon, shaking hands and murmuring some congratulatory remarks.</p>
