France27th Aug 16
Dear AuntieJust a line to let you know that I am well. It is such a long time since I have written to you that you will think I have forgotten you altogether.
We have been in France two months now, we arrived in Marsailles on the 25th of June and went from there up to Le Havre it took us about 54 hours in the train it was a very long journey but we all enjoyed it pretty well as it was beautiful scenery all the way and everything was new to us.
Every available piece of land seems to be under cultivation here all down the south they go in more for vineyards I think they grow the grapes mostly for wine and up north it is all either wheat or oats. They seem to have very good crops this year they are harvesting everywhere
