<p>May 12 rises the smoke of many steamers &ndash; intermingling with that of the great factories. Beneath the beautiful grounds surrounding the column, &amp; then the sea, that far famed sea of the North on whose bosom floats our mighty Fleet, the terror of the Hun, but the pride of every Britisher. But naught see I except a few small steamers, tugs &amp; sailing craft. The surface is calm, almost without a ripple &amp; beyond hardly discernable, is the coast of England. One would hardly realise that the world is at war, if it were not for the many tents dotted here &amp; there on the landscape, &amp; the groups of soldiers passing to &amp; fro along the roads. And yet &ndash; what hidden dangers may be lurking beneath the calm surface of yon sea, what enemies even in our midst.
