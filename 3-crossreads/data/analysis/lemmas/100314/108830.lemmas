 31/1/18 London ? Boulogn We were part of a convoy accompani by torpedo boat destroy . Although the sun was bright and the water calm the temperatur becam veri cold made the trip disagre . Pull in at Boulogn at 1 pm and made for the EFC Officer 's Club which is splendid comfort . It is staf by W.A.A.Cs and I notic them also at the Signal Office . Veri neat and smart in their brown uniform but what an atmospher for a young girl . At lunch we had ampl white bread and a flow sugar bowl which was much appreci . Walk down the promenad by the beach . The town is built on rather a steep upward slope and some of the street are step like stair . Along the quay were plenti of fish craft and fishermen in loos red blous . Rather dark look class of peopl talk volubl in French .
