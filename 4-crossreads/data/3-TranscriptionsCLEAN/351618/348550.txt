Lieut Archie Raymondo is now posted to our Battery and looks well. He was previously acting as transport officer. Lieut Richards is officer in charge of one of our guns - a real good sort. Capt Crisp of the 9th Battery was transferred to gun Battery in place of Capt Leslie dead. Lieut Urquhart has gone back to Alexandria - a wreck - enough said. Lieut Hodgens has come over from Alexandria & Lieut Ross is still at No 3 gun. Our Major (Gus Hughes) is not well and looks as if he wants a good rest from his responsibilities. Sergt Major Handsford is still the same old customer.
Capt Dr Marks is much thinner than when we left Mena.
