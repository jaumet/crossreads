It kicked so much &amp; reared about that it was necessary to remove other horses from nearby.

Whoa! &amp; various other ejaculations from the Chief Officer on the bridge, &amp; at the same time the A13 swung out of line owing to her steering gear failing. The Chief officer of course ran amok &amp; yelled orders by the score. H.M.S. Hampshire however dropped back &amp; came over asking if we needed assistance. In an hour we were on our way back to our position &amp; from astern it was a magnificent sight as it was possible to see the whole convoy.</p>
