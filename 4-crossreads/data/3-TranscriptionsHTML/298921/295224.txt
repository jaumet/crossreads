<p>September, 1915<br/>Friday 10<br/>Lovely weather now &amp; cool nights, am posting you some snapshots of Anzac today. <strike>Heard today that the Transport carrying some of the 6th Brigade has been torpedoed &ndash; <u>Col: Linton</u> Brigadier &amp; about 20 others drowned &ndash; Jack Lorimer &amp; Harry Phillips are in that Brigade, but hope were not among the 20.<br/>It surprises me that more transports are not sunk considering the shipping between Alexandria &amp; Gallipoli</strike>.</p>
