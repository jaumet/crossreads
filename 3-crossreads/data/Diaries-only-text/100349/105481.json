Was releived form the post yesterday reported to the quack. Had a high temperature, was give a "P.U.O" ticket and was sent out. Walked out 6 miles
to the 7th Field Ambulance. Was made a stretcher case there and sent on to the 3rd Canadian Casualty Clearing Station. Woke up this morning in between lovely sheets, and washed sweet and clean, in the 7. Canadian General Hosp. Etables. My ticket is marked No.19.A.T. so I guess I was sent straight on in an Ambulance train. There does not appear to be much the matter with me. They tell me I am to rest quietly. Can I? I should worry!

Have been asleep for about a week. The doctor has not examined me yet. I rest in bed and read. I could die happy now. Glorious weather ouside.
