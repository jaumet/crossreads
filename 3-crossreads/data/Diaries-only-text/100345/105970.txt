cold fairly wet day: on guard in the trenches: Frity sent over another dose of "coal boxes" before dinner: a heavy bombardment is on again round to the east: Gee Algie! but I just got a shock: a "whiz bang" came over I thought it was on my dug out, the floor seemed to lift I thought I was going to play sky-terriers: our boys gave them a steady bombardment before tea:

on guard in trenches: glorious day: usual shells by both sides during day: after tea the gas horns gongs sounded from our left we had to "stand to" with helmets on turban fashion: we had "alarms" on off all the night did not get much shut eye: The first one was "fair dinkum" but after that I think it was the fog which used to roll up in big banks of course it is not worth taking any risks. Our guns gave them a banging at the first alarm. Luiet pye from Lithgow was
