<p>a large number of head cases, many have lived but a few have died from shock.  Some few of the wounded are very young 17 &amp; 18 &amp; with their English faces look mere boys.</p>
<p>Tuesday 8th</p>
<p>Arrived at Alexandria during the afternoon and I had a restless sleep through the winch working etc.</p>
<p>Wednesday 9th</p>
<p>Unloaded all our wounded with motors finishing about 7 P.M.    We were given leave at night but not until we struggled for it &amp; several had cleared off.  Uptown there were hundreds of newly arrived Australians doing the sights &amp; getting into trouble in the usual way.   They were eager for news &amp; many were the gory tales told to them by our chaps and others.</p>
<p>Thursday 10th</p>
<p>We were given leave during the afternoon much to our satisfaction.   My first day was to get my watch repaired which cost me 12 P.T. after a great deal of bargaining then I bought two cushion covers &amp; blouses to send home &amp; several postcards &amp; photos packing the whole up with some curios in the form of coins bullets etc.   From here I went to see Lance who was camped at Sidi Bishr returning to the ship about 10.30 P.M.</p>
<p>Friday 11th</p>
<p>On board all day &amp; did the town in the evening.   Spent about an hour looking through a curio shop wishing for the necessary to indulge in some.</p>
<p>Saturday 12th</p>
<p>The next few days were a succession of alarms disappointments &amp; a display of mismanagement.</p>
