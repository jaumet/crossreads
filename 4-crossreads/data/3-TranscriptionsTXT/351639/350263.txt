 our official estimate puts the Turkish losses at seven thousand killed and wounded by judging from the enormous numbers of dead lying in front of the trenches unburied this is probably an underestimate and probably at least one third of the  attacking  whole army was wiped out stop  the ground presents an extraordinary sight when viewed through the trench periscopes stop  two hundred yards away and even closer in places are the Turkish trenches and between them and our lines the dead lie in hundreds there are groups of twenty or thirty massed together as if for mutual protection some lying on their faces some killed in the act of firing others hung up in the barbed wire stop  in one place a small group actually reached our parapet and now lie dead on it shot or bayoneted at point blank range stop  hundreds of others lie just outside their own trenches were they were caught by rifles and  machine gun fire  shrapnel when trying to regain them hundreds of wounded must have perished between the lines for it was only on
