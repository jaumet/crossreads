AssiyutWhich I think is up to the time of writing the prettiest place at yet we have yet touched. Assiyut boasts of a barrage smaller than the world famous one of Assouan, of course, but by no means despicable..The European quarter of the town is quite distinct  &   apart from that of the natives: some of the houses are very fine  &  the gardens are a picture.The outstanding feature of the place is its atmosphere of American mission  &  religion.The first night I was there I was asked to attend a meeting :  &  a little further on a beetle browned square headed individual asked me whether I would "Keer to cum along to chourch".They have an excellent mission school
