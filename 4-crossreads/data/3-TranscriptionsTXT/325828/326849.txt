My dearest Father, I am having rather a quiet night to-night.  We are doing the full 8 hour-shifts now from 10 till 6, as we have 73 patients in here now & so among them 7 bad cases.  I see by the roster issued to-day, I am on the Dog-watch again this week, but I don't object.  It is now about 3 A.M. & nearly all the patients in this ward (12 of them) are sleeping quietly enough.  We each have charge of a ward for the shift & Perce is head-sherang.  The O.C (Major Lawes) held a parade the other morning, & picked the mob for Queen's Park.  Neither Percy nor I were picked; but there is still a chance as P. has the sergeant of the transports working for him trying to get us in.  Anyway if we don't get away this time, we will probably stand a chance for the Base Hospital for France to be formed next month.   Walter will have probably told you that I got my uniform the other day from F. Smith, & that it fits me fairly well.  It turns very cold up here about 2 A.M.  If I can work it, I am going to try & get off for a few days & go up to the Parkes Show next week, all being well.   A Church of England mission started in camp on Friday.  I went then & to-night (Sunday) I heard Dr. Long Bishop of Bathurst, who is a fine speaker.Love to all home,Leo
