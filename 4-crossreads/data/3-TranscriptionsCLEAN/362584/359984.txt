  
 and I went round to see her on Sunday. She was a great friend of Evan Richards, & his death has cut her up terribly. She was so pleased I could tell her such a lot about him, & has offered to put me up whenever I go to London. She is a fine old lady, & entertains Australian officers regardless of expenses. Her house is open to them all, at all times, & whenever you call you are almost certain to meet somebody you know. 
 Father tells me that you have been to Wagga with him, & that you met old Mr Bolton. I remember him trying to teach me how to play billiards without much success, so he showed me the town instead. 
 Our division has been withdrawn from the firing line, so there will be no need to worry when I join up with them. Anyway there will be very little fighting in the winter, & we shall be happier more contented & better off in France than we are here. 
 So cheer up! 
 Your loving son
