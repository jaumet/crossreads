<p>weather on Gallipoli Coast is said to be too rough for landing troops.</p>
<p>Tues. 2nd Nov. 1915.</p>
<p>On guard last night &amp; the other Refts (4th &amp; 5th Troop destes) rioted &amp; broke down the hatchways to the stores &amp; got plenty of bottled ale etc. There was a lively time &amp; cigarettes &amp; chocolate were all over the show.<br/>Captain of ship threatened to shoot some but a lot of notice they took of him.<br/>This is one of the effects of keeping us here at anchor in Mudros &amp; not putting  us on shore at all.<br/>Some ship was on fire in the harbour last night &ndash; don't know its name.<br/>This morning we all have to tranship on to the "Osmanieh" &ndash; supplied with 200 rounds of ammunition.<br/>Been putting oil into a monitor that drew alongside of us.<br/>The "Mauretania" as a hospital ship looked a fine sight as we left.<br/>Landed at ANZAC &amp;  spent remainder of night sleeping in holes dug out in Shrapnel Gully. Firing going on all night over the ridges.<br/>This is a weird place.</p>
<p>Wed. 3rd. Nov.<br/>Shifted up towards our battalion this morning &amp; we are being drafted towards different Coys. of the 4th.<br/>Doing the night on the flat</p>
