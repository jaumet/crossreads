  
 19 April 1918 Friday Bought 5 Rabbits for 2/- each for Pasteur Institute, Jerusalem wanted for Bacteriological purposes, & the M.G. was sending to Cairo for them Took them in;  many natives being inoculated a green parrot was imitating their yells when the needle went in, awful curs,   & no one sort  the cleverness of the Parrot.  I see a poor old Galah occassionally, natives will spend hours in front of a talking parrot.
