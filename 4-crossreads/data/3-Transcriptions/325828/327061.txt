<p>29th Training Squadron,<br/>Australian Flying Corps,<br/>Shawbury,<br/>(near) Shrewsbury,<br/>Shropshire, England,<br/>25/8/1917.</p>
<p>My dear Ones at Home,<br/>I am afraid that by this time you will have classed me among the "Bad Correspondents"; on looking at my Diary to-day I was awfully surprised to see that I haven't written home since the 29th of last month.  I remember now that it was whilst I was in the Military Hospital at Prees Heath, Salop, that I wrote.  Whilst cutting my wisdom tooth on the left side jaw, an abcess formed, and became so painful that the Quack here decided to send me into Hospital; This was on the Saturday morning; I stayed in till the following Tuesday and by that time, I got so fed up with it all that I decided to come back home, and arranged my papers accordingly.  I am glad to say that I have had no further trouble with my teeth.  Whilst I was on the Staff in London, I had the whole of my mouth overhauled by a reliable Dentist (civilian) and thoroughly attended to.<br/>As I think I stated in my last letter, I put a transfer in for the Flying Corps, whilst I was at A.I.F. headquarters, and came up here on the 13th July. (An unlucky day, Friday, and also an unlucky number, 13)  I came up originally with the intention of becoming a Pilot, but they shoved me into the Orderly Room with the job of Returns Clerk, and here I am still: (more anon re the work later).  As soon as I can, I intend getting away to a Pilots' School and working like a nigger for my certificate.<br/>Just as there are so many Companies in a Brigade, and so many Brigades to a Division, so here there are three Squadrons to a "Wing", six "Wings to a Group.  The three Squadrons here, are made up of two Tommy Squadrons, namely the 10th and 67th, and one Australian Squadron (29th)<br/>Talk about Red &ndash;Tape in the Army- I have been absolutely convinced of it since I have taken this job on.  Returns-Clerk.  Responsible that Returns are sent in for this, that and the other.  On my table here, an 8 X 4 one, are crowded papers of all sorts, dealing with all sorts of things in the Squadron, from different makes of Aeroplanes down to drawing-pins.<br/>From the beg<strike>g</strike>inning of the month till the last day of the same month, I have to send in no less than 54 different sorts of Returns; the trouble is this, as we are an Australian Squadron attached to an English one, we have to send in and be accountable to the 29th Wing (R. F. C.) and at the same time be accountable to our own Headquarters in London.   So that practically we have double work to do in this connection.<br/>Since I last wrote I have had quite a lot of letters from Home, for which I have to thank you all so much.  Letters from Father dated 27/5/17, and 3/6/17; 0l dated 27/5/17 &amp; 3/6/17; and Walters dated 26/5/17 and then this morning I got another budget from you all dated variously, one from Father 26/6/17, one from Mother 26/6/17, and one from Walter 22/6/1917.  I was so very glad to hear from all of you again, and to know that you were all well at the time of writing.<br/><u>Father</u>   Thank you for your very newsy letters; it is a great treat to read and re-read them and then I indulge in a reverie and imagine myself back gain in dear old N.S.W.  I too, Father am very glad the pubs have no attraction for me.  Naturally I see a lot of it in a camp like this, especially as we have a wet canteen on the ground.  Since I have been in England, and more especially whilst I was in London, I was absolutely astonished to see the way in which the women (mainly the working and poorer classes I am referring to) stream into the hotels for their beer as though it was nothing at all: the pubs over here are open on Sundays exactly the same as any other day, but there is this about it, they have to close at 9 p.m. and can't open till 11 a.m. the next day: also "shouting" is absolutely prohibited.<br/>I can't make it out at all about Rid: I wrote to him just before I left London and a few weeks ago had the letter returned from the Base Record Office with "NO RECORD OF THIS OFFICER" stamped across it.<br/>The way I addressed it was this,<br/>Captain Chaplain R. C. Oakley,<br/>2nd Brigade Artillery Headquarters,<br/>1st Australian Division,<br/>A.I.F.  France.  This is the right address isn't it?  I have written again since, putting the same address, but I don't know how the letter will get on.<br/>I have as a chum here an old S.H.S. boy by the name of Donnan (Sid)   He had an elder brother at the High School about 1908 a fairly tall chap with fair hair, and with glasses.  Do you remember him at all</p>
