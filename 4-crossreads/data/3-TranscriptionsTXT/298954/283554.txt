1917Wed. 26th Dec.The "Igotz" came alongside and coaling commenced.   The two vessels are bumping heavily, even dangerously.   The heat is stifling, the port-holes closed, and the place covered with coal dust.
Thu. 27th Dec.The "Ingotz" cast off at 6 pm, (the rolling of the vessels was causing very dangerous bumping) and the ports were permitted to be opened.   I staggered over to the port and absolutely gulped down the fresh air. - and had my first glimpse of the Atlantic.
It was a glorious clear evening, the water rising and falling over "Wolf's" port torpedo tube was a deep ultramarine and a brilliant planet was rising in the dusk.
Sun. 30thAt about 5.30 pm Bob rushed along to the hospital with The Very Latest Rumour.   We were off at 7 pm and it had definitely been decided to rush the blockade.   He recommended asking for a transfer to the "Mendi".
