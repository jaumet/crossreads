<p>Saturday 23rd December 1916.<br/>8 a.m. At last we start &amp; make a move from the ghastly &amp; barren scene. Marched to the train which was only about &frac34; of a mile away.  We passed our friend Capt. Millison, who has been transferred to another Ambulance. Travelled in open trucks for about 7 miles. raining &amp; terribly cold. We do the last part of the journey in Motor Buses, a distance of over 30 miles to travel. Arrived at the -- Chateau where the rest of our Unit is billeted at 5 p.m. We received a great reception, plenty of hand shaking. It was a real treat to be home once again, far away from the roar of Artillery &amp; being amongst the green fields again. It is an ideal spot for a rest. It seemed quite strange to see a good number of new</p>
<p>faces, reinforcements &amp; three new officers. We are to be the Units guests for three days, some swank believe me. Slept like a top during the night, it was a god send not hearing that dreaded cry <u>"Stretcher Bearers"</u>.</p>
