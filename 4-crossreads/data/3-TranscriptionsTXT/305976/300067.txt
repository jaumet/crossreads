This last week I have been down to a slight attack of Malaria. To day the Sherf of Mecca's arrived here.I had heard such a lot about them that I looked forward with interest to meeting them. I never saw a more undisciplined lot of Troops. All hands seemed to go where they liked & do just as they chose. Some were mounted on Camels, some on Horses, Turkish mules & Ponies others were on foot.They seemed fairly well dressed but there was no uniformity among them. They have the reputation of being plunderers & I must confess looked it.
