arguing the toss as to the way to go. Have been through a lot of them big
shops they are splendid, but all the same I don't think they are much` more up to date than we are in Sydney in this branch. Their tubes are splendid wonderful to say I find them even easier to find my way about than those of London. Last night Frank I went saw a Grand Opera, "Rigoletto" it was in the National Opera to try describe their theatre would be foolish, magnificent is no name for it, built in the olden days of the French Monarchy it is a masterpiece. London theatres are book shops compared to this marvellous pile she is something I shall never forget I wonder if there are any finer theatres in the world than this masterpiece I doubt it for Paris is the home of this sort of thing, although we could not understand a word of the Opera which is of course all singing we thoroughly appreciated it for the music etc was lovely, the acting good.
