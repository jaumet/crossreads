I am writing this on the shores of Lake Timsah. We are down for a swim but I didn’t go in today To windy. Erzurum has been take by the Russians from the Turks. A very important capture and should influence Roumania in our favour. Just got word through that C. Sect. from here and C Sect. from 8th Fld. Amb. are forming a new ambulance under Major Moseley. All the ambulances are being split up similarly. We will get away from here very shortly.

Sunday 20th – B Section went out to the trenches today and we are moving off tomorrow to form the new ambulance I think to Tel-el-Keber and then on to Zietoun. Wrote home to Maud and Hilda today. General Birdwood made a very fine speech to the men at Church this morning and asked all commanding officers to go more among their men and find out their wants and complaints.

It is almost certain we are going to France in the near future. Nothing much of importance on today. We are still holding ourselves in readiness to move off at any time. Sergeant Banner is back again with us. We are able to get leave into Port Said or Suez instead of Cairo now. I will go into Port Said on my next leave. Kit inspection today.

Did practically nothing all day. Went down for a swim in the morning and had Q.M’s fatigue in the afternoon.
