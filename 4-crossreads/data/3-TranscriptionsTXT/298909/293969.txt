 26/4/1916  Wednesday 
 Absolutely the hottest I've ever experienced, majority say Temperature was  115  in the shade. 
 One could hardly stay in the tent. The dust, sand &amp; heat was very hard on my eyes, so I am now wearing goggles &amp; find much relieved &ndash; Drilling all day on the sand, we were quite busy all day at times bringing in fellows sunstroke etc from the Division we are at present with. There is a general activity here, all units going their hardest. Artillery firing all day. Infantry rifle firing bomb throwing &amp; trench digging &ndash; Bayonet practising etc. 15th F. Ambulance getting everything ready. 
 Brigadier McKay &ndash; Prince of Wales &amp; Staff are buzzing about every day &ndash; all these things tell me that they expect the Turks here any day. We have also been warned against hostile airships. 
 We all had to do a perish for water to day, got some water about 8.30 pm &ndash; only about 2,000 men waiting. Had two good swims.
