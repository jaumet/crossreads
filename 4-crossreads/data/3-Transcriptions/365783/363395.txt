<p>What an unfortunate devil poor Frank is with his cars &ndash; he always seems to be in trouble &ndash; I think he must regard that "Wurley" corner as a bit of a Jonah, he has so often broken down in its immediate vicinity.   I suppose he got a good old dressing down from the occupants of the car.   What a godsend Cuddy must be for Frank when he gets into trouble.<br/>I forgot to tell you that I had a letter from Uncle Joe soon after he got here &amp; in it he told me that the had just received the box of Xmas bush that you sent to him at Broadmeadows &ndash; he told me to thank you very much for it &ndash; he was afraid that you would think that he had forgotten.  I have not seen him since the evening I had dinner with him at his mess at Heliopolis.    I saw Concanon in Cairo yesterday &ndash; I told him about the burglary at this house &ndash; he had heard about it &ndash; he made no mention about the burglar having occupied the bed of the lady of the house.   I made no mention of the extraordinary operation that had been performed on his daughter.   I was glad to hear by your letter from Tenerife dated 23.2.15. that you had received a letter from me from Egypt.  I took Fred out the day before yesterday for a day with a real live Major &ndash; he behaved himself fairly</p>
