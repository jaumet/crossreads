<p>This evening another brigade, with engineering, medical, and other details, are under orders to get away, before 10 O'clock this morning they had begun to strike tents, &amp; in other ways prepare for the leave taking.  I shall ride round during later hours to note what is being done.</p>
<p>Father McAuliffe went with Colonel MacLaurin, I saw him off, &amp; I have written to Father Sherrin at St. Marys Cathedral, in accord with promise made to the padre.</p>
<p>Last night I was in Cairo for a few hours.  Caught the 8 p.m. train.  Went to the Continental Hotel, there met Mrs Newmarch, &amp; others that I knew.  It being Saturday night, the usual dance was being held.  Mrs N. several times told me that it was a good display to look at.  Many soldiers, with different uniforms, made the scene a gay one, lady residents &amp; some from the City constituted the dancers.  There was much variety in the women.  Many were good to look upon, others were not up to so high a standard.  The terraced dressed did not take my fancy, in fact to me the fashions look less pleasing to the eye each season.  I hope that you girls have not taken to the several storied skirt, which is narrowed about the ankles.  Became tired at 11 pm., &amp; caught to 11-30 train for home.  Dr. Newmarch, Dr. Aspinall, Dr. Millard, Dr. Poate, Dr. Cane [possibly Dr Kay?], were amongst those who started last night.  Please when you see Dr. Paton that I forgot to place these names in his letter alongside of Dr. Millards?</p>
<p>I enclose you as a curiosity an envelope which was posted at Ismalia addressed to Cairo, it was opened by the Censor &amp; sent on.  Note the number of post marks upon it.  "Mrs. G. L. Knowles"</p>
