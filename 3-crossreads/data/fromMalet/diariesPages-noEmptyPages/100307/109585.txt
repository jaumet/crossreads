Camp near Le Barque Pozieres

looking round. There are a hut or two and a few dugouts scattered round and a few Australian graves. Germans had just a few inches mounded above them where they fell and boots and handbones were sticking out. Around were the tiny carcases of the characteristic maggots all turned black. All professed to be able to recognise the ground and it came as a surprise to find that we were a quarter of a mile from Gibraltar and everyone was quite out in their reckoning! 
Through Stewart's messing the limber and cross went to the wrong place and we had to come home after a fruitless journey. Most vexatious. Rode back with Dooley. 
 we noticed embedded several whole shells which had failed to explode and the trees edging the road were liberally sprinkled with bullet splashes. Road busy with tractors guns and other traffic. Orders to hold ourselves in readiness to move forward tonight for a stunt. Hope it comes to nothing
