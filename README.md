Crossreads 
==========

This software is a prototype that develops the idea of transversal-reading, or  derive-reading. This is about to read a text in  alternatives orders. 

Initially, the text or collection of texts are divided in pieces (almost paragraphs) and then the similarity among pieces is calculated.

With all the pieces we build a web interface [javascript app] that allows cross-reading.

[April 24th, 2014]: Active development. Code and usage not yet documented.  Expected launch late May 2014.
