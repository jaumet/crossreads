 So I think it best to come. Have you seen or heard anything of Oscar Watford I think Linklater is wounded. I believe they got the news a day or so before I left. There is no mistake there are a lot of men engaged at Gillapolis I hope you will like the presents and that you recieve them. Write and tell the lady that you recieved them. She put her card inside. By jove our fellows have made a name for themselves. They stop at nothing, &amp; all the time they keep on saying what about a charge with the bayenots. The Turks fear them more than the Indians. Stan sends his kind regards. Don't worry about me, because there are hundreds of brave chaps fallen, and if I go I am quite prepared to die, especially fighting for my country; &amp; I will let them know there is a Hill on the field Will write again soon So hoping you are all well love to all friends. With all my love to your dear selves &amp; Dear Dorothy Your loving Son Tom.
