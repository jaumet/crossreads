  
 to England again, but perhaps the war will end. 
 So little John (Graham) says a prayer for me, does he?  That's just sweet of him, and you tell him that his Uncle Jock often says a prayer that Graham will grow up into a great big strong fellow, so big & strong that the Germans will always after  being  be afraid to fight us again:  I shall notice a great change in him, I suppose, & also in little Tom. 
 Children alter so much more in a short time than grown up people. 
 John seems to have been busy buying and selling & trying to keep the ball rolling generally:  I am expecting a wire any day now in end of April saying the season has broken and all looks well for the grass to grow a bit before the hard weather in June:  its up to the seasons to remain good for another year or two still. 
 I'm afraid I've simply rambled on in this letter, Mrs John, with all the things I'm thinking about:  and I haven't been polite as I should be and inquired after your health & all you've been doing. 
 But anyhow I've liked writing you this letter, and when I get up to the front in a day or so, I'll write you again, next time probably pencil writing. 
 Goodbye, best love to John, little John & to you.
