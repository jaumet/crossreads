 [Friday 19 May 1916] 
 Marched out at 3.30 AM &amp; saw a sight I have not seen since Elands River fight- rows &amp; rows of dead horses &amp; Camels &ndash;graves of Turks &amp; Yeomanry- at  Quatia  Camp equipment &amp; love letters Captured 12 sheep &amp; 8 Bedouins but noTurks. [Following paragraph is crossed out] Everything left in the Yeomans Camps- Blankets Helmets &amp;  Polo Balls !!   Golf sticks!!  great Tables &amp; ovens &amp; Whiskey &amp; Champagne bottles &amp; we poor devils can hardly get drinking water carried it is not to the Credit of the Regiment.  I have  NOT  mentioned 12 Hours in the saddle, could hear Warships bombarding further up the Coast but I must be careful what I write. Some of the Photos &amp; letters were disgustingly indecent.
