  
 Daffadils. and you see them grow wild I came back through Cambridge and when we were about 14 miles out of Sydney I passed acres of glass houses and they are looked after by girls and you could see them full of tomatoes and cucumber they are a great price so I expect they pay to grow them in such quantities. The wild flowers are coming out and every where you look the place is full of the primrose and blue bells & they look very fine when they are growing wild. All the trees are out in leaf & the fruit trees in blossom and it make a big contrast after seeing nothing else but Limbless trees & stumps in France. but the bulbs were out in flower when I left. I was up before a board to day and I am going to be transfered to an artillery camp
