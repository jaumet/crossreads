working on the old German line at Fricourt. Cold sleet and snow; there was only one fire; I could not get near it, till I removed the explosive from a German bomb and threw it into the fire; I had it to myself then, because the boys fled. A French civilian visited Fricourt under escort and recovered his cash box from the foundations of a house.

Fell for some heavy tumbling lately. Shovelling macdam into motor lorries. They say that 800 tons of macdam a day is used in the construction and repair of roads in this sector. Every yard of them has to be constructed over, shell torn grounds, that would bog a duck. It is almost impossible to recognise this place now as the same area
