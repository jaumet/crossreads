 Thursday 20th April 
 News in paper of fall of Trebizond &amp; today I hear that America has declared war on Germany. If so things are indeed brighter. No letters yet. Hope to be on the way to France soon. Foot is &ndash; like I imagined for weeks &ndash; nearly better. 
 Friday &amp; Sat. 
 Nothing happened to get excited about.
