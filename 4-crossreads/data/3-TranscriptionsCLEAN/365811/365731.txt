Australians are in favour of conscription but cant bring themselves to vote for it because they don't like to send other people's sons having none of their own to send & similar reasons, but would like the Government to have taken the bold course & introduced it through Parliament & not by referendum.

 Goodbye, kindest regards to you all, 
 Yours very sincerely A [indecipherable]
