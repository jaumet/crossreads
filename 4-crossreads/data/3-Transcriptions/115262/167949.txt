<p>Sunday 1 July 1917.</p>
<p>Reveille at 6 a.m. &amp; appreciated the 2 hrs. extra&nbsp;<s>sleep</s>&nbsp;rest but planes disturbed us from 4 to 6 a.m. Fell in at 9 a.m. &amp; with other units were taken for a swimming parade, to Bitter Lakes. Ismailia. Had a decent swim and several of us bought water melons from natives. They were nearly as good as Australian produce of this kind. Around the lakes are date palms which give the place a fresh appearance. Maize &amp; vegetables are also grown by irrigation.</p>
<p>Reached camp 12.30 pm. &amp; wrote up diary &amp; letters during afternoon.</p>
