<p>Camp suprise, when the next day May 31th, about 60 of them returned &amp; informed us the following.  ,,When leaving hier they wher escorted to a Camp about 2 miles distant.  They had been quatered in Tents, without bedding, only blankets.  The next morning they had been called into Office &amp; asked by a Military Officials, if they wher willing to goe to the front &amp; fight for Serbia if so they would be free to goe into a Military Camp instead of returning to the Concentration Camps.  The 60 returned replied that they wher willing to fight for Austria, the land of their birth, but never for an enemy.  On June 1 another batch returned about dinnertime, followed by another during the afternoon &amp; still another during the evening, all telling us the same story.  The oviation they recieved wher great about 4000 Internees cheering them loudly when they entered the Camp Gates.  The Camp Brass Band gawe a ,,Selection" in honor of their patriotic actions &amp; showing the Australian Military Officials, that they never would turn ,,Traitores" to their Country but prefferred to hawe their liberty robbed &amp; being returned behind the Barb Wire.  One June 3 the last returned minus about 37 Croates Dalmatines wich enlisted.  This action might suprise some of the Readers in the Military stooping so low as to ask Internees to goe to fight for them under the promisse of gaining their liberty,</p>
