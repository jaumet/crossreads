<p>26.3.17<br/>Dear George, this is one view of this great Cathedral. It is the Highest Stone Building in England &amp; the Steeple is also the Highest. It is magnifique &amp; too grand to write about. The X marks the Gate from the Cloisters. The wall here is marked with Bullet Holes where the Royalists fired on Cromwells Troops. 70 odd men fell dear here right in the Cathedral Close. Best of Luck &amp; Good Wishes to All.   Harry</p>
