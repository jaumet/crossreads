Monday 16th Aug. 1915

Entrained at Zeitoun at 1-30 am for Alexandria. Arrived latter place about 6 am. Embarked at once on S/S "Saturnia". Met Arthur Gray on board. Had a long chat with him about home etc. Left Alexandria about 7 pm.

The "Saturnia" is the dirtiest most stinking ship I have met in my experience. Packed like sardines aboard (3500 troops about) the atmosphere in the mess decks below where we are supposed to sleep, is foetid & suffocating. The lavatories & latrines are unapproachable, human excrement & an indescribable mass of filth in the shape of decomposed meat, bread, straw & other refuse floats around in rank pools of urine & putrid water. Little fresh water is available & the food is disheartening both in quality & quantity. I have heard frequent complaints of bugs & lice & body vermin & I am not surprised. The ship is a disease breeder & thank God our journey upon it will be short.

I sleep on deck where one has an opportunity of breathing the pure ozone.

Life belt parade at 3 pm. Quite a parody of a show in itself. I can imagine the state of affairs on the sound of an alarm. Hell would then be let loose & mad riot reign supreme. There are two battalions & several "details" aboard. Life belts are short & the boats are not "efficient" by any means. Inoculated for Cholera 4 pm..
