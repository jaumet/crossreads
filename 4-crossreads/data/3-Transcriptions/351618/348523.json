<p>Returned home to a desolate tent late.</p>
<p>Sunday 13th June<br/>Up early &amp; saw Ted Coleman. Recvd issue of stuff etc Packed up etc. A big crowd of irresponsibles in Details.</p>
<p>Loaded up in motors for embarking at 9am tomorrow. We had some of the wild Australians in our motor who persisted in exclamations and noises at every one as we passed along. On arrival at wharf I was placed in charge of the Artillery Light Horse &amp; other Details to see that they served something to replenish the inner man.  I have had little varied experience as to Troopships up to now but the "Annaberg" has beaten everything by far for dirt and other inconveniences. She was most disgraceful in every way and all the Australians were consigned to the lower decks &ndash; or I should say the lowest hold a place not fit for pigs. There was nothing to sleep on &ndash; no (I have since heard that a lot of these ships are much the same as the Annaberg)</p>
