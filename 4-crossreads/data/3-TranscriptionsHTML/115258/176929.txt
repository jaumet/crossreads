<p>in her neck while I was away and has been sent to hospital, so I have no horse to ride now but I expect some remounts will come along in a day or two. Love to Mother &amp; Fred. I am Your loving Son Rober C Wilson</p>
<p>P.S. I think I told Mother &nbsp;this but I will tell you to make sure. Lieut. J Leask is going by the next hospital boat (when ever that is) and he lives in Boyle Street Mosman in a house call &#39;Leacholme&quot; just at the foot of Spofforth Street. Jim is a jolly fine chap and a great soldier. I was at Fort St with him, also at that Rural camp. He taught me signalling over here and I worked with him for some time till he got his commission in the 11th Regt. He was badly wounded but says he is coming back here again anyhow I hope you will get &nbsp;a chance to see him. You&#39;ll like him awfully much. His brother was killed in France about 2 years ago. I think I have often sent you photos of Jim before he got his commission, so you will know him when you see him (perhaps).</p>
