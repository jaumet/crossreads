 F. G.O.C. [General Officer Commanding] makes rounds accompanied by very much Belying. I go to Y.W.C.A. & play for Dance all night. It is a very nice evening. I am feeling off & cannot get to sleep thinking about M.O.I.

 W. I get my Breeches from the Tailor. I pack up for I.O.M.  [Isle of Man]. I go to Y.W.C.A. & sit alone all night, reading music. Go home & straight to Bed. I wait on the corner for Nothing.
