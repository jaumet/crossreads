MELBOURNE,673 Bourke Street,Nov. 28th, 1918.
Dear
The list and other particulars hereunder were forwarded to me by several comrades of my late son, Private F.W.Roberts, but I cannot vouch for the absolute correctness of names and numbers.
I send these particulars with the hope that you will be comforted to know, (if you do not already,) where the body lies of the one dear to you amongst a gallant community.
To you, as a relative of a soldier who was a comrade in arms of my dear son, in life, death and burial, I offer my sympathy and respect.
Yours faithfully,C.W.Roberts
The names beneath are those of some soldiers of the 21st Battalion, 6th Brigade, 2nd Division of the Australian Imperial Force, who were killed in the attack on Mont St. Quentin, near Peronne, France, on Sunday, 1st September, 1918.
Some, if not all, were buried the same night on a slope of the mount, the first eleven in one grave, the twelfth close by, and the last two near by. A nice cross was placed at the head of each.
