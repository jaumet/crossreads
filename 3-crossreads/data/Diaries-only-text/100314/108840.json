5/2/18 Selles
Walked down to "B" Coy who are some distance out of the village along the pleasantest secluded country lanes which must be lovely in the Spring. Found most of the men engaged on making a miniature rifle range Later the doctor came down and gave a lecture on VD. Just close to the town is an old burned down chateau. After lunch rode around the billets and inspected the Transport lines and the Signalling School and the School of Instruction. After mess went to BdeHds saw the General (Paton) arranging matters re P.V. Martin and others. He goes on leave in the morning leaving me in charge. On return handed everything over to Matthews and did a lot of writing. A sore throat and a bad cold just like before going on leave last. Rotten
