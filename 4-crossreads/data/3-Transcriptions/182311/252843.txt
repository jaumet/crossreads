<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The river (River &mdash;) froze right over &amp; this fine flowing stream fifteen yards wide ceased to be an obstacle &amp; could be crossed on foot at almost any spot thereby shortening many of our little trips which now involve considerable detour to cross bridges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While pond &amp; ground were so frozen, shells &amp; minenwerfer which had previously burrowed into the mud &amp; so had only local effect, became ten times</p>
