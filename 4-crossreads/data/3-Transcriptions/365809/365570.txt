<p>Flanders 15-10-17<br/>Dear Mother and Father,<br/>Am fit and comfortable again. My luck seems to stick to me alright. I think I have answered all your letters lately. There is a mail just in but it is not yet sorted. I have not drawn anything yet. Have been fairly busy buzzing about from place to place lately but have always managed to strike fairly comfortable quarters.</p>
<p>We have reorganised the Hd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qrs. Mess and now have crockery plates and cups and the tucker is much better served. We also have a white table cloth.</p>
<p>Phyllis is getting dangerous; she bites and licks me all over until I give her some sugar and then gets worse.<br/>Cheeiro<br/>Best love<br/>Your affectionate son<br/>C.R.Lucas<br/>Enclosed may be interesting. I was at the School at the time and missed the show. I think we are the only people who have attempted to run a Battalion show.</p>
