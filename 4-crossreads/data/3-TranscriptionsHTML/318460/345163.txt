<p>Wednesday Wed 6/16<br/>letters from Nell &amp; Jack also papers from Syd yesterday  Viv much better got his voice back again.  The Boys are being knocked about in the Trenches. [indecipherable] John had his two feet blown off got his knife out &amp; cut one away  &amp; applied a ligature himself then had to wait hours to be taken out.</p>
<p>Thursday 7/12/16<br/>Same old thing, no snow yet but cold enough for it. The Boys come out tomorrow night. Pay &pound;2-0-9. deferred &pound;17-10-0. Up to your waist in mud in the front line, can only go between support &amp; front line at night. Grenadier Guards also 59th AIF marched out leaving wounded in dug outs one of the guards was rescued after 4 days this is dinkum. 59 Pioneers swear it is true they saw them.</p>
<p>Friday 8/12/16<br/>2nd division has gone out reduced to 1800 how are they going to keep this up. Raining to day, had to shift to dug-outs, beautiful, have to give up our Posies to others coming in why couldnt they take the dug-outs, seeing its only for one night, but this Batallion is run by all the others in the Brigade for instance our Boys have done 8 days in front line &amp; supports right off, no others have done this &amp; its not that they are any more fit.<br/>The more I see of the Australians the more I am convinced that they are the most foul mouthed bragging, malingering crowd in this war all they think of is food, women, drink &amp; to see who can curse the worst, my honest opinion is that they are mostly a damn lot of wastrels &amp; cowards always talking of how to get to blighty or home &amp; they expect to beat the huns with this material (I don't think.)  Pay 2-1-9, deferred 17-11-0   got sudden orders to Pack up &amp; go another 2 miles towards the line 3 P.M. we are now at Delville Wood &amp; the guns are going merrily, in dug-outs here about 4 ft high  &amp; 5 ft long. Only here two days I think. Sergt. Livingstone ill again, think he will go to blighty, if so I get his Job, hope so.</p>
<p>Saturday 9/12/16<br/>On fatigue, our Boys came out last night &amp; a lovely time they had, getting fixed up in these rat holes mud &amp; slush up to your knees. Our dug out dripping water all night, found myself lying in a Pool of it about 3 am. wonderful how the Rheumatism keeps off.  Bread &amp;<br/>night got some Pioneers 3 killed 4 wounded &amp; 3 shell shock.<br/>Pay &pound;2-2.9 deferred &pound;17-12-0.<br/>Raining &amp; miserable water dripping into the dug out.  Blankets, coat &amp; everything, wet.  Had bread &amp; milk for dinner.</p>
