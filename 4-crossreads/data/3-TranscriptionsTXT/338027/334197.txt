 Saturday, 19 June, 1915 I had occasion to go down to the jetty and was surprised to see a lighter coming alongside with our fellows on back from Anzac on arrival there they reported and were told to go back from where they came from so back they came to Red Cross Island as it is called altogether there are over thirty Red Cross Units ashore; there are too may A.M.C. there already they are falling over each other there is nothing to do we are running more danger remaining here from fevers etc than at Anzac from Turks fire, so impregnable is our position.  The Tommies lost a trench near Krithia but regained it with heavy loss to both sides we are getting the slight cases on the Island. 
 Sunday, 20 June, 1915 The Col lined us up to-day and spoke rather sharply about so many of us applying for transfers, he said they are absolutely unobtainable and that to-morrow we in conjunction with the RAMC start a convalescent hospital until we receive further orders he told us to go about our work cheerfully as he was doing the men bitterly resent it and have good reason to but he has the whip hand for orders are orders.  About a thousand sick and slightly wounded arrived here at dusk for the various hospitals, mostly British but a few Aust, the Tommy may be a good soldier but the average are so dense that it is painful to talk to them.
