Spent another day in. Was releived in the evening, but had to stay back half the night on fatigue. Some animal pinched my little rifle, my best friend. She was a good little "hipe"; her number was 9751 so was an original and had been in Mons; as the inscription on its plate proved. No.196. 2nd Royal Fusiliers. The one I have collected to replace it is only just a rifle; made last year.

Came out this morning to High Wood. Went foraging, had glorious luck! Found a good feed and a bottle of whisky. A bosker new overcoat and other sundries of wearing apparel.
