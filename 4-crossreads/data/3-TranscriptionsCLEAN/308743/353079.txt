 Revielle at 6 Stables per usual nothing of much event during the morning only horses ridden again but in the afternoon I was sent to find Bill Latham & deliver a mss to him from the CO set out at 2 pm for the Citedil & after spending an hour & a half in finding same I'm told that they are over in Abesia so over I go but before that I went all over the Citedil, the most gorgeous building I have ever been in the staircases are beautiful white marble & the handrail is 9 inches wide & 22' feet long out of the solid & in one piece under the domes they are paneled & then decorated in diminishing figure of bronze the guide told me that they havn't been touched for at least 200 years & they now look far & away better than our most beautiful  theatre when new. I arrived at Abbasia at 4 pm & found Bill, niggers very offensive & expect trouble any day now. Bed 9.30 pm.
