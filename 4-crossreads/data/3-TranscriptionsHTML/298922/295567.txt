<p>Friday 14 September 1917</p>
<p>Alex<br/>The old ship Aragon our G.H.Q. ship at Gallipoli was recently here &ndash; it would be a coincidence if I sailed in her.</p>
<p>Today I &amp; 2 other officers went to Stanley Bay for a swim &amp; in the afternoon to the Yatch Club for tea.</p>
<p>Still no word as to embarking &amp; altho' I am enjoying the spell I am naturally impatient to be off. This town is of course darkened at night &amp; I had to sign a certificate that I alone would be responsible if a light were shown from my window in Hotel.</p>
