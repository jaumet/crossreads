23rd January 1917. Went on duty at 4 oclock this morning. Did not sleep too bad in the dugout. Came off duty at 6 had breakfast then went on duty from 8 till 12.30. Off for the afternoon had a good look around our new home. Very quiet on the front, but enemy aeroplanes were frequent in their visits. Very cold through the day. Went on duty again at 5 till 8. Received letters from home and a good batch too. Looted bed etc for our dugout fixed them up tonight. Very comfortable. Just fancy a real live bed on active service. Enemy aeroplanes responsible for shelling the 27th Battery today, with the result that they had to clear out. One man killed officer men wounded. Am writing this in my dugout at 11 oclock. I go on duty for 2 hours at 12.
