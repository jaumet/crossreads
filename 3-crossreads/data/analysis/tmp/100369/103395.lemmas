 " Goodby Australia " S.S. Mongolia Juli 9th 1916 . I Thi bold outlin grow dimmer , in the sunset 's golden glimmer Jut headland , rocki slope and wind bay And the troop are gather forward , with strain eye gaze shoreward , Just to catch the last glimps fade with the day . 2 For a passion devot , strong and boundless as the ocean , For a Home of Homeland , glorious and Free With a solemn strang insist , as we swing out in the distanc Thrill our heart anew with sacr love to thee . 3 All the tender tie that bind us . All the memori that remind us Of thi Shore , thi sun kiss land , thi beauti rare Everi golden recollect , stir chord of deep affect Build anew the heart 's High Throne , and set thee there .
