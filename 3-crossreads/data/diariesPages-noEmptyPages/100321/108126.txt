5/1/19 Gourdinne
Cold and dull. Bare black trees gaunt but the country a vivid green never seen in Australia. This morning was erected a RAF hangar for our Cinema on Monday. Afternoon was squally and the officers beat the sergeants in a football match. On rather a height the old village clusters round its 400 year old church and looks grey and exposed. The Maires house and farm are solid and luxurious of their kind and built on the most solid stone and all electrically lit. After the football the sergeants officers again met in the evening and played cards in a bridge tournament. Thus did we spend our Sunday. Yvonne (Chalmers Marraine) is down for the day an unsophisticated maid.
