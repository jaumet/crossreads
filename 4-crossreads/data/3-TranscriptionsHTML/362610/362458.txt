<p>Wednesday 30 August 1916<br/>A miserable cold &amp; wet day. Immediately after breakfast set out on the bike to find the Div. Gas School &amp; after a lot of trotting round managed to locate it. Was there all the morning, &amp; the afternoon being more boisterous than ever, I stayed inside getting a few letters written.</p>
