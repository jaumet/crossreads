<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father<br/>Tomorrow I go back to duty I tried hard to be allowed to go straight back to France but could not manage it &amp; shall now have to go through the horrible process of working my way round the depots in England. It is a horrible business &amp; I am looking forward to it with great disgust</p>
<p>Saw Beiers &amp; his wife yesterday &amp; am going to have lunch with them today I think Beiers will be sent back to Australia He is far from well now &amp; will be pretty certainly unfit for further service in France. I will extract a promise from him to come &amp; see you if he does get back. Of course his little wife will go with him &ndash; I think you will both love her.</p>
<p>By the way Col Oatley who followed Simpson at the B/W is going to Australia I gave him fathers address &amp; he has promised to call so keep a look out for him. There seems to be a good number of chaps going home nowadays &ndash; London is full of them all waiting for ships.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Your affte Son<br/>C R Lucas</p>
