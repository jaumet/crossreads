Minelayer H.M.S. Magnolia passed in Suez direction. It was a treat for our eyes to see this ship going at a good speed drop a lifeboat full of bluejackets. Immediately the boat touched water the inmates rowed swiftly to the shore with a rope to secure the warship against the side of the Canal. She was now pulling up to allow a troopship to pass. Mines are dropped over the stern by apparatus supplied for the purpose. The ship resembled a destroyer & 2 guns were visible to us. "City of Cairo" and P & O.  "Arabia"
