 Dear Bess, 
 Your letters of 17 Sept and 24 Oct now to hand, the first for several mails past. 
 So George Ravell will be married by now. &nbsp;I&nbsp;get mixed up with them, except for old Tom. &nbsp;Who is going to sail Kismet this season: is it being sailed in their name? 
 I see you have taken on dancing again. &nbsp;I hear the Tango is all the rage. &nbsp;There have been a few hops here, but it is painful to try to dance in these boots of ours&nbsp;on a floor as rough&nbsp;as sandpaper. &nbsp;Nevertheless the villagers go nap on them, for for four years and more they have had to put up with many privations and much severity. 
 Are you still down in the Cashier&#39;s Office? &nbsp;You will like it better down there than up above, where the atmosphere is always thick with work. &nbsp;You can tell&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;
