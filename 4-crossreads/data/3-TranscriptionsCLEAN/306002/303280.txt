  
 3.9.15 Fri. 3rd.  Last night was one of the best I have had for comfort & contentment.  The Hospital Ship lit up gaily with Red & Green lights looked a pretty sight standing out some distance from the shore, she was the only boat visible, although we knew that scores of warboats & destroyers were there, about 9 oclock a flash of flame followed by a loud report & the screeching of the shell over us was proof enough that the warboats were still there, she fired 30 or 40 shots & then again silence broken only by an occasional rattle of rifle fire;  as we were coming along the sap yesterday evening we passed scores of wounded men mostly English  bet  being taken to the beach to be sent to the Hospital boat, they had been in a scrap early yesterday morning.
