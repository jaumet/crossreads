<p>Monday, July 3rd:<br/>Fine.  Rise 5.30 a.m.  Ride out to 1st A.S.C. and commence on new hut.  Great sight to-day.  Air duel between a German and one of ours.  Ours was hit and our fellow volplaned to the ground.  Hard luck!  He was gaining fast on Fritz when he dropped.  Return to billet 5 p.m.  Retire 9 p.m.  Receive news from dear old Mother.  God bless her.  I lay listening through the night to our armoured train crawling along and giving Allemond a few shells, always moving from place to place and dropping a shell and then off again.  The Tommies began their offensive last Saturday and in conjunction with the French have met with wonderful success.</p>
<p>Tuesday, July 4th:<br/>Rise 5.30 a.m.  Showery.  Ride out on waggon to job.  Return to billet 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Wednesday, July 5th:<br/>Manages to keep fine.  Work on Officers' quarters at above job.  Return home 5 p.m.  Coming home with three others riding in the rear limber, when she comes apart from the leader right in a busy spot where there were plenty of on-lookers.  Of course it was a great joke.  Prepare for another move.  Retire 9 p.m.  Twelve midnight, gas alarm, but the fumes never reached us.</p>
