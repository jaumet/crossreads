  
 was delivered to me about noon;   the latter reached me at 5 p.m.  This was in reply to a message despatched by me on yesterday morning.  I sent it on Friday thinking that you might like to reply by week end;  you chose the same mode as did I, that is the deferred.  Any how it is good to have late news from you.   It is bad luck not to be able to let the rooms, but one never knows what the morrow will bring forth, but the wise man makes provision for any emergency, wisdom has not been my fort, while hard work has been my portion since I came to mans estate, in the performing of it let me hope that I have done the State some service, such has ever been my aim without hope or desire for self reward;  a silly way perhaps, but my way and with it must my mind rest content.  The exact wording of your cable: "Lieut. Col. Nash, Hospital, Heliopolis, Palace Hotel, Cairo.   Still trying let rooms otherwise all well.   Nash." 
 Caggie dear:  Weston told me that he had heard about you but that he had not seen you.   I saw something in the newspapers about the Japs being in Australian waters, but no particulars have yet come to hand.

They were the actors during the last great war, while now they are the onlookers, they no doubt appreciate the latter roll, it certainly is the lest costly in blood and treasure. 
 The white gloves are rather a good joke.  Bullock amongst the others has had a bad time in the North, it was a horrid place to which to go. 
 Glad some of you went to the receptions for the Japs.  Marg must still look massive Nan is a protester of the first order.  Glad that Joe received the cable for her birthday.  Good luck to her now and always. 
 During the next few weeks, I fear me you will have large casualty lists of Australians from the Dardenelles, the wounded are pouring freely into the hospitals here, three have come to me within the last hour, on one ship there were 600, how many then must there have been altogether, considering that trainloads of wounded have been continuously during several days and nights, and our hospitals are upon the periphery of the area to which patients are sent.  Nothing will surprise me.  By jove the war is being brought home to each of us in real earnest, especially to those who have sons and brothers.  Yet how much more dreadful must it be in the countries of England, France, Russia and the German States. 
 I read the Federal parliament and other references to the festive Bertie.  He always a little too assertive, and during the present crisis his name handicapped him to a great extent, and if he had taken an old mans advice he would have held his tongue, but in his ignorance he believed that his knowledge was superior to that of his seniors,
