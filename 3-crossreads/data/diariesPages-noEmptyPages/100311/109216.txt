9/10/17 Broodseinde Ridge
Stewart and Rodda did not get back from viewing the J.O.T until about 2.30 am and with them brought Coghlan Savage. The former had laid out the whole on his prismatic compass in a very short space of time. Stewart and Rodda were mud up to the eyes and very done up tired. A man of the 18th. wandered in after being out in No MansLand since 2 days ago. A member of a party attacking a pillbox he took refuge in a shell hole and had quite exciting adventures. His account, picturesquely illuminated by all the oaths of the hardened campaigner, sounded very funny. Reports indicate that the boys are in fair heart considering all things and we trust for them to give a good account of themselves at hop off time. Now (3.50 a.m.) there is a good amount of crumping going on but nothing extraordinary. At 5 am the barrage lashed out but was feebler than usual and enemy retaliation very hot. Sniping m.g. fire heavy.
