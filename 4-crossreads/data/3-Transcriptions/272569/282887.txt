<p>Tues. 25-7-'16<br/>a.m. we witnessed the fiercest bombardment etc. 400 yds. away that any of us had seen. This was kept up intermittedly until dawn. With the dawn &amp; long before arrived the wounded. 4 a.m. shortage of Ammo &amp; Bombs reported from firing trench. Charlie &amp; self continued carrying same from Reserve &amp; Gordon Dump until 10 a.m. <strike>all day</strike> On the 1st trip to firing line I experienced the raw recruits experience of seeing our dead everywhere. Coming back from line to Dump we were assisting the S.B. with a hvy wounded and was in front shafts when I heard a voice with something familiar about it say "They're making it pretty willing aren't they?" On enquiry from our S.B.</p>
