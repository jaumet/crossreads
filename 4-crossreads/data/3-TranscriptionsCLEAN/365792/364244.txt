  
 June 13 centre of the main street (High St) The town itself is quiet & old-world  Pop' about 2,000 
 14  Some  winter weather this Wonder what Dad would think of it. Sue uses the room in which he was born. Little did I think a couple of years Since that I would ever set eyes on England, let alone come right here. On the way down from Cheltenham I noticed several familiar names which I had often heard at home. On the other hand we passed (on the Bristol line) the town of Tamworth & I felt almost inclined to get out & pay a visit to the Office, but  that Office  is over 12,000 miles away from here. The Wesleyan Chapel just opposite is dated 1858, so it must have been built before Dads time. Had a good look round, inspected the C of E & the graveyard. The Church is very old - having been built in 1300 & it has all the latest improvements, "heaters etc" Saw Grandmothers & Grandfathers graves -
