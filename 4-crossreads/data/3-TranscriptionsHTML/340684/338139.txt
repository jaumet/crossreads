<p>459<br/>New Zealand Hospital<br/>Walton on Thames<br/>9th December 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father<br/>Another week has gone and I am still here making the 16th week in this hospital &ndash; my eye has improved a great deal I can see more than I did before the eye went blind, it is getting quite brown again and the iris that was white is getting quite black again and I don't think any one without looking very closely would even know I had a bad eye &ndash; The youngsters didn't come up last week end but are coming on Sunday. They buck me up tremendously  and I hope to spend Christmas with them  - I thought I would be able to leave here almost immediately</p>
