<p>Friday 25 February, 1916</p>
<p>We put in the finishing touches on our pit but we still have about 20 yards of communication trench to do &amp; 2 dugouts to put in.</p>
<p>We are getting used to the walking back &amp; forward to the job also to the hard work &amp; my back is beginning to show less signs of complaining than at first.</p>
<p>I managed to get a pair of sox &amp; a balaclava cap from the comforts fund.</p>
