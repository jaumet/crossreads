  
 Wednesday 8 May 1917 [1918] Awoke 4.30 a.m. & oh so good to have had a long sleep & no pain.  Ward companions 4 in number talk without ceasing of course but as no "head" - not so annoying.  Mist sodii sulph., 2 cc. as usual (B.D.), toast & custard allowed.  M.O. very carefully refrains from any reference to yesterday's dose but says T. 98.4 & mind I keep it so, etc.  Head better ? pain ? etc. & goes quietly away & I sleep most of day.  One hears such funny little bits of talk behind this screen.  One furious at being pushed out & "he spoke as though I were shamming".  All are quite well as far as I can see.  A new expression, "Were you out here in the very early days?" serves to remind all present that we are with "R.I.P." people as the "Bully" has it.
