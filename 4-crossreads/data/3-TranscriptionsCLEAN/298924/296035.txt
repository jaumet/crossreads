  
 Saturday 22 February 1919 Rafa Daisy's letter Dec. 29.  Sorry Egyptian officials mutilated Cable & I printed it, remaining - note re Katandra - St. Ives do well, but I hope to meet myself now if only 1 night will go Scotts.  Mother's letter Dec. 22, also letter from Pearce of Pastoralists Review, he said old R.B. Wilkinson still going strong.  Very glad Joe is safely home & well - we will have a lot to talk about.
