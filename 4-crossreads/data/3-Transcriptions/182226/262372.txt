<p>Thursday 16 December, 1915</p>
<p>Got a letter from Bill How from All Saints. He was a New Zealander who was in the same room as myself &amp; we got rather chummy.</p>
<p>I was speaking at a debate this evening &amp; I won the decision. We had a very enjoyable evening.</p>
<p>Still no boat, had to have bully beef for dinner &amp; it was pretty hard to tackle.</p>
