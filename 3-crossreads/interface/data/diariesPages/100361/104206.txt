Sun. Jan 3
Finished up at mid-day and tried to settle down to write some Letters, but the place was in such an uproar that it was impossible.
Mon. 4
Went down the Village and had my photo taken. Hope they turn out alright so that I can send one Home to M.S. Received Letter from Mother. 
Bad news in Paper. Tidal Wave at Mackay, Queensland. Enormous damage.
Tues. 5
Got Letters from Stan Wright and Mrs Sam ? also Photo of Illy's group. As usual I turned out a dream. Hope to the Lord the Sutton Veny turn out alright. 
Had to turn out of my cubicle to make Room for a new Serg.
Wed 6. 
Miserable, wet, day. There's not much to write about in ones Diary. The Papers are all shrieking that we can "never starve Germany", and the war news is not too cheering.
Stan Wright said his Father mentioned us in his Letter and said he was pleased to hear of my "narrow escape from death." Queer way to put it.
Wrote to Mother tonight, but news is scarce, and it's hard to write a decent Letter. I must write to France tomorrow.
Thur. 7
Bust day at the Mess, but things went off very well.
