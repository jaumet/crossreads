counter attacking regardless of loss, but our chaps are winning troops & his are falling back & it affects the spirits of the men in each case. I have strong hopes of being back for Xmas. It would break your heart to see the way the retreating Hun left these villages & towns he cut down all trees fruit & otherwise, has blown up every house in every place. No wonder the French attack so viciously.Well my dear with fondest love to self R & B from your loving brotherKen
