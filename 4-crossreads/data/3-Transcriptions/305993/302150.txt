<p>Sunday, 29.12.18<br/>We disembarked our remainder of the troops &amp; spent the day ashore.  We found the inhabitants were anything but hostile &amp; as we went along the main streets in batches in our transport uniform, as we passed hundreds of Bulgurian privates &amp; all the Bulgurian officers saluted us as if they had been one of the Allies.  We proceeded through the main part of the town &amp; found the place well garrisoned by French &amp; British troops.  We went to the park which occupied miles of land.  Beautifully laid out &amp; very picturesque.  The trees were lovely.  In fact one of the finest parks &amp; drives that we ever saw, as good as the best in Britian <strike>of</strike> or the Colonies.  This particular park was full of people it being Sunday afternoon thousands were there all well dressed very much like the French style, clean &amp; tidy.  The town similar very clean appearance quite different to Salonika &amp; Egyptian towns.  We visited a dump of shells which had been blown up some months ago.  This particular spot was shelled by the Russian fleet &amp; thousands of shells blew up &amp; several Turks which were here lost their lives, the railway carriages &amp; trucks were blown up &amp; the rails torn up.  We picked up several live shells shrapnel some 100 lbs. weight some partly exploded but decided to leave them as they were too dangerous to handle, yet splendid souvenirs.</p>
