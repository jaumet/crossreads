  
 28/8/15  Up by starlight. Must have chosen the hardest spot in camp, no sleep after once waking up. Out on parade only one man absent at reveille roll call this morning but a good many since cleared off to have another splash. Program battn drill and anticholera inoculation. Bdier on warpath re parade state. Officers slack & won't get grip no ad at H.Q. Great talk in Cairo last night over the first appearance on the stage of an Egyptian actress. Up to now always been considered degrading to appear on the stage as of course their faces must be uncovered, but there has never been any objection to their going in for cafe concert entertaining. Madame Murrira the first woman to cross the footlights. The play said to be very wearisome and not up to expectations.
