<p>willing and obliging but his pet aversion and it is a pet aversion &ndash; DICIPLINE-There is a good deal of what soldiers call "messing about" in the service which means literally any order or orders being first given and then (apparently without ryme or reason ) countermanded to put up with that sort of thing requires years of practice hard discipline and the patience of a JOB. This sort of thing is at all times a great bugbear but we all have to bow to the inevitable on such occasions. And <u>that</u> really is OHalloran's prejudice. For example the officer says lead 2 horses to water each man. I repeat that order when the horses are off the line, along comes a fresh order Each man must lead 3 horses! . on such occasions O'H is heard at his best and his remarks are really worth recording . passable signaller but he will become expert when he comes back fro the signalling School; Suffers very much from "Aeroplanitis" which means lilterally shock to the nervous system on the approach of hostile aeroplane and the anxiety and horrible uncertainty as to whether he will drop bombs or not. We all suffer from the unpleasant malady to a greater or lesser degree "O'H" suffers from it to a greater degree than any other man I have ever met.<br/>It is no fault of his because he had the misfortune when in Melbourne</p>
