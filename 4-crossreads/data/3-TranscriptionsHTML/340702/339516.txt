<p>the only thing that enables a fellow to carry on. Maffesoni Jun. nearly cut his arm off on the Docking Saw tonight. Finish war for him. He was going to have a finish fight with one of the others in a few days time &ndash; man proposes ---</p>
<p>23.10 Wed<br/>Raining again. wet &amp; miserable Had the petrol Engine &amp; Dynamo on my own last night but had a good passage. Got the Petrol Engine (Japy Freres) on my own again. The little bugger settled her Governor so I had to control by short circuiting the Spark &amp; manipulating the inlet valve Finally Bert fixed up the Governor after 20 Mins delay &amp; she is now running O.K. The little bitch bushed her Governor again within 20 Mins &amp; I had to put in the rest of the shift as a human Governor controlling her by short circuiting the magneto or operating the inlet valve</p>
<p>25.10 Friday Oh that darling? <u></u> Japy Engine. She ran like an angel last night, but tonight the little love is peevish. They dismantled the Governor to fit plates on it but one of them is a wee bit too long &amp; Japy is making the most of this excuse to cause trouble.</p>
<p>26.10 Saturday<br/>Went to Poperinghe today &amp; bought a match Box cover &amp; Compass. I will need the latter to determine the polarity of the New? Dynamo that they found in the Pill Box</p>
