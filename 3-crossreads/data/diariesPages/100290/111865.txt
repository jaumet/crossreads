Friday
Tony self mess orderlies. Still fine calm. Heat tempered by cool north west breeze.
Nothing striking occurs except. a Sapper was sentenced to 5 days cell on bread water for refusing to go under hose after stable duty. His excuse was a cold the fact of having one shower already. Adjutant Laurence was prosecuter and odious man. Penalty far too drastic, merely vindictiveness on officers part.
