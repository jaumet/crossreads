<p>In the afternoon we went for a good route march west of our billets to the wooded ridge and round back home by the main road. It started to rain a bit but we didn't get very wet. Wrote 5 letters in the evening and went to bed, early.<br/>18.10.16 Physical drill this morning at 6.30 and at 8.30 ordinary drill exercises until 10.30 when we were dismissed so that a team could be picked for the Drivers &amp; Headquarters versus Sappers football match. Football started at 1 and resulted after a fair game in a win for the drivers by three points. Wrote to Melv and we were paid at 5 o'clock after tea. inclined to be raining to-night. MacKay went to-day to near St Omer to look for new billets where we are supposed by rumour to train before going to the Somme and I fancy we are waiting until our line is pushed near enough Bapaume to capture it and the Australians will be part of the attacking forces. Rough last night in all the sections I believe most were drunk. Nearly a fight here in the other sections and down the road two were knocked out. After tea it was raining but lightly and I walked to the village up the main road and after a wine or two came home &amp; met Yank and we repaired to an estaminet and consumed numerous drinks of all descriptions. However, I pulled out before it came too warm and came home &amp; Yank followed soon after. Awakened in the middle of the night by a fierce argument but no more came of it.<br/>19.10.16 Woke up feeling rather heavy and went to physical drill at 6.30 and did a route march and double. Fell in again at 8.30 and after doing a bit of rifle exercises it started to rain so we took shelter and spent the morning fixing up the voting for the referendum. Supposed to be a football match in the afternoon against the second company but it was too wet and was raining all the morning with a strong wind. Fell in again at 2 but were dismissed at once as the ground was so bad so got to work &amp; shaved and changed into clean clothes and read a bit of surveying. Irvine &amp; Linton were pretty drunk and Irvine was sick over his bed.<br/>20.10.16 Very cold this morning with a hard biting frost and wind. We went for a sharp double to the railway line and marched back. Fell in after breakfast at 8.30 and after a bit of drill we had some games jumping etc until 11.45 and then were dismissed</p>
