not properly sorted, so got it Sunday - The sabbeth makes  very little difference here - how we have two C of Eng. chaplains & two R.C. chaplains that we will have  more services here - be able to arrange times to suite the sisters etc. Somehow today I cannot write, so much noise & a convalescent sister walking around &   talking nonsense, that she is making me quite nervy. Essie &   I cannot read nor write through here. She has been discharged but disappointed at not getting a few days at Alexandria - so is laying around waiting for the old Col Maudsley to worry him. Really some people make you quite disgusted - I had such a lot I wanted to write but my brain will not work. If my photo is any good &   you think it worth it, get a dozen &   send them to my special friends for a Xmas Present. Mrs &   Mr Osburne are so good, every mail I get heaps or weely papers from them & such lovely long joint letters. If anyone should get it, send it to Mrs Osburne of Terang with my fond love.
