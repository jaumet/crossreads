<p>9th June 1916 <br/>Still in Capetown Harbour on getting up. Pulled out from wharf at 12 oclock. Dropped anchor in Table Bay for reasons I do not know. Seems rotten to keep us on board &amp; Capetown in sight just a few hundred yards away. Goodness knows how long we will stop here. A cold day into the bargain. Clouds hanging low over the Table Mountain all day. Have not seen the sun since we arrived at Capetown.</p>
<p>10th June 1916 <br/>Still at Capetown &amp; in Table Bay. Very quiet day &amp; a rotten cold one. Still in suspense of what is going to be done. No hope much of going ashore from here.</p>
<p>11th June 1916 <br/>Promise of landing on shore for Monday. Colonel Pearce on shore yesterday &amp; promised last night. Our position re leaving here is a bit more known. As matters stand now we leave here Wednesday (12th) with other troopers &amp; a convoy of warships. Some of the transports have arrived and we can see them go into the docks from here. These transports by the way left before us &amp; were on the way via Suez when they had orders to proceed via the Cape. Our unit on duty today. Memorial Service to Kitchener postponed on account of wet. We are having rotten weather. Fishing for sharks the main thing on board Nothing else of much consequence doing.</p>
<p>12th June 1916 <br/>Did not go on shore. Very disappointed. Mess orderly at new mess. Coaled (final) in Table Bay from lighter. A slightly better day. Had a good view of Table Mountain /c at sundown</p>
