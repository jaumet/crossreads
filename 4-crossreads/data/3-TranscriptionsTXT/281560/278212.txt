 9/2/16. We are getting into a busy track now; 13 steamers passed outwards today. We were past Aden at 5 P.M. and are well into the Red Sea this evening. Aden is a bare sunsmitten place to look at. 10/2/16. A chap died today, and they buried him this evening with military honours I saw a locust fall on the deck today and there was absolutely no land in sight. 11/2/16. Pay Day! We passed a french mail steamer today. She was in sight at daylight but it took us all day to catch her. The Stewards gave a good concert; and the Colonel gave out the prizes won in the sports competition. The ship's captain, a very decent old chap span a yarn or two also.
