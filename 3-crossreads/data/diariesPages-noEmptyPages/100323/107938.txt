Doctor diagnoses complaint as influenza and I feel rotten. We are about in line with the Gulf of Guinea and weather is hot. Things are going just like a camp on the boat ? all are settled down now and the ship churns away out of sight of land. Sea like a smooth lake. Tonight Diggers Parliament. Padre Fox advocates Prohibition and Ash opposes.

Received small wireless budget today. A fine cool breeze though we are not far from Sierra Leone. Feeling heady and sleepy but much better. This afternoon a meeting of a Farmers Convention. Tonight for the first time the Southern Cross came into sight but I, being in bed, did not see it.
