It appears that they had everything ready thinking some of us would try to get away, &amp; and a nervous sentry seeing someone moving underneath a hammock, loosed off his revolver &amp; gave the alarm. No one was hurt but the after ropes between the two ships were cut to pieces by machine gun fire</p>
