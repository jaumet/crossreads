<p>the lead &amp; get to Blighty so desperate I was.  Someone came along &amp; asked me what I'd give them for a leave pass to England.  I offered them my hopes of Heaven &amp; what I value more of Hell &amp; they produced one ordering me to London next day, after I'd taken 15 fits &amp; turned numerous handsprings I sobered down &amp; caught the train taking with me about the heaviest suit case (laden with Bosch souvenirs) &amp; the lightest heart on record &ndash; how blue was the sky, how beautiful the country, the things in the garden yards &amp; yards high quite a la Jack's beanstalk.  Well to make a very long journey shortened got to London, its wonderful the feeling one has crossing the Channel &amp; one offers up this sort of prayer all the way, Oh God spare me from submarines this trip &amp; I'll be a good boy for ever so long &amp; I don't care a damn what you do to me on the way back, you can submarine me 20 times if you like only let me get to Blighty (this is a universal prayer for those who travel by sea Londonwards).</p>
