Gorgeous Motor cars & carriages thronged the road, but we passed a good few, as we had a nice pair of Arab horses in.  On arrival at Mena House we left the carriage & proceeded on foot to the base of the pyramids.  You could not realise what they are to look at.  Huge masses of Stone, & the Egyptian Gov. have cut away portions of the edges & you can climb right up to the top, but it takes you a day to do it. dimensions of Cheops Pyramid which is the largest one [diagram of pyramid with dimensions] You can see the quarries in the distance that they dug the Stone from, & it is about 5 miles from where they were built.  It is across the Nile & it is marvellous how they got them across, but "Cheops" alone took over 100 years to build.  You can still see the pits alongside the walls where they mixed the cement.  imagine several pits cut out of solid rock, about 150 ft long 50 ft deep & 50 ft wide.  So you can bet they used some cement on the job
