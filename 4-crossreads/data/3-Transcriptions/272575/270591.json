<p>France 17.6.17<br/>Dear Mother<br/>Everything still goes on the same here, we are still resting and having a fairly decent time.   Taking into consideration the fact that there is still a war on.  We do the usual old parades in the forenoon, and after dinner we defile the waters of the Ancre, by bathing therein, it is a narrow winding little stream fairly deep in places, and has a good swift current which is a good thing.   we get a continual supply of fresh water to swim in.   This afternoon one of your letters arrived.   Mrs H. had posted it last month to the Hospital but I had left and it has just managed to catch up to me   The weather still keeps fine and quite hot we have an occasional Thunderstorm, and when one commences it is time to seek shelter for the rain comes down some.   we were bathing one afternoon and one started.   needless to say we got wet.</p>
