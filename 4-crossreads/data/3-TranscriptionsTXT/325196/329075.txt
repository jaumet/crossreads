 1-1-16 I scaled out as soon as I was paid, &amp; came to Cairo parted with Arthur &amp; Bottom &amp; went to a Greek Dentist to have 3 new teeth on the plate, &amp; while he was doing it wrote a letter or two at the Soldiers Club in the Gardens, then bought a Dnoto Fountain pen (75 P.T) &amp;  a watch (65 P.T.) &amp;amp: I am now pretty well fitted up again for Active Service; It was very funny with the Greek dentist as he could not speak a word of English &amp; to arrange the price he had to call in a French neighbour before we could come to terms.
