<p>went for a stroll with Will after tea: Roger &amp; Sault &amp; A Coy's guard fell into the ditch dodging a shell:</p>
<p>Saturday June 24th <br/>billets: patchy showery day: up at 8 am: our guns bogged in a little during the early hours of morning: after I finished Tom, Nug, &amp; I went almost in to Armentieres for a walk: After dinner Tom &amp; I had one of our "eat ups": wrote to Et &amp; sent P.C.s: plenty of shells kicking around: Alf went into the water dodging a shell: our guns opened up again towards midnight &amp; Fritz returned as per usual: Seen a dual &amp; a fokker made a beautiful dive at a plane but missed him:</p>
<p>Sunday June 25th <br/>Billets: good day: the reputation for shells was well kept up &amp; we were chased out of our billets in the morning: he was after our "big how is its" &amp; landed first shell almost on them but of course did not know his luck: communion at 9.am &amp; very nice: after dinner aeros were up like flies &amp; bombed Fritz's sausages: the bombs bursting in some big clouds made a pretty effect, just like weeping stuff falling from the clouds: nine of our planes were in a bunch &amp; with the big thunder clouds as a background looked well. A Fritz was up so two of our "fighters" chased him &amp; tried to bomb him &amp; the bombs looked pretty bursting in the clouds: Fritz bogged in to the trenches a lot &amp; our guns did a good bit of firing all day: after tea we had church in the barn &amp; it went well: we had another "Kentucky" tea party &amp; it was tra-bong: our guns opened up a heavy bombardment about 11.30 pm as our raid was on: It was a pretty sight to see the rockets going up &amp; the flashes of the guns &amp; explosions: Fritz got a rough passage all right: he replied pretty hotly but I believe we worked our "knut" this time in the trenches &amp; came off light:</p>
