<p>Thursday<br/>Left camp again at 9 oclock, marched into the Station &amp; entrained.  It is now 2 oclock &amp; we leave at 3 for 36 hr. journey.  The men are in Cattle trucks each holding about 30 men.  This is the first time they have had the experience of Cattle trucks &amp; the comments are amusing.<br/>Spent all day on the Train &amp; all night, travelling very slowly.</p>
<p>Friday, 24<br/>Still in the train.  The country is not much good and the houses poor.  We are travelling up the coast.  Passed through Abbeyville, Boulonge &amp; the suburbs of Calais.  Arrived at Balieul at 10 p.m.  The Trenches are not far away.  The flare lights &amp; star shells light up the sky &amp; the Guns can be heard quite distinctly.<br/>The Batt. set out to walk 6 miles to Billets.  The Guides lost them &amp; it was 5 oclock before the men got to Billets.  The sacks were very heavy and they were quite exhausted.</p>
