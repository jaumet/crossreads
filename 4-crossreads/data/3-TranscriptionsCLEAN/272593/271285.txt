After this I went down into the big dugouts where Jock was camped to have a look how the miners were getting along, the dugout is easily 20ft deep & is as warm as toast they hold quite a number of men. Dead funny up here they carry the water for cooking in bags on their backs the boys go out with picks crowbars & shovels & dig it out of the shellholes it is a great thickness over a foot in places & too hard to get it out. The other night on our right the Tommies hopped over & took 280 prisoners & 2 machine guns, we put a very heavy barrage over on the German lines 31st  Am taking up to the lines tonight 6 tins cigarettes & they will be very welcome to the boys.
