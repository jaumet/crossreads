<p>His case is one of great interest because functional paralysis is rare with an actual head injury &amp; because the paralysis corresponded to the hemisphere which had been concussed. How much real sensory loss &ndash; I mean that is due to actual pathological changes &ndash; can be known only after the psychical phenomena have cleared up but as I said we do not think there will be much. He has improved considerably since he came in.</p>
<p>I hope you will come &amp; see him often.</p>
<p>With kind regards<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>George Riddock</p>
