firesteps the men yarn smoke clean their rifles. We have some very good shots and so has Abdul. Potting at loopholes is good practice. Great expression is possy = place. Our Kings prizeman (Bisley) Thurlow does good sniping work and lies in this little sniper's nest waiting for Abdul to visit his latrines and then shooting him

The usual routine. Men in supports at toilet one shaving another "washing" ? a wipe with damp rag. Others chasing scotch greys. Several using firesticks to burn them out of the seams ? some of these chaps are Block knots! Spent evening in firing line quiet. A few wounded. One chap killed. He was just breathing when the stretcher passed me
