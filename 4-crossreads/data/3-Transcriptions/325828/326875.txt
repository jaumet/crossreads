<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Christmas Day is on us once more but this time under entirely strange &amp; new conditions.  It was raining here very steadily last night &amp; turned cold towards evening.  It was the rummiest Christmas Eve that I have put in for a good many years, &amp; it &amp; today will be long remembered by us if we are spared.  I am half expecting to get a letter from you today as I have heard there is a mail in, &amp; it will be the best Xmas Box I could wish for.  It has been a very quiet here since we landed here but I expect the next fight will be in Egypt here near the Canal.  As you know all the letters from Egypt are censored before they leave the country, so we are not allowed to say anything of our doings.  It is beautiful &amp; fresh here this morning after last nights rain.  I suppose the whole total wouldn't amount to more than 15 or 20 points but it freshened things up a bit.  There is a Christmas Service in the YMCA here this morning to which I am going, &amp; this afternoon we are thinking about going into Heliopolis for a stroll.<br/>Address your letters as above No 6359 etc, omitting of course Zeitoun, until I advise you any different   I sent you a cable on the 23rd for New Year Greetings which I hope you will receive in due time.  Give my love to all at home, &amp; my best love to yourself, Father dear.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Leo.<br/>I sent a card to Rid at No 21 Hospital, Alex. a few days ago saying I was here.</p>
