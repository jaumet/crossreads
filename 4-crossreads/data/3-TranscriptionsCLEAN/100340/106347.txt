there were four pianos, one double keyboard organ  & a billiard table. Of course I mean in different houses and some most beautiful bronze ornaments worth about   20 each in one house. I would like to have them in my own house. One good thing for us there were plenty of potatoes & all the appliances for cooking them too. Needless to say we had a game of billiards & tried the pianos too. The second time we were in that village we went along to play billiards again but someone had evidently taken one ball as a souvenier so that's mucked the game up. Of course when fritz  started his tricks we ducked down the cellars. Well dear Sis I hope I will soon hear from you again. I had a letter from Aunt Jen the other day. Auntie told me you & Noni were well so I get news about you that way. Well dear Sis will close now with fondest love to you Noni & Vol from your brother Hal 15526 Pte Vick
