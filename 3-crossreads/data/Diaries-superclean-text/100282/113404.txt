whoever he may be when she pays him, he will hand the change back to you so as you can tip him, but you make him give it to the girl, she will then just give him the bare tip no more, he will look as black as thunder shake his head. I used to nearly die laughing every time to watch the manouvering of the waiter so as he could get the tip from the stranger then watch his expression when the girl hands him a few coppers where we would otherwise give him francs.
During the afternoon we also visited Versailles travelled out 1st class by train which takes about 20 minutes, it is only a short walk from the station, we engaged the usual guide who hangs round these places I don't care much for them myself too much of the parrot like chatter this one who could speak English was no exception to the rule, he showed us round all the ancient old places both inside out, the Grand chambers where the old Kings Queens of France used to sleep were very interesting
