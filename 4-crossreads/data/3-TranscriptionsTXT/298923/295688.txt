22 January 1918 TuesdayRichon-Le-Zion is shown on most maps as Ayan-Kara.Anzac Div. Headquarters are in Baron Rothschilds house in Richon-Le- Zion- Nicely furnished, water laid on, two storied, standing among Oranges & Palms- with a photo of the baron on the wall-  He settled many Jews here & the Richon Winery is one of the biggest in the world-  The Turks damaged nothing.Rode 8 miles into Jaffa or Joppa  & bought colored book of Holy Land cities in German!! but the colouring is absolutely correct & you will be safe in copying if you can find time little Mother to paint.  I searched the Town for this, the only one so hope it arrives safely
