  
 We are getting a lot of fellows now direct from peninsular - it just breaks me up to see them - worn out, thin, nervy & with typhoid.  They do wonderfully well poor old chaps but one can't get a smile out of them to begin with.  We have not yet garden for our Convalescent typhoids here & I must say the latter type seem to regain all their spirits & are the limit as regards pranks & mischief. Do you remember that tableful at G.M.H. - General Kenna, Lord Hartington & Co. - I believe they are all killed  expec  except one. The Nile is up - you never saw such a dirty muddy old fellow as he is now &  very  smelly!  The fields in front of us here are lovely, all different varieties of green.  I do wish you had been to this place.  Try & take a run down to Neutral Bay & see my folk, one brother, stepsister & Mrs. B., they would so love it.  Get to Neutral Bay P.O. (Ben Boyd Rd.), they are quite close to it.  We have a car here & I get a turn in it occasionally & drive it. Went to Mataria yesterday. Miss Maclean gone to Australia. Fan has gone on transport to England.  Bob has been invalided (dysentry) to Malta & wires "going England". 
 Address C/o Cooks.
