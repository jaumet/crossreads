<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>Since writing last we have called in at Colombo &amp; by the sheerest good luck, I managed to get ashore there. For the last week or so before reaching Colombo, we had the most perfect weather you could imagine. The sea &amp; wind died down, &amp; with a smooth sea &amp; clear sunny days not too hot, we really put in a very good time. The piano we bought at Thursday Island is just the thing, &amp; there is plenty of music every night.</p>
<p>We arrived at Colombo just at dusk on Monday night 8th Feb and there are no wharves here, so both transports lay out near the breakwater. Scores of natives came round in boats straight away &amp; though they were not allowed on board, many of them scaled up ropes on to the deck &amp; started bargaining with the soldiers. No leave was granted that night of course, and we just had to be contented at looking at the lights of the City. You</p>
