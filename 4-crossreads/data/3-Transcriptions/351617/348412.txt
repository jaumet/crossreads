<p>Head Quarters. We had a pretty substantial Pill-Box for a home, and 4 Bunks and as long as one stayed inside we were pretty safe from Light shells but had a heavy shell landed on us I doubt if they would ever have found us, as it takes more than a tin hat to stop 8ft of concrete.</p>
<p>Here again rations were very scarce, the first 4 days and we lived mostly on bully beef and beans salvaged from shell holes, (in Tins), and made into a stew.</p>
<p>I remember one day Chas. Ekberg of Hawthorne, Victoria, and myself were making one of these stews when a big shell burst over on the Light Railway about 200 yds away blowing up 2 trucks that were there. We just looked up and went on with our work when there was a whisk and thud and a big piece about 3 by 1 inch landed right in the fire. It must have gone between both of us</p>
