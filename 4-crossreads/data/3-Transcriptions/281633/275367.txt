<p>&amp; signed statement that my equipment was all correct (it isn't).  6 men left A Company today for the Graves Registration work, quite a lot of Aussies are taking on this scheme.  Cyril Gray came to the Battalion last night now there is the 4 of us, Anderson, Gray, Hogue, &amp; myself.</p>
<p>27-3, Thursday<br/>Had a Bath at the Charbonnage Marcinelle Nord.  While there I copied the shifts as given by the act of 1889 of which a summary was posted at the Office.</p>
<p>Day Shift Underground<br/>(All others work 12 hours per Shift (at least).)<br/>Boys under 16 descend at 7 a.m. or 8.30 a.m.<br/>They come up at 4 p.m. or 5.30 p.m.<br/>Night Shift Underground<br/>Boys under 16 Descend at 8.00 p.m.<br/>Ascend at 5.00 a.m.<br/>Above ground<br/>Boys under 16 and women over 16 and under 21 start at 7 a.m. and work till 7 p.m., they are to have 1/8 of this time for rest or meals.<br/>By another act 1905 it is laid down that no work excepting such as is absolutely essential to prevent damage to the plant shall be performed on Sunday.<br/>Women work underground &amp; in the lamp room and also do practically all the trucking.  It is quite a shock to an Aussie to see them all grimed by the coal dust with great heavy Sabots on their feet and their hair tied up in a filthy rag something like a turban.</p>
