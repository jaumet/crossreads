<p>Sunday 3rd Jan 1917<br/>About 4pm the H.M.S.Kent left us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the Transports all went separate routes. At five o'clock 10 destroyers came alongside but only two remained, the remainder going with the other transports.<br/>Mon 8th Jan 17<br/>Very rough we have to hang on to the rails, as it is impossible to stand without holding on to something.<br/>About 8.30pm we sighted the first lighthouse in England</p>
