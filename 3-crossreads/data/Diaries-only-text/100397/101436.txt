6th Aug. 16 Stoke War Hospital Stoke On Trent. Eng.
My Dear Mother I arrived here from France on the 29th of last month. How long I will be here I cannot say, perhaps my area will keep me long enough to miss the winter or the greater part of it.  I have no wish to be in the trenches in winter. This game is not what it is made out to be. We left the Flanders, Front "we were right opposite Lille." and travelled South through Domart, Allonville Warloy ? Albert. went into the firing line near Albert, opposite what was once the village of Pozieres, that was our objective, On Sunday the 23rd at 1 am. we left our trenches and crossed no mans land towards the trenches our guns were going a treat, and, our leaders, well the less said the better. before we knew just what was happening some of us were in under our own guns, and they are no joke, we got orders to dig in so we started, next thing I found that the Sergeant in charge had disappeared where he was no one seemed to know and when I looked round to see if I could find him I found that we were only about 16 strong. The rest of the company I could not see anywhere, so I decided to stay where I was. I was busy trying to dig deep enough to lessen the risk of stopping a piece of Hot Iron. There was plenty of it moving but I gave the job up one gun was dropping shells a few feet away behind a bank. The bank used to fairly shake again when one of them burst.
