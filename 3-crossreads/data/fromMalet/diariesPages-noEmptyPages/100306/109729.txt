"Le Dans de l?Amour" from "Madame Sherry"
Gorman to Sparrow:-
"Hail to thee blithe spirit. Bird thou never werest.
Grim viaged War hath smoothed his wrinkled front
And he that mounted barbered steeds
To fright the souls of feared adversaries
Now capers nimbly in a ladies chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute."
Letter from old Bob Ralston concluded:-
Remember me to all my dear fellow officers!"
