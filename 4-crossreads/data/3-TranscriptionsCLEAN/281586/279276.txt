  
 Said a lad to me "When I came away to the War, my Mother gave me this" showing me an old, warn, Bible.  "And, he continued, with a light laugh, "She believes that I still read it, and that I still pray"  He was then "going the pace" 
 1 Your last fond gift to me Ah, then you little knew (As in your hand you held The volume old, and gave it to me  then, with many prayers That I'd be true) Nor dreamed, such faith was thine That scarcely would the leaves Be turned, by hand of mine. 
 2 Neglected was your gift, For long, aside it lay While, you, dear heart believed The inspired page, to be to me A source of joy and strength A lambent Ray Of light from God's own Throne And so you prayed, and thought my prayers Were mingling with your own. 
 3 And so with measured pace The days rolled swiftly by And each with tales of broken vows To tell, and deeper peering in To sins dark ways Till God, on High Seemed very far away And judgment stirred no fears And love was stark and gray.
