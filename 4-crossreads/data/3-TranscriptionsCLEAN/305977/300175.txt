with a Frenchman employed at Chandres Freres & he says he will show me around Cairo some Sunday.  The streets of Cairo are crowded at night & there is no doubt the Austn is very popular no doubt probably because he spends freely.  Spent a fairly cold night on guard.
Saturday 13th [Feb]Came off guard at 11 oclock & knocked about the town till 3 oclock.  There was a great crowd of soldiers in town in the afternoon.  Races were on.  Had dinner & afternoon tea in town.  Got back to camp about 4 in the afternoon.  Wrote a few postcards & posted them after tea.  Felt pretty tired & went to bed early.
Sunday 14thCool, cloudy day.  Was mess orderly so did not attend any parades.  The whole Bgde was inspected after church & the general said we made a good impression.  Ted Rabbitts
