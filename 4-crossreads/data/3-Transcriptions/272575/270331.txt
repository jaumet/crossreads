<p>We heard various accounts of the way in which the L pool and Casula men had set out to make a name for themselves But at first I thought some of the accounts were overdone however we learned a little of what they had been at from News cuttings sent across.  I guess any of the lads who took part will be wise, when they are eventually drafted out amongst the different Battallions, if they keep their mouths shut, and know as little as possible about the whole affair for the Old hands over here will not hesitate to let them know just what their opinion of them is.   I can tell you that they will not find it a very flattering one, Say Sweetman is the sort we want over here    No doubt they will present him with the Royal Humane Society's medal   Well I showed the account of the rescue to one of the Lone Pine men and remarked that, Sweetman would no doubt receive the R.H.S.M. and would be just the sort to pick up a V.C. or D.C.M. in action.  "He said oh yes. Perhaps." in my opinion its harder to win the R.H.S.M. than either V.C. or D.C.M." &ndash; That is the opinion of one who survived the L.P. charge and is considered a good soldier, he certainly has a good nerve   I am not a bit surprised to hear that H.s Produce business is Mafush" as a Gyppo would say, it was a bad time to start anything of that sort,   Now if H. could manage to secure a billet as Station Bookkeeper, somewhere in the Sou West or Nor West division he would benefit more ways than one for I'll wager that although he might find the climate a bit warm at first</p>
