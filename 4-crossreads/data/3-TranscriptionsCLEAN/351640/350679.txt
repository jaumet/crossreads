The two stars, always bearing the same relationship  to one another, by following the characteristic curve which indicates the shape of a scorpion you can easily map out from star to star Scorpio [all uppercase letters].  There is with me no pretence to have much knowledge of the heavenly bodies, but with eyes open and alert, one can hardly help in a journey through life, jusqu a cinquante huit ans [French: up to 58 years of age] to have in his brain representations of them.  Each is index of other worlds than ours.
Good night! Good night!!!  Good night!!!!! [A line of Xs and Os.]Fancy I hear Mother M. Joseph remark: Silly man!  Silly boy!!!  Silly man!!!!!But then we cannot all be wise at all times!  Can we?  Superfluous energy must blow off."Seize hold of God's hand, and look full in the face of His Creation, and there is nothing he will not enable you to achieve".  The Two Paths - Ruskin.
26-3-15. Happy thought.  I have just written a letter to the Ministry for Education asking them to let me have amongst other things a copy of the plans of one of their schools, that I may write about them and submit to others for consideration.  To every member of the Dominican Sisterhood, as to the parents and the children, light & fresh air are of the utmost concern, the former that they may be kept in the best of mental and physical health the basis upon which good & sufficient human work rests, and it is probably correct that he who does the most and the best of work in God's world will reap the richest rewards from Heaven, the judge of course being God.As the parents have responsibility for the educating & bringing up of their children, they should insist that in every school where the young people are being taught should have more than sufficient light and fresh air, that the eyes & brain may not be taxed unnecessarily and the vitality of every tissue lowered by contaminated air reaching the blood through the lungs twenty times per minute.  Is there anything of more importance for well being?
