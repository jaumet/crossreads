<p>they assure me of numerous parcels and other good things once I get over to France again.</p>
<p>I have not written to Clarry for some time Ida will you tell him that he may expect a letter from me very shortly. I don't know how it is but somehow the days slip by and I do not notice that the time flies and I do not write. I see where there was a little trouble with the railways in New S Wales, but I think it must have been settled satisfactorily alright. Can you give me the address of George or Charlie Grimes or Joe Warn. I have met nearly all the old Stuart Town chaps but have not yet ran across those.<br/>George Sullivan is over here somewhere I think in England, and young Jack McCormick from Store Creek is in this depot.</p>
<p>I am so glad to her that Aub is getting on so well and growing such a big chap. I hope he will be quite recovered by the time I get back.<br/>Will have to sign off now dear Ida .<br/>With best love to you all, mother, Father, Aub and yourself<br/>Your loving Brother<br/>Gordon</p>
<p>Remember me to Ted Corrigan</p>
