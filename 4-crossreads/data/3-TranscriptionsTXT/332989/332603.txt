to Copes Creek   D P Dickson
We are very well looked after here and are fortunate in having a very fine girl as our Nurse, her name is Sister McIntosh, comes from Sydney.   Glad to hear that Russel Richardson has been heard of    A  couple of our Battalion were reported missing from Fleur Baux (our first time in the trenches last May) & somebody had a letter from them and they reckoned they were being well treated, so probably Russel R will be fairly well off.   It is a good thing if Mr Richardson knows that a weekly parcel of food is sent from the Red Cross Society also clothes & tobacco to one prisoner in Germany.   Mr D.P. Dickson for whom Mr R. used to ship parcels to Copes Creek is here tracking missing soldiers (Visits hospitals with a list of missing from every Battalion & shows them to the new patients as they arrive & they are often able to give news about one or two, probably having seen them taken prisoner or blown up by shell) & has been buried etc.   Dickson is going to find out how Russell is & what parcels
