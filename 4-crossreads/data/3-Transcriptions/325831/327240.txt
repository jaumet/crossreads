<p>8.<br/>old 26th Battn in Sydney &amp; later of the 4th AIF is now acting as Brigadier to the 1st Bde.</p>
<p>He played in a football match against our battalion about two weeks ago. One enthusiastic young subaltern, during the game, had a violent little difference with someone who was hanging on to the ball &amp; spoke his mind a little too expressively &ndash; to his subsequent horror he found he had been ill-using &amp; abusing his Brigadier. I do not suppose there is any previous record in military history of a Brigadier taking part in a football match on active service.</p>
<p>Well pour le present, au revoir</p>
<p>With best wishes to Mrs &amp; Miss Ferguson &amp; yourself</p>
<p>I am</p>
<p>Yours very Sincerely</p>
<p>J L Flannery   1st Bn</p>
