<p>25-12-16<br/>Mon 25th<br/>Xmas day in El Arish. Maj. Smith in Command of C Sqdn turned up from Maghaba some time last night &amp; brought back 4 mountain Battery Guns (9 pounders) 4 prisoners, a large supply of rifles &amp; all sorts of equipment 100,000 rounds of Turkish ammunition &amp; a small box of German fine telephone wire. I lost no time in pinching 12 reels of this &amp; left only two as he reported he had telephone wire. I had to leave some to go on to B.H.Q. there was also one telephone but it was too big to be of use for a Regt as it is too awkward to carry about, this I took over to B.H.Q. this afternoon put in</p>
