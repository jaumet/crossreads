Goodnight's sleep & the nurse washed me I'm O.K.  Major Darcy goes to Australia per SS Borda on Monday so am giving him my Diary & letter for you- to post in SydneyAs we came along the Canal, the rosy cheeked Tommies climbed on to the train "Tell us all about it chum" then when they found we were officers they faded away.The Cotton fields are in flower now, the 2nd crop I've seen in Egypt.Another batch of wounded arrived last night & the Hospital is full of chloroform.
