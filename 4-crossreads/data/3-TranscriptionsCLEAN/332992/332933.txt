I finished reading a book called "A Son of the Sea" a magnificent story of Life & Adventure in the British Navy by Beverley Keat & Victor Darning.  It is of absorbing & trilling interest from start to finish.  No 342. The Boys friend Library. 
 Tuesday May 1.1917 A beautiful bright spring morning.  There was lot of artillery activity last night and this morning Fritz shelled one of our batteries for a long time before breakfast. Four months of the year have flown.  Time is speeding on and every day our position is getting stronger and that of the enemy weaker.  It seems to me that our artillery is only playing with Fritz for time, like a cat with a mouse, and when the opportune time comes will wipe him out.  The weather is so beautiful that it seems a pity that there should be a war on.  This part of Belgium is hilly & there is a wood along the ridge of hills, and I am told that it is the King of Belgiums hunting grounds.  The ridge N. of us is known as Hill 6. The wind was favourable for a gas attack & as the Huns were observed getting their gas cylinders ready we were warned to sleep with our respirators beside us in readiness.
