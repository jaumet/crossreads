My Dear Mother.   We reached Port Suez after a splendid trip all the way the weather was all that could be desired, although the last couple of nights on the ship were windy and cold    we disembarked at Port Suez and then proceeded to camp by Rail.   I was detailed off with five others to guard some of the Baggage which was left on the wharf and, in the evening we were able to take a walk round part of the Port.   it is a dingy dirty little place   at the mouth of the canal the town proper is about a mile away  I did not manage to have a look through it but I dont think I missed much as the accounts I heard of it were not very alluring ones, I believe it is even dirtier than Cairo and that is not saying much for it,   I arrived in camp, on Tuesday morning about 3 a.m. after a very unexciting trip Per Rail
