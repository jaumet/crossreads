being played here. Adjourned to a cafe for some coffee (served in vase like glass) cheese &c. The people love to get together and yarn over their coffee. The liquors at the bar were rhum and a few other spirits and different liquers. Had a glass of Benedictine in a glass twice as large as our liquer glasses. Much struck with the great courtesy of these folk both to strangers & among themselves. Always bowing, exchanging good wishes and giving thanks. Left in a passenger train at 5 pm and had a cavalry Major and an Engineer for companions - both Eton men & good fellows. A slow journey travelling all night and reached Amiens about 3 a.m. Got a room at Hotel Belfort - a fine place and had some coffee and rolls before turning in. feet very sore and very fatigued. Rouen is a pretty place and those who are stationed there like it very much. It has a background somewhat like Marseilles. Sanitation is weak. Streets full of fine looking girls and women. Saw a peasant girl with little white nun-like cap on her head. Quite happy on the arm of her bucolic lover
