<p>for the day, most of them were suffering with trench feet. If this disease is not caught in time the feet are generally amputated. Weather bitterly cold.</p>
<p>Thursday 30th November.<br/>10:30 a.m. In the Trenches again. Bob &amp; I occupy a good &ndash;dug-out, a great improvement on those we lived in a fortnight ago. Fritz very quiet this morning. One poor fellow in the dug-out was suffering terrible agony with Trench feet &amp; Hands. We carried him along to our 4th Relay Post. Working for the next 24 hours at the R.A.P. which is about &frac34; of a mile from the Front Line. My <strike>first</strike> second carry was rather a severe one, carried a man on my back to the 4th Post from the R.A.P. He soon got very heavy, only had one spell as it was a work of art to lift him up again, without hurting his feet. I almost collapsed when I arrived at the Post, but a hot drink soon put me right again. Our next Stretcher Case</p>
