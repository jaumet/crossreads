<p>Ypres 5/10/16  New reinforcements arrived and paraded for inspection at 11 am.  Loafed round and supervised cleaning up during day.  At 6 pm CO. and staff shifted to firing line and I left at 8 with an orderly.  All of our gear in charge of batmen went on with the transport.  Our route lay along a road thronged with troops in small parties and small detachments of transport.  Behind lay the shattered sombre ruins of Ypres, in front a low lying flat dark region with ruined houses.  Even the trees are broken about by gunfire.  The light of flares lent a fitful illumination to the scene.  They showed the great salient here appearing in front on both flanks and almost behind one.  The flares seemed of a different kind to the old variety and hung suspended in the air for a long time, perhaps parachuted.  Reached Battn. HQ in the ruins and settled down to an all night vigil without any sleep at all.  Gas alarm on right.</p>
<p>6/10/16  Remained up all night.  Orderly from "C" Co got lost coming from firing line and was found wandering about by Grieg.  Very easy to mistake directions particularly if wet as there are no landmarks, and it is a simple matter to wander out past our own lines into 'No Mans Land' and stumble into a German trench.  Went to bed at 8 am and stayed there until 2 pm.  During remainder of day things were very quiet and stayed so until evening when mail and rations arrived.  Some rattling of machine guns and bombing on the flanks but all quiet on our immediate front.  Retired to bed again at 8 pm but did not sleep well until late.  Artillery liason officer with us and Dooley arrived with the QM.</p>
<p>7/10/16  Called at 3 am and put on thigh boots.  Found C.O had to see General so took over the inspection of the front line, slipping and sliding in the mud and slush using a long staff to preserve balance.  Flares continuous &amp;</p>
