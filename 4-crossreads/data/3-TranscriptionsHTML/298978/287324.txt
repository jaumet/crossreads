<p>the coast of Western Australia. Far away astern of us there are a few grey specks getting ever smaller &ndash; the last sight of Australia - 'tis most fitting that the dusk should be creeping on, for it was seven years ago that I saw these same specks of land at the dawn of a glorious day &ndash; that was my first of Australia, the land which has been so much to me, which gave me my great chance in life, which I now leave perhaps for ever.</p>
<p>Dec: 31<br/>Sea quite calm &ndash; usual routine.</p>
<p>Jan; 1. 1915<br/>Burial at sea, perhaps the first of many &ndash; a brilliant sky above, glorious blue below &ndash; we are all lined up on deck &ndash; all the fleet is stopped &ndash; somewhere, from one of the ships , a body has been cast to the deep; way back in Australia some mother will mourn a son &ndash; there is dead silence throughout that huge fleet; just the gentle heaving of the ocean, each man to think of Death as he may.<br/>The "Dismiss" is sounded; we all feel relieved to get back to the work of living, though I can't help thinking of the, perhaps not far distant, date when I shall see my comrades dying in hundreds on the field of battle.</p>
<p>Jan: 2<br/>Usual routine &ndash; in the evening am giving lessons in drawing to two of the men. We have a printing press on board,</p>
