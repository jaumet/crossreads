<p>28/11/18 Paris<br/>within. Old people creeping about "this tomb" and old people sitting in chairs to sell candles &amp; relics. Now marching on the map to the Church of St Sulpice &ndash; an immense place and not so dull. Again noticed old age by devotion trying to ensure good things after death. Walked down to the Jardins de Luxembourg now desolate and winter dreary. Now to Boulevard St Michel and past the Cluny Museum. Cafes gaily lit up. Smart officers &amp; pretty girls. Yanks everywhere. Tubed home from Odeon there were great crowds about the whole place. Did soon arrive at the Continental. Took taxi for Gare de Lyon at 7. with some American sisters as companions. Found my reserved seat in the train for Nice and got a pillow and blanket for 4 fr.</p>
