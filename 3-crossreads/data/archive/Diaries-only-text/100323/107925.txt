4/7/19 "Chemnitz" Hull
Finer day. Expect to sail tomorrow morning and sent McLean out to arrange billeting the troops in the decks. Went into Hull which was very busy and animated today and did some shopping. In the square there is a statue to Wilberforce who holds a scroll of papers in his hand. Viewed from one aspect this gives the statue a ludicrously obscene look ? on a wet day something 1000 times worse than the Brussels mannequins. This is a C3 population all right ? poor rickety kids anaemic girls and mutilated men ? arms legs fingers missing. Wretched slummy dwellings. After dinner round the docks and saw a coaling machine at work tipping whole trucks of coal into chutes to the bunkers.
