After a good deal of ringing-up & worry trying to get an Ambulance we succeeded in reaching the hospital at 8 p.m.  I was very glad that she went because I could not nurse her properly here.

Had a great day last Wednesday.  Saw the sights of Alexandria - Visited The Roman & Egyptian Catacombs which we are very interesting - then to some gardens that we visited on the Sunday, then back to Groppi's for afternoon tea, about 6 p.m.  Then we helped (two of us) a friend do some shopping to get a few things to take to the trenches.

Saturday afternoon a party of us had a delightful sail on the Harbour.  Saw two French Cruisers, three
