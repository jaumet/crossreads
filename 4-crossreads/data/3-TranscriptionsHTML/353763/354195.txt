<p>A Chinese tailor has been off &amp; I've ordered some white clothes  -  He's the thinnest   -  most drawn out, almond eyed, son of China I've seen  -  Got my washing done too &ndash; 3/6 per dozen  -  I only put in big things &amp; made up the dozen with handkerchiefs  -  I am wearing a soft shirt &ndash; open at neck &ndash; no tie &ndash; Kharki pants &amp; a holland coat with my shoulder straps  -  I borrowed the latter from a brother officer  -  Naval men are splendid lenders also borrowers  -  Not a word of AE1  -  They're gone  -  We've abandoned hope  -  Poor chaps  -  All we can do is to help their families &amp; dependents  -  35 men wiped out in one act &amp; no one has any idea <u>how</u> &amp; that's the worry  -  The water is too deep even if the spot were located &ndash; which it isn't -The navy cant draw any lesson  -  AE2 isnt allowed out by herself now  -  We shall be here sometime  -  I'm one of the contented ones  -  I wish to happen what does happen  -  I read &ndash; keep my eyes open &ndash; listen  -  I cant talk much because my point of view on very many things is not that of the others  -  I'm Australian &amp; very democratic  -  However we all pull splendidly together &amp; really like each other &amp; I'm only one in a <u>mob</u></p>
