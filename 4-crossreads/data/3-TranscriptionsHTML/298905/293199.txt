<p>having to go back to trench life again, &amp; roll in the mud get lousy dirty, &amp; nearly sick of life again after his holiday is over I'm afraid my spell is going to make me discontented &amp; can you wonder at it.<br/>This morning a party went from here I was among them we had 2 lady guides, &amp; they took us to Parliament House, what a lovely &amp; magnificent building it is from the outside it is built right alongside the old Thame's, civilians are not allowed inside but soldiers are privileged so we were taken through it, inside the house is magnificent lovely marble floors stained windows snifter painting depicting all the old time scenes &amp; battles, coronations, portraits</p>
